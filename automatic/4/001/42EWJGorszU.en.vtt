00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
mechanism how to unlock the liner which

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.820 
mechanism how to unlock the liner which
is<00:02:32.070> basically<00:02:33.000> through<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.420> Swiss<00:02:33.810> cross<00:02:34.050> so

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
is basically through that Swiss cross so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.170 
is basically through that Swiss cross so
you<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.100> have<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.310> press<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.700> down<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.090> then

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
you just have to press it down and then

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.580 
you just have to press it down and then
you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.660> see<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.050> liner<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.620> moving<00:02:39.590> moving

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
you can see the liner it's moving moving

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.010 
you can see the liner it's moving moving
down<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:43.050> once<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.440> press<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.840> fold<00:02:45.840> it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
down so once you press it it can fold it

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
Victoria Knox trail master because they

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.500 
Victoria Knox trail master because they
are<00:03:28.890> more<00:03:29.070> or<00:03:29.130> less<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> same<00:03:29.580> size<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.270> one

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
are more or less the same size this one

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.580 
are more or less the same size this one
is<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.710> one-handed<00:03:32.640> open<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:34.260> open<00:03:34.530> it

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
is not the one-handed open to open it

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.270 
is not the one-handed open to open it
with<00:03:34.680> two<00:03:34.830> hands<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:36.560> wait<00:03:37.560> let<00:03:37.740> me<00:03:37.830> just<00:03:38.010> show

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
with two hands and wait let me just show

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.970 
with two hands and wait let me just show
the<00:03:38.640> difference<00:03:38.970> between<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:40.530> victorinos

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
the difference between the victorinos

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.180 
the difference between the victorinos
and<00:03:44.450> already<00:03:45.450> called<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.050> window<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:46.800> this

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
and already called the window so this

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.060 
and already called the window so this
one<00:03:47.430> as<00:03:48.300> you<00:03:48.690> can<00:03:48.840> see<00:03:48.990> has<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> small

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
one as you can see has a small

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.220 
one as you can see has a small
screwdriver<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.850> this<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:51.300> not<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:52.200> of

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
screwdriver on it this one not so one of

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.730 
screwdriver on it this one not so one of
them<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.950> basically<00:03:53.540> open<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.870> can<00:03:55.320> while

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
them you basically open the can while

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.120 
them you basically open the can while
going<00:03:56.190> forward<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.500> one<00:03:58.709> as<00:03:58.890> far<00:03:59.070> as

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
going forward and on that one as far as

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.730 
going forward and on that one as far as
I'm<00:03:59.370> informed<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.510> have<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.780> go<00:04:00.900> backwards<00:04:01.440> to

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
I'm informed you have to go backwards to

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.560 
I'm informed you have to go backwards to
open<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:02.550> think<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.090> only<00:04:03.150> difference

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
open I think that is the only difference

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.330 
open I think that is the only difference
however<00:04:03.780> Victoria<00:04:04.380> Knox<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.770> think<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.160> one

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
however Victoria Knox I think this one

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.190 
however Victoria Knox I think this one
is<00:04:05.550> nicer<00:04:06.030> because<00:04:06.240> you<00:04:06.690> have<00:04:06.870> another

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
is nicer because you have another

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.550 
is nicer because you have another
scooter<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.160> want<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:09.870> one<00:04:10.020> just<00:04:10.230> looks<00:04:10.380> a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
scooter I want and that one just looks a

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.770 
scooter I want and that one just looks a
bit<00:04:10.590> weird<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.370> sharp<00:04:12.230> but<00:04:13.230> whatever<00:04:14.780> okay

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
bit weird and sharp but whatever okay

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.870 
bit weird and sharp but whatever okay
and<00:04:15.959> then<00:04:16.080> let<00:04:16.709> me<00:04:16.830> just<00:04:17.040> open<00:04:17.190> up<00:04:17.370> light<00:04:17.609> for

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
and then let me just open up light for

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.620 
and then let me just open up light for
you

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.670 

okay<00:04:21.200> so<00:04:21.709> here<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.370> go<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.580> can<00:04:22.730> see<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.680> so

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
okay so here you go you can see that so

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.880 
okay so here you go you can see that so
let<00:04:24.860> me<00:04:24.920> just<00:04:25.100> clean<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.640> up<00:04:25.760> a<00:04:25.820> bit

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.920 

okay<00:04:30.890> you<00:04:30.950> can<00:04:31.160> see<00:04:31.370> that<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.760> Wenger<00:04:32.510> blade

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
okay you can see that the Wenger blade

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.760 
okay you can see that the Wenger blade
is<00:04:33.140> bigger<00:04:33.920> than<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.490> one<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.090> Clorox<00:04:35.630> and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.470 

look<00:04:39.770> at<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.390> cutting<00:04:41.390> edge<00:04:43.480> actually

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
look at the cutting edge actually

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.670 
look at the cutting edge actually
cutting<00:04:45.080> one<00:04:45.200> is<00:04:45.320> more<00:04:45.530> or<00:04:45.590> less<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.830> same<00:04:47.680> but

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
cutting one is more or less the same but

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.010 
cutting one is more or less the same but
actually<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:50.090> can't<00:04:50.300> get<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.510> trail<00:04:50.720> master

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
actually you can't get the trail master

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.830 
actually you can't get the trail master
with<00:04:51.170> a<00:04:51.520> one-handed<00:04:52.520> opening<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.690> hole

movement<00:05:32.330> I<00:05:32.480> don't<00:05:32.600> know<00:05:32.660> if<00:05:32.780> this<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:32.960> just

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
movement I don't know if this is just

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.290 
movement I don't know if this is just
particular<00:05:33.560> on<00:05:33.830> this<00:05:33.920> one<00:05:34.130> knife<00:05:34.340> or<00:05:34.670> all<00:05:35.180> the

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
particular on this one knife or all the

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
current frame us to have that but it's a

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.750 
current frame us to have that but it's a
bit<00:05:37.130> disappointing<00:05:37.340> because<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:40.370> can<00:05:40.520> hear

it<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:42.500> shouldn't<00:05:42.800> be<00:05:42.890> that<00:05:42.920> way<00:05:43.600> so<00:05:44.600> the

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
it it shouldn't be that way so the

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.810 
it it shouldn't be that way so the
finger<00:05:44.930> and<00:05:45.080> this<00:05:45.230> is<00:05:45.380> case<00:05:45.980> it's<00:05:46.190> better<00:05:46.430> and

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
finger and this is case it's better and

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.380 
finger and this is case it's better and

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
it so let me just compare it to the

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.050 
it so let me just compare it to the
other<00:06:12.200> Victoria<00:06:12.680> Knox<00:06:12.830> knives<00:06:13.070> so<00:06:13.880> you<00:06:13.970> have

other Victoria Knox knives so you have
the<00:06:14.150> size<00:06:14.300> comparison<00:06:15.340> officer<00:06:16.340> is<00:06:16.460> a

the size comparison officer is a

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:26.620 
the size comparison officer is a
standard<00:06:18.130> sak<00:06:20.890> compact<00:06:21.890> version
