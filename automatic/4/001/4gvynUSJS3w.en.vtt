but<00:01:33.240> i<00:01:33.299> personally<00:01:33.810> prefer<00:01:34.110> by<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
but i personally prefer by now is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.590 
but i personally prefer by now is
because<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.430> you're<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.270> know

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
because then you're not like you know

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.940 
because then you're not like you know
you're<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.780> drifting<00:01:37.170> around<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.680> player

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you're not drifting around one player

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.580 
you're not drifting around one player
for<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.310> long<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.200> also<00:01:40.290> do

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
for so long and and what you can also do

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
for so long and and what you can also do
is<00:01:40.799> after<00:01:41.460> you've<00:01:41.729> done<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.000> we'll<00:01:42.780> just

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
is after you've done that we'll just

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
is after you've done that we'll just
have<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> look<00:01:43.200> at<00:01:43.350> Flamini<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.240> because<00:01:45.240> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
have a look at Flamini and because you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389 
have a look at Flamini and because you
can<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.600> exactly<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.770> opposite<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.189> as

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
can do exactly in the opposite way as

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
can do exactly in the opposite way as
well<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.759> i'll<00:01:48.000> show<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.509> what<00:01:48.600> i<00:01:48.659> mean<00:01:48.719> in<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
well so i'll show you what i mean in a

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.069 
well so i'll show you what i mean in a
second<00:01:49.610> Flamini<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.909> an<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.329> record<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.930> he

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
second Flamini is an on record so he

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.510 
second Flamini is an on record so he
won't<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.350> go<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:52.710> much<00:01:52.860> even<00:01:53.219> if<00:01:53.310> he<00:01:53.399> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
won't be go for much even if he is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.819 
won't be go for much even if he is
converted<00:01:54.030> 1600<00:01:54.689> coins<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.020> no<00:01:55.500> because

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
converted 1600 coins that no because

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.190 
converted 1600 coins that no because
both<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.219> them<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
both of them are up for that so what I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.520 
both of them are up for that so what I
wanted<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:59.070> meaning<00:01:59.369> right<00:01:59.670> there<00:02:00.000> is

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
wanted what I was meaning right there is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.679 
wanted what I was meaning right there is
now<00:02:01.530> let's<00:02:01.799> check<00:02:02.039> in<00:02:02.850> central<00:02:03.210> defensive<00:02:03.539> mid

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
now let's check in central defensive mid

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.109 
now let's check in central defensive mid
so<00:02:03.810> dr<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> normally<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> sense<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.369> mid<00:02:05.610> so

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
so dr be as a normally a sense of mid so

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.880 
so dr be as a normally a sense of mid so
let's<00:02:06.299> check<00:02:06.539> him<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.840> central<00:02:07.200> defensive<00:02:07.619> mid

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
let's check him in central defensive mid

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.020 
let's check him in central defensive mid
and<00:02:09.050> let's<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.289> what's<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.710> this<00:02:11.640> could<00:02:11.880> be<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and let's see what's up this could be a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790 
and let's see what's up this could be a
better<00:02:12.300> profit<00:02:12.720> because<00:02:12.840> i<00:02:13.020> think<00:02:13.080> central

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
better profit because i think central

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530 
better profit because i think central
mid<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.190> CDM<00:02:14.610> actually<00:02:15.030> goes<00:02:15.180> for<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> little

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
mid to CDM actually goes for a little

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.520 
mid to CDM actually goes for a little
less

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
less

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.910 
less
2.2<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.400> no<00:02:17.760> profit<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.150> be<00:02:18.300> made<00:02:18.740> sorry<00:02:19.740> it

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
2.2 that no profit to be made sorry it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.530 
2.2 that no profit to be made sorry it
goes<00:02:20.069> for<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> little<00:02:20.370> bit<00:02:20.490> more<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.730> do<00:02:20.880> think<00:02:21.240> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
goes for a little bit more I do think so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.199 
goes for a little bit more I do think so
now<00:02:22.020> we're<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.290> check<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.850> check

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
now we're going to check going to check

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.160 
now we're going to check going to check
Jack<00:02:24.810> Wilshere<00:02:26.780> Jack<00:02:28.819> Wilshere<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.270> think<00:02:31.020> he's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
Jack Wilshere Jack Wilshere I think he's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.380 
Jack Wilshere Jack Wilshere I think he's
gonna<00:02:31.350> go<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.950> little<00:02:31.980> bit<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.520> CDM<00:02:33.060> so

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
gonna go for a little bit in CDM so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.270 
gonna go for a little bit in CDM so
we'll<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.200> wait<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.100> can

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
we'll have to wait and see what we can

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.760 
we'll have to wait and see what we can
if<00:02:35.640> there's<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.330> potential<00:02:36.660> deal<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.530> just

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
if there's a potential deal so it's just

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.170 
if there's a potential deal so it's just
very<00:02:37.890> very<00:02:38.010> easy<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.430> picking<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.940> players

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
very very easy just picking the players

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.170 
very very easy just picking the players
that<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.630> feel<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.709> could<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.340> know<00:02:41.459> could

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that you feel that could you know could

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.090 
that you feel that could you know could
be<00:02:42.300> converted<00:02:42.750> into<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.080> central<00:02:43.650> defensive

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
be converted into a central defensive

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.729 
be converted into a central defensive
mid<00:02:44.280> roll<00:02:44.430> or<00:02:44.790> sent<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.180> mid<00:02:45.360> roll<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.750> of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
course then you just go and pick him up

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.350 
course then you just go and pick him up
off<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.600> market<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.190> 3,000<00:02:50.190> right<00:02:50.370> there<00:02:50.670> nope

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
off the market so 3,000 right there nope

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.030 
off the market so 3,000 right there nope
3000<00:02:51.959> was<00:02:52.050> right<00:02:52.230> there<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
3000 was right there so that would be a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.479 
3000 was right there so that would be a
bad<00:02:53.250> Buy<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.750> we'll<00:02:54.750> check<00:02:55.080> out<00:02:55.320> Aaron<00:02:56.010> Ramsey
