00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.300

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.010
 the attack 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.220
 on the entire eyelid 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.150
 always tap because otherwise you 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.809
 risk dropping the material doing 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.530

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:20.550
 where do you stop and then just do it in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:24.960
 so hasty and 217 from mac and you 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:29.220
 go degrade with this color with 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.750
 this color in matter is just at 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.350
 above the color still posed on 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.350

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.570
 we were getting a black pencil 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:48.320

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.700

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.189
 internal corner at this level slightly 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.380
 here I know this level jemaye 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.500
 so I 'm going to take this bath under the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.900
 stock market and 14 aces at macaq do 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.700
 honor and I'm going to degrade the court 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.340
 degrade with my past of 217 I'm going 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.739

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.970

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.930
 I take a little color and I will 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.090

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.680
 at mac then at the end of times it can 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.519
