00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.240
 But let's take a look at the necessary materials before you choose 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.360
 3 pieces of canned artichoke dish 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.920
 2 eggs 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.440
 1 cup flour 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.200
 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.480

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 and to fry; olive oil 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.800
 After taking a look at the ingredients for artichoke pan, let's start 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
 We said we have two eggs. 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 the eggs are breaking a nice 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 throwing some salt 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 salt 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 flutter 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 now we are adding water 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 We said 1 cup of flour 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.920
 but until the consistency of the controlled and gradually add 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.640
 let's keep flapping 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.040
 we have achieved a smooth mixture 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.400
 now we get our canned artichokes, we're cutting it 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.560
 let's go by the fire to fry now 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.440
 we use small pans to spend less fat, we put the pan on fire 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.440
 so much fat enough 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.440
 Now we chop the artichokes we have dipped in the dough we prepared 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 we cover each side 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.600
 we have to throw in the oil, the oil needs to warm up a little more 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.880
 in this way 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 our pans 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200
 no more servise 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.560
 fresh artichokes to be prepared after boiling 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 let's also pay attention to this 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.040
 let's leave parsley 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.320
