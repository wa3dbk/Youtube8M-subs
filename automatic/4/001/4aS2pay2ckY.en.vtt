00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
something it's so hard to I've actually

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.730 
something it's so hard to I've actually
pinned<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.110> pinned<00:00:30.290> it<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.500> pinned<00:00:30.650> it

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
pinned it and pinned it and pinned it

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.900

machine<00:00:32.270> and<00:00:32.300> sew<00:00:32.689> it<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:33.379> difficult<00:00:33.620> to

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
machine and sew it and it's difficult to

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.860 
machine and sew it and it's difficult to
keep<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.309> in<00:00:34.429> this<00:00:34.550> right<00:00:34.820> move<00:00:35.149> yeah<00:00:35.449> it<00:00:35.600> moves

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.110 
keep it in this right move yeah it moves
around<00:00:36.109> but<00:00:36.859> then<00:00:37.010> also<00:00:37.190> I've<00:00:37.579> tried<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:37.969> use<00:00:38.000> a

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
around but then also I've tried to use a

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.720 
around but then also I've tried to use a
fusible<00:00:38.600> web<00:00:38.929> and<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:40.160> can't<00:00:40.429> do<00:00:40.579> that

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
fusible web and you can't do that

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.009 
fusible web and you can't do that
because<00:00:41.030> you're<00:00:41.300> gonna<00:00:41.359> see<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.690> web<00:00:41.839> through

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
because you're gonna see the web through

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.419 
because you're gonna see the web through
there<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.379> can't<00:00:42.589> iron<00:00:42.800> it<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:43.160> yeah<00:00:43.249> this
