information I want to show you the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.110 
information I want to show you the
process<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.590> your<00:03:14.010> cashews<00:03:14.490> go<00:03:14.760> through

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
process that your cashews go through

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.120 
process that your cashews go through
before<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.540> get<00:03:16.140> them<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:16.800> quite<00:03:17.100> a

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
before you get them it's quite a

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.370 
before you get them it's quite a
rigorous<00:03:17.850> process<00:03:18.120> -<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.660> was<00:03:18.990> shocked

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
rigorous process - I was shocked

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.710 
rigorous process - I was shocked
actually<00:03:19.710> at<00:03:20.310> all<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:21.060> steps<00:03:21.270> that<00:03:21.480> they<00:03:21.690> need

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
actually at all the steps that they need

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.890 
actually at all the steps that they need
to<00:03:22.050> go<00:03:22.440> through<00:03:23.190> in<00:03:23.430> order<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:24.180> be<00:03:24.330> safe<00:03:24.660> for

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
to go through in order to be safe for

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.530 
to go through in order to be safe for
consumption<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.760> tasty<00:03:27.300> enough

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
consumption and you know tasty enough

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.590 
consumption and you know tasty enough
for<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.960> to<00:03:28.140> actually<00:03:28.170> enjoy<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.250> cashew

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.280 

that<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.050> first<00:03:34.320> step<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:35.280> we<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
that is the first step and we do the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.860 
that is the first step and we do the
stamen<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.590> open<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.190> top<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.870> steamer

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
stamen we open the top of the steamer

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.190 
stamen we open the top of the steamer
and<00:03:40.230> put<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.680> rawness<00:03:41.070> in<00:03:41.310> we<00:03:41.880> use<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.360> shells

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
and put the rawness in we use the shells

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.050 
and put the rawness in we use the shells
of<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:44.060> runners<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.410> swell<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.680> steamer<00:03:47.550> yeah

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
of the runners to swell the steamer yeah

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.940 
of the runners to swell the steamer yeah
they're<00:03:48.330> steaming<00:03:48.600> hub<00:03:48.990> when<00:03:49.650> they<00:03:49.830> are

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
they're steaming hub when they are

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.450 
they're steaming hub when they are
cutting<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.520> nuts<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:52.140> get<00:03:52.380> polls<00:03:52.680> when

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
cutting the nuts and we get polls when

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.100 
cutting the nuts and we get polls when
it's<00:03:53.640> not<00:03:53.850> steamed<00:03:54.210> and<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:54.570> are<00:03:54.660> cutting<00:03:54.990> you

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
it's not steamed and we are cutting you

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.259 
it's not steamed and we are cutting you
get<00:03:55.380> early<00:03:55.590> Brooking

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.780 

this<00:04:00.269> is<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.540> second<00:04:00.930> step<00:04:01.170> from<00:04:02.129> the<00:04:02.280> healing

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
this is the second step from the healing

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.559 
this is the second step from the healing
then<00:04:03.390> we<00:04:03.629> spread<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.319> on<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.500> sheet<00:04:04.950> for<00:04:05.940> 24

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
then we spread it on the sheet for 24

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.960 
then we spread it on the sheet for 24
hours<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.170> cool<00:04:07.530> down<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.129> that<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.670> send

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
hours to cool down so that we can send

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.610 
hours to cool down so that we can send
it<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.480> cutting<00:04:09.930> side<00:04:10.140> if<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:12.409> rawness<00:04:13.409> is

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
it to the cutting side if the rawness is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.150 
it to the cutting side if the rawness is
hot<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.970> are<00:04:15.060> cracking<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:16.410> kill<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.949> can

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
hot and we are cracking you kill it can

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
hot and we are cracking you kill it can
crack<00:04:17.459> unless<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:18.120> cool<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.690> down<00:04:22.729> do<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.760> cut

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
crack unless you cool it down do the cut

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.110 
crack unless you cool it down do the cut
inside<00:04:24.570> every<00:04:25.380> day<00:04:25.560> we<00:04:25.770> will<00:04:26.190> crack<00:04:26.490> 800

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
inside every day we will crack 800

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.779 
inside every day we will crack 800
Colusa<00:04:27.540> we<00:04:28.290> have<00:04:28.410> machine<00:04:28.949> that<00:04:29.250> we<00:04:29.430> use<00:04:29.460> to

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
Colusa we have machine that we use to

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:30.469 
Colusa we have machine that we use to
crack<00:04:30.030> it

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
crack it

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.050 
crack it
they<00:04:30.780> cut<00:04:31.020> inside<00:04:31.410> we<00:04:31.710> have<00:04:31.889> nice<00:04:32.580> in<00:04:32.850> with

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
they cut inside we have nice in with

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.120 
they cut inside we have nice in with
this<00:04:33.210> so<00:04:33.780> there's<00:04:34.169> two<00:04:34.470> steps<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:35.010> the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
this so there's two steps in the

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.159 
this so there's two steps in the
cracking<00:04:35.520> process<00:04:36.030> it's<00:04:36.360> really<00:04:36.449> cracking

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
cracking process it's really cracking

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.950 
cracking process it's really cracking
Indy<00:04:37.530> Shelley<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:39.000> women<00:04:39.330> first<00:04:39.600> crack

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
Indy Shelley the women first crack

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.500 
Indy Shelley the women first crack
they're<00:04:40.229> not<00:04:40.410> open<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.160> then<00:04:41.820> they<00:04:42.180> have<00:04:42.389> to

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
they're not open and then they have to

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.240 
they're not open and then they have to
remove<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:43.050> all<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.350> way<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.830> rest<00:04:44.010> of<00:04:44.160> the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
remove it all the way the rest of the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.159 
remove it all the way the rest of the
way<00:04:44.400> from<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.789> shell<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.810> SAP<00:04:46.139> that

way from the shell the SAP that

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.290 
way from the shell the SAP that
surrounds<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.220> nut<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.729> shell<00:04:48.000> is<00:04:48.270> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
surrounds the nut in the shell is the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.020 
surrounds the nut in the shell is the
same<00:04:48.750> chemical<00:04:48.990> as<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.710> chemical<00:04:50.639> that's<00:04:50.820> in

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
same chemical as the chemical that's in

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.080 
same chemical as the chemical that's in
poison<00:04:51.660> ivy<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.050> poison<00:04:52.110> oak<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.520> most<00:04:53.910> people

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
poison ivy and poison oak so most people

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.610 
poison ivy and poison oak so most people
are<00:04:54.330> very<00:04:54.389> allergic<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:55.199> it

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
are very allergic to it

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.920 
are very allergic to it
you'll<00:04:56.340> notice<00:04:56.729> that<00:04:56.970> some<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.539> women<00:04:57.690> are

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
you'll notice that some of the women are

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.810 
you'll notice that some of the women are
putting<00:04:58.110> oil<00:04:58.350> on<00:04:58.590> their<00:04:58.770> hands<00:04:59.250> that's<00:04:59.580> to

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
putting oil on their hands that's to

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.700 
putting oil on their hands that's to
protect<00:05:00.210> them<00:05:00.389> from<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.870> sap<00:05:01.169> that's<00:05:01.470> within

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
protect them from the sap that's within

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.100 
protect them from the sap that's within
the<00:05:02.010> cashew<00:05:02.460> nut<00:05:03.090> itself<00:05:03.570> that<00:05:03.960> would

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
the cashew nut itself that would

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.480 
the cashew nut itself that would
irritate<00:05:04.500> their<00:05:04.919> skin<00:05:04.950> if<00:05:05.880> it<00:05:06.150> got<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.389> it<00:05:10.490> is

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
irritate their skin if it got on it is

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.990 
irritate their skin if it got on it is
the<00:05:11.760> first<00:05:12.450> step<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.080> this<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.160> dryer

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
the first step and this is the dryer

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.529 
the first step and this is the dryer
we<00:05:15.960> dried<00:05:16.289> from<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:17.070> crack<00:05:17.340> inside<00:05:17.760> we<00:05:18.180> put<00:05:18.210> it

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
we dried from the crack inside we put it

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.879 
we dried from the crack inside we put it
in<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.780> oven<00:05:18.990> dryer<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:20.340> dry

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
in the oven dryer to dry

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.700 
in the oven dryer to dry
for<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.659> canal<00:05:23.659> could<00:05:23.870> be<00:05:23.960> easier<00:05:24.319> to<00:05:24.439> kill

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
for the canal could be easier to kill

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:34.279
