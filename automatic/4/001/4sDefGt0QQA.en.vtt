it's<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> terrible<00:00:47.219> idea<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.730> we're

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it's just a terrible idea and we're

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.819 
it's just a terrible idea and we're
going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.480> over<00:00:48.510> some<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.530> those<00:00:49.590> reasons

but why is this applicable to us and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
but why is this applicable to us and
space<00:00:52.590> engineers<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.250> medieval<00:00:53.520> engineers

well<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:55.520> one<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
well that's because one of the

that<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:02.100> likely<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:03.390> will

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that it is very likely that we will

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.370 
that it is very likely that we will
announce<00:01:03.719> something<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.519> paid<00:01:05.519> mods<00:01:05.790> on

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
space engineers and that's not a good

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
space engineers and that's not a good
thing<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.740> I'll<00:01:10.740> go<00:01:10.860> over<00:01:10.890> some<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> the

if you're a modern you want to make some

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.289 
if you're a modern you want to make some
money<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:16.049> understand<00:01:16.909> wanting<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.180> do

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
money I can understand wanting to do

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.490 
money I can understand wanting to do
that<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.070> valve<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.970> game<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.350> it's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that but valve and the game that it's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.770 
that but valve and the game that it's
Ford<00:01:22.830> takes<00:01:24.290> 75%<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:26.580> revenue<00:01:27.030> earned

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
Ford takes 75% of the revenue earned

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.140 
Ford takes 75% of the revenue earned
from<00:01:28.770> your<00:01:28.979> mod<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.310> say<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> 99-cent

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
from your mod so say you have a 99-cent

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.609 
from your mod so say you have a 99-cent
mod<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.810> means<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:31.380> probably

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
mod that means that you're probably

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.270 
mod that means that you're probably
going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.159> 24<00:01:32.670> sense<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> that's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
going to get 24 sense of it that's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
going to get 24 sense of it that's
appallingly<00:01:35.280> low<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:37.049> should<00:01:37.259> be

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
appallingly low and it should be

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980 
appallingly low and it should be
reversed<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.369> should<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.240> Mater<00:01:39.600> should

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
reversed it should be the Mater should

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.590 
reversed it should be the Mater should
be<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.320> getting<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:41.250> 75<00:01:41.790> cents<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
be the one getting that 75 cents and the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.859 
be the one getting that 75 cents and the
developer<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.759> Val<00:01:44.759> maybe<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.570> should<00:01:45.780> get

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
developer and Val maybe they should get

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.639 
developer and Val maybe they should get
the<00:01:46.280> smaller<00:01:47.280> portion<00:01:47.869> that's<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.350> tip

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the smaller portion that's just the tip

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
the smaller portion that's just the tip

feel that it should work after the game
gets<00:03:15.079> updated<00:03:15.410> but<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.709> can't<00:03:16.069> necessarily

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
gets updated but you can't necessarily

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.140 
gets updated but you can't necessarily
ensure<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:19.870> also<00:03:21.400> modders<00:03:22.400> lose<00:03:22.730> their

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150

ensure that and also modders lose their
rights<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.109> mods<00:03:24.410> after<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.459> gets

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
rights to the mods after it gets

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.539 
rights to the mods after it gets
uploaded<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.690> actually<00:03:27.199> becomes<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
uploaded it actually becomes the

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.110 
uploaded it actually becomes the

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
steam so that's not really something

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.949 
steam so that's not really something
that<00:03:34.040> matters<00:03:34.519> I'm<00:03:35.090> sure<00:03:35.419> they<00:03:35.569> don't<00:03:35.750> want<00:03:35.870> to

that matters I'm sure they don't want to

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.000 
that matters I'm sure they don't want to
do<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.079> because<00:03:36.319> they<00:03:36.440> want<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.680> think<00:03:36.859> of<00:03:36.949> it

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
do that because they want to think of it

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.399 
do that because they want to think of it
as<00:03:37.099> their<00:03:37.370> baby<00:03:37.609> they<00:03:37.849> made<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.449> they're
