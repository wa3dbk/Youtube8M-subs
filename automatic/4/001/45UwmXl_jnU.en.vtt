00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
 we are back blue cross against 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.600
 Saints 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:11.620
 that you can expect even the favorite 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.110
 because I do not see any favorite if I see 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.610
 for what we could appreciate against the 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.110
 Atlas team I see the team much more 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.939
 solid of the defensive part 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.730
 the blue cross comes from receiving three goals 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.259
 but beyond that the stuck they are 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.250
 having crosses over the moment because to 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.500
 Through the Chaco GimÃ©nez 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.360
 I think he will continue to be a favorite 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.640
 to this team beyond receiving the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.560
 second match without blue cross achieves 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.450
 play as he did last week 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.699
 midweek against morelia is 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.829
 amount but if you can connect from that 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.960
 way yes no no no in moments of 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:46.269
 brilliant is that at times it overwhelmed 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.309
 morelia in in quantity because that is the 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.690
 news arrival with variants can be 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.039
 that is with his but very little is 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.629
 truth I see the jumping team 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.820
 also very solid has a rapidity in 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.800
 the defensive part these models 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.769
 how extraordinary was extraordinary 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.699
 maybe already restarts fails at 40 of 40 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.699
 of 30 who wear it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.580
 Oribe peralta holder change things 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.540
 and the truth is that I maybe like blue 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.060
 but by a margin 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.680
 and little ones that saints have for 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.290
 beat the heart with that picture without 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.140
 doubt in the half meter of the technicians 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.980
 Patricia worked for him as we criticized him 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.350
 and your eyebrows renteria and the first goal of 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.330
 weekend is guti tu for renterÃ­a 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.040
 inside of agreement with you veto but 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.840
 but if there is a man who has remained 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.729
 duty on this roster of saints is the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.240
 whistle is a man who has not been so 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.240
 regular 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.710
 yes but the need for street and there it is 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.690
 the give you minutes and good came and you 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.390
 it worked of course and it won and it happened 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.530
 over the atlas with four goals with three 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.300
 goals three goals for a finished 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.770
 eliminator but that lack of 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.770
 forcefulness does not worry you 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.570
 uribe is not uribe is this team and what 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.160
 You said the reference is for real time 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.350
 how many created when you see back that 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.270
 it arrives that generates too many good 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.489
 get speed 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.080
 to grab the ball the war with Pablo 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.000
 that Japan is the one that recovers and from there to 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.650
 I tell you that the ball and there is tranquility 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.570
 is that the worst are pressures from the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.380
 our both now you have to see why 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.790
 the last time 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.800
 pablo rodrÃ­guez was not in the field 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.460
 as a starter so that the match against 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.360
 the course they end up losing and that at 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.360
 [Music] 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.360
 First 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.409
 [Music] 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.650
 It was the difference but Juan Pablo is a 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.660
 important man for santo fabra 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.080
 blue cross will continue to live the dream 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.300
 that is, you can stay on top of that 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.100
 that level that we have lived for him 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.860
 especially it has players for that and 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.570
 him to continuity the constancy I 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.370
 I think that until now he has had 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.040
 to leave part against the america in the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.230
 semifinal of cup that has demonstrated 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.630
 showed a great a great 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.240
 possibility is the best standards to the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.010
 moment has had results either 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.180
 have been so bright even if colom 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.180
 back suddenly
