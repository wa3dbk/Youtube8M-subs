00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.890
 some today we find ourselves for 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.260
 new video for the tests of 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.890
 episode 1 cars so explanation of 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.390
 this new series 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.020
 it is the three car testing 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.779
 different selected and that I put 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.340
 forward for actually it's not rather 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.560
 fashions it's more like skins we're going 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.029
 say mode in parentheses so we 're going 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.400
 this time will tackle three types 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.470
 of different cars then the one that 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.000
 you see here it's a lamborghini 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.579
 gallardo guy most wanted an audi a6 I 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.960
 am not very sure and a peugeot 206 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.020
 because I thought she was very 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.620
 good to attest so first we 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.629
 let's test 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:56.920
 the audi the gallardo so to the world in 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:00.280
 already the little problem with the visual is that 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.670
 the head goes over when we turn to the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.230
 right 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.730
 we do not see it but if we turn to the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.010
 left or the voice anyway and if they 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.130
 stay at best we also see it no 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.730
 very very beautiful there is a good reflection if 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.189
 we will change color for example 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.110
 that's better maybe see the reflection the 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.270
 texture is not bad except you see it 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.259
 are there little wheel bugs good I you 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.369
 will do a little zoom and see no 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.650
 little bugs two wheels running through a 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.409
 little soil it does not do too much 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.869
 so we'll do a little tour with so 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.840
 these are the ones you find on a bit too much 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.299
 big this is this problem otherwise she is 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.420
 very very beautiful from the point of view so we 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.780
 will succeed in texture bins so in 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 made 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 goethe to darken in the wall 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.510
 so in fact we have to see everything 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.300
 simply if there are texture bugs 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.290
 as it is so when you saw 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 I do not know if you have but when I 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.750
 call you in the wall the wheel jumped 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.580
 weirdly we see that the smoke comes out of 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.950
 engine so that there are not too many bugs 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.880
 special 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.400
 otherwise I think it's not bad if 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 I'm ours and I 'll put a little 6 because 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.050
 in fact the roads actually waste everything from 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.550
 the car must be put less 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.940
 big so this time we will change on 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.890
 will test with the audi so has already 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.769
 reassembled the flat suffer bias I 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.330
 find that it is very beautiful reliefs 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.810
 good if they did not put any 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.420
 relief 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.790
 I find it all the same and there is 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.900
 not too many small stream bugs 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.290
 the wheels are not so big and I 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.890
 find that she is very very beautiful 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.430
 so we'll do a little trick 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.269
 so she's not so good 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.480
 so we're going to tap into a wall nothing will happen 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.480
 past 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.220
 take a little bit of too much 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.200
 so here's the door to a little broken the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.220
 motor we know not too oiled but I 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.670
 think rather that there is the front 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.870
 normally but his sister from the back 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.270
 that's a small fail after that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.580
 it's with their textured extract of the 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.170
 car because that's when it's there 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.730
 when you replace with a car that 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.580
 went back engine and that Norman is 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.750
 in front it's that it's not so we 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.510
 will play their prince blow it 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:26.739
 provides a successful example here 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.170
 it is very very beautiful, very very 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.430
 beautiful so now going to 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.970
 last tests 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.610
 so if i will put a note the audi a6 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.470
 I would put him a little 8 or 9 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.080
 she is very very good not too much 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.730
 textures six pack of textures for I 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.190
 tell when there are collisions like 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.830
 all the textured cars and tom 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.470
 boonen pass him to the peugeot 206 to 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.600
 a French car that is very very 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.670
 well texture is very very beautiful the 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.140
 problem is that if you see it's 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.060
 in fact we see the shadow in fact that 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.070
 it's a 4 4 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.290
 you see that it's really a small 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.040
 little that spoils a little bit otherwise 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.019
 roads no wheel bug it's very 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.769
 very beautiful so we will put it 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.560
 for example in black we will be there m in 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.150
 white here we left blank 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.039
 so the problem is that inside 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.870
 is still blue but if you have 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.400
 noticed is about the car he writes 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.039
 peugeot near the seat you look at me 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.970
 shows you that zuma can play that this is 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:34.180
 so beautiful after us to see them we will 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.310
 take a ride on the parking lot 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.110
 nothing special 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.200
 we will put nitro and we will 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.229
 knock a colleague a collision 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.729
 So here is the not say that there is no 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.320
 a lot of collision bugs but at 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.120
 the less he is there we can see very well that he 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.350
 is the collision that happened there 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.500
 collision bugs like the others 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.789
 so here we see the collisions is going 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.430
 now having backed off for 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.330
 see if the life of this breaks 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.539
 here is by c 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.370
 the crash bugs are there so that's 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.919
 very very good for a car 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.039
 like that so for the car I the 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.620
 would put 1.9 because the crash bugs 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:18.849
 does not exist there really are the 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.699
 collisions that exists there is no bug I 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.710
 mean full on the ground 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.699
 the only problem that I removed ben I 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.159
 can even put 1.8 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.539
 it's actually we see that in 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.360
 the shadow was a 4 4 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.449
 look we see very well that it's a 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.310
 4 4 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.469
 so here I hope that this little 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.629
 presentation do not hesitate like suggest 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:43.780
 me cars to test and I you 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:46.360
 I will let you know if 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.060
 I would accept something so maybe my 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.460
 next time I go straight through the 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.250
 car is so normal but 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.750
 it's because normand c14 qahtan abbas 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.889
 So I will hand down to those 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.629
 who want to offer me cars I 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.620
 would say if it's possible or not by 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:03.819
 example you can offered me a 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.770
 audi a2 maybe a a6 a c1 I'm 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.529
 not me everything you want a bmw 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.479
 to propose to you I can test for you 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:12.159
 and I 'm going to maybe do some video 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.779
 So here please Rule 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:15.779
 since comments go hi hi
