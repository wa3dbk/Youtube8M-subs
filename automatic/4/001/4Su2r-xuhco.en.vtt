00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.630
 I wondered mickey it's been 13 years that I play 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.940
 music and effects 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.370
 I'm talking tasting would really talk about sensory analysis 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.760
 a skier actually it's really 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.350
 a science in itself tasting but it's really devaluing 1 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.500
 qualify him 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.900
 but using the licenses 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.250
 that it is the villains that it is the smell is the same the touch 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.720
 it is in that that I think it's very very they are even less 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.610
 those who think like me no 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.160
 my analysis 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.810
 he qualifies it with the same measuring tools that the consumer can 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.510
 finally patina daegu his coffee 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.190
 he also uses it in a way maybe a little less calculated 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.490
 a little less to specify it with them he also remained without greeting his 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.440
 smell they became 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.470
 he loves me are touched even though he was not conscious 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.480
 and in fact it's true it's better 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.090
 coffee is a whole world in the all from 105 mm really 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.230
 even in a cup of coffee in hand 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.510
 hundreds and hundreds of euros me and all the aromatic palette that 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.980
 is present whether it is the floral notes 1 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.960
 you have already highlighted as the hymns of liquefying of Ethiopia we want 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.860
 ideas note itself lemony like the cafes of kenya one has some 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.260
 bergamot notes and fall all these light and flowery notes are 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.240
 present 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.170
 then we wait 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.840
 all on a register of rose notes within all nut notes they 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.459
 emanate from the final way of sometimes almond seeds 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.739
 they who are also there after investigation 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.859
 we can play with temptation 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.519
 with the grind actually also with the extraction and there we can develop 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.089
 again 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.299
 a whole aromatic palette with roasting increased textile 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.819
 and even this guerrilla origin could have gone very far in the magic 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.679
 we can lead them to very good ideas and 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.759
 spicy notes notes almost even sometimes of sandra that are 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.599
 really very very intense very heavy 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.489
 very present and all to enrich death in the soul the aromatic profile
