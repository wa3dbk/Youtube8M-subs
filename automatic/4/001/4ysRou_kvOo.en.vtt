00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.539 
can figure it out and then
trivia<00:02:45.430> activator<00:02:46.120> which<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.799> dependency

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
and it will install that if you don't

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.170 
and it will install that if you don't
already<00:02:50.290> have<00:02:50.469> it<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.040> then<00:02:51.549> just<00:02:51.579> set<00:02:51.939> it<00:02:51.969> to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
already have it and then just set it to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.209 
already have it and then just set it to
whatever<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.569> want<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.989> just<00:02:53.650> set<00:02:53.799> mine<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
volume buttons up and then down so it's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.440 
volume buttons up and then down so it's
kind<00:02:57.099> of<00:02:57.129> like<00:02:57.280> up<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.760> down<00:02:57.969> like<00:02:58.090> you're
