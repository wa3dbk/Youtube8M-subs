00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
a roller coaster I think I know I think

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
a roller coaster I think I know I think
she's<00:00:47.940> realizing<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.499> okay<00:00:49.800> sometimes

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
she's realizing that it's okay sometimes

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.160 
she's realizing that it's okay sometimes
not<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.519> be<00:00:50.609> perfect<00:00:51.089> and<00:00:51.179> making<00:00:51.539> mistakes<00:00:51.960> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
not to be perfect and making mistakes is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.309 
not to be perfect and making mistakes is
part<00:00:52.229> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> life<00:00:52.889> part<00:00:53.339> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.609> sanest<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
part of the life part of the sanest and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.629 
part of the life part of the sanest and
just<00:00:55.319> think<00:00:55.679> you<00:00:55.799> know<00:00:55.920> much<00:00:56.100> easier<00:00:56.489> with

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:56.639 
just think you know much easier with

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.459 
just think you know much easier with
myself<00:00:57.089> and<00:00:57.359> that<00:00:57.479> I<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.749> brought<00:00:58.139> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
myself and that I think brought the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.619 
myself and that I think brought the
calmest<00:00:58.979> that<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.639> now<00:00:59.819> on<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.089> cord<00:01:00.389> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
calmest that I have now on the cord and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.239 
calmest that I have now on the cord and
I<00:01:00.809> guess<00:01:01.260> there's<00:01:01.469> also<00:01:01.620> getting<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.129> little
