from Manhattan to Montauk we're at
epidemic<00:02:17.170> proportions<00:02:17.350> here<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:19.030> believe

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
epidemic proportions here and I believe

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.270 
epidemic proportions here and I believe
that<00:02:19.630> it's<00:02:19.930> because<00:02:20.260> we're<00:02:20.440> all<00:02:20.650> we're<00:02:21.130> all

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
leaky nuclear reactors exact and I think

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.780 
leaky nuclear reactors exact and I think
it's<00:02:26.170> very<00:02:26.470> important<00:02:27.130> for<00:02:27.160> people<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.580> pay
