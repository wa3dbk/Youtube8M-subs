to want to be really known in right out

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.420 
to want to be really known in right out
cyclonic<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:32.830> going<00:03:32.980> through<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.190> head<00:03:33.340> to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
cyclonic you going through the head to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.060 
cyclonic you going through the head to
the<00:03:33.520> moment<00:03:33.790> yeah<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.180> think<00:03:34.270> so<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.750> mean<00:03:35.110> it's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
the moment yeah I think so I mean it's

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.440 
the moment yeah I think so I mean it's
different<00:03:36.550> for<00:03:36.730> different<00:03:36.760> papers<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.300> think

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
different for different papers I think

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.990 
different for different papers I think
between<00:03:37.570> Reno<00:03:38.020> max<00:03:38.290> from<00:03:39.280> from<00:03:39.610> what<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:39.820> hear

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
between Reno max from from what you hear

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.130 
between Reno max from from what you hear
and<00:03:40.060> what<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.209> Steve<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.690> little<00:03:40.989> bit<00:03:41.080> of

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
and what you Steve is a little bit of

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.110 
and what you Steve is a little bit of
that<00:03:41.280> but<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.370> need<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.580> be<00:03:42.670> careful<00:03:42.820> because

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
that but you need to be careful because

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.430 
that but you need to be careful because
it<00:03:43.420> could<00:03:43.510> be<00:03:43.600> someone<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.050> outside<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.410> a

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440
