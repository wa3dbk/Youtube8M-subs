00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
computer it has the size so we just say

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.529 
computer it has the size so we just say
transfer<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:05.469> transferring<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:07.030> data

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
transfer and it's transferring the data

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.130 
transfer and it's transferring the data
from<00:02:08.020> our<00:02:08.140> XP<00:02:08.619> machine<00:02:08.979> onto<00:02:09.190> our<00:02:09.940> new<00:02:10.240> install

from our XP machine onto our new install
of<00:02:11.410> Windows<00:02:12.250> 7<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.830> will<00:02:15.010> take<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.220> little
