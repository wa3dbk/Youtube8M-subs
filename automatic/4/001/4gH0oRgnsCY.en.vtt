richness of a fish mahi-mahi is a really
great<00:03:18.830> fish<00:03:19.040> for<00:03:19.070> cooking<00:03:19.490> because<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.540> very

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
great fish for cooking because it's very

I'd<00:03:27.170> say<00:03:27.380> it's<00:03:27.560> most<00:03:28.070> akin<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:29.060> swordfish<00:03:29.510> if

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690

you've ever had that but it doesn't have

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
you've ever had that but it doesn't have
any<00:03:31.550> of<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.670> fishy<00:03:31.880> smell<00:03:32.000> when<00:03:32.300> you're
