00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.970
 as you say 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.030
 one knows for example from the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.130
 week show as brisko schneider yes 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 Of course, that is already very important 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 This week show is a long time ago 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 I have a 2011 one again 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.720
 try the old brand with new ones 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 to revive comedians 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.949
 but that's not right 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.019
 it can not be forced to work 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.849
 but where do we come from now ? 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.930
 Of course you can admire it here 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.489
 city â€‹â€‹talk at center.tv not and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.190
 otherwise I have anke with the colleague 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.989
 engelke a book closed a comedian 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.559
 Like you sometimes he has that too 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 need to play a serious role 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.530
 self-employment of course 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.750
 which it is I ask so in the blue 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.940
 could imagine a crime earlier 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.930
 Commissioner to play yes, crazy 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.980
 My girlfriend will be happy that is 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.980
 namely, huge crime site if you have yes 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.460
 something but good then you would have 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 already clarified but at the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.580
 theme to stay in English thrillers 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.380
 For example, there are the commissioners 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.869
 iaaf irony much more joke than that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 german colleague inspector barnaby es 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.439
 accident good but so far we have in 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.509
 germany so too my wife and me 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.850
 We watch it for example always like crime scene from 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.960
 what the gentlemen delivered and bragged 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.920
 It's really awesome to do that 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.869
 which is of course a limit to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.880
 Overdraft is good and here in Cologne 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.310
 we have the dietmar bear and klaus j 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 while as commissioners in action 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.790
 you can imagine that soon 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.790
 to replace what will not be soon 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.079
 But fun aside the trend goes 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.520
 of course, that's the way 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.859
 german krimis with more and more comedy 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.329
 enriching elements so if you 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.759
 then approach me sometime 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.469

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.520

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.140
