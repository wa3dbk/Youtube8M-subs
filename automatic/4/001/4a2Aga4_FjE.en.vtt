and its vehicles both are hugely
important<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.290> running<00:01:37.560> gun

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

ways so we've made a lot of innovations

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
ways so we've made a lot of innovations
in<00:01:43.350> terms<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.710> how<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.890> class<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.189> play<00:01:44.549> and

in terms of how the class is play and
the<00:01:45.119> gadgets<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.720> use<00:01:45.869> things<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the gadgets that we use things like the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
the gadgets that we use things like the
grappling<00:01:47.159> hook<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> zip<00:01:47.790> line<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.479> can

grappling hook and the zip line that can

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.030 
grappling hook and the zip line that can
be<00:01:48.720> used<00:01:48.869> both<00:01:48.990> by<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.920> your

that<00:02:15.460> wonder<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.640> different<00:02:16.970> ways<00:02:17.120> people

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
that wonder the different ways people

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.920 
that wonder the different ways people
are<00:02:17.990> playing<00:02:18.260> when<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.700> wall<00:02:20.300> versus

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
are playing when it's the wall versus

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.770 
are playing when it's the wall versus
the<00:02:21.260> criminal<00:02:21.860> side<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.460> equation<00:02:22.880> well

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the criminal side of the equation well

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.690 
the criminal side of the equation well
it<00:02:23.870> depends<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.230> lot<00:02:24.410> on<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.770> mode<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.310> terms<00:02:25.610> of

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
it depends a lot on the mode in terms of

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.520 
it depends a lot on the mode in terms of
what's<00:02:25.910> how<00:02:26.090> they're<00:02:26.300> playing<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.320> some

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
what's how they're playing so in some

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.920 
what's how they're playing so in some
cases<00:02:27.560> it's<00:02:28.100> relatively<00:02:28.760> symmetrical<00:02:29.090> both

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
cases it's relatively symmetrical both

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.290 
cases it's relatively symmetrical both
sides<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.350> similar<00:02:30.710> goals<00:02:30.950> like<00:02:31.250> let's<00:02:31.280> say<00:02:31.550> an

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
sides of similar goals like let's say an

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.720 
sides of similar goals like let's say an
armored<00:02:32.630> car<00:02:32.660> crashes<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.160> spills<00:02:34.490> its

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
armored car crashes and it spills its

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.430 
armored car crashes and it spills its
load<00:02:34.910> all<00:02:35.060> over<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.450> ground<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.990> there's<00:02:36.350> a

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
load all over the ground and there's a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.650 
load all over the ground and there's a
big<00:02:36.860> pile<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.070> cash<00:02:37.340> there<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.180> both<00:02:38.390> sides

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
big pile of cash there so now both sides

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.990 
big pile of cash there so now both sides
need<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.170> grab<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.070> try<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> secure<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.820> and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
need to grab it and try to secure it and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.340 
need to grab it and try to secure it and
they<00:02:41.270> also<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.630> their<00:02:41.750> own<00:02:41.780> vaults<00:02:42.290> that

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
they also have their own vaults that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.450 
they also have their own vaults that
they're<00:02:42.530> trying<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.800> protect<00:02:43.100> at<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.280> same

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
they're trying to protect at the same

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.460 
they're trying to protect at the same
time<00:02:43.670> other<00:02:44.390> times<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:44.960> more<00:02:45.020> asymmetrical

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
time other times it's more asymmetrical

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.560 
time other times it's more asymmetrical
where<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.820> case<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.240> there's<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
where in that case like there's like a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.330 
where in that case like there's like a
bank<00:02:47.900> or<00:02:48.140> some<00:02:48.350> place<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.830> police<00:02:49.070> need

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
bank or some place that the police need

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.070 
bank or some place that the police need
to<00:02:49.370> defend<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.630> criminals<00:02:50.960> trying

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
to defend and it's the criminals trying

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.170 
to defend and it's the criminals trying
to<00:02:51.260> get<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.830> if<00:02:51.890> they<00:02:52.010> do<00:02:52.070> get<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.550> then<00:02:53.060> it

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
to get in and if they do get in then it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.520 
to get in and if they do get in then it
becomes<00:02:53.540> where<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> criminals<00:02:54.230> are<00:02:54.320> trying

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
becomes where the criminals are trying
