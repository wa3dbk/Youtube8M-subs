going all right fond as I found his
objective<00:02:53.909> so<00:02:54.150> he's<00:02:55.019> going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.260> go<00:02:55.349> right

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
objective so he's going to go right

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.110 
objective so he's going to go right
after<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.950> see<00:02:56.190> if<00:02:56.250> he<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.489> plant<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.909> bomb

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
after that see if he can plant that bomb

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.000 
after that see if he can plant that bomb
so<00:02:57.480> then<00:02:57.629> is<00:02:58.110> there<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.530> no<00:02:58.680> one's<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:58.920> the

so then is there and no one's on the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.410 
so then is there and no one's on the
island<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.519> test<00:02:59.700> them<00:02:59.819> either<00:02:59.940> there

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
island that can test them either there

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.610 
island that can test them either there
was<00:03:00.569> that<00:03:00.690> question<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.110> i<00:03:01.200> mentioned

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
was that question that i mentioned

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.440 
was that question that i mentioned
before<00:03:01.650> how<00:03:02.159> is<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.489> indicated<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.150> hidden

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
before how is it indicated to hidden

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.390 
before how is it indicated to hidden
weapons<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.930> saw<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.290> pistol<00:03:04.769> icon<00:03:05.190> that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
down now here is a question as well bomb

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.240 
down now here is a question as well bomb
timer<00:03:12.000> how<00:03:12.269> long<00:03:12.599> is<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:12.959> really<00:03:13.709> isn't<00:03:14.190> that

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
timer how long is it really isn't that

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.009 
timer how long is it really isn't that
long<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.060> just<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.480> give<00:03:15.599> it<00:03:15.629> enough

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
long so you just have to give it enough

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.460 
long so you just have to give it enough
cover<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.069> be<00:03:17.849> able<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.269> allow<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.019> bomb<00:03:19.260> to

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
cover to be able to allow that bomb to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.570 
cover to be able to allow that bomb to
explode<00:03:19.500> right<00:03:20.069> now<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.430> see<00:03:20.549> that

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
explode right now you can see that

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.860 
explode right now you can see that
they've<00:03:20.790> got<00:03:20.879> a<00:03:20.940> player<00:03:21.180> nice<00:03:21.450> little<00:03:21.720> cover

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
they've got a player nice little cover

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.539 
they've got a player nice little cover
fire<00:03:22.140> there<00:03:22.409> he's<00:03:22.590> able<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.920> pick<00:03:23.069> up<00:03:23.190> bullet

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.490 
fire there he's able to pick up bullet
but<00:03:23.730> which<00:03:23.879> we<00:03:24.000> often<00:03:24.150> get<00:03:24.390> taken<00:03:25.080> down<00:03:25.110> though

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500
