you<00:00:06.120> might<00:00:06.270> have<00:00:06.330> seen<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.629> already<00:00:06.750> but<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> few

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
you might have seen it already but a few

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.049 
you might have seen it already but a few
months<00:00:07.529> ago<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:07.919> were<00:00:07.950> out<00:00:08.130> testing<00:00:08.580> spuds<00:00:08.940> and

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
months ago we were out testing spuds and

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.790 
months ago we were out testing spuds and
spawns<00:00:09.360> underwater<00:00:09.840> there<00:00:10.440> was<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.590> lot<00:00:10.769> of

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
spawns underwater there was a lot of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.230 
spawns underwater there was a lot of
good<00:00:10.980> feedback<00:00:11.160> from<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.550> but<00:00:11.880> there's<00:00:12.030> one

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
good feedback from that but there's one

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.820 
good feedback from that but there's one
question<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:12.840> kept<00:00:13.019> getting<00:00:13.139> asked<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
question that we kept getting asked and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.079 
question that we kept getting asked and
that<00:00:13.950> was<00:00:14.070> what<00:00:14.250> happens<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.730> boil<00:00:14.910> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
that was what happens to boil is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.609 
that was what happens to boil is
obviously<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.870> time<00:00:16.049> we're<00:00:16.440> using

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
obviously at the time we're using

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
obviously at the time we're using
particles<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
particles but now we're going to do the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.900 
particles but now we're going to do the
same<00:00:19.109> with<00:00:19.289> boilers<00:00:19.740> we've<00:00:20.220> got<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> Mark<00:00:20.670> flow

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
same with boilers we've got a Mark flow

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.400 
same with boilers we've got a Mark flow
out<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> swim<00:00:21.510> behind<00:00:21.630> us<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.080> felt<00:00:22.260> it

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
out and the swim behind us we felt it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.290 
out and the swim behind us we felt it
around<00:00:22.529> found<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.949> nice<00:00:23.100> clear<00:00:23.430> spot<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.180> we're

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
around found a nice clear spot so we're

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
around found a nice clear spot so we're
going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> try<00:00:24.660> spot<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.140> gun<00:00:25.260> Trice<00:00:25.529> bombs<00:00:25.890> but

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
going to try spot or gun Trice bombs but

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.560 
going to try spot or gun Trice bombs but
we're<00:00:26.279> also<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> get<00:00:26.939> thrown<00:00:27.210> sticks

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
we're also going to get thrown sticks

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.240 
we're also going to get thrown sticks
out<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.260> what's<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
out and just see what's going to be the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.900 
out and just see what's going to be the
most<00:00:29.400> accurate

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
most accurate

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.490 
most accurate
what<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> presentation<00:00:31.080> they<00:00:31.170> give<00:00:31.380> them

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
what kind of presentation they give them

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.170 
what kind of presentation they give them
what<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.369> improve<00:00:32.610> your<00:00:32.669> accuracy

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
what you can do to improve your accuracy

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.319 
what you can do to improve your accuracy
so<00:00:34.079> let's<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.760> happens

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.580 

with<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.420> pod<00:00:39.629> we're<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.110> filling<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> kind

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
with this pod we're just filling it kind

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.770 
with this pod we're just filling it kind
of<00:00:40.620> 3/4<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> way<00:00:41.460> full<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:42.420> don't<00:00:42.600> want<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
of 3/4 of the way full you don't want to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.090 
of 3/4 of the way full you don't want to
fill<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> rim<00:00:43.649> otherwise<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
fill it right to the rim otherwise you

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.520 
fill it right to the rim otherwise you
do<00:00:44.280> lose<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:44.850> from<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:45.719> past<00:00:45.930> experience

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
do lose a lot from from past experience

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
do lose a lot from from past experience
I'm<00:00:46.649> expecting<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> few<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.789> kind<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.059> come

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
I'm expecting a few to just kind of come

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.970 
I'm expecting a few to just kind of come
out<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> cast<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.050> hopefully<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.920> won't

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
out on the cast but hopefully it won't

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.770 
out on the cast but hopefully it won't
be<00:00:50.100> too<00:00:50.160> bad<00:00:50.309> obviously<00:00:50.940> compared<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
be too bad obviously compared to a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
be too bad obviously compared to a
normal<00:00:52.440> spot<00:00:52.620> mix<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.920> can't<00:00:53.129> compress<00:00:53.399> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
normal spot mix you can't compress it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.490 
normal spot mix you can't compress it
down<00:00:53.670> quite<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.090> much<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.539> let's<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.410> this

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
down quite as much so let's see how this

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.660 
down quite as much so let's see how this
one<00:00:55.710> goes<00:00:57.710> got<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.859> everything<00:00:59.309> clipped<00:00:59.520> up

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
one goes got it everything clipped up

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.279 
one goes got it everything clipped up
already<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.390> getting<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
already so it's just getting the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.690 
already so it's just getting the
directing<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:07.100> that's<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> obviously<00:01:08.580> as

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
directing right that's it obviously as

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
directing right that's it obviously as
you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> fairly<00:01:09.600> short<00:01:09.900> cast<00:01:10.260> if

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you can see on a fairly short cast if

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.340 
you can see on a fairly short cast if
you<00:01:11.280> did<00:01:11.430> come<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:11.930> landed<00:01:12.930> roughly

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
you did come out but landed roughly

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.690 
you did come out but landed roughly
around<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.650> same<00:01:13.860> area<00:01:14.100> you're<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.340> not

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
around the same area you're not not

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.080 
around the same area you're not not
quite<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.030> accurate<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> could<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.110> been

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
quite as accurate as it could have been

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:27.230 
quite as accurate as it could have been
so<00:01:18.090> let's<00:01:18.270> try<00:01:18.869> another<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> those

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.969 

if<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.420> dropped<00:01:28.659> on<00:01:28.810> on<00:01:29.109> the<00:01:29.380> initial<00:01:29.770> cast

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
if you dropped on on the initial cast

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.550 
if you dropped on on the initial cast
but<00:01:30.189> they've<00:01:30.310> got<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.579> same<00:01:30.820> sort<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.179> power

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
but they've got the same sort of power

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.990 
but they've got the same sort of power
obviously<00:01:32.560> if<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.829> spot<00:01:33.250> in<00:01:33.399> like<00:01:33.549> 100

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
obviously if you spot in like 100

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.429 
obviously if you spot in like 100
hundred<00:01:34.270> twenty<00:01:34.570> yards<00:01:34.869> they're<00:01:35.170> going<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.380> be

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
hundred twenty yards they're going to be

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.469 
hundred twenty yards they're going to be
falling<00:01:35.679> a<00:01:35.860> lot<00:01:36.009> shorter<00:01:36.250> or<00:01:36.939> in<00:01:37.060> short<00:01:37.210> cuts

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
falling a lot shorter or in short cuts

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
falling a lot shorter or in short cuts
like<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:38.020> not<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.200> major<00:01:38.409> problem

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.800 

moving<00:01:42.250> onto<00:01:42.369> spawners<00:01:42.670> one<00:01:43.420> thing<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:43.689> do

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
moving onto spawners one thing you do

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.999 
moving onto spawners one thing you do
hear<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.020> lot<00:01:44.079> of<00:01:44.200> people<00:01:44.350> questioning<00:01:44.890> is

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
hear a lot of people questioning is

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.679 
hear a lot of people questioning is
actually<00:01:45.579> how<00:01:45.700> much<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.969> can<00:01:46.060> get<00:01:46.209> in<00:01:46.329> there

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
actually how much you can get in there

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.959 
actually how much you can get in there
so<00:01:47.140> we<00:01:47.770> using<00:01:48.069> the<00:01:48.130> biggest<00:01:48.399> one<00:01:48.520> today<00:01:48.670> that

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
so we using the biggest one today that

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.249 
so we using the biggest one today that
they<00:01:49.090> do<00:01:49.240> that's<00:01:49.600> you're<00:01:49.750> reaching<00:01:49.899> one<00:01:50.140> they

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
they do that's you're reaching one they

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.230 
they do that's you're reaching one they
brought<00:01:50.439> down<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:50.920> compared<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:51.969> a<00:01:52.060> full

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
brought down and compared to a full

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.620 
brought down and compared to a full
payload<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.439> spod<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:55.030> surprising

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
payload of of the spod it's surprising

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.109 
payload of of the spod it's surprising
that<00:01:55.959> you<00:01:56.049> can<00:01:56.170> actually<00:01:56.259> get<00:01:56.590> all<00:01:57.579> of<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:57.969> in

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
that you can actually get all of that in

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.809 
that you can actually get all of that in
and<00:01:58.929> spend<00:01:59.829> a<00:01:59.890> little<00:02:00.009> bit<00:02:00.130> more<00:02:00.250> time<00:02:00.579> on<00:02:00.610> it

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
and spend a little bit more time on it

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.130 
and spend a little bit more time on it
you<00:02:00.880> can<00:02:01.000> probably<00:02:01.149> get<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.390> few<00:02:01.479> few<00:02:01.959> more

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
you can probably get a few few more

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.449 
you can probably get a few few more
boilers<00:02:02.530> in<00:02:02.649> there<00:02:02.829> I<00:02:02.860> think<00:02:02.890> they<00:02:03.099> take<00:02:03.280> about

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
boilers in there I think they take about

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.809 
boilers in there I think they take about
60<00:02:04.000> or<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.329> so<00:02:05.069> spend<00:02:06.069> spend<00:02:06.459> a<00:02:06.489> bit<00:02:06.610> time

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
60 or so so spend spend a bit time

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.490 
60 or so so spend spend a bit time

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
max it out make sure that door can shop

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.330 
max it out make sure that door can shop
and<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:11.049> can<00:02:11.170> actually<00:02:11.319> get<00:02:11.590> more<00:02:11.829> than<00:02:12.250> you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and you can actually get more than you

the surface where the spod was diving a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
good couple of feet under although it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.150 
good couple of feet under although it
does<00:02:31.900> mean<00:02:32.109> that<00:02:32.139> it's<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.440> little<00:02:32.799> bit<00:02:32.950> louder

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
does mean that it's a little bit louder

the spod but to be honest I prefer that
nice<00:03:29.130> nice

but there's a nice nice clump on the
bottom<00:03:41.490> so<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.850> suppose<00:03:42.090> if<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.330> really

the weed couple foot wide that might be

the weed couple foot wide that might be
the<00:03:47.040> one<00:03:47.160> but<00:03:47.340> 99%<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.420> time<00:03:48.600> if<00:03:49.020> it's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
the one but 99% of the time if it's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.090 
the one but 99% of the time if it's
straight<00:03:49.470> boilies

I'd<00:03:50.160> definitely<00:03:50.880> be<00:03:50.970> going<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.390> bomb

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
I'd definitely be going for this bomb

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.300 
I'd definitely be going for this bomb
you're<00:03:52.110> not<00:03:52.230> losing<00:03:52.410> anything<00:03:52.770> on<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.070> cast

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
you're not losing anything on the cast

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.030 
you're not losing anything on the cast
and<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:54.870> gets<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.200> out<00:03:55.260> there<00:03:55.320> slightly

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
and it just gets it out there slightly

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.830 
and it just gets it out there slightly
slightly<00:03:56.610> better<00:03:56.760> feeding<00:03:57.150> situation<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:57.750> my

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
slightly better feeding situation in my

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.320 
slightly better feeding situation in my
opinion
