00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.139
 good time hello i am their darden 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.789
 the lesson I want to talk about and that's what's about 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.060
 opportunities many people consider 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.910
 that their potential their potential 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.279
 some probabilities this is very valuable 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.880
 thing they are very proud of it i'm not very 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.010
 it is appreciated 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.590
 we hide and attach weighed uneasy 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.170
 just think a tit is better in the hands 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.660
 or a crane in the sky 100 rubles right 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.530
 now or 500 maybe someday 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.480
 then while you get about it i wanted 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.890
 say your opinion and with that I will tell 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.920
 one more question how do you think is better 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.629
 work for money or experience well 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.760
 answer the last question will tell 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.010
 fields for what money immediately what experience 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.329
 Globally, I personally think that if you 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.010
 you will work for experience and you will be all 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.520
 life work only for experience not getting 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.739
 not a penny 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.050
 best work for money because experience 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.470
 and in any case you get but if you 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.570
 working for free you get experience 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.420
 free unpaid work and not 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.800
 worth believing everyone serve them as a reassurance 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.539
 swedish hour i will get as you can 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.539
 earn no hua like 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.110
 every oak is potentially every tooth 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.580
 once was acorns every palm tree 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.060
 was once a little date 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.119
 The grain of the date-seed is much 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.569
 more than palm trees acorns in the forest and yes 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.950
 everywhere 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.970
 much more than oaks therefore 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.890
 treat a little differently to your 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.580
 opportunities you have opportunities 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.819
 but the opportunity is worth nothing 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.610
 opportunity is worth nothing 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.610
 not worth a dime 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 a little bit not all she did to this topic 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.270
 money in this world is defined like this 1 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.689
 the ruble to the one who came up with 10 rubles 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.979
 who made and 100 rubles to someone who sold 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.110

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.319

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.750
 your opportunity 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.610

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.750
 looking for new regret for missing out 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.010
 old course now right now 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.569
 now there are opportunities 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.230
 right now you can do something 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.440
 to their use and to transfer 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 potential energy into real 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.860
 translate the opportunity into reality personally 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.630
 I'm going to use right now 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.489
 opportunities to jump from four meters 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.110
