00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
about future Gohan and why I still think

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.520 
about future Gohan and why I still think
even<00:00:32.239> though<00:00:32.390> he<00:00:32.599> didn't<00:00:32.809> get<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.140> ample

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
even though he didn't get the ample

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.049 
even though he didn't get the ample
training<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.129> the<00:00:34.190> hyperbolic<00:00:34.640> time<00:00:34.999> chamber

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
training and the hyperbolic time chamber

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.389 
training and the hyperbolic time chamber
in<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.659> present<00:00:36.079> I<00:00:36.230> think<00:00:37.100> he<00:00:37.190> should<00:00:37.370> have

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
in the present I think he should have

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.819 
in the present I think he should have
been<00:00:37.629> more<00:00:38.629> than<00:00:38.839> strong<00:00:39.140> enough<00:00:39.199> to<00:00:39.589> defeat

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
been more than strong enough to defeat

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.000 
been more than strong enough to defeat

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.690 
mention the fact that when you think
about<00:03:42.410> 13<00:03:43.100> years<00:03:43.130> as<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.670> time<00:03:44.120> frame<00:03:45.340> 13<00:03:46.340> years

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
in the future is the equivalent to 5

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.570 
in the future is the equivalent to 5
years<00:03:51.400> between<00:03:52.400> 5<00:03:53.390> years<00:03:53.720> between<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:55.250> Buu

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
hyperbolic time chamber that he wasn't

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
Volans hidden powers you got to realize

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.370 
Volans hidden powers you got to realize
that<00:04:25.610> most<00:04:26.120> of<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.390> time<00:04:26.630> has<00:04:26.840> hidden<00:04:27.050> power

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
that most of the time has hidden power

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.440 
that most of the time has hidden power
was<00:04:27.470> come<00:04:27.650> out<00:04:27.680> when<00:04:27.980> he<00:04:28.130> has<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.250> huge<00:04:28.610> huge

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
was come out when he has a huge huge

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.050 
was come out when he has a huge huge
surge<00:04:29.900> of<00:04:30.140> emotion

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
surge of emotion

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.300 
surge of emotion
so<00:04:32.060> when<00:04:32.720> Gohan<00:04:33.170> was<00:04:33.350> fighting<00:04:33.740> against<00:04:34.010> cell

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
so when Gohan was fighting against cell

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.280 
so when Gohan was fighting against cell
and<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:35.060> soul<00:04:35.240> unions<00:04:35.630> were<00:04:35.750> beating<00:04:36.050> up<00:04:36.170> on

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
and the soul unions were beating up on

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.640 
and the soul unions were beating up on
his<00:04:36.410> friends<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.240> Android<00:04:38.240> 16<00:04:38.630> got<00:04:39.320> his<00:04:39.440> head

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
his friends and Android 16 got his head

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.840 
his friends and Android 16 got his head
squished<00:04:40.070> which<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.400> thought<00:04:40.580> was<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.760> pretty

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
squished which I thought was a pretty

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.980 
squished which I thought was a pretty
funny<00:04:41.300> scene<00:04:41.600> Oh

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.530 

Gohan<00:04:45.220> tapped<00:04:46.220> into<00:04:46.520> his<00:04:46.730> power<00:04:47.000> in<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.450> he

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
Gohan tapped into his power in and he

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.510 
Gohan tapped into his power in and he
wants<00:04:47.810> Super<00:04:48.080> Saiyan<00:04:48.290> 2<00:04:48.500> and<00:04:48.740> if<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:49.280> look<00:04:49.430> at

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
wants Super Saiyan 2 and if you look at

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.640 
wants Super Saiyan 2 and if you look at
it<00:04:49.640> against<00:04:49.910> raditz<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.840> frieza<00:04:50.930> whatever

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
it against raditz and frieza whatever

his<00:04:51.800> friends<00:04:52.160> are<00:04:52.280> hurt<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.580> endangered

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
his friends are hurt and endangered

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.160 
his friends are hurt and endangered
that's<00:04:53.120> what<00:04:53.300> his<00:04:53.390> head<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.630> powers<00:04:53.870> come<00:04:54.020> out

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
that's what his head and powers come out

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.050 
that's what his head and powers come out
so<00:04:54.980> I'm<00:04:55.370> saying<00:04:56.090> if<00:04:56.420> it's<00:04:56.900> been<00:04:57.400> I'm<00:04:58.400> sorry<00:04:58.910> if

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
so I'm saying if it's been I'm sorry if

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.940 
so I'm saying if it's been I'm sorry if
you've<00:04:59.240> been<00:04:59.390> fighting<00:04:59.870> for<00:05:00.080> 13<00:05:00.530> years<00:05:00.860> and

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
you've been fighting for 13 years and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.410 
you've been fighting for 13 years and
you<00:05:01.250> can't<00:05:01.520> bring<00:05:01.700> out<00:05:01.850> your<00:05:02.000> hidden<00:05:02.240> power

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
you can't bring out your hidden power

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.110 
you can't bring out your hidden power
that<00:05:02.690> makes<00:05:02.900> no<00:05:03.080> sense<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.530> me<00:05:03.560> I<00:05:03.830> mean<00:05:04.790> he

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
that makes no sense to me I mean he

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.480 
that makes no sense to me I mean he
definitely<00:05:05.360> has<00:05:05.960> all<00:05:06.260> of<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.680> reasons<00:05:07.040> to<00:05:07.100> go

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
definitely has all of the reasons to go

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.700 
definitely has all of the reasons to go
Super<00:05:07.850> Saiyan<00:05:08.090> 2<00:05:08.360> or<00:05:08.540> not<00:05:08.990> just<00:05:09.260> Super<00:05:09.500> Saiyan

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
Super Saiyan 2 or not just Super Saiyan

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.740 
Super Saiyan 2 or not just Super Saiyan
2<00:05:09.890> but<00:05:10.100> at<00:05:10.280> least<00:05:10.430> increases<00:05:11.090> power<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.480> lot

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
2 but at least increases power a lot

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.810 
2 but at least increases power a lot
more<00:05:11.960> than<00:05:12.110> what<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.350> actually<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.610> what

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
more than what it actually is but what

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.240 
more than what it actually is but what
we<00:05:13.970> really<00:05:14.240> have<00:05:14.390> to<00:05:14.600> look<00:05:14.780> at<00:05:14.960> is<00:05:15.230> how<00:05:15.830> long

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
we really have to look at is how long

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.210 
we really have to look at is how long
did<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.550> take<00:05:16.670> Gohan<00:05:17.480> to<00:05:18.110> turn<00:05:18.380> into<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.740> Super

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
did it take Gohan to turn into a Super

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.770 
did it take Gohan to turn into a Super
Saiyan<00:05:19.250> for<00:05:19.700> the<00:05:19.790> first<00:05:20.030> time<00:05:20.270> because<00:05:20.450> that's

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
Saiyan for the first time because that's

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.440 
Saiyan for the first time because that's
extremely<00:05:21.380> important<00:05:21.830> if<00:05:21.980> it<00:05:22.640> took<00:05:23.030> gave<00:05:23.300> me

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
extremely important if it took gave me

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.750 
extremely important if it took gave me
years<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:23.810> turn<00:05:24.140> Super<00:05:24.410> Saiyan<00:05:24.740> one<00:05:25.040> after<00:05:25.610> the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
years to turn Super Saiyan one after the

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.030 
years to turn Super Saiyan one after the
Android<00:05:26.060> killed<00:05:26.360> all<00:05:26.510> of<00:05:26.540> his<00:05:26.720> friends<00:05:27.080> then<00:05:27.800> I

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
Android killed all of his friends then I

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.560 
Android killed all of his friends then I
can<00:05:28.250> probably<00:05:28.520> understand<00:05:29.120> why<00:05:29.300> he<00:05:29.450> couldn't

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
can probably understand why he couldn't

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.770 
can probably understand why he couldn't
beat<00:05:29.840> them<00:05:30.070> but<00:05:31.070> if<00:05:31.250> Gohan<00:05:31.670> has<00:05:31.700> been<00:05:32.000> Super

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
beat them but if Gohan has been Super

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.930 
beat them but if Gohan has been Super
Saiyan<00:05:32.990> 2<00:05:33.320> I'm<00:05:33.860> sorry<00:05:34.160> if<00:05:34.280> he's<00:05:34.400> been<00:05:34.610> super

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
Android 80 wasn't even involved in the

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.589 
Android 80 wasn't even involved in the
fight<00:06:53.319> whereas<00:06:54.319> in<00:06:54.770> the<00:06:55.370> anime<00:06:55.940> Gohan<00:06:56.360> fought

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.029 
fight whereas in the anime Gohan fought
against<00:06:56.840> both<00:06:57.080> androids<00:06:57.560> and<00:06:57.680> it<00:06:57.770> looked<00:06:57.949> like

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
against both androids and it looked like

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.260 
against both androids and it looked like
he<00:06:58.250> could<00:06:58.400> hold<00:06:58.610> his<00:06:58.759> own

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
he could hold his own

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.950 
he could hold his own
but<00:07:00.020> I'm<00:07:00.740> basing<00:07:01.490> most<00:07:01.970> of<00:07:02.210> my<00:07:02.330> facts<00:07:02.599> off<00:07:02.810> in

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
but I'm basing most of my facts off in

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.870 
but I'm basing most of my facts off in
the<00:07:03.020> manga<00:07:03.349> but<00:07:03.380> the<00:07:03.830> anime<00:07:04.250> still<00:07:04.580> shows<00:07:04.849> the

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
the manga but the anime still shows the

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.640 
the manga but the anime still shows the
Gohan<00:07:05.419> who's<00:07:05.539> weaker<00:07:05.840> than<00:07:05.960> the<00:07:06.110> androids

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
Gohan who's weaker than the androids

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.150 
Gohan who's weaker than the androids
so<00:07:07.780> when<00:07:08.780> you<00:07:08.900> put<00:07:09.139> all<00:07:09.380> of<00:07:09.410> those<00:07:09.680> things<00:07:09.740> in

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
so when you put all of those things in

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.939 
so when you put all of those things in
consideration<00:07:10.759> the<00:07:11.210> fact<00:07:12.199> that<00:07:12.349> Gohan<00:07:12.770> had

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:12.949 
consideration the fact that Gohan had

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.100 
consideration the fact that Gohan had
plenty<00:07:13.280> of<00:07:13.460> time<00:07:13.520> to<00:07:13.729> Train<00:07:14.150> the<00:07:14.780> fact<00:07:15.020> that

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
plenty of time to Train the fact that

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.710 
plenty of time to Train the fact that
Gohan<00:07:15.560> still<00:07:15.919> has<00:07:16.159> the<00:07:16.400> hidden<00:07:16.550> power<00:07:16.880> the

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 
Gohan still has the hidden power the

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.830 
Gohan still has the hidden power the
fact<00:07:17.960> that<00:07:18.139> you<00:07:18.770> can<00:07:18.979> even<00:07:19.099> say<00:07:19.430> if<00:07:19.639> Tien<00:07:20.180> Shan

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 
fact that you can even say if Tien Shan

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.170 
fact that you can even say if Tien Shan
Han<00:07:21.110> trained<00:07:21.500> for<00:07:21.740> 13<00:07:22.159> years<00:07:22.460> I'm<00:07:22.669> sure<00:07:22.729> he

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
Han trained for 13 years I'm sure he

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.219 
Han trained for 13 years I'm sure he
would<00:07:23.300> have<00:07:23.389> been<00:07:23.479> strong<00:07:23.720> enough<00:07:23.750> to<00:07:24.020> beat

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229 
would have been strong enough to beat

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:26.379 
would have been strong enough to beat
the<00:07:24.650> weakened<00:07:25.099> version<00:07:25.430> of<00:07:25.580> the<00:07:25.699> androids<00:07:26.210> and

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389 
the weakened version of the androids and

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.020 
the weakened version of the androids and
these<00:07:26.900> androids<00:07:27.500> were<00:07:27.680> weaker<00:07:28.190> because<00:07:28.940> of

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.030 
these androids were weaker because of

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.420 
these androids were weaker because of
the<00:07:29.120> fact<00:07:29.389> that<00:07:29.710> dr.<00:07:30.710> Jarreau<00:07:31.490> in<00:07:31.849> the<00:07:32.810> future

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.430 
the fact that dr. Jarreau in the future

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.059 
the fact that dr. Jarreau in the future
used<00:07:34.430> he<00:07:35.389> did<00:07:35.569> not<00:07:35.780> have<00:07:35.960> I'm<00:07:36.169> sorry<00:07:36.349> dr.<00:07:36.770> Jo<00:07:36.919> in

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:37.069 
used he did not have I'm sorry dr. Jo in

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:39.640 
used he did not have I'm sorry dr. Jo in
the<00:07:37.159> future<00:07:37.400> did<00:07:37.610> not<00:07:37.880> use<00:07:38.330> his<00:07:39.050> remote

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650 
the future did not use his remote

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.589 
the future did not use his remote
control<00:07:39.830> device<00:07:40.430> to<00:07:40.639> shut<00:07:40.849> off<00:07:40.970> the<00:07:41.150> adjoint

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 
control device to shut off the adjoint

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.629 
control device to shut off the adjoint
so<00:07:42.110> the<00:07:42.259> androids<00:07:42.620> just<00:07:42.830> went<00:07:43.039> on<00:07:43.130> a<00:07:43.159> rampage

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 
so the androids just went on a rampage

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.670 
so the androids just went on a rampage
whereas<00:07:44.389> in<00:07:44.539> the<00:07:44.659> past<00:07:44.840> he<00:07:45.199> had<00:07:45.380> the<00:07:45.530> ability

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 
whereas in the past he had the ability

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.279 
whereas in the past he had the ability

to shut them up and he kept working on
them<00:07:48.500> to<00:07:48.949> tweak<00:07:49.219> and<00:07:49.370> improve<00:07:49.460> them<00:07:49.820> so<00:07:50.169> guys

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:51.169 
them to tweak and improve them so guys

this<00:07:52.009> is<00:07:52.159> basically<00:07:52.580> why<00:07:52.820> I<00:07:52.849> think<00:07:53.210> future

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:53.509 
this is basically why I think future

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:55.330

Gohan<00:07:53.810> is<00:07:53.840> a<00:07:54.020> lot<00:07:54.229> weaker<00:07:54.469> than<00:07:54.620> he<00:07:54.860> should<00:07:54.889> be

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.530 
I still think he should have been more

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.719 
I still think he should have been more
