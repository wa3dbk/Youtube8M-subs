00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
you can ignore some of these wires they

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.509 
you can ignore some of these wires they
go<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.680> other<00:02:49.890> things<00:02:51.920> right<00:02:52.920> here's<00:02:53.159> a<00:02:53.250> wire

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.809 
14 gauge wire probably recommends 12 but
I<00:03:21.750> think<00:03:22.079> 14<00:03:22.590> would<00:03:22.769> be<00:03:22.919> sufficient<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.549> now

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
got my wires here in the clip got the

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.990 
got my wires here in the clip got the
relay<00:05:33.470> which<00:05:33.860> without<00:05:34.099> too<00:05:34.400> much<00:05:34.520> trouble<00:05:34.759> you

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
relay which without too much trouble you

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.140 
relay which without too much trouble you
can<00:05:36.099> get<00:05:37.099> to<00:05:37.280> go<00:05:37.430> through<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:37.699> screw<00:05:38.000> right

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
can get to go through that screw right

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.020 
can get to go through that screw right

your power is coming from your battery
goes<00:05:50.990> into<00:05:51.349> pin<00:05:51.820> number<00:05:52.820> 87<00:05:53.599> and<00:05:54.490> then<00:05:55.490> you

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
goes into pin number 87 and then you

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.379 
goes into pin number 87 and then you
want<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:58.550> wire<00:05:59.620> that's<00:06:00.620> bringing<00:06:01.039> power<00:06:01.400> to

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
want the wire that's bringing power to

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:09.300 
want the wire that's bringing power to
the<00:06:02.599> coil<00:06:03.729> you<00:06:04.729> want<00:06:04.940> that<00:06:05.210> one<00:06:06.520> to<00:06:07.520> go<00:06:07.840> into

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
the coil you want that one to go into

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:17.290 
the coil you want that one to go into
n86<00:06:12.280> now<00:06:13.280> you've<00:06:13.460> got<00:06:13.669> this<00:06:13.909> one<00:06:14.240> here<00:06:16.300> going

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
n86 now you've got this one here going

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.370 
n86 now you've got this one here going
to<00:06:18.099> the<00:06:19.099> actual<00:06:19.460> clip<00:06:19.729> on<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:20.030> coil<00:06:20.380> this

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
to the actual clip on the coil this

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.060 
to the actual clip on the coil this
one's<00:06:21.680> going<00:06:21.889> to<00:06:21.949> be<00:06:22.039> pin<00:06:22.370> 30<00:06:22.849> and<00:06:23.889> then<00:06:24.889> your

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
one's going to be pin 30 and then your
