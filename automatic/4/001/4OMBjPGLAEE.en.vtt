 tutorial crane rt terex 75 tons 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.879
 2014 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.180
 huancavelica eagle hill project 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:21.050
 peru carlos albino callao good 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.230
 let's start with the keypads I was already calling 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.930
 not only all these lights 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.960
 lights I know you already know that in this mode 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.900
 this is the mode 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.670
 fever is for simple transmission what 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.109
 what is this 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.120
 two times four and here is 4x4 this is 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.250
 the lock is what it does when you 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.219
 you are in the 4x4 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.670
 apply the lock I know I give you more 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.440
 force for movement to 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.200
 move in what is way 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.030
 too sinuous 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.760
 now we have what is crabs already 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.810
 you know 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.750
 coordinated simple crab 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.630
 does the creator of hand tightens goes to 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.240
 accelerate tightening will lower the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.590
 revolution is not repressed this is for 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.360
 check the engine when the engine has 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.340
 a problem you do not have tight for a 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.680
 amount of minutes an amount of 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.500
 seconds and you will throw away the error that 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.590
 is presenting the team works from 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.510
 oscillation of rear axles that what 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.050
 makes that when you move the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.720
 rear suspension will play but with 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.360
 This will work and it will not play will 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.500
 be stuck 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.340
 blocks cats cats extensions 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.230
 extensions for what is 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.300
 Stabilization will only work 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.660
 when you are pressing this blue button and 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.410
 you have to press this blue button and 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.900
 play with the canvas 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.910
 play with the blocks the cats 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.910
 that is in a state of emergency 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.220
 joyce in has several functions here 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.490
 pull out pen metes pen is in effect 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.900
 normal always having this tight 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.060
 system that is the man system 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.560
 dead for what safety do you have to 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.480
 have it tight so that the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.530
 Joystick has the same joyce ting 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.730
 right so always tight now 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.100
 It is good to take out a spin pen in 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.110
 this machine in this in this telex the 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.240
 model the turn is always locked not 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.740
 has a turntable brake, you do not have 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.170
 brake pedal has not working 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.290
 it was always blocked now that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.920
 makes this red button make that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.780
 let go slowly I advise that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.990
 turn while keeping the red button pressed 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.440
 so that the movement in 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.320
 this camps in this green button you change 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.690
 mode one to modes mode one is 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.900
 take out the thickest pen and the mode of 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.510
 take out the two smaller ones 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.250
 consecutively and when you have the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.800
 auxiliary winche this machine does not have the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.510
 auxiliary winche you lend for example 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.610
 you are squeezing it and it will activate you 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.350
 auxiliary winch and you can work no 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.920
 active according to facilitate and work with 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.010
 with this that is finer or if not with 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.709
 nobody is the auxiliary winche 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.439
 now the right I be in right 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.750
 also has the function is to be for 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.329
 the right pen for the pen to go up 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.180
 hook down hook that this thing to do 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.489
 horn and here they make you the way hare and 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.440
 the turtle monkey see it in free mode 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.940
 turia engine 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.320
 the break brake brakes 1 the parking 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.660
 down is the pin 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.090
 there's the turntable pin or pin there 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:47.540
 they see it accelerator and brake 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.719
 the eye of the podium the action and that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.040
 and most importantly the radio the best the 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.170
 lasts the moon of the cranes that has 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.299
 radio seems to me the most perfect of this 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.730
 doubt is having to have your team of 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.879
 sound and more if it's not Peruvian music 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.160
 well now we have what is the pack 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.380
 to see 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.030
 the pac at the time of lighting it is going to 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.940
 vote this configuration this 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.970
 configuration like this you exhausted efe 4 is for 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.920
 what is this plugin everything can not 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.540
 Look for example 10 and 4 we're going to 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.780
 teach everything that is nib that nib 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.820
 you are using key and if you are using 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.720
 sling there will you vote everything 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.720
 what is not 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.229
 already the f5 for example is if you're 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.220
 wearing the blooming or not I'm not 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:38.490
 wearing I do not have it on f1 is cats already 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.889
 gata gatas not know 100% on 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.860
 tire wheels you know now 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:49.550
 there it is here is for the returns of the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.510
 Forwarding but 1 2 3 4 5 I have 6 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.780
 lines so you already know they give you enter 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.480
 and it will look like what the position is 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.800
 of the feather 51% and the two small ones 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.540
 50% I'm in covers there that side 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.940
 when you are in uve front or is it 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.910
 front you mark the fy there you can pine 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.580
 it already sends you what is radio capacity and 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.740
 all that is not all everything that 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.950
 such mode reads the turtle mode of the pen 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.840
 now if you give one later you're going 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.060
 send when you move from to send 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.730
 the revolutions per minute for this one by 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.740
 minute that they can if you're in the 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.950
 another one back to front first 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.950
 second third and the mile per hour and in 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.449
 what is this heat and the pressure of 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.909
 oil 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.860
 good the limitations that you want 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:42.469
 suddenly do not you do not want to throw 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.080
 pens to such a degree radius height you 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.389
 teaches not in rotation teaches you and you go 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.849
 changing clear that it is not convenient 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.550
 give yourself in these things because later you 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.800
 they block the machine and you have a problem 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:00.050
 good that 's 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.930
 almost everything is terex 2014 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.990
 we have what not 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.470
 as the hand that the indicators what 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.440
 It is indicators of 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.050
 the usual locks 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.340
 and good nothing else this is all 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.560
 tutorial terex 75 tons 2014 carlos 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.340
 to the wine from the silent for all the 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.340
 cool people
