a<00:01:44.040> good<00:01:44.369> question<00:01:44.850> after<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.810> just

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
a good question after all it is just

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.569 
a good question after all it is just
folding<00:01:47.840> but<00:01:48.840> other<00:01:49.110> than<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.220> more

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
folding but other than that it is more

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.819 
folding but other than that it is more
convenient<00:01:51.000> after<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.079> take<00:01:52.619> it

that if right now there's nothing
protruding<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.239> side<00:02:55.480> because<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
protruding to the side because the the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.000 
protruding to the side because the the
cover<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.500> bit<00:02:59.830> ball<00:03:00.489> job<00:03:00.819> here<00:03:01.319> but<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.680> can

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
cover is a bit ball job here but you can

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.220 
cover is a bit ball job here but you can
hold<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.940> type<00:03:04.209> properly<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.959> want<00:03:05.080> to

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
hold it to type properly you want to

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.050 
hold it to type properly you want to
flatten<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.890> whole<00:03:06.010> cover<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.580> but<00:03:06.849> when<00:03:06.970> you

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
flatten the whole cover so but when you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.900 
flatten the whole cover so but when you
flatten<00:03:07.360> all<00:03:07.660> cover<00:03:07.959> see<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.280> piece<00:03:09.549> juts

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
flatten all cover see this piece juts

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.190 
flatten all cover see this piece juts
out<00:03:10.120> or<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:12.130> piece<00:03:12.430> juts<00:03:12.910> out<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.510> it

out or this piece juts out and it

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.380 
out or this piece juts out and it
becomes<00:03:14.950> with<00:03:15.310> irritating<00:03:16.090> when<00:03:16.209> you're

trying to type on the in portrait mode

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.920 
trying to type on the in portrait mode
so<00:03:19.480> do<00:03:19.930> be<00:03:20.170> aware<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.829> that<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.820> other<00:03:22.269> thing

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
so do be aware of that the other thing

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.170 
so do be aware of that the other thing
that<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.470> have<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.920> slight<00:03:24.310> problem<00:03:24.459> years<00:03:25.180> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
that I have a slight problem years the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.809 
that I have a slight problem years the
because<00:03:28.180> they<00:03:28.420> need<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.989> give<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.069> inner

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
because they need to give it the inner

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.430 
because they need to give it the inner
these<00:03:31.269> are<00:03:31.450> little<00:03:31.900> pieces<00:03:32.819> inside<00:03:34.410> there<00:03:35.410> are

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
these are little pieces inside there are

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.720 
these are little pieces inside there are
hot<00:03:35.709> pieces<00:03:35.980> inside<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.790> malabar<00:03:37.420> cover

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
hot pieces inside the malabar cover

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.539 
hot pieces inside the malabar cover
because<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.880> these<00:03:40.090> moving<00:03:41.019> these<00:03:42.010> moving

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
because of these moving these moving

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.349 
because of these moving these moving
foldable<00:03:43.540> parts<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.650> thing<00:03:45.010> feels<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.180> bit

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
foldable parts the thing feels a bit

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.259 
foldable parts the thing feels a bit
flimsy<00:03:47.350> when<00:03:47.560> you're<00:03:47.739> holding<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.700> guess

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
flimsy when you're holding it I guess

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.309 
flimsy when you're holding it I guess
it's<00:03:49.420> just<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.660> personal<00:03:50.109> feeling<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.709> probably

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
it's just a personal feeling is probably

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.840 
it's just a personal feeling is probably
gonna<00:03:53.319> hold<00:03:53.769> up<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:54.280> like<00:03:54.400> any<00:03:54.519> other

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
gonna hold up just like any other

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.809 
gonna hold up just like any other
silicon<00:03:55.510> cover<00:03:55.840> but<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.889> other<00:03:57.100> issue<00:03:57.370> here

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
silicon cover but the other issue here

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.259 
silicon cover but the other issue here
is<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.200> way<00:03:59.410> it<00:03:59.470> bends<00:04:00.269> because

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
is that the the way it bends because

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:08.610 
is that the the way it bends because
it's<00:04:01.690> bending<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:06.720> no<00:04:07.720> I'm<00:04:07.870> not<00:04:08.019> sure<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.380> see

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
it's bending in no I'm not sure you see

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.710 
it's bending in no I'm not sure you see
that<00:04:08.650> because<00:04:08.980> it's<00:04:09.250> bending<00:04:09.579> in<00:04:09.910> on<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.359> on

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
that because it's bending in on the on

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.650 
that because it's bending in on the on
the<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.380> folding<00:04:11.829> points<00:04:12.280> yeah<00:04:13.180> there's

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
the the folding points yeah there's

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.120 
the the folding points yeah there's
actually<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:14.170> lot<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:15.479> the<00:04:16.479> your<00:04:16.889> there's<00:04:17.889> lost

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
actually a lot of the your there's lost

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.440 
actually a lot of the your there's lost
stress<00:04:18.729> creator<00:04:19.239> on<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.720> material<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.240> if<00:04:22.240> we

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
stress creator on the material so if we

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.830 
stress creator on the material so if we
look<00:04:22.659> at<00:04:22.870> it

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
look at it

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.860 
look at it
it<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:25.040> possible<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:26.080> after<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> while<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:28.870> can

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
it is possible that after a while I can

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.670 
it is possible that after a while I can
try<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.530> focus<00:04:30.889> on<00:04:31.340> this<00:04:31.550> thing<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:33.470> is

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
try to focus on this thing it is

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.629 
try to focus on this thing it is
possible<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.310> after<00:04:34.550> wow<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.800> areas

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
possible that after wow you the areas

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.180 
possible that after wow you the areas
which<00:04:38.030> have<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.600> day<00:04:39.290> with<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.680> folding

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
which have the day with the folding

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.570 
which have the day with the folding
areas<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:41.270> mostly<00:04:41.750> see<00:04:41.960> some<00:04:42.590> sort<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:43.010> stress

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
areas you mostly see some sort of stress

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.250 
areas you mostly see some sort of stress
max<00:04:44.380> start<00:04:45.380> appearing<00:04:45.740> on<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:47.110> might<00:04:48.110> look

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
max start appearing on it and might look

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.490 
max start appearing on it and might look
ugly<00:04:48.950> it<00:04:49.700> might<00:04:50.000> look<00:04:50.540> less<00:04:50.840> than<00:04:51.139> less<00:04:51.470> than

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
ugly it might look less than less than

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.380 
ugly it might look less than less than
perfect<00:04:52.360> after<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.389> few<00:04:53.780> months<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.169> usage<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:55.520> a
