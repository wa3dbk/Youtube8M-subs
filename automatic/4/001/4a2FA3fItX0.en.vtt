00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
can it's smart though it knows where

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.800 
can it's smart though it knows where
you're<00:01:43.530> at<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.070> then<00:01:44.670> it'll<00:01:44.939> take<00:01:45.270> shots<00:01:45.600> at

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
