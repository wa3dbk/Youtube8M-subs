 While holding monkey monkey mouth 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.710
 Asaishi

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.700
 Tteyuu Neau one solution 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.899

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.899
 Not turned 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.270
 What Since Well equivalent It is a little balance 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.270

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.530
 The iterator to Monkey near from more evening 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.000

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.990
 Nde was going to say was a back injury 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.770
 Really vertical condition 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.790

 There are places where I want to strike more 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.010
 It became a kind of operation 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.190
 Well 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.190

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.549
 March 3 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.549
 Kedomo it was Kofu Metropolitan of the game 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.070
 that 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.379
 It is somehow N' 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.800
 It can be accumulated in this way 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.540
 The result is not- 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.640
 Maa's 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.170
 Re Ramare Ttero 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.850
 Of his first issuing million copies 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.950
 We'll hesitation Nde was able to issue a so-so 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.130
 Dash until March 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.210
 Very good start 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.210
 I'm out, but 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:59.130
 After all that's up and running, I was able to get rid of it in the second half 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.470
 Bancho of poison dart 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.319
 I'm selling it because it's an interesting bund 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.689
 Well set up 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.689
 Yes it seems that the Bancho 2 setting is likely to enter 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.050
 Go and 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.050
 2nd place to go back 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.099
 Well, I was able to do the second half quite well though 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.969
 Somehow positive 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.830
 Thing I Sissi head 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.729
 I am doing it 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.169
 The game is good 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:42.819
 Is it really the beat of that life? 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.819
 I should have done that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.090
 Why is it the attraction of one shot 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.139
 Temptation 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.139
 And it has opened 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:01.169
 It is said to beat the leader 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.169
 The favor from the life I owed Ebasura bus 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.580
 Though it is not done 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.840
 Well 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.040

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.000
 Heart beat of life 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.569
 I think a little about 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.200
 I wrote a lot in blogs, but 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.780
 Oh if you go 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.780
 The final maybe compared to ever Eva 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:33.599
 Do you say that the attraction is a bit thin 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.599
 Screen is beautiful and produces 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.230
 Many are good but 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.960
 After all, please come to the board system 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.529
 It is good to know synchro replay city 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.009
 Oh no 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.009
 Ummm 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.990
 I'm fine 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.990
 This is 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.030

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:06.360

 For me it's kinda 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.500
 Though it is r to tend to circle 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.849
 While saying such a thing 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.540
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:32.529
 100 games that's over, though 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.430
 I wonder if I want to turn it a little 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:37.030

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.030

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.730
