so I'm off to brizl again get some

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.699 
so I'm off to brizl again get some
consoles<00:03:53.379> so<00:03:54.209> same<00:03:55.209> as<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.450> last<00:03:55.719> two<00:03:56.349> lots<00:03:56.590> of

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
consoles so same as the last two lots of

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.059 
consoles so same as the last two lots of
episodes<00:03:57.389> we<00:03:58.389> just<00:03:58.569> see<00:03:58.719> I'll<00:03:59.709> probably<00:03:59.889> do

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
episodes we just see I'll probably do

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.289 
episodes we just see I'll probably do
this<00:04:00.450> film<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:02.340> one<00:04:03.340> more<00:04:03.519> trick<00:04:03.760> maybe<00:04:04.000> I

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
this film it one more trick maybe I

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.789 
this film it one more trick maybe I
think<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.810> can<00:04:04.930> probably<00:04:05.079> safely<00:04:05.440> say<00:04:05.769> that

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
think you can probably safely say that

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.580 
think you can probably safely say that
the<00:04:06.250> infrastructure<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:08.669> all<00:04:09.669> okay<00:04:10.470> most<00:04:11.470> of

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
the infrastructure is all okay most of

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.080 
the infrastructure is all okay most of
the<00:04:11.650> time<00:04:11.829> because<00:04:12.040> I'm<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.280> single<00:04:12.760> issue<00:04:12.849> with

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
the time because I'm a single issue with

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.789 
the time because I'm a single issue with
it<00:04:13.209> apart<00:04:13.479> one<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.019> charges<00:04:14.260> being<00:04:14.590> down

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
it apart one of the charges being down

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:15.960 
it apart one of the charges being down
but<00:04:14.979> there's<00:04:15.129> another<00:04:15.310> one<00:04:15.489> there<00:04:15.669> so<00:04:15.819> what's

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
but there's another one there so what's

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.969 
but there's another one there so what's
the<00:04:16.060> problem<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.690> then<00:04:16.900> subsequently<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.889> was

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
the problem and then subsequently it was

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.629 
the problem and then subsequently it was
fixed<00:04:18.250> within<00:04:18.459> two<00:04:18.820> weeks<00:04:18.940> anyway<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:20.639> all

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
fixed within two weeks anyway so all

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.790 
fixed within two weeks anyway so all
working<00:04:22.150> fine<00:04:22.479> there's<00:04:23.199> been<00:04:23.349> no<00:04:23.530> issues

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
working fine there's been no issues
