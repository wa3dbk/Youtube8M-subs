then<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> socks<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.829> a<00:02:24.920> little<00:02:25.190> heart<00:02:25.459> on

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
then the socks have a little heart on

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.380 
then the socks have a little heart on
the<00:02:27.290> bottom<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:28.610> want<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.849> take<00:02:29.000> them<00:02:29.180> off<00:02:29.360> so

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
the bottom you want to take them off so

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.490 
the bottom you want to take them off so
that<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.959> check<00:02:30.170> out<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.900> they<00:02:32.900> also<00:02:33.079> told

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
that I can check out and they also told

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.020 
that I can check out and they also told
me<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.739> if<00:02:33.829> you<00:02:33.950> replace<00:02:34.280> one<00:02:34.549> limb<00:02:34.790> they

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
me that if you replace one limb they

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.220 
me that if you replace one limb they
match<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.540> other<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:35.959> if<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
match the other so if you have a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.759 
match the other so if you have a
pleasant<00:02:36.620> company<00:02:36.799> limb<00:02:37.310> they<00:02:38.060> won't<00:02:38.389> put<00:02:38.840> one

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
pleasant company limb they won't put one

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.379 
pleasant company limb they won't put one
limb<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.160> doesn't<00:02:40.579> match<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:40.970> guess<00:02:41.209> they

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
limb that doesn't match so I guess they

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.140 
limb that doesn't match so I guess they
must<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.840> fair<00:02:42.260> supply<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:43.400> her<00:02:43.549> torso<00:02:43.819> is

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
must have a fair supply but her torso is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.580 
must have a fair supply but her torso is

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
doll hospital they told me that more

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.140 
doll hospital they told me that more
than<00:03:19.099> likely<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.459> looked<00:03:19.609> like<00:03:19.700> our<00:03:19.819> hair<00:03:20.000> had

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
than likely it looked like our hair had

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.789 
than likely it looked like our hair had
been<00:03:20.180> blow-dried<00:03:20.720> or<00:03:20.930> like<00:03:21.079> flat<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.470> under

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
been blow-dried or like flat I under

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.890 
been blow-dried or like flat I under
something<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.340> guess<00:03:22.880> they<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:23.299> tell<00:03:23.510> if<00:03:23.690> it's

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
something I guess they can tell if it's

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.420 
something I guess they can tell if it's
been<00:03:24.079> something's<00:03:24.680> been<00:03:24.799> done<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.160> higher

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
been something's been done to a higher

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.199 
been something's been done to a higher
idea<00:03:25.970> but<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.680> definitely<00:03:27.859> curlier<00:03:28.669> and<00:03:29.060> a

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
idea but it's definitely curlier and a

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.699 
idea but it's definitely curlier and a
little<00:03:29.450> bit<00:03:29.569> thicker<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.959> think<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.380> other<00:03:30.500> wig

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.039 
little bit thicker I think the other wig
was<00:03:30.889> just<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.280> tiny<00:03:31.489> bit<00:03:31.700> thinner<00:03:31.970> but<00:03:32.840> she's
