00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
just because if you make it to light

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
just because if you make it to light
it's<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> show<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.880> rather

have it darker than just a little bit
lighter<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.869> a

so<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.579> doesn't<00:01:47.850> tug<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.119> hair<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
so it doesn't tug on your hair so this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
so it doesn't tug on your hair so this
is<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.310> my<00:01:50.430> hair<00:01:50.610> looks<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.810> silver

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
is what my hair looks like it's a silver

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.980 
is what my hair looks like it's a silver
color<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:53.189> does<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.790> purple<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.570> but

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
color it does have some purple to it but

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.170 
color it does have some purple to it but
I'd<00:01:55.290> rather<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.950> add<00:01:56.219> some<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:56.670> purple<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
I'd rather just add some more purple to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
I'd rather just add some more purple to
see<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.750> difference<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:59.040> i'm<00:01:59.280> just

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
see to see a difference now i'm just

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.920 
see to see a difference now i'm just
going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.759> massaging<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
going to be massaging the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.140 
going to be massaging the
Commissioner<00:02:01.800> with<00:02:02.010> a<00:02:02.040> guy<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.580> my<00:02:02.610> hair<00:02:03.120> and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
Commissioner with a guy in my hair and

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.630 
Commissioner with a guy in my hair and
then<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.320> does<00:02:04.590> look<00:02:04.830> like<00:02:05.010> it's<00:02:05.280> not

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
then is that it does look like it's not

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.880 
then is that it does look like it's not
light<00:02:05.970> enough<00:02:06.000> or<00:02:06.570> dark<00:02:06.810> enough<00:02:07.050> but

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
light enough or dark enough but

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.980 
light enough or dark enough but
eventually<00:02:08.399> you'll<00:02:08.789> see<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> difference<00:02:09.509> as<00:02:09.660> it

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
eventually you'll see a difference as it

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.110 
eventually you'll see a difference as it
processes<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.100> color<00:02:11.340> will<00:02:11.580> start<00:02:11.940> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
processes that the color will start to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:22.270 
processes that the color will start to
show<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.750> then<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.980> will<00:02:14.100> be<00:02:14.250> loved

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.980 

I<00:02:23.860> tend<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.190> gradually<00:02:25.760> add<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.330> guys

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
I tend to just gradually add the guys

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.230 
I tend to just gradually add the guys
from<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> top<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.770> my<00:02:28.160> scalp<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.910> bottom

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
from the top of my scalp to the bottom

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.120 
from the top of my scalp to the bottom
of<00:02:29.360> my<00:02:29.540> roof<00:02:29.780> just<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.230> make<00:02:30.530> sure<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.770> have

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
of my roof just so I make sure I have

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.520 
of my roof just so I make sure I have
full<00:02:31.400> coverage<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.720> also<00:02:32.870> important<00:02:33.470> to

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
full coverage but it's also important to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.650 
full coverage but it's also important to
make<00:02:33.709> sure<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:34.069> have<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.340> die<00:02:34.700> at<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.270> ends

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
make sure you have the die at the ends

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.800 
make sure you have the die at the ends
just<00:02:35.900> because<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:37.640> tends<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.240> fade<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
just because it tends to fade the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.770 
just because it tends to fade the
fastest<00:02:39.290> at<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.650> bottom<00:02:40.069> or<00:02:40.280> just<00:02:40.940> me<00:02:41.150> I'm<00:02:41.510> not

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
fastest at the bottom or just me I'm not

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.229 
fastest at the bottom or just me I'm not
really<00:02:41.959> sure<00:02:42.080> but<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:43.580> would<00:02:43.700> rather<00:02:43.850> be<00:02:44.030> safe

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
really sure but it would rather be safe

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.850 
really sure but it would rather be safe
than<00:02:44.270> sorry<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.810> then<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:45.260> blends<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.680> lot

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
than sorry and then it just blends a lot

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:58.220 
than sorry and then it just blends a lot
better

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.890 

you<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:59.069> tell<00:02:59.280> there's<00:03:00.150> you're<00:03:00.510> starting<00:03:00.810> to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you can tell there's you're starting to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.570 
you can tell there's you're starting to
see<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.050> difference<00:03:01.560> from<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.830> purple<00:03:02.340> where

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
see a difference from the purple where

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.550 
see a difference from the purple where
it<00:03:02.700> looks<00:03:02.909> really<00:03:03.090> light<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.720> now<00:03:04.379> it's

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
it looks really light and now it's

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.229 
it looks really light and now it's
starting<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> process<00:03:05.159> so<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:05.879> starting<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
starting the process so it's starting to

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.180 
starting the process so it's starting to
get<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.390> little<00:03:06.540> bit<00:03:06.690> darker<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.920> going

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
get a little bit darker and that's going

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.490 
get a little bit darker and that's going
to<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.610> color<00:03:08.849> that<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.390> want<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.049> get<00:03:10.230> for

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
to be the color that I want to get for

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:35.110 
to be the color that I want to get for
my<00:03:10.650> lavender<00:03:11.010> hair

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.880 

no<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.569> what<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.810> looks<00:03:36.959> like<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.380> then

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
no this is what it looks like and then

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.010 
no this is what it looks like and then
afterwards<00:03:38.490> I'm<00:03:38.849> just<00:03:39.060> gonna<00:03:39.180> put<00:03:39.450> on<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.660> cap

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
afterwards I'm just gonna put on a cap

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.589 
afterwards I'm just gonna put on a cap
and<00:03:40.290> then<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.280> let<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.550> process<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:42.390> about

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
and then just let it process for about

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:49.180 
and then just let it process for about
an<00:03:42.780> hour<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.950> pretty<00:03:44.280> much<00:03:44.340> just<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:45.000> silly

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.730 

so<00:03:50.060> now<00:03:50.240> these<00:03:50.390> look<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.170> result<00:03:51.380> of

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
so now these look this is the result of

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.970 
so now these look this is the result of
