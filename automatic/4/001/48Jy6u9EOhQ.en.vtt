00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.740 
we go we just have the camera panel that
I<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.790> put<00:02:05.969> on

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
I just put on

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.960 
I just put on
mm-hmm<00:02:08.750> now<00:02:09.379> here's<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.979> bottom<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.759> back

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
mm-hmm now here's the bottom of the back

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:23.970 
mm-hmm now here's the bottom of the back
and<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:14.060> line<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.450> up<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:19.730> so

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.670 

they're<00:02:24.980> actually<00:02:25.280> fairly<00:02:25.489> simple<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.000> put<00:02:26.180> on

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
they're actually fairly simple to put on

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.190 
they're actually fairly simple to put on
and<00:02:27.680> that's<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:29.209> now<00:02:29.720> we're<00:02:29.870> done<00:02:29.959> with<00:02:30.019> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
and that's that now we're done with the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.170 
and that's that now we're done with the
back<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:31.099> that's<00:02:31.370> what<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.580> back<00:02:31.730> looks<00:02:31.760> like

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
back so that's what the back looks like

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.610 
back so that's what the back looks like
and<00:02:32.930> now<00:02:33.349> we<00:02:33.410> have<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:34.040> piece<00:02:34.549> for<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.849> front

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
and now we have one piece for the front

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.720 
and now we have one piece for the front
this<00:02:36.620> might<00:02:36.830> take<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.069> little<00:02:37.160> more<00:02:37.400> work

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
this might take a little more work

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.759 
this might take a little more work
because<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:38.540> flimsy<00:02:39.130> that's<00:02:40.130> okay<00:02:44.769> there

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
because it's so flimsy that's okay there

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.479 
because it's so flimsy that's okay there
we<00:02:45.860> go<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:48.170> can<00:02:48.380> see<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.829> can<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.190> align

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
we go and you can see you can just align

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.410 
we go and you can see you can just align
this<00:02:49.670> up<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:51.790> there<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.940> indicator

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
this up with the there the indicator

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.890 
this up with the there the indicator
light<00:02:53.690> LED<00:02:54.200> or<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.769> speaker<00:02:55.190> hole<00:02:55.340> or<00:02:55.579> both

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
light LED or the speaker hole or both

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.030 
light LED or the speaker hole or both
that<00:02:56.900> works<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:59.290> go<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.530> line<00:03:00.799> that<00:03:00.829> up<00:03:01.090> and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
that works so go just line that up and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.240 
that works so go just line that up and
it<00:03:04.040> should<00:03:04.489> fit<00:03:04.970> perfectly<00:03:05.950> if<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.099> work

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
it should fit perfectly if the work

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.009 
it should fit perfectly if the work
around<00:03:07.579> it<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.790> little<00:03:07.970> bit<00:03:08.209> just<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.840> make<00:03:08.989> sure

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
around it a little bit just to make sure

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.440 
around it a little bit just to make sure
that<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.950> keys<00:03:10.220> are<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.519> place<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:10.849> keys<00:03:11.329> are
