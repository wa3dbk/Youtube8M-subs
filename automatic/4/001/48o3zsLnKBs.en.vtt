00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.580
 cowardice of the guest 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.050
 they could have avoided the artist 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.250
 if kairat nurtas did not come out and sang 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.190
 little song and left the stage 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.309

 there were cases when artists and in heavy 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.420
 conditions sang and talk about what's in there 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.700

 when he was on stage except him 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.110
 no one was singing whether at the wedding and 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.509
 Sultan Nazarbayeva Kairat Nurtas or 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.200
 gave a concert in Aktau as he himself now 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.330
 approves 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.340
 left unexplained but quite 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.770
 the scenario looks obvious today 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.690
 future revolution in Kazakhstan and and will 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.670
 move non scientific staff and others 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.979

 that Kazakhstan is starting to live in a new way 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.429
 what happened after kazakhstan 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.679
 so what he was before can not be 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.720
 experience of recent decades has shown that 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.000
 make revolutions more effective by 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.700
 most energetic radical public 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.860

 waves of criticism in recent years very much 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.170
 afraid of powerful speeches below those 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.580
 more so even before the arab spring before 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.430

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.810
 to overthrow in 2010 in Kyrgyzstan 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 there was a powerful popular uprising 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.549
 which in general Nazarbayev is very clear 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.560
 showed his fate the concert of the people 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.409
