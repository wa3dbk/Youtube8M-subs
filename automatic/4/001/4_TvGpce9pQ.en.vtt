legitimate question Bank conquest is a
little<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:51.719> different<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:52.559> question

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
little bit different from other question

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.310 
little bit different from other question
banks<00:00:53.460> where<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.149> felt<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.600> some<00:00:54.899> question

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
banks where as I felt like some question

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500 
banks where as I felt like some question
makes<00:00:55.530> were<00:00:55.710> merely<00:00:56.010> diagnostic<00:00:57.000> tools<00:00:57.239> I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
makes were merely diagnostic tools I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.119 
makes were merely diagnostic tools I
felt<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.079> mostly<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> learning<00:00:58.980> tool

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
felt like it was mostly a learning tool

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
felt like it was mostly a learning tool
and<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.820> what<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> quite<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> good

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and and that's what a quite a good

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.290 
and and that's what a quite a good
question<00:01:01.079> Bank<00:01:01.289> should<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:02.059> conquest<00:01:03.059> has

question Bank should be conquest has

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810 
question Bank should be conquest has
fewer<00:01:03.719> questions<00:01:03.989> than<00:01:04.710> any<00:01:05.070> other<00:01:05.339> question

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
fewer questions than any other question

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.530 
fewer questions than any other question
Bank<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.390> found<00:01:06.810> meaning<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:08.159> there<00:01:08.340> was

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
like 2400 questions so conquest prides

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.450 
like 2400 questions so conquest prides
themselves<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.350> having<00:01:16.830> fewer<00:01:17.189> questions

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
themselves in in having fewer questions

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.490 
themselves in in having fewer questions
that<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.030> higher<00:01:18.240> quality<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> reason

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that are higher quality and the reason

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
that are higher quality and the reason

used as a learning tool than a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.140 
used as a learning tool than a
diagnostic<00:01:24.240> tool<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.500> question

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
diagnostic tool because the question

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.670 
diagnostic tool because the question
descriptions<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.390> fleshed<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.380> I
