00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.510
 Well, what are you waiting for? 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.260
 are very well here I am already in another 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.800
 video commenting on and for this video 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.279
 I wanted to show you what armor is 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.439
 of the blades and his dragon sword 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.170
 come on 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.469
 these can be found only if they 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.199
 like to look for a lot of good not so much but 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.640
 you can overlook the first 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.930
 what we are going to do is go Arab 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.100
 skype in a temple 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.100
 I think they are called 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.970
 great we hope 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.509
 ok once here already 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.790
 again we will have to enter the temple 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.210
 good because we were practically in 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 the entrance 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.990
 once here 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.600
 or some strange 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.050
 there on the table we went to the left 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.080
 and here on this wooden table there is 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.240
 find dragon come and I appear 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.140
 steal because here are the blades 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.570
 but if you are just in this 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.070
 mission will seem to get it 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.899
 without stealing it and in this chest here as 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.970
 can see is all the armor of the 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.970
 blades you are with a shield 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:22.620
 and now 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.620
 here looking for if they could be forged 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.000
 here look at this if you can what 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.000
 they need are steel ingots 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.900
 ok for the dragon 20 what they need is 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.439
 quiksilver in god's be an ingot of 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.439
 mercury 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.480
 and as you see the whole set is very 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.830
 but very nice I loved it and this 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.610
 it would be all in this video 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.610
 thank you very much for watching and as always 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.610
