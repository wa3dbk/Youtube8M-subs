00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 how come to the next tutorial the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.140
 trust 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.340
 here we work with dumbbells or 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.790
 with long trade you can do that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.790
 choose 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.760
 we'll show you the grid first 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.189
 the short antl the pomace consists of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.740
 Two exercises once the front squat 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.189
 deep front knee bend so very down 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.800
 goes and that push out two exercise us 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.559
 show us first the front squat 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 right here takes the dumbbells 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.940
 Body tension is built up 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.989
 the elbows are a bit high and accurate 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.079
 Now you make the front first 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.520
 knee bend down weight shifting 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.110
 just like a normal squat 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.440
 But the weight is just ahead 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.600
 all the way down and now you shoot high 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 and that's the only thing it comes across 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.070
 come down again and back up 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.379
 important is to push that weight 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.550
 also behind the ears gets too 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.699
 again for the agility of the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.199
 shoulder and on the way down the ryck 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.540
 Do not stretch but the errors 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.640
 we show you again and again 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.010
 up and down again and now 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.350
 a bit more fluid and working here 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.320
 again the whole body many big ones 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.740
 Muscle explosive is also with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.280
 in it exactly nicely liquid work kind 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.810
 made that very fast before and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.390
 respects also back on it that they 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.000
 do not come too far forward but 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.180
 that they are really stable in the back since 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.920
 exactly 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.740
 ok then we come to the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.290
 trust that with the barbell the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.600
 starting position is exactly the same as us 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.450
 are about feet hip-feet are 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.610
 turned slightly outwards 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.009
 rating of the are the front squat 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.759
 position a bit wider from above 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.439
 start december at exactly the elbows 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.170
 what we should have learned already 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.770
 be as high as possible 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.079
 weight shift as I said behind 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.750
 on the heel now you are once in 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.630
 the deep squat takes the momentum 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.489
 with and pushes out and the poor 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.360
 should be said behind the ears 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.269
 are located 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:20.099
 the whole thing twice now deep 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:22.760
 Lower kneecap with ejection and 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.760
 drop 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.530
 so does the optimum trust than thinking 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.480
 It's always an exclusive exercise 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.249
 He really should, however 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.299
 Make sure that the technology always 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.540
 otherwise it was true 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.519
 Risk of injury very high with something 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.680
 less weight if you are sure 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.129
 Feel free to work with the cinema 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.849
 piece by piece up and then 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.849
 should that fit 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.450
 Another small tip from me 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.450
 push your head forward , for example 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.010
 so the back stays nice and straight 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.080
 exactly and as me already said that 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.260
 really has little weight at first 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.360
 take and do the exercise correctly 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.550
 Run clean and in our system 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.930
 Can you decide if we can handle it? 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.710
 the barbell makes or with the post 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.530
 made 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.420
 You have seen pm videos or you can see 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.720
 nor that we do that with the dumbbells 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.880
 but you can do it okay again 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.950
 thank you so much for practicing with us 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.110
 barbell ipm system 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.220
 we hope we could give you some reason 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.170
 help 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.240
 Of course I try with my team 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.770
 and to support regularly and also 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.110
 some more videos for you too 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.130
 Turn so that you have better than even 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.090
 be more powerful 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.090
 Many Thanks
