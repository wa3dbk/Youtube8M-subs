00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.800

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.110
 bicycle that walks 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.410
 I have to confess I do not know how to walk in 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.410
 bicycle my name is 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.590

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.590
 demon machine and leave me alone 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.340
 it seems that someone needs some classes 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.840
 of pedaling that you say bo you take it or 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.420

 [Music] 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.050
 with these wheels you will easily learn 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.270
 and now to practice hockey 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.990
 and so I began my slow learning 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.369
 cyclic 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.369

 [Music] 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.840
 you're ready juan carlos welcome to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.250
 means of transport that does not pollute or 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.650
 produces noise that helps 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.640
 decongest the city and do more 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.190
 healthy 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.770
 and my first pedals were in a 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.350
 quiet bike path 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.119
 a bicycle costs on average 30 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.310
 times less than a car and it's 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.429
 infinitely cheaper to maintain 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.129
 also it does not use fuel so it does not 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.050
 dirty the air 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.690
 where they park auto fit eighteen 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.370
 bicycles and even though it does not look like it is more 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.920
 anger that a car in short distances 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.959
 since it avoids congestion but what 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.870
 better is to constantly walk in 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.299
 bicycle stimulates your metabolism 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.209
 improving your health considerably what 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.030
 that you say freddy until the short walk 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.700
 the bike lanes are over and our only 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.110
 alternative was to advance dangerously 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.110
 between the cars and the glasses 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.010
 in a city like santiago 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.709
 unfortunately there is no culture 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.660
 ciclística there are few bikeways no 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.519
 to park bicycles and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.239
 drivers do not respect cyclists 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.239
 way that 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.630
 part of my way idiots today 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.310
 late to my good meeting 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.290
 quiet citizens this can not be 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.719
 freddy let's talk to the mayor not 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.989
 and tell this pelafustán that I need 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:12.030
 my washing machine for urgent washing but 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.000
 if you are silly and stupid with your helmets 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.099
 ridicules that are offered to you not be the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.900
 funny mister mayor I come in 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.209
 representation of all cyclists of 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.430
 the city ​​to demand that it encourage the use 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.189
 of the bicycle and build bicycle paths 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.680
 happy I would but I have to sleep my 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:32.040
 third nap of the day permit 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.799
 we better go fresh 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.750
 maybe in the future the authorities will 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.060
 realize how fundamental it can be 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.430
 be the massive use of the bicycle for 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.650
 live in healthier cities by 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.629
 while the best thing is to preach with the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.609
 example, I think I should follow only Freddy 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.129
 thank you very much for your teachings 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.200
 responsible bodoque always wear the helmet 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.720
 do not get in the way of the cars 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.069
 do not listen to music while pedaling and 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.470
 remember that at night you will be 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.079
 practically invisible so you must 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.439
 use the different reflective a lot 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.920
 Luckily we soon see was a good 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.920
 rabbit 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.390
 while pedaling a feeling of 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.610
 infinite seized me could not 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.310
 stop my body was filled with 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.579
 oxygen and my old bones rejuvenated 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:27.268
