that<00:01:43.770> those<00:01:43.979> SSDs<00:01:44.790> use<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> MDOT<00:01:45.720> 2<00:01:45.899> interface

coating but the GS 60 actually both of
them<00:02:27.970> not<00:02:28.180> sure<00:02:28.330> you're<00:02:28.510> talking<00:02:28.599> about

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
them not sure you're talking about

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.080 
them not sure you're talking about
wheels<00:02:29.080> they<00:02:29.290> both<00:02:29.560> use<00:02:30.010> an<00:02:30.280> IPS<00:02:31.060> panel

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
wheels they both use an IPS panel

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.620 
wheels they both use an IPS panel
whereas<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.170> GS<00:02:32.410> 60<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.220> also<00:02:33.940> using<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.360> new

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780

rest area than most laptops the reason
for<00:03:26.079> that<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.650> they<00:03:26.890> have<00:03:27.100> cooling<00:03:27.670> vents<00:03:28.000> up

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
for that is they have cooling vents up

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.640 
for that is they have cooling vents up
in<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.420> tops<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> notebooks<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.380> keep

them<00:03:29.859> running<00:03:30.040> quite<00:03:30.579> cool<00:03:30.880> in<00:03:30.910> spite<00:03:31.329> of

them running quite cool in spite of
their<00:03:31.600> slimness<00:03:31.900> they<00:03:32.560> both<00:03:32.799> use<00:03:33.100> six<00:03:33.670> cell

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
their slimness they both use six cell

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.910 
their slimness they both use six cell
batteries<00:03:34.420> so<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.660> GS<00:03:34.870> 60<00:03:35.140> has<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> 52<00:03:35.769> watt

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
batteries so the GS 60 has a 52 watt

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.770 
batteries so the GS 60 has a 52 watt
hour<00:03:36.100> battery<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.640> GS<00:03:36.850> 70<00:03:37.120> has<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.239> 60<00:03:37.660> watt

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
hour battery the GS 70 has a 60 watt

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.229 
hour battery the GS 70 has a 60 watt
hour<00:03:37.930> battery<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.829> they<00:03:39.459> actually<00:03:39.700> use<00:03:40.090> the

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
hour battery and they actually use the

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.160 
hour battery and they actually use the
same<00:03:40.480> AC<00:03:41.250> adapter<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.850> it's<00:03:43.450> kind<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.840> like<00:03:44.139> a

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
same AC adapter so it's kind of like a

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.500 
same AC adapter so it's kind of like a
thin<00:03:44.560> but<00:03:44.799> still<00:03:45.040> quite<00:03:45.340> large<00:03:45.790> power<00:03:46.269> brick

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510

these<00:03:46.660> are<00:03:46.810> some<00:03:47.019> serious<00:03:47.350> then<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.340> light

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
these are some serious then in light

these are some serious then in light
notebooks<00:03:49.000> but<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.420> me<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:50.049> GS<00:03:50.350> 60<00:03:50.739> is

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
notebooks but to me the GS 60 is

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.410 
notebooks but to me the GS 60 is
probably<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.459> more<00:03:51.579> exciting<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.209> two

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
probably the more exciting of the two

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.900 
probably the more exciting of the two
which<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.690> guess<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.079> why<00:03:53.319> MSI<00:03:54.220> had<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.579> as<00:03:54.700> like

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
which I guess is why MSI had it as like

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.210 
which I guess is why MSI had it as like
their<00:03:55.090> super-secret<00:03:55.870> project<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.799> uses<00:03:57.130> a
