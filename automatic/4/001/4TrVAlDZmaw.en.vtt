heard earlier in the week about it being

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.230 
heard earlier in the week about it being
a<00:00:28.480> war<00:00:28.720> war<00:00:28.930> one<00:00:29.200> setting<00:00:29.590> let's<00:00:30.070> complete<00:00:30.400> do

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
a war war one setting let's complete do

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.270 
a war war one setting let's complete do
do<00:00:31.419> this<00:00:32.230> game<00:00:32.529> is<00:00:32.800> going<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.790> be<00:00:33.940> based<00:00:34.630> off

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
do this game is going to be based off

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.500 
do this game is going to be based off
futuristic<00:00:36.280> warfare<00:00:36.940> which<00:00:37.150> i<00:00:37.270> think<00:00:37.329> is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
futuristic warfare which i think is

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.910 
futuristic warfare which i think is
pretty<00:00:37.690> much<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:38.079> logical<00:00:38.500> way<00:00:38.650> to<00:00:38.710> go

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
pretty much the logical way to go

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.380 
pretty much the logical way to go
because<00:00:39.070> that's<00:00:39.280> what<00:00:39.430> most<00:00:39.640> first-person

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
because that's what most first-person

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.050 
because that's what most first-person
shooters<00:00:40.750> are<00:00:40.870> doing<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.290> of<00:00:41.860> course<00:00:42.060> they

an exciting thing to see so I'm not
really<00:01:03.280> sure<00:01:03.400> if<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:04.150> game's<00:01:04.390> gonna<00:01:04.540> hold<00:01:04.809> up

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
really sure if the game's gonna hold up

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.510 
really sure if the game's gonna hold up
to<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.170> hype<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.560> trailer<00:01:05.920> but<00:01:06.189> from<00:01:06.369> what

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
to the hype of the trailer but from what

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.219 
to the hype of the trailer but from what
I've<00:01:06.670> seen<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:07.060> looks<00:01:07.240> like<00:01:07.390> they're<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:08.110> know

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
I've seen it looks like they're you know

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.609 
I've seen it looks like they're you know
using<00:01:08.950> vehicles<00:01:09.520> all<00:01:10.390> kinds<00:01:10.869> of<00:01:10.960> new

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
using vehicles all kinds of new

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.080 
using vehicles all kinds of new
technology<00:01:12.280> in<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.490> game<00:01:12.640> which<00:01:12.790> hopefully

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
technology in the game which hopefully

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.599 
technology in the game which hopefully
will<00:01:13.479> go<00:01:13.689> into<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.170> actual<00:01:14.770> multiplayer<00:01:15.399> part

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
will go into the actual multiplayer part

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.639 
will go into the actual multiplayer part
of<00:01:15.759> it<00:01:15.880> which<00:01:16.390> seems<00:01:16.689> to<00:01:16.810> be<00:01:16.929> the<00:01:17.109> next<00:01:17.320> logical

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
of it which seems to be the next logical

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.289 
of it which seems to be the next logical
step<00:01:17.950> for<00:01:18.249> call<00:01:18.579> of<00:01:18.609> duty<00:01:18.909> if<00:01:18.969> they<00:01:19.060> want<00:01:19.270> to

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
step for call of duty if they want to

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.510 
step for call of duty if they want to
compete<00:01:19.509> with<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:20.039> new<00:01:21.039> games<00:01:21.310> like

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
compete with a new games like

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.550 
compete with a new games like
Battlefield<00:01:22.119> titanfall<00:01:22.780> things<00:01:23.229> like<00:01:23.380> that

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
Battlefield titanfall things like that

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.919 
Battlefield titanfall things like that
those<00:01:24.070> games<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:24.490> always<00:01:24.609> been<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.909> good<00:01:25.719> with

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
those games have always been a good with

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.319 
those games have always been a good with
using<00:01:26.200> vehicles<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:26.920> titanfall<00:01:27.399> just<00:01:28.149> being

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
using vehicles and titanfall just being

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.880 
using vehicles and titanfall just being
released<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.780> using<00:01:29.020> robots<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.619> things<00:01:29.770> like

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
released is using robots and things like

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.639 
released is using robots and things like
that<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.399> hopefully<00:01:31.359> this<00:01:31.539> they<00:01:31.780> will<00:01:31.960> learn

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
that so hopefully this they will learn

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.399 
that so hopefully this they will learn
their<00:01:32.890> lesson<00:01:33.310> maybe<00:01:33.939> and<00:01:34.240> hopefully<00:01:35.140> this

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
their lesson maybe and hopefully this

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.539 
their lesson maybe and hopefully this
game<00:01:35.560> will<00:01:35.649> be<00:01:35.740> really<00:01:35.979> good<00:01:36.219> hopefully

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
game will be really good hopefully

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.919 
game will be really good hopefully
they'll<00:01:36.819> fix<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.149> lot<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.420> bugs<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.780> were

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
they'll fix a lot of the bugs that were

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.629 
they'll fix a lot of the bugs that were
in<00:01:38.049> call<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.259> duty<00:01:38.380> ghosts<00:01:38.799> because<00:01:39.039> called<00:01:39.520> it

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
in call of duty ghosts because called it

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:43.200 
in call of duty ghosts because called it
egos<00:01:39.819> blows<00:01:40.240> but<00:01:41.079> sledgehammer<00:01:41.619> games<00:01:41.829> is<00:01:42.249> the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
egos blows but sledgehammer games is the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.139 
egos blows but sledgehammer games is the
main<00:01:43.450> company<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.770> was<00:01:44.950> helping<00:01:45.399> modern

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
main company that was helping modern

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.359 
main company that was helping modern
warfare<00:01:46.359> 3<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:47.619> hopefully<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.219> means

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
warfare 3 which hopefully that means

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.069 
warfare 3 which hopefully that means
that<00:01:48.639> this<00:01:48.759> will<00:01:48.999> have<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.389> same<00:01:49.749> great

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
that this will have the same great

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.800 
that this will have the same great
effect<00:01:50.469> as<00:01:50.649> modern<00:01:51.310> warfare<00:01:51.520> 3<00:01:51.700> did<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.420> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
effect as modern warfare 3 did and I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.620 
effect as modern warfare 3 did and I
loved<00:01:53.109> modern<00:01:53.409> warfare<00:01:53.590> 3<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.249> hopefully<00:01:54.670> this
