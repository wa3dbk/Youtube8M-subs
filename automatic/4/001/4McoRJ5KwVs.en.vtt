creature that lays the egg this is the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:56.980 
creature that lays the egg this is the
part<00:01:56.000> where<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.180> started<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.509> get<00:01:56.600> actually

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
part where I started to get actually

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.310 
part where I started to get actually
creative<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.530> start<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:57.799> make<00:01:57.950> my<00:01:58.070> own<00:01:58.100> thing

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
creative and start to make my own thing

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.450 
creative and start to make my own thing
there's<00:02:00.320> absolutely<00:02:00.740> no<00:02:00.890> reason<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.189> put<00:02:01.340> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
there's absolutely no reason to put the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.679 
there's absolutely no reason to put the
poison<00:02:01.670> spitter<00:02:02.090> at<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.299> front<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.509> your

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
poison spitter at the front of your

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.359 
poison spitter at the front of your
creature<00:02:02.990> at<00:02:03.619> this<00:02:03.860> stage<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.310> game

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
creature at this stage of the game

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.700 
creature at this stage of the game
because<00:02:04.909> what<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.390> actually<00:02:05.569> does<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:06.080> is<00:02:06.259> it

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
because what it actually does it is it

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.259 
because what it actually does it is it
makes<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:07.009> trail<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.399> poison<00:02:08.000> rather<00:02:08.179> than

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
makes a trail of poison rather than

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:23.380 
makes a trail of poison rather than
actually<00:02:08.660> spitting<00:02:09.019> it

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.520 

so<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.080> figure<00:02:24.350> okay<00:02:24.410> that's<00:02:25.040> unique<00:02:25.280> enough

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
so I figure okay that's unique enough

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.500 
so I figure okay that's unique enough
change<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.620> name<00:02:27.770> up<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.340> little<00:02:28.610> bit

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
change the name up just a little bit

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:40.900 
change the name up just a little bit
even<00:02:29.720> though<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.020> doesn't<00:02:30.170> even<00:02:30.319> matter

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.980 

again<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.120> how<00:02:42.300> long<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.480> takes<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.810> load

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
again this is how long it takes a load

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:50.050 
again this is how long it takes a load
spots<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.710> computer
