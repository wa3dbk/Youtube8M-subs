00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.430 
hopefully this one actually works
alright<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.940> 12<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:36.019> one<00:02:36.230> it's

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
alright so it is 12 in it's a one it's

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.120 
alright so it is 12 in it's a one it's
one<00:02:36.650> foot<00:02:36.890> shorter<00:02:37.459> than<00:02:37.630> my<00:02:38.630> other<00:02:38.660> one<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.829> i

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
one foot shorter than my other one so i

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.199 
one foot shorter than my other one so i
don't<00:02:40.340> know<00:02:40.400> if<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.700> will<00:02:40.790> actually<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:41.180> a

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
don't know if that will actually be a

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.190 
don't know if that will actually be a
big<00:02:42.049> difference<00:02:42.440> or<00:02:42.530> not<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.370> first<00:02:44.110> thing<00:02:45.110> i

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
big difference or not so first thing i

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.699 
big difference or not so first thing i
know<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.470> that's<00:02:45.650> very<00:02:45.799> easy<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:48.260> change<00:02:48.500> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
know is that's very easy to change that

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.410 
know is that's very easy to change that
I<00:02:48.799> think<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.579> knob<00:02:49.910> right<00:02:50.090> here<00:02:50.150> will

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
I think this knob right here will

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.839 
I think this knob right here will
tighten<00:02:50.630> them<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.019> that's<00:02:51.140> good<00:02:51.849> alright

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
tighten them but that's good alright

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.479 
tighten them but that's good alright
let's<00:02:53.209> see<00:02:53.390> if<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.739> take<00:02:54.739> pull<00:02:55.160> these<00:02:55.310> off

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
let's see if I can take pull these off

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.839 
let's see if I can take pull these off
pull<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.269> apart<00:02:57.010> alright<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.220> i<00:02:58.250> can<00:02:58.549> it's

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
pull it apart alright so i can it's

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.819 
pull it apart alright so i can it's
pretty<00:02:59.239> easy<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.630> do<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.530> i'm<00:03:00.680> guessing

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
pretty easy to do and i'm guessing

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.150 
pretty easy to do and i'm guessing
there's<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.099> knob<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.489> can<00:03:01.760> tighten<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:03.160> all

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
there's a knob that can tighten that all

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.599 
there's a knob that can tighten that all
right<00:03:04.400> let's<00:03:05.030> see<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:07.100> yeah<00:03:07.310> that's<00:03:07.430> pretty

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
right let's see so yeah that's pretty

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.750 
right let's see so yeah that's pretty
cool<00:03:08.000> this<00:03:08.480> is<00:03:08.540> what<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.690> looks<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.760> i

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
cool this is what it looks like and i

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.430
