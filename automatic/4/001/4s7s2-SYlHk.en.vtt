you have a black eye blending is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.359 
you have a black eye blending is
definitely<00:00:21.900> key<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.769> there<00:00:22.890> are<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> couple

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
definitely key but there are a couple

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
definitely key but there are a couple
other<00:00:23.609> things<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.869> make<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.080> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
other things that I do to make it a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.859 
other things that I do to make it a
little<00:00:25.830> easier<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.550> blend<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> easiest

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
little easier to blend so the easiest

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.320 
little easier to blend so the easiest
way<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.039> think<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.760> from<00:00:30.000> dark

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
way to do it I think is going from dark

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.700 
way to do it I think is going from dark
to<00:00:30.420> light<00:00:30.570> you're<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.140> want<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> put<00:00:31.590> the
