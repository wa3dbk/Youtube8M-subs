00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
F we'll make adjustments with it so from

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.729 
F we'll make adjustments with it so from
the<00:02:12.340> outside<00:02:12.819> we'll<00:02:13.209> make<00:02:13.390> little<00:02:13.739> really

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
the outside we'll make little really

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.550 
the outside we'll make little really
fine<00:02:15.069> fine<00:02:15.430> adjustments<00:02:16.150> either<00:02:16.810> closer<00:02:17.260> to

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
towards the middle it all affects the

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.860 
towards the middle it all affects the
tone<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.829> how<00:02:27.519> we<00:02:27.579> adjust<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.450> post

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.660 
tone so how we adjust that post
determines<00:02:29.709> a<00:02:29.829> lot<00:02:30.099> about<00:02:30.370> how<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
instrument will sound if we bring it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.100
