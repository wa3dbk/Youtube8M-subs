playing<00:01:48.450> against<00:01:48.689> snipers<00:01:49.140> who<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.439> only

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
playing against snipers who can only

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.609

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
like no recoil on my gun and that's why

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.179 
like no recoil on my gun and that's why
I'm<00:01:54.810> owning<00:01:55.140> them<00:01:55.290> because<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:55.829> getting<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I'm owning them because I'm getting the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.100 
I'm owning them because I'm getting the
shot<00:01:56.369> off<00:01:56.520> first<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.119> what<00:01:57.570> helped<00:01:57.840> me<00:01:57.899> do
