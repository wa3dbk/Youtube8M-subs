00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
Tally's pickups I liked it because they

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.200 
Tally's pickups I liked it because they
are<00:05:00.669> a<00:05:00.700> bit<00:05:00.820> hotter<00:05:01.270> than<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.169> normal<00:05:02.500> ones<00:05:02.740> I

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
are a bit hotter than the normal ones I

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.780 
are a bit hotter than the normal ones I
didn't<00:05:04.210> really<00:05:04.450> like<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.810> n3<00:05:05.790> American

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.550 
didn't really like the n3 American
deluxe<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.300> think<00:05:07.630> they<00:05:07.780> are<00:05:07.840> noiseless<00:05:08.260> which

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
deluxe I think they are noiseless which

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.880 
deluxe I think they are noiseless which
is<00:05:08.710> good<00:05:08.919> but<00:05:09.130> um<00:05:09.510> it's<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.600> bit<00:05:10.750> thin<00:05:11.470> for<00:05:11.770> me

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
is good but um it's a bit thin for me

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.100 
is good but um it's a bit thin for me
this<00:05:12.610> is<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.850> maple<00:05:13.419> American<00:05:14.260> deluxe<00:05:14.500> neck

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
this is a maple American deluxe neck

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110 
this is a maple American deluxe neck
with<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.230> locking<00:05:17.380> tuners<00:05:17.710> its<00:05:18.640> compound

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
with the locking tuners its compound

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.990 
with the locking tuners its compound
radius<00:05:19.390> so<00:05:19.960> it's<00:05:20.380> actually<00:05:20.680> flatter<00:05:21.190> over

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
radius so it's actually flatter over

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.420 
radius so it's actually flatter over
here<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.450> rounded<00:05:23.350> over<00:05:23.530> here<00:05:23.770> so<00:05:24.040> it<00:05:24.190> makes

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
here and rounded over here so it makes
