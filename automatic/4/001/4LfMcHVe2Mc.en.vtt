00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.460
 and 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.480
 hello everyone it's strings order in a queue 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.290
 us another rare and very cool telly 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.830
 here are the firms 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.140
 adwords a certain branch is and 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.300
 working for inside the japanese market and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.610
 so on so on so on in general 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.490
 without me everybody knows everybody here is telly 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.350
 Differs in a beautiful matte stroke. 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.930
 so lacquered rosewood pad 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.720
 apparently and famously I suspect so 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.550
 here and there is such a pustule which is of the type 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.700
 boost is actually the first time such a 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.260
 I see on the body koch the idea is that in any 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.270
 position would not be here where it 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.520
 our switch including this one 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.810
 a piece 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.670
 Means pressure and more precisely on this thing 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.430
 cut both sensors at once and so 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.080
 seriously the signal is raising now we are 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.360
 here we can hear here 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.100
 here it doesn't matter where you were. 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 clicking here you get this one 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.840
 a sound that is well, how to let 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.030
 cool enough here and we will listen 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.500
 fender blues junior 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.500
 well and forward 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.979
 and 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.470
 and 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.990
 but 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.379
 Well, now being in different positions 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.379
 I click on this little thing, see yes game 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.989
 that is, we can play a single together 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.950
 on bridge but pressing only this thing on 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.629
 Immediately it turns out the sound and the only one 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.069
 there are powerful that is, it cuts like 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.069
 as if in humbucker mode too 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.550
