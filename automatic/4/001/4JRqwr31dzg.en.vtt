is showing promise as a tournament game
however<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.420> would<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> hope<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.129> this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
however I would like to hope that this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.000 
however I would like to hope that this
bug<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:39.210> fixed<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.350> let<00:00:40.469> me<00:00:40.559> show<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> what

bug can be fixed so let me show you what

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.790 
bug can be fixed so let me show you what
it<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.129> basically<00:00:42.320> Cervantes<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.530> move

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it is basically Cervantes has a move

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
it is basically Cervantes has a move
that<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.879> think<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.329> called<00:00:45.570> pirates<00:00:46.079> scheme

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
that I think is called pirates scheme

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
that I think is called pirates scheme
yeah<00:00:46.649> pirates<00:00:47.129> scheme<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.610> +<00:00:47.850> K<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
yeah pirates scheme a + K it's in the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.029 
yeah pirates scheme a + K it's in the
move<00:00:48.719> list<00:00:48.989> I'm<00:00:49.230> showing<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.920> that

move list I'm showing you this so that

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.100 
move list I'm showing you this so that
you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.460> some<00:00:50.989> manipulation<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you know it's not some manipulation of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.900 
you know it's not some manipulation of
the<00:00:52.230> game<00:00:52.410> system<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.129> actually<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the game system it's actually just a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.389 
the game system it's actually just a
simple<00:00:54.270> move<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.680> does<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> auto

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
simple move and what it does is it auto

PlayStation and this also happens on the
Xbox<00:01:15.180> version<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.840> can't<00:01:16.530> push<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> home

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.789 
Xbox version I can't push the home
button<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.729> escape<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> game<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.900> can't<00:01:19.500> push

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
button to escape the game I can't push

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
button to escape the game I can't push
any<00:01:19.950> buttons<00:01:20.520> nothing<00:01:21.030> works<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.869> only<00:01:22.049> thing

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
any buttons nothing works the only thing

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.170 
any buttons nothing works the only thing
you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.130> power<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.790> your

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you can do is power down your

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.340 
you can do is power down your
playstation<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.380> xbox<00:01:26.000> manually<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
playstation or xbox manually so this is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.539 
playstation or xbox manually so this is
basically<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.860> completely<00:01:29.700> game<00:01:30.119> breaking<00:01:30.689> bug

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
basically a completely game breaking bug

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.420 
basically a completely game breaking bug
obviously<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
obviously was not a you know in the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.859 
obviously was not a you know in the
original<00:01:35.549> versions<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> game<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:39.210> would

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
original versions of the game so I would

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.530 
original versions of the game so I would
like<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.220> fixed<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.180> perfect

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
like for this to be fixed in a perfect

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.010 
like for this to be fixed in a perfect
world<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.280> think<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.430> warranting<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.689> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
world I think it's warranting that it is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
world I think it's warranting that it is
fixed<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.009> actually<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.579> game

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
fixed because it's actually a game

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
fixed because it's actually a game
breaking<00:01:48.360> bug<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> move<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.430> game

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
breaking bug there is a move in the game

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
breaking bug there is a move in the game
that<00:01:50.909> doesn't<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.930> supposed<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> do

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that doesn't do what it's supposed to do

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.300 
that doesn't do what it's supposed to do
but<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.250> only<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:54.649> potentially<00:01:55.649> could

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
but not only that it potentially could

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.370 
but not only that it potentially could
damage<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.969> game<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.509> could<00:01:57.689> damage<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.200> game

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
damage the game it could damage the game

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.700 
damage the game it could damage the game
save<00:01:58.740> files<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.520> could<00:02:00.090> damage<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:01.049> who<00:02:01.500> knows

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
save files it could damage a who knows

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.380 
save files it could damage a who knows
maybe<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.189> could<00:02:02.340> damage<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.790> Playstation

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
maybe it could damage your Playstation

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.749 
maybe it could damage your Playstation
or<00:02:03.509> Xbox<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> would<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.490> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
or Xbox so I would like to think that

or Xbox so I would like to think that
this<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> big<00:02:06.420> enough<00:02:06.659> deal<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.560> perhaps

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
this is a big enough deal that perhaps

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.880 
this is a big enough deal that perhaps
Namco<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.910> want<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.300> fix<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:10.830> the

I<00:02:12.170> would<00:02:12.410> also<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.190> think<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.940> since

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
I would also like to think that since

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.960 
I would also like to think that since
they<00:02:14.569> potentially<00:02:14.930> could<00:02:15.290> try<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> fix<00:02:16.520> this
