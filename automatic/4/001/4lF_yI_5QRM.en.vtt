00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
 later today about the forest 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.460
 and how the in a forest 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.940
 yes if you look at this forest it is a very dense forest a very dark forest 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.940
 trees are all very close together 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.959
 go stand up yourself dead due to lack of light 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.419
 it is actually very inviting to perform in a thin here and how 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.240
 we do that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.849
 and how do we view that and how do we give it a go? 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.499
 well here you have a very nice example of the class that status 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.089
 there is a belief 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.380
 and an oak in it 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.060
 the douglas is actually a series head 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 the pine and the oak coby naturally and that's why we already have this tree 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 offered est 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.670
 And a blessed thing is that you are with a blessing or blaze knife 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.200
 so very sharp knife 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.260
 and with that piece of bark can be removed from the trunk that goes like this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.480
 that's how it goes afterwards so the timber trader knows what tree you are 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.510
 can take away 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.420
 we have just seen how you like trees with a change or blaze human 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.720
 you can see the marks on which the fits of the spell is done 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.430
 You can also want to do it with pieces of paint with a spray can and if you like 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.180
 sees the country many trees have been identified 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.770
 which means that this entire piece of forest is harvested 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.210
 to get a lot more at the bottom, so you get a lot more 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.590
 forest rejuvenation 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.210
 yes you can be beautiful in the forest anb and then see your neck is around a strip 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.850
 that animals has been cut out 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 That is actually meant among them to make for the machines so that they later 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.410
 in kind 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.680
 to drag the cda out this is actually missing a whole row of trees 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.690
 removed and we call that reasons 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.210
 so in this forest have in recent years different bundle 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.390
 occurred 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.190
 what is still there is the rich and the beech 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.310
 all the trees have been sawn out and harvested very slowly 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.550
 here you can see the remains of the trees that went down sawed off its roof 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.520
 the oaks and beech trees remain standing but with a lot of light and space so here 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.750
 about the coming years no longer come true so I have a short explanation 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.130
 given how we are in the forest with the beaters 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.180
 and how we are going to give that you know the sequel if you Euromold what that 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.690
 brussels all mean a lot 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.630
 and it keeps it being harvested naturally because we in the Netherlands also part 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.229
 be able to get our own wood from our wood art 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.589
 We have an obligation to keep a part of us what we need for it 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:17.669
 our use 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.439
 that we have to keep that out of our own forest we can't get everything out of it 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.729
 word 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:26.849
 and that again has nvc quality mark so in other words it is grown sustainably 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.179
 so in that regard we can be quite proud of it
