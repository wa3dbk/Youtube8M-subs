negative 3.75 and negative 4.75 because

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.410 
negative 3.75 and negative 4.75 because
that<00:02:33.650> just<00:02:33.800> means<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.580> negative<00:02:35.000> sign<00:02:35.180> means

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that just means the negative sign means

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.870 
that just means the negative sign means
that<00:02:35.599> you're<00:02:35.750> farsighted<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.370> negative<00:02:37.730> sign

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
that you're farsighted the negative sign

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.009 
that you're farsighted the negative sign
means<00:02:38.030> you're<00:02:38.209> near-sighted<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
means you're near-sighted and the

means you're near-sighted and the
positive<00:02:39.590> sign<00:02:39.769> means<00:02:40.010> you're<00:02:40.190> farsighted
