unfortunately<00:01:18.170> we<00:01:19.040> don't<00:01:19.310> actually<00:01:19.670> have<00:01:20.570> a

unfortunately we don't actually have a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.320 
unfortunately we don't actually have a
quick<00:01:21.799> draw<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.220> I<00:01:22.280> think<00:01:22.340> I'll<00:01:22.490> take<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.700> long

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
quick draw so I think I'll take a long

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.399 
quick draw so I think I'll take a long
barrel<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:23.690> don't<00:01:23.810> know<00:01:23.869> what's<00:01:24.020> doing<00:01:24.290> on

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
barrel I don't know what's doing on

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.680 
barrel I don't know what's doing on
there<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:24.860> class<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.280> KSG<00:01:25.610> with<00:01:26.600> the

exactly<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:34.040> class<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.610> bit<00:01:34.880> silly

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150

exactly but this class is a bit silly
guess<00:01:35.360> we<00:01:35.480> might<00:01:35.660> as<00:01:35.720> well<00:01:35.960> add<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> camera<00:01:36.590> on

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
guess we might as well add a camera on

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.700 
guess we might as well add a camera on
this<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.310> just<00:01:37.880> tell<00:01:38.090> me<00:01:38.180> down<00:01:38.420> below<00:01:38.780> for
