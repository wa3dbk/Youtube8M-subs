00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.019
 hello everyone here again is mega 11 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.389
 with a short video this video will be short 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.269
 and it will only be a personal opinion of this 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.919
 good topic a while ago I've seen 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.200
 many fan reviews now of 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.570
 adventure saying that it is declining that 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.270
 it is not like before that there is only filling 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.160
 among other comments 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.150
 there have also been comments 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.670
 comparing it with the steven series 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.890
 good universe I know that the steven series 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.629
 universe is having a big impact and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.149
 his episodes have been very interesting 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.050
 but that has nothing to do with time 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.940
 of adventure 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.250
 steven universe and hour of adventure not 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.890
 they are the only series in cartoon network 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.500
 they are also a show more clarence uncle 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.510
 great peace among others so I would not have 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 only sense compare it with steven 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.760
 universe as if they had a kind of 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.010
 rivalry some exaggerate by saying that 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.930
 it should be finished and that is no longer 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.329
 sorry to see it then in my personal opinion 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.309
 that's not true several say that because 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.079
 in these moments now of adventure 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.269
 shows episodes that focus on 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.590
 values ​​and teachings of life showing 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.200
 more the lives of other characters 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.940
 secondary but that does not mean that 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.040
 it will be like this forever and not 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.900
 are filler episodes since the plot 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.150
 main time of adventure is not watch 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.860
 things of the mushroom war ni 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.170
 know the past of Simon or some 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 battle against the leeds the series is time 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.680
 of adventure is shown in any 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.330
 situation that improve the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.460
 characters and show the new 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.650
 experiences in their lives that a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.070
 episode is not shocking or revealing 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.680
 does not mean that it is filling and if all 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.660
 absolutely all the series have 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.640
 boring episodes that will make you think 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.340
 that the creators ran out of ideas 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.530
 or just want to make time now of 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.870
 adventure still needs a lot to show 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 and should not be compared to success 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.800
 of other series since it is not in a 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.010
 kind of war to see what series is 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.200
 better good also if you do not like the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.180
 series you can slowly go to see another 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.360
 series and should not criticize without 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.270
 arguments good friends I hope that you 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.580
 have liked this short video a lot 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 lucky everyone says goodbye is mega 11
