personally I think that is a really good
winter<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.330> most<00:01:24.780> people<00:01:25.049> don't

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.819 
winter because I think most people don't
realize<00:01:25.259> how<00:01:25.680> bad<00:01:26.340> um<00:01:26.930> when<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> rain<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
outside Springs but obviously it's very

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.139 
outside Springs but obviously it's very
cold<00:01:40.899> there<00:01:41.079> I<00:01:41.500> literally<00:01:42.340> should<00:01:42.640> get<00:01:42.850> out<00:01:43.000> of

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
cold there I literally should get out of

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.870 
cold there I literally should get out of
the<00:01:43.270> water<00:01:43.539> and<00:01:44.020> should<00:01:45.009> walk<00:01:45.250> for<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.549> bit<00:01:45.579> and

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
the water and should walk for a bit and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.419 
the water and should walk for a bit and
her<00:01:46.119> hair<00:01:46.509> would<00:01:46.899> turn<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.500> ice<00:01:47.679> it<00:01:48.069> will<00:01:48.280> just

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
her hair would turn to ice it will just

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.240 
her hair would turn to ice it will just
freeze<00:01:48.969> you<00:01:49.539> could<00:01:49.750> snap<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.380> because<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.130> had

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
freeze you could snap it because it had

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.850 
freeze you could snap it because it had
got<00:01:51.459> so<00:01:51.670> cold<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.119> was<00:01:52.240> like<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.689> popsicle<00:01:53.409> and

got so cold it was like a popsicle and

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.149 
got so cold it was like a popsicle and
think<00:01:54.640> I'm<00:01:54.819> thinking<00:01:55.209> to<00:01:55.329> myself<00:01:55.360> how<00:01:56.049> bad<00:01:56.500> is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159
