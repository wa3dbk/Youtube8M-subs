the corners of the goggles the only

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.060 
the corners of the goggles the only
issue<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> figure<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
issue I have with the figure is that the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.800 
issue I have with the figure is that the
legs<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.430> little<00:01:11.549> bit<00:01:11.729> uneven<00:01:11.850> makes<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
legs are a little bit uneven makes it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.410 
legs are a little bit uneven makes it
difficult<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.170> her<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> stand<00:01:17.180> with<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> little

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
difficult for her to stand with a little

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
difficult for her to stand with a little
work<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.930> her<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.110> stand<00:01:19.320> fairly<00:01:19.979> well

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
work can get her to stand fairly well

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.410 
work can get her to stand fairly well
but<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.640> doesn't<00:01:20.759> take<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> knock<00:01:21.299> her

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
but it doesn't take much to knock her

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.039 
but it doesn't take much to knock her
back<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.720> again<00:01:23.540> here<00:01:24.540> she<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.930> the
