comparison<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.629> gaming<00:00:04.140> here<00:00:04.529> underwater

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
comparison of the gaming here underwater

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.919 
comparison of the gaming here underwater
between<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.290> third<00:00:07.740> gen<00:00:08.130> Moto<00:00:08.700> G's<00:00:09.210> both<00:00:09.660> the

between the third gen Moto G's both the
one<00:00:10.170> gig<00:00:10.410> model<00:00:10.590> on<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.190> left<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.849> e2g<00:00:12.719> model

one gig model on the left and e2g model

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.660 
one gig model on the left and e2g model
on<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.440> right<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.420> see<00:00:15.630> how<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.670> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
on the right so we can see how it is and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.590 
on the right so we can see how it is and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
as you can see we are going to not go

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.450 
as you can see we are going to not go
too<00:00:21.660> hard<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.350> them<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.039> underwater

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
too hard on them and the are underwater

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.370 
too hard on them and the are underwater
as<00:00:23.789> well<00:00:24.060> as<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.539> see<00:00:25.220> very<00:00:26.220> nice<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:27.380> so

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
as well as you can see very nice here so

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.870 
as well as you can see very nice here so
we're<00:00:28.470> not<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:28.890> too<00:00:28.949> hard<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.640> them

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
we're not going to go too hard on them

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.690 
we're not going to go too hard on them
and<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:30.929> see<00:00:31.349> everything<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.460> low

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and you can see everything is on the low

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.810 
and you can see everything is on the low
at<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.630> moment<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.860> using<00:00:35.190> my<00:00:35.370> controller

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
at the moment so I'm using my controller

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:47.180 
at the moment so I'm using my controller
as<00:00:36.059> well<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> let's<00:00:37.770> go<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> when<00:00:46.950> you're<00:00:47.100> on

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
as well so let's go so when you're on

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.850 
as well so let's go so when you're on
the<00:00:47.309> beach<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.820> something<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.780> Moto<00:00:49.110> G's<00:00:49.590> got

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the beach or something the Moto G's got

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.029 
the beach or something the Moto G's got
your<00:00:50.010> back<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:51.440> when<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> want<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> play

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
your back here when you want to play

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.270 
your back here when you want to play
underwater<00:00:57.530> let's<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.739> zoom<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> little

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
underwater let's just zoom in a little

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:10.630 
underwater let's just zoom in a little
bit<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:20.280 

so<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.730> forgetting<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.180> controls<00:01:12.690> here

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.330 

so<00:01:22.020> first<00:01:23.020> things<00:01:23.260> first<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.800> think<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:24.070> can

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
so first things first I think you can

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.720 
so first things first I think you can
see<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.910> little<00:01:25.900> bit<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.080> lags<00:01:26.320> here<00:01:29.730> but

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
see a little bit of lags here but

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.520 
see a little bit of lags here but
interestingly<00:01:31.120> enough<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.810> can<00:01:31.990> hear<00:01:32.260> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
interestingly enough I can hear the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.660 
interestingly enough I can hear the
speaker<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:36.400> is<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:38.290> coming<00:01:38.740> through<00:01:39.550> the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
speaker which is just coming through the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:02:04.310 
speaker which is just coming through the
water<00:01:39.880> there<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.130> bit<00:01:45.280> slow<00:01:45.670> though

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.290 

so<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.710> boilers<00:02:06.280> are<00:02:06.460> still<00:02:06.760> just<00:02:07.090> as

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
so the boilers are still just as

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.200 
so the boilers are still just as
unforgiving<00:02:07.690> here<00:02:08.670> when<00:02:09.670> you're<00:02:09.850> playing

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
unforgiving here when you're playing

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.699 
unforgiving here when you're playing
underwater<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:13.000> do<00:02:13.540> bear<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.959> in<00:02:14.050> mind

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
underwater so do bear that in mind

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.790 
underwater so do bear that in mind
oh<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.300> that'll<00:02:16.930> close<00:02:17.230> here<00:02:17.770> a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
oh can you see that'll close here a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.830 
oh can you see that'll close here a
little<00:02:17.980> bit<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:24.600> maybe<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:27.400> can<00:02:27.730> see<00:02:28.330> if<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.630> can

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
little bit so maybe we can see if we can

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.570 
little bit so maybe we can see if we can
get<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.050> little<00:02:29.260> bit<00:02:29.410> more<00:02:29.620> smoother<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:33.489> you

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
get a little bit more smoother so you

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.690 
get a little bit more smoother so you
can<00:02:33.730> see<00:02:33.910> I'm<00:02:34.030> right<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.540> bottom<00:02:34.959> here<00:02:35.380> of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
can see I'm right on the bottom here of

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.390 
can see I'm right on the bottom here of
practically<00:02:36.700> everything<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:39.220> I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
practically everything so you know I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.870 
practically everything so you know I
think<00:02:40.739> really<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:43.209> bit<00:02:43.450> struggling<00:02:44.050> here

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
think really is a bit struggling here

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.690 
think really is a bit struggling here
maybe<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.239> m4<00:02:46.750> aqua<00:02:47.190> could<00:02:48.190> do<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.400> little<00:02:48.519> bit

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
maybe the m4 aqua could do a little bit

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.650 
maybe the m4 aqua could do a little bit
better<00:02:48.910> might<00:02:49.900> check<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.290> out<00:02:50.380> as<00:02:50.560> well<00:02:51.660> but

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
better might check that out as well but

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.180 
better might check that out as well but
let's<00:02:53.470> just<00:02:53.709> move<00:02:54.250> on<00:02:54.489> now<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:56.190> higher-end

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
let's just move on now to the higher-end

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.120 
let's just move on now to the higher-end
moto<00:02:57.790> G<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.660> 2gig<00:02:59.200> model<00:02:59.620> which<00:02:59.769> we<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.100> have

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
moto G the 2gig model which we do have

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.949 
moto G the 2gig model which we do have
here<00:03:00.670> as<00:03:00.820> well<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.310> as<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.850> can<00:03:04.000> see<00:03:04.060> here<00:03:04.750> we

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
here as well so as you can see here we

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.070 
here as well so as you can see here we
are<00:03:04.989> running<00:03:05.380> same<00:03:06.340> kind<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.730> thing

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
are running same kind of thing

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.560 
are running same kind of thing
everything<00:03:08.080> on<00:03:08.230> pretty<00:03:08.680> much<00:03:08.830> low<00:03:10.170> and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
everything on pretty much low and

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.720 
everything on pretty much low and
hopefully<00:03:13.570> that<00:03:13.810> will<00:03:13.900> give<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.730> chance

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
hopefully that will give it a chance

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:23.670 
hopefully that will give it a chance
here<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.330> just<00:03:19.540> go<00:03:22.080> not<00:03:23.080> hearing<00:03:23.500> what

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
here and we can just go not hearing what

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.280 
here and we can just go not hearing what
sound<00:03:24.040> from<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:25.170> so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:47.300 

that<00:03:29.290> could<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:31.770> I'll<00:03:32.770> go<00:03:32.920> out<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.040> low

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:04:00.510 

so<00:03:48.310> let's<00:03:48.550> get<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.790> close<00:03:49.120> look<00:03:49.450> here<00:03:49.510> at<00:03:50.020> that

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.520 

so<00:04:01.180> you're<00:04:01.450> not<00:04:01.540> getting<00:04:01.690> any<00:04:01.960> sound<00:04:02.200> with

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
so you're not getting any sound with

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.760 
so you're not getting any sound with
this<00:04:02.680> one<00:04:03.250> maybe<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:04.270> speaker<00:04:04.870> deactivated

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
this one maybe the speaker deactivated

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.330 
this one maybe the speaker deactivated
or<00:04:05.920> something<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.690> can<00:04:07.870> check<00:04:08.080> out<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.560> actual

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
or something we can check out the actual

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.960 
or something we can check out the actual
performance<00:04:10.060> here<00:04:10.900> if<00:04:11.560> you'll<00:04:12.520> get<00:04:12.760> on<00:04:12.850> the

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
performance here if you'll get on the

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:26.430 
performance here if you'll get on the
bite<00:04:21.960> and<00:04:23.790> if<00:04:24.790> you<00:04:24.910> ask<00:04:25.120> me<00:04:25.420> this<00:04:25.810> looks<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.260> lot

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
bite and if you ask me this looks a lot

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.220 
bite and if you ask me this looks a lot
better<00:04:26.680> actually<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:28.830> little<00:04:29.830> bit<00:04:30.040> jerky<00:04:31.230> here

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
better actually a little bit jerky here

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.860 
better actually a little bit jerky here
and<00:04:32.410> there<00:04:32.650> but<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:34.830> nevertheless<00:04:35.850> in<00:04:36.870> fact

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
and there but and nevertheless in fact

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:50.540 
and there but and nevertheless in fact
maybe<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:38.320> not<00:04:38.500> better<00:04:39.750> wishful<00:04:40.750> thinking

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.270 

so<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.640> can<00:04:51.850> see<00:04:52.120> here<00:04:52.600> we're<00:04:52.870> getting<00:04:53.280> quite

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
so you can see here we're getting quite

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.150 
so you can see here we're getting quite
a<00:04:54.340> bit<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.670> lag<00:04:56.040> during<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.190> fighting<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:59.160> we

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
a bit of lag during the fighting and we

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.590 
a bit of lag during the fighting and we
can<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:00.340> sure<00:05:00.490> enough<00:05:00.760> here<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.300> see<00:05:01.480> if<00:05:01.540> we

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
can you sure enough here and see if we

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:10.879 
can you sure enough here and see if we
can<00:05:01.720> get<00:05:01.870> into<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.080> car

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:29.720 

No<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.740> got<00:05:14.219> blasted<00:05:14.520> again

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.220 

so<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:30.390> can<00:05:30.570> see<00:05:30.840> quite<00:05:31.230> a<00:05:31.260> nice<00:05:31.440> effect<00:05:31.950> here

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
so you can see quite a nice effect here

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.400 
so you can see quite a nice effect here
when<00:05:34.230> you<00:05:34.970> put<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.000> little<00:05:36.150> ripple<00:05:36.630> there<00:05:39.350> but<00:05:40.350> I

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
when you put a little ripple there but I

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.940 
when you put a little ripple there but I
think<00:05:40.710> here<00:05:42.140> we're<00:05:43.140> going<00:05:43.230> to<00:05:43.290> have<00:05:43.470> to<00:05:43.710> give

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
think here we're going to have to give

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.850 
think here we're going to have to give
the<00:05:44.250> actual<00:05:44.820> performance<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:46.670> d-minus<00:05:48.650> have<00:05:49.650> to

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
the actual performance a d-minus have to

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.830 
the actual performance a d-minus have to
be<00:05:49.980> honest<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:50.760> know<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:51.120> don't<00:05:51.420> think<00:05:51.690> it's

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
be honest you know I don't think it's

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.800 
be honest you know I don't think it's
the<00:05:51.960> best<00:05:52.170> I've<00:05:52.380> seen

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
the best I've seen

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.020 
the best I've seen
I<00:05:54.810> don't<00:05:55.710> know<00:05:55.860> if<00:05:56.070> it's<00:05:56.400> got<00:05:56.520> something<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:56.820> do

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
I don't know if it's got something to do

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.050 
I don't know if it's got something to do
with<00:05:57.210> being<00:05:57.780> on<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:57.990> water<00:05:58.200> I<00:05:58.770> doubt<00:05:59.760> it

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
with being on the water I doubt it

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.990 
with being on the water I doubt it
though<00:06:00.090> you<00:06:00.570> know<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:00.780> should<00:06:01.700> be<00:06:02.700> about<00:06:02.850> the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
though you know you should be about the

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.180 
though you know you should be about the
same<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:04.020> strange<00:06:04.320> thing<00:06:04.560> is<00:06:04.590> is<00:06:04.890> that<00:06:04.980> when

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
same the strange thing is is that when

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.980 
same the strange thing is is that when
there's<00:06:05.640> not<00:06:05.820> much<00:06:06.030> happening<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:06.570> can<00:06:06.750> see

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
there's not much happening you can see

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.180 
there's not much happening you can see
it's<00:06:07.170> quite<00:06:07.320> smooth<00:06:07.800> here<00:06:08.960> which<00:06:10.850> is<00:06:11.850> puzzling

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
it's quite smooth here which is puzzling

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.560 
it's quite smooth here which is puzzling
but<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.310> doesn't<00:06:14.580> seem<00:06:14.760> that<00:06:14.820> you<00:06:15.030> can<00:06:15.150> handle

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
but it doesn't seem that you can handle

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.520 
but it doesn't seem that you can handle
much<00:06:15.780> when<00:06:16.110> things<00:06:16.470> are<00:06:16.980> happening<00:06:18.050> so<00:06:19.050> I'm

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
much when things are happening so I'm

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.350 
much when things are happening so I'm
gonna<00:06:19.740> have<00:06:19.890> to<00:06:20.010> give<00:06:20.160> it<00:06:20.250> a<00:06:20.480> d-minus<00:06:22.100> our

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
gonna have to give it a d-minus our

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.290 
gonna have to give it a d-minus our
better<00:06:24.360> luck<00:06:24.600> next<00:06:24.630> time<00:06:25.020> moto<00:06:26.090> well<00:06:27.090> very

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
better luck next time moto well very

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.600 
better luck next time moto well very
nice<00:06:27.540> when<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:27.960> comes<00:06:28.230> to<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.830> flexibility

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
nice when it comes to the flexibility

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.010 
nice when it comes to the flexibility
here<00:06:30.000> and<00:06:30.290> terms<00:06:31.290> of<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:31.530> waterproofing<00:06:33.020> so

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
here and terms of the waterproofing so

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.230 
here and terms of the waterproofing so
where<00:06:34.380> ya<00:06:34.770> think<00:06:35.310> we're<00:06:35.640> going<00:06:35.850> to<00:06:35.940> leave<00:06:36.060> it

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
where ya think we're going to leave it

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.200 
where ya think we're going to leave it
there<00:06:36.480> I<00:06:37.190> think<00:06:38.190> you<00:06:38.490> only<00:06:38.730> get<00:06:38.910> thirty

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
there I think you only get thirty

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.530 
there I think you only get thirty
minutes<00:06:39.690> with<00:06:39.930> these<00:06:40.140> devices<00:06:41.270> before<00:06:42.270> you

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
minutes with these devices before you

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.450 
minutes with these devices before you
could<00:06:42.690> have<00:06:42.870> some<00:06:43.080> trouble<00:06:43.560> I<00:06:43.770> hope<00:06:44.280> you

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
could have some trouble I hope you

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.160 
could have some trouble I hope you
enjoyed<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:44.820> little<00:06:45.090> test<00:06:45.450> here<00:06:45.630> on<00:06:46.020> the

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
enjoyed the little test here on the

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.800 
enjoyed the little test here on the
water<00:06:46.380> with<00:06:46.830> the<00:06:47.100> new<00:06:48.020> Moto<00:06:49.020> G<00:06:50.450> third<00:06:51.450> Jen's

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810
