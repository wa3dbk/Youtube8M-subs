00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
way around all the way to here so you

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.830 
way around all the way to here so you
know<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:15.790> should<00:03:16.790> have<00:03:16.820> made<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.090> video<00:03:17.240> earlier

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
know I should have made a video earlier

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.820 
know I should have made a video earlier
of<00:03:18.050> Miri<00:03:18.560> gluing<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.340> part<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:21.110> didn't

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
of Miri gluing that part to but didn't

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.670 
of Miri gluing that part to but didn't
feel<00:03:21.950> like<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:24.890> shoe<00:03:25.340> glue<00:03:25.490> is<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:25.940> $6

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
feel like it so a shoe glue is like $6

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.910 
feel like it so a shoe glue is like $6
