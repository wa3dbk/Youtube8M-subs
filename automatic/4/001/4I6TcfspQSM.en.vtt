00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello youtube and welcome to the second one 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.830
 and last video to our logitech 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 illuminated keyboard 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.090
 I have the thing now complete 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.700
 worked through and claim weekend 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.490
 now just enough for a keyboard 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.130
 this time of accommodation and I can 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.779
 There's something to tell you about the tip 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.160
 Noise that interests many, too 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.900
 just when you order online and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.529
 little chance has the keyboard in the store 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:40.079
 to test 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:43.469
 just catch a glimpse of that 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.030
 now two sentences and the noise altogether 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.469
 pleasant at the beginning I thought as 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.780
 I started in the keyboard 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.010
 that works hard but then I am 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.170
 went there and just got here 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.570
 taken my normal apple keyboard 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.110
 to tap and the clique even has 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.410
 higher 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.059
 probably an aluminum and that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 thing is quieter I can not do that now 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.320
 show my I have from playing computer 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.770
 or windows so calculated log 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.470
 logitech g500 10 keyboard so or more 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.479
 macrotast ants and and the clique 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.369
 a lot louder at once the keys 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.890
 bigger ones are going down and on 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.759
 just felt more volume than around 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.040
 to make noise 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.799
 Here are the keys are relatively flat as 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.930
 I think 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.840
 and do not express themselves as a keyboard 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.299
 does not give you how to do it that way 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.970
 keyboards from laptop keyboard knows and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.829
 hate the game makes good the sun things 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.490
 I'm hardly up here 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.770
 used 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.990
 clearly because keys and number block is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.400
 sometimes not exactly as mac 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.079
 User is happy if you then 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 they key in the numbers 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.049
 can enter a little faster 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.149
 But what I have used then 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.630
 here the special keys for storm louder 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.700
 quieter 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.350
 this works well with mac if itself 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.119
 Now someone, of course, asks 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.759
 windows anyway and then we have here 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.290
 the button for the lighting and that 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.610
 Can this keyboard has one 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.549
 backlight and that goes 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.930
 completely from right to left under the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.100
 if you feel like that a bit 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.780
 you can see it in between 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.649
 This makes it seem like we're here 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.000
 see something 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.000
 unfortunately this is too bright because you see what 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.260
 Keys are out and now I am once 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 On top of that, press the full brightness 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.579
 and so if you look between 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.090
 she our poor bad 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.470
 gleam 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 but you only have that when he's so off 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.030
 above just as pure wars so if you 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.829
 from the extreme side when he looks from 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.599
 diagonally in front or from above then on it 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.109
 then the keys will light up and also shine 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.060
 above the orange lights up with and then 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:43.349
 So you see so many 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.680
 Adjustments from full power 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.510
 a little less even less and again 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.720
 that's nice at night, too 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.000
 Do not look for the optics freaks below 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.709
 you the stock this for the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.409
 handball that is not particularly high 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.049
 and fits so I use so what stop 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.879
 usually not and if they are 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.590
 are these pads I am not so 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.359
 fan of probably this is here 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.069
 the exact compromise between there is something 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.840
 to lay hands on them and people 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.950
 who are not used to say otherwise or 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.690
 that's not so much that bothers me 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.389
 I do not like it at all 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.489
 typing was a lot of fun 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.129
 play around a bit works well 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.389
 normal if you have such a mouse and one 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:27.879
 typical control used by me 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.829
 gets the keyboard in any case 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.540
 Plus point so I would not have thought 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.879
 I was very skeptical at the moment 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.470
 this rounded spacebar down 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.599
 All buttons but you get used to it 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.169
 It does not bother me at all 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.760
 yes i would use the keyboard 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.500
 recommend and buy so it fits 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.190
 i am i what would you change it 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.250
 probably that the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.500
 Special keys would not make orange 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.690
 but just the same darker 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.459
 So not so noticeable but if the 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.169
 keyboard then lights up and it is dark 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.549
 So it looks good that way 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.290
 Thank you very much for this 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.299
 I hope I could give you something 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.690
 Help makes it good and see you next 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.690
