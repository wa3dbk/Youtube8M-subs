 these children have been born in africa 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.470
 this is in western europe

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.330
 they all have exactly the same 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.340
 potential to live 120 years but what 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.840
 most likely, Africans are not 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.840
 even reach 38

 increasing their life expectancy to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.030
 as new ones are being produced 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.250
 advances in medicine most likely 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 will see what the world is like in the first 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.719
 22nd century years

 [Music] 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.190
 the disease divides the world in the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 developed countries the main 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.260
 causes of death are cancer and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.120
 cardiovascular problems in the countries 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.850
 developing are still the

 infections malaria cholera dysentery 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.130
 or measles continue to wreak havoc on 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.430
 countries like Afghanistan angola liberia 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.070

 [Music] 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.270
 in no other aspect the division between 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.790
 rich countries and poor countries 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.190
 the difference between being born to one or the other 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.440
 side of opulence is so palpable 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.440
 [Music] 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.770
 infectious diseases cause the 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.500
 45 percent of deaths in countries 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 in the process of developing all of them

 only 6 pneumonia diarrhea infant malaria 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.940
 tuberculosis and measles are the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.380
 responsible for 90% of mortality 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.690
 curable diseases for the most part 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.770
 that however cause more than 11

 millions of deaths per year 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.340
 the simple use of antibiotics would reduce 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.479
 notably these figures 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.479
 [Music] 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.280
 the problem is that antibiotics 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.000
 they cost a lot of money and the development of 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.130
 new antibiotics has decreased what 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.220
 we are observing is that the resistance 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.960
 of microorganisms is increasing 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.330
 at the same time that there is less 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.940
 research in the development of new 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.400
 antibiotics because the companies 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.140
 pharmaceutical companies are directing their 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.630
 investigations to diseases 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.330
 related to old age as the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.760
 Alzheimer's in addition to others other than 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.110
 infectious diseases that are not 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.240
 the most serious problem in countries 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.600
 developed 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.110
 90% of the research money and 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.520
 both public and private development no 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.550
 is intended for diseases 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.360
 infectious diseases in which it is invested only 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.790
 10% this means that the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.970
 medicines and the vaccines they need 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.310
 developing countries must 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.740
 make sure that the governments of the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.860
 industrialized countries along with the 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.510
 private and public companies 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.510
 work to rectify this problem

 old known others such as AIDS or 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.500
 implacable Ebola have arisen in the 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.180
 last decades in the immediate future 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.989
 will appear others that today not even 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.989
 we imagine 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.320
 and we have to face even 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.150
 infections that we thought eradicated 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.280
 definitely and that they have returned to 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.290
 manifest as a consequence of the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.660
 war or precarious conflicts 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.190
 environmental conditions

 [Music] 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.510
 the arrival of antibiotics allowed 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.190
 significantly reduce the incidence of 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.130
 infections especially in the first

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.870

 of natural selection are more its

 generation is a matter of minutes and 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.140
 quickly evolve us with

 our trips with the transport of 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.240
 food and abuse of antibiotics were 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.780
 we support its expansion and its battle

 for becoming resistant

 our hopes of triumph are

 deposited mostly in vaccines

 cataloged as infectious however 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.599
 we hardly have vaccines for a
