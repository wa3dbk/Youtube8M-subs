Icarus<00:00:13.290> tomato<00:00:14.099> tomahto

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
Icarus tomato tomahto

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.500 
Icarus tomato tomahto
from<00:00:15.269> Summa<00:00:15.570> Godzilla<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.260> final<00:00:16.619> Wars<00:00:17.480> now<00:00:18.480> I

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
from Summa Godzilla and final Wars now I

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.670 
from Summa Godzilla and final Wars now I
guess<00:00:18.810> we'll<00:00:18.960> get<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.410> articulation

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
guess we'll get on with the articulation

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.269 
guess we'll get on with the articulation
is<00:00:22.430> arms<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.730> go<00:00:23.810> 360<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.050> his<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.740> legs<00:00:26.070> get

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
is arms can go 360 but his back legs get

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.609 
is arms can go 360 but his back legs get
in<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> way<00:00:26.550> his<00:00:27.390> frontal<00:00:27.900> back<00:00:28.109> legs<00:00:28.380> can

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
in the way his frontal back legs can

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.510 
in the way his frontal back legs can
move<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:30.019> his<00:00:31.019> hind<00:00:31.800> legs<00:00:31.949> back

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
move in and out and his hind legs back

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.380 
move in and out and his hind legs back
here<00:00:33.440> can<00:00:34.440> go<00:00:34.590> 360<00:00:34.860> his<00:00:35.460> abdomen<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.239> up

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
here can go 360 his abdomen can go up

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.100 
here can go 360 his abdomen can go up
and<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.520> it's<00:00:38.520> very<00:00:38.879> loose<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and down and it's very loose so I

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.660 
and down and it's very loose so I
wouldn't<00:00:40.410> try<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
wouldn't try this if you want to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.180 
wouldn't try this if you want to
replicate<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.350> his<00:00:43.350> head<00:00:43.590> moves<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
replicate it but his head moves up and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.209 
replicate it but his head moves up and
down<00:00:44.750> but<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.809> joint<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.140> very<00:00:46.170> easy<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.010> break

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
down but the joint is very easy to break

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
down but the joint is very easy to break
so<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> wouldn't<00:00:47.969> recommend<00:00:48.239> moving<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.200> that

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
so I wouldn't recommend moving it that

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.510 
so I wouldn't recommend moving it that
much<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> want<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> replicate<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:52.520> so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
much if you want to replicate this so

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
much if you want to replicate this so
let<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> good<00:00:54.270> look<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:57.620> right<00:00:58.620> now

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
let you get a good look of it right now

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
let you get a good look of it right now
go<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.550> scaling<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:01.250> don't<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> mini<00:01:02.820> ax

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
go on to scaling I don't have a mini ax

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600 
go on to scaling I don't have a mini ax
or<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> cou<00:01:03.539> manga<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.159> gonna<00:01:05.250> pair

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
or a cou manga so I'm just gonna pair

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.490 
or a cou manga so I'm just gonna pair
them<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.570> Gods<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.320> that's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
them with the Gods all I have that's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.640 
them with the Gods all I have that's
closest<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> Sun<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> Godzilla<00:01:09.500> Godzilla

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.660 

1968<00:01:13.650> Godzilla<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> Bandai<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:16.460> as<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.610> can

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
1968 Godzilla the Bandai one as you can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.520 
1968 Godzilla the Bandai one as you can
see<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.890> more<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.100> less<00:01:20.280> accurate<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:21.090> think

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
see the more or less accurate I think

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.120 
see the more or less accurate I think
account<00:01:22.530> macorís<00:01:23.040> should<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.810> up<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.130> maybe

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
account macorís should be up here maybe

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.440 
account macorís should be up here maybe
like<00:01:26.520> Godzilla's<00:01:26.909> supposed<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.270> way

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
like Godzilla's supposed to be way

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.200 
like Godzilla's supposed to be way
bigger<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.770> no<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.310> isn't<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
bigger so no this isn't really all that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.210 
bigger so no this isn't really all that
accurate<00:01:30.890> well<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.250> guys<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:34.220> but

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
accurate well what do you guys think but

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.770 
accurate well what do you guys think but
final<00:01:35.970> war<00:01:36.150> scaling<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.720> could<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.110> accurate

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
final war scaling this could be accurate

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.670 
final war scaling this could be accurate
and<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.509> Lego<00:01:42.990> creation

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and so that is it for this Lego creation

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.190 
and so that is it for this Lego creation
review<00:01:44.149> there<00:01:45.149> wasn't<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.899> much<00:01:46.049> to

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
I used to make this um the the head here

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.870 
I used to make this um the the head here
the<00:03:17.349> fangs<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.040> abdomen<00:03:18.579> were

the fangs and the abdomen were

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.229 
the fangs and the abdomen were
completely<00:03:19.299> mine<00:03:19.660> but<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.829> legs<00:03:21.099> I<00:03:21.579> got<00:03:21.970> from

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
completely mine but the legs I got from

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.629 
completely mine but the legs I got from
the<00:03:22.389> shell<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.109> attacks<00:03:23.709> Lord<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.400> Rings

the shell of attacks Lord of the Rings

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.940 
the shell of attacks Lord of the Rings
set<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:27.099> basically<00:03:28.230> turned<00:03:29.230> them<00:03:29.440> from<00:03:29.470> brown

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
set and basically turned them from brown

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.119 
set and basically turned them from brown
spots<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.849> white<00:03:31.090> yellow<00:03:31.480> spots<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.440> be<00:03:32.739> more

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
spots to white yellow spots to be more

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.140 
spots to white yellow spots to be more
accurate<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.609> come<00:03:34.000> anga<00:03:35.099> but<00:03:36.099> since<00:03:36.879> this<00:03:36.970> is

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
accurate to come anga but since this is

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.629 
accurate to come anga but since this is
a<00:03:37.180> rather<00:03:37.419> big<00:03:37.780> one<00:03:38.220> I'll<00:03:39.220> let<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.489> have

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
a rather big one I'll let you have

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.759 
a rather big one I'll let you have
little<00:03:39.910> overhead<00:03:40.419> look<00:03:41.410> at<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.780> he<00:03:44.500> does

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
little overhead look at it and he does

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.890 
little overhead look at it and he does
have<00:03:44.980> two<00:03:45.190> eyes<00:03:45.400> yeah<00:03:45.819> we're<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.690> know<00:03:46.750> he's

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
have two eyes yeah we're you know he's

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.750 
have two eyes yeah we're you know he's
supposed<00:03:47.169> to<00:03:47.199> have<00:03:47.319> like<00:03:47.560> around<00:03:48.010> eight<00:03:48.250> or<00:03:48.280> so

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
supposed to have like around eight or so

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.159 
supposed to have like around eight or so
but<00:03:49.599> come<00:03:50.530> at<00:03:50.680> cou<00:03:51.040> manga<00:03:51.400> has<00:03:52.090> two<00:03:52.480> big<00:03:52.900> eyes

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
but come at cou manga has two big eyes

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.629 
but come at cou manga has two big eyes
and<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.560> rest<00:03:53.829> of<00:03:53.980> them<00:03:54.099> surrounding<00:03:54.549> are

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
and the rest of them surrounding are

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.939 
and the rest of them surrounding are
really<00:03:54.879> small<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:56.199> was<00:03:56.290> extremely<00:03:56.500> hard

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
really small and that was extremely hard

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:03.530 
really small and that was extremely hard
to<00:03:57.099> replicate<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.760> Lego<00:03:58.000> oh<00:04:00.870> look<00:04:01.870> at<00:04:01.989> it

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
to replicate in Lego oh look at it

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.860 
to replicate in Lego oh look at it
bottom

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.810 

alright<00:04:08.870> now<00:04:09.140> let's<00:04:10.270> onto<00:04:11.270> articulation<00:04:12.820> his

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
alright now let's onto articulation his

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
alright now let's onto articulation his
two<00:04:14.510> things<00:04:14.840> can<00:04:15.080> go<00:04:15.200> 360<00:04:16.630> he<00:04:17.630> has<00:04:17.900> 1<00:04:18.230> 2<00:04:18.470> 3

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
two things can go 360 he has 1 2 3

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.950 
two things can go 360 he has 1 2 3
joints<00:04:20.840> on<00:04:21.140> each<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.620> his<00:04:21.769> 8<00:04:22.040> legs<00:04:22.780> they<00:04:23.780> can

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
joints on each of his 8 legs they can

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.940 
joints on each of his 8 legs they can
move<00:04:24.110> up<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.560> down<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:27.080> his<00:04:27.440> little<00:04:27.740> claw

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
move up and down and his little claw

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.100 
move up and down and his little claw
here<00:04:28.190> can<00:04:28.340> go<00:04:28.430> 360<00:04:29.090> but<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.450> don't<00:04:29.690> want<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.930> move

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
here can go 360 but I don't want to move

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.090 
here can go 360 but I don't want to move
them<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.920> break<00:04:31.160> him<00:04:31.340> out<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.760> position

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
them to break him out of this position

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.150 
them to break him out of this position
so<00:04:34.100> set<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.090> camera<00:04:35.360> down<00:04:35.920> let's<00:04:36.920> go<00:04:37.100> to

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
so set the camera down let's go to

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.540 
so set the camera down let's go to
scaling<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:39.100> guess<00:04:40.100> we'll<00:04:40.370> pull<00:04:40.760> back<00:04:41.120> out

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
scaling I guess we'll pull back out

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.190 
scaling I guess we'll pull back out
Godzilla

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
Godzilla

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.930 
Godzilla
now<00:04:45.200> this<00:04:45.410> scale<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.950> really<00:04:46.160> accurate<00:04:46.490> it's

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
now this scale is really accurate it's

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.750 
now this scale is really accurate it's
even<00:04:47.150> more<00:04:47.300> accurate<00:04:47.510> than<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.310> YMS<00:04:49.310> f<00:04:49.520> qu

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
even more accurate than the YMS f qu

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.820 
even more accurate than the YMS f qu
manga<00:04:50.150> because<00:04:50.590> kamongo

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
manga because kamongo

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.220 
manga because kamongo
when<00:04:52.040> he<00:04:52.100> did<00:04:52.250> like<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.430> little<00:04:52.550> leap<00:04:52.850> up<00:04:53.230> right

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
when he did like a little leap up right

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.610 
when he did like a little leap up right
here<00:04:54.560> was<00:04:55.340> huge<00:04:56.330> compared<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.840> Godzilla<00:04:57.290> like

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
here was huge compared to Godzilla like

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.060 
here was huge compared to Godzilla like
this

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
this

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.850 
this
so<00:04:59.000> yeah<00:04:59.930> this<00:05:00.580> scaling<00:05:01.580> is<00:05:01.820> pretty<00:05:02.150> accurate

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
so yeah this scaling is pretty accurate

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
so yeah this scaling is pretty accurate
and<00:05:05.590> even<00:05:06.590> though<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:06.770> promised<00:05:07.400> I<00:05:07.580> would<00:05:07.760> let

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
and even though I promised I would let

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.430
