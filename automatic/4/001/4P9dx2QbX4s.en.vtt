00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.330
 Hello everyone in today's video I will show 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.590
 to you how i draw soviet and so i put 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.619
 light shadows 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.859
 slate comfortable rose on the whole fold of the century 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.650
 and Iâ€™m on my feather brush further 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.460
 With the same brush I apply a mattino shade 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.470
 by golden rose 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.480
 series comfort and touch more 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.480
 that's how it all looks forever 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.430
 now we come to the arrow itself 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.949
 first i draw on somewhere in the corner 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 small line and a little bit and and I bring 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:52.699
 until the end, I bring out thin 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.129
 an arrow parallel to his wandering and 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.829
 rather the tip of the eyebrow 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.530
 small dialogue feathering that was not 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.170
 so noticeable transition our arrows 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.020
 I generally advise you to draw arrows from 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.539
 mid-century to increase your eye 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.430
 make it gonna grouge further just 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:15.940
 complementing the arrow doing a little bit 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.940
 just thicker and their arrow is ready
