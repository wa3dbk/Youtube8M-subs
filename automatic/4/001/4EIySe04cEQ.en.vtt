00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.570 
a bunch of raindrops at
same<00:02:13.830> time<00:02:15.410> but<00:02:16.410> I'm<00:02:16.530> actually<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.430> go

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
same time but I'm actually going to go

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.940 
same time but I'm actually going to go
back<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:18.030> black<00:02:21.140> what<00:02:22.140> else<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:22.710> here

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
back to black what else can we do here

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.570 
back to black what else can we do here
we<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.760> enable<00:02:24.240> touch<00:02:24.660> feature<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
we can enable touch feature so the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.190 
we can enable touch feature so the
raindrops<00:02:27.030> won't<00:02:27.300> shatter<00:02:27.630> if<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.020> touch

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
raindrops won't shatter if you touch

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.070 
raindrops won't shatter if you touch
them<00:02:28.700> but<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.880> like<00:02:30.000> watching<00:02:30.420> them<00:02:30.510> shatter<00:02:30.810> so

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
them but I like watching them shatter so

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.850 
them but I like watching them shatter so
