00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.060
 I'm greg red geek and for them 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.010
 intimate and I welcome you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.650
 for this new jt technical game with 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.650
 these weeks the test of a stabilizer 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.940
 month for camcorder or phone camera 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.230
 because the picture makes products 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.180
 it's good but your videos are better 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 then you derivative and discover all our 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.060
 tests all noted saitek live from 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.340
 shenzhen in china 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.750
 jean bafoue say so go find out 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.750
 all after generic and after panic 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.760
 today today today we 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.860
 will test a stabilizer for cameras 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.659
 cameras or smartphone so you 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.640
 go see a product rather nice all 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.409
 relatively simple metal and yet 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.120
 not given that allow you to put 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.070
 directly from following your camera your 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 camera or your phone 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.390
 so this is a device that is rather 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.690
 easy with 1 removable sleeves 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 with a weight a counterweight that will you 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 allow in fact to stabilize a small 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.030
 little bit your camera when you go up 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.590
 and get off when you go to make 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.810
 effects but better beautiful words on 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 will stay in the box in the box 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.720
 so we will find the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.229
 stabilizer what is rather a 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 good news 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.729
 then the simulator will be delivered to him 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.649
 with its weights to know that peas 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 you will discover they are removable 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.789
 to see the unscrewed water 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.549
 allow weight or weight in fact 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.369
 Then there will be the joystick 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.080
 here so the task that is pretty good 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.140
 quality a the plastic is pretty good 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.380
 do you will also find the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.289
 support that there that will allow you 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.420
 of actually attached other devices by 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.780
 example a microphone where you can put 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 a projector another light or by 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.009
 example if you have a bait 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.689
 other devices for your device 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.729
 photo or your camera you can 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.020
 attach it with this device here you 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.700
 have a second props that is 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.430
 rather interesting that is the support 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.039
 for smartphones to these practices where he 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.780
 just put it directly 1 on 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.609
 the stabilizer and then put 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.039
 your smartphone on the other hand 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:14.760
 attention is limited in fact to the small 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.590
 smartphone 4 4 ​​5 inches maximum big 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.070
 2.5 inch smartphone in fact you do not 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.739
 do not come back too much 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.650
 then the multi-stabilizer 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.970
 positions that you discover here you 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.489
 you can actually manipulate 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.700
 the device and move it directly 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.370
 the weight on this one so choose in 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.920
 makes the right positioning to do the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.180
 counterweight with your device 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.400
 same at the handle this one 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.890
 is removable 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.320
 we can see here I can move 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.090
 in all positions and finally on 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.070
 the top you will be able to actually 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.569
 put your device directly into 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.950
 the police 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.150
 which will suit you there is not bad huh 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.010
 it's a bit like a gearbox 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.400
 in h 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.319
 good there more in there and you will be able 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.189
 actually put your camera directly 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.560
 in fact in pollution 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.569
 again the most important and the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.700
 more complicated will be to find the 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.159
 counterweight for the device to be 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.620
 well centered on this one 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:18.769
 so we went outside for 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.269
 test this stabilizer a little bit 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.120
 so we gave you a try first 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.450
 without a balloon and we simply walk and we 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.689
 at the camera at height at eye level 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.650
 in order to film for example the road and 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.840
 sell a little bit what's going on so 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.819
 this is true we have an effect we have a 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.669
 walking effect and it's not always 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.739
 most enjoyable then we have you 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.439
 do a second try with the same 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.260
 walk but there that the stabilizer and 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.669
 there we can realize that and ben 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.060
 it's better but again it's 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.489
 a job 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.199
 the stabilizer and a good device 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.780
 photo will not make you a filmmaker 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.609
 for as much cut it will take a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.290
 little bit to control the device but he 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.530
 is true that we feel a little less 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.579
 shaking with the stabilizer 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.359
 then we actually have a test that 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.849
 still works a little bit more 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.199
 concluding with the stairs then the 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.560
 lan down the stairs with the 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.509
 camera 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.459
 well here is where they are mounted as you 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:13.129
 want after we can do one or 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.530
 the other and we eventually made you 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.900
 is because we had to compare the 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.949
 same test with the stabilizer and there 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.419
 it makes sense and we see 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.699
 although in fact the camera is still 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.020
 much less shaken than what we 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.419
 could have finally what we could have 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.870
 do not have especially without the 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.870
 stabilizer 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.240
 so that's good it's conclusive where I 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.680
 can competitor then you what is this 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.090
 that we would have liked for the device and ben 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.800
 we will have beautiful and but this story of 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.780
 stabilization see it's still 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.190
 rather practical 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.770
 the product is pretty enough it is very 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.660
 well finished in color like that in red 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.820
 with black with the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.110
 the grill while it's quite nice in 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.500
 did it still quite well the 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.480
 job 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.680
 after a good time it will not make you a 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.390
 filmmaker for 99 euros but after 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.650
 if we learn to use this way we 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.870
 can make plans we have seen 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.700
 shots like that where it turns slowly or 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.140
 so they show like that we drank 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.880
 can do super nice things moment 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.770
 when I read in positions that are 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.520
 not always easy even if everyone 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.800
 some of you who are when 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.330
 Zionist the device will be rather practical 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.380
 question we will regret we are good on 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.490
 will regret the fact that it's a small 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.570
 compact it's true that even we 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.640
 in the street when we walk with 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.950
 our thing like that it's not super star 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.880
 and one for the shot so it will be really 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.170
 intended for those who want to make 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.730
 videos you want to do things a 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.380
 little nice with their phone and 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.730
 everything after we regret that the device 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.130
 is still a little heavy with 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.110
 the peas here well it's true that even 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.460
 if you will be able to change them 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.530
 does a device that is not well 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.620
 very light and finally we will appreciate 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.750
 last year the price at 99 euros 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.070
 good ben here after it's expensive cheap 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.970
 the product when of very good quality 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.560
 there in metal 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.790
 so it's like very very heavy it's 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.110
 especially for that in fact it to rise 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.490
 up to the level of the postage costs 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.170
 put a little bit but it makes a 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.910
 device that is rather nice and rather 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.990
 complete at mtx that's it for 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.880
 today is to love this video for 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.020
 flexibility of craton gt3 r r de 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.410
 flesh by sharing his videos about 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.200
 social networks 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.280
 here the r of comments leaving to 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.860
 comment on this video 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.450
 recalls if we can reach by 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.380
 miracle and 300 comments and well 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.450
 of you will gain this support for 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.010
 for smartphones or for devices 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.820
 photo for camera so there you can 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.590
 tell you what you think 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.180
 it's good it's not good you see 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.740
 utility you do not see the utility 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.370
 after that it will be a little bit of you to 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.330
 tell us and finally the blue thumb r 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.550
 because it's always a pleasure 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.930
 and then it will be 21 inches 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.190
 blue know anchor for work 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.520
 in the optics that's all for 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.900
 today 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.830
 I hope this little test will have more than 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.669
 it was a product we had when 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.710
 even under the sun for a while 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.330
 we wanted to use even ourselves 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.280
 myself and ourselves and 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.629
 and me is out and soon and 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.229
 soon and maybe even for 1 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.460
 go to fuck 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.990
 so you really had to know this 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.409
 product on technical it's all for 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.150
 today 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.469
 I'll meet you tomorrow 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.879
 for an upcoming video always in 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:46.129
 shenzhen city in china and 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.629
 Waiting it was greg geek your friend 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:49.879
 Chinese the most buzz blogger of the 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.770
 web the only bloggers who finishes 7 aces 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.210
 high tech with a little bit of humor and 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.430
 especially with a small pep a little peace 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.430
 prosperity randomness of an arm
