00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
picture of it right now we talked about

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
picture of it right now we talked about
a<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.259> bit<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.560> technobuffalo<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:05.909> while

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
there's a very good chance this is a

there's a very good chance this is a
fake<00:02:08.280> image<00:02:08.670> i<00:02:08.849> think<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.539> design<00:02:09.869> cues<00:02:10.289> that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
fake image i think the design cues that

fake image i think the design cues that
we're<00:02:10.619> seeing

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
we're seeing

reception well the answer is really know
what<00:02:25.690> Apple<00:02:25.960> did<00:02:26.110> was<00:02:26.320> instead<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.680> making<00:02:27.070> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
what Apple did was instead of making the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.610 
what Apple did was instead of making the
back<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.060> apple<00:02:28.450> logo<00:02:28.480> sort<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.470> look<00:02:29.590> like

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
back of the apple logo sort of look like

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.440 
back of the apple logo sort of look like
a<00:02:29.740> mirror<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.370> actually<00:02:30.670> right<00:02:30.940> where<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
a mirror it's actually right where the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.660 
a mirror it's actually right where the
Wi-Fi<00:02:32.320> radio<00:02:32.740> is<00:02:32.890> always<00:02:33.130> now<00:02:33.370> certainly

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
Wi-Fi radio is always now certainly

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.980 
Wi-Fi radio is always now certainly
there<00:02:33.730> have<00:02:33.850> been<00:02:34.120> some<00:02:34.270> Wi-Fi<00:02:34.690> reception

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
there have been some Wi-Fi reception

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.680 
there have been some Wi-Fi reception
issues<00:02:35.410> with<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.710> iPad<00:02:36.330> become<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.420> assume

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
issues with the iPad become the assume

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.030 
issues with the iPad become the assume
at<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.900> engineering<00:02:38.230> team<00:02:38.380> has<00:02:38.680> learned<00:02:38.860> from

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
at the engineering team has learned from

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.950 
at the engineering team has learned from
those<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.150> think<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.510> we<00:02:40.600> can't<00:02:40.840> actually

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
those so I think that we can't actually

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.630 
those so I think that we can't actually
get<00:02:41.260> an<00:02:41.410> all<00:02:41.530> aluminum<00:02:41.680> enclosure<00:02:42.040> and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
get an all aluminum enclosure and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.900 
get an all aluminum enclosure and

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
transfer fidelity that's one big one of

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.700 
transfer fidelity that's one big one of
the<00:02:48.520> big<00:02:48.640> knocks<00:02:48.880> on<00:02:49.150> having<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.720> wireless<00:02:50.200> that

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
the big knocks on having a wireless that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.050 
the big knocks on having a wireless that
was<00:02:50.830> also<00:02:51.070> why<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.250> first<00:02:51.520> generation<00:02:51.970> iphone

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
was also why the first generation iphone

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.850 
was also why the first generation iphone
serve<00:02:52.570> had<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.870> aluminum<00:02:53.290> on<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.410> top<00:02:53.650> and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
serve had the aluminum on the top and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.130 
serve had the aluminum on the top and
the<00:02:53.950> block<00:02:54.190> black<00:02:54.580> down<00:02:54.790> below<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.630> black<00:02:55.840> was

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
the block black down below the black was

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.740 
the block black down below the black was
where<00:02:56.380> all<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:57.190> sort<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.850> wires<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.480> teds

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
where all the sort of wires and teds

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.530 
where all the sort of wires and teds
were<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.290> on<00:02:59.770> the<00:02:59.890> iphone<00:03:00.370> 3g<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.060> 3gs<00:03:01.090> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
were and on the iphone 3g and 3gs the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.600 
were and on the iphone 3g and 3gs the
plastic<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:03.100> signal<00:03:03.430> could<00:03:03.550> be

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
plastic so the signal could be

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.550 
plastic so the signal could be
transmitted<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> bit<00:03:04.300> easier<00:03:04.390> so<00:03:05.140> let's<00:03:05.380> talk

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
transmitted a bit easier so let's talk

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.470 
transmitted a bit easier so let's talk
about<00:03:05.710> some<00:03:06.040> features<00:03:06.460> there's<00:03:06.820> been<00:03:06.970> talk<00:03:07.240> of

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
rumor circulating that AT&amp;T exclusivity

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.840 
rumor circulating that AT&amp;T exclusivity
is<00:05:07.530> actually<00:05:07.890> going<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.160> end<00:05:08.310> with<00:05:08.640> this

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
is actually going to end with this

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.540 
is actually going to end with this
upcoming<00:05:09.120> device<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:10.380> if<00:05:10.710> we<00:05:10.920> were<00:05:11.100> ever<00:05:11.280> going

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550

upcoming device so if we were ever going
to<00:05:11.670> get<00:05:11.760> an<00:05:11.880> iphone<00:05:12.150> on<00:05:12.240> verizon<00:05:12.270> i<00:05:12.720> think

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
to get an iphone on verizon i think

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.300 
to get an iphone on verizon i think
we've<00:05:12.990> got<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.260> best<00:05:13.440> chance<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.890> seeing<00:05:14.130> it

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
we've got the best chance of seeing it

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.550 
we've got the best chance of seeing it
on<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:15.300> fourth<00:05:15.600> generation<00:05:16.080> phone<00:05:16.290> which

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
on the fourth generation phone which

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.960 
on the fourth generation phone which
again<00:05:16.860> looks<00:05:17.070> like<00:05:17.160> we<00:05:17.280> could<00:05:17.400> end<00:05:17.550> up<00:05:17.670> seeing

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
again looks like we could end up seeing

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.440 
again looks like we could end up seeing
towards<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.020> tail<00:05:19.230> end<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.740> june<00:05:20.270> which<00:05:21.270> would

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450
