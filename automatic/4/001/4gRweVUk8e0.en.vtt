your fuel gauge if you will that shows

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.859 
your fuel gauge if you will that shows
you<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> state<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.640> charge<00:01:44.970> capacity<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.810> the

you the state of charge capacity in the

you the state of charge capacity in the

that's<00:01:52.829> based<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.460> historical<00:01:54.180> driving
