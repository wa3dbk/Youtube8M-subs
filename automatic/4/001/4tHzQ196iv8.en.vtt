scarf<00:00:49.050> y'all<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.890> camera<00:00:50.190> before

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
scarf y'all see this on camera before

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.330 
scarf y'all see this on camera before
and<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.019> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> an<00:00:52.710> average<00:00:53.100> sized

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and then this is just an average sized

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.650 
and then this is just an average sized
one<00:00:53.609> okay<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.539> um<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.410> wrap<00:00:56.039> my<00:00:56.160> hair<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.969> couple

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
one okay so um I wrap my hair a couple

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
one okay so um I wrap my hair a couple
different<00:00:57.750> ways<00:00:58.019> I<00:00:58.350> figured<00:00:59.160> since<00:00:59.339> my<00:00:59.489> hair

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
different ways I figured since my hair

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.549 
different ways I figured since my hair
is<00:00:59.789> half<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:00.570> now<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.019> might<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.289> well<00:01:01.320> do

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
is half up right now I might as well do

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.259 
is half up right now I might as well do
it<00:01:01.589> because<00:01:02.100> I'll<00:01:02.309> probably<00:01:02.339> either<00:01:02.940> wash

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
it because I'll probably either wash

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.360 
it because I'll probably either wash
them<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:04.019> doing<00:01:04.230> something<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.830> don't

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
them going or doing something I don't

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.410 
them going or doing something I don't
know<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.640> I'm<00:01:05.730> doing<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:05.940> my<00:01:06.000> hair<00:01:06.240> next

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
know what I'm doing with my hair next

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
know what I'm doing with my hair next

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
um probably my favorite way to wear a

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.139 
um probably my favorite way to wear a
wrap<00:01:28.890> would<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.979> basically<00:01:32.060> put<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
wrap would be like this basically put it

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.480 
wrap would be like this basically put it
on<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.329> head<00:01:33.710> if<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:34.860> leaving<00:01:34.979> hair<00:01:35.340> out

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
on your head if you're leaving hair out

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.889 
on your head if you're leaving hair out
leave<00:01:35.759> whatever<00:01:35.939> hear<00:01:36.299> you're<00:01:36.450> leaving<00:01:36.600> out

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
leave whatever hear you're leaving out

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.190 
leave whatever hear you're leaving out
and<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.350> probably<00:01:37.619> isn't<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.280> good

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
and this probably isn't going with good

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.889 
and this probably isn't going with good
but<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.560> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.009> take<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> then

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
but what you want to do take it and then

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:56.289 
but what you want to do take it and then
grab<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.350> where<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.950> tie<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.610> knot

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:06.560 

okay<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.720> we<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.110> time<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:58.680> not<00:02:04.280> okay<00:02:05.570> then

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
