well<00:00:00.179> I<00:00:00.210> think<00:00:00.269> if<00:00:00.510> I<00:00:01.199> can<00:00:01.260> make<00:00:01.530> some<00:00:01.680> shots<00:00:01.890> I

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
well I think if I can make some shots I

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.830 
well I think if I can make some shots I
think<00:00:02.250> that<00:00:02.550> would<00:00:02.669> help<00:00:02.790> you<00:00:03.510> know<00:00:03.629> there's

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
think that would help you know there's

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.200 
think that would help you know there's
no<00:00:04.020> table<00:00:04.230> Baker<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:05.009> those<00:00:05.220> guys<00:00:05.460> some

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
no table Baker and those guys some

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.579 
no table Baker and those guys some
perimeter<00:00:06.600> shots<00:00:06.810> we<00:00:06.990> couldn't<00:00:07.290> make<00:00:07.379> them

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
perimeter shots we couldn't make them

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.070 
perimeter shots we couldn't make them
and<00:00:07.859> now<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.269> will<00:00:09.420> help<00:00:09.570> they're

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
and now that that will help they're

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.530 
and now that that will help they're
there<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.410> get<00:00:10.559> well<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.639> had<00:00:11.849> some<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.480> know

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
there to get well we had some you know

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.390 
there to get well we had some you know
we<00:00:12.780> had<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> few<00:00:13.230> looks<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.679> wouldn't<00:00:13.950> say<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.250> had

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
we had a few looks I wouldn't say we had

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.640 
we had a few looks I wouldn't say we had
a<00:00:14.429> ton<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.790> them<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.780> ones<00:00:16.049> they<00:00:16.379> made<00:00:16.619> a

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
a ton of them but the ones they made a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.290 
a ton of them but the ones they made a
few<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> first<00:00:17.400> half<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.789> did<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.240> that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
few in the first half we did it and that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.580 
few in the first half we did it and that
was<00:00:18.510> probably<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.840> difference<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> game

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
was probably the difference in the game

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.370 
was probably the difference in the game
and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.760> thought<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.180> got<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.480> inside<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
and I thought we got it inside in the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.590 
and I thought we got it inside in the
first<00:00:22.529> half<00:00:22.830> gift<00:00:23.039> did<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.340> nice<00:00:23.519> job

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
first half gift did a nice job

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.929 
first half gift did a nice job
we<00:00:25.320> didn't<00:00:25.710> they<00:00:25.980> maybe<00:00:26.220> did<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> little<00:00:26.730> better

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
we didn't they maybe did a little better

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.820 
we didn't they maybe did a little better
job<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.599> weren't<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:27.930> patient<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> get<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
job or we weren't as patient to get it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.910 
job or we weren't as patient to get it
into<00:00:29.010> him<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.090> second<00:00:30.480> half<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.990> if<00:00:31.590> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
into him in the second half and if you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740 
into him in the second half and if you
know<00:00:32.009> if<00:00:32.099> they<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> body

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
know if they can do that and get a body

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.450 
know if they can do that and get a body
like<00:00:33.989> Thomas<00:00:34.410> got<00:00:34.559> his<00:00:34.680> body<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.070> him<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.340> him

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
like Thomas got his body on him got him

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
like Thomas got his body on him got him
so<00:00:35.640> deep<00:00:35.880> they<00:00:36.360> couldn't<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.840> much<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.440> so

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
so deep they couldn't do much on it so

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.920 
so deep they couldn't do much on it so
uh<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.550> know<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> don't<00:00:39.690> know

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
uh you know that you know I don't know

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.660 
uh you know that you know I don't know

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
if they have wichitawx really has to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.299 
if they have wichitawx really has to
balk<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.450> don't<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.780> Thomas<00:00:43.140> says<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.620> but

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
balk they don't like Thomas says so but

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.500 
balk they don't like Thomas says so but
they're<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.850> they're<00:00:45.030> big<00:00:45.149> guys<00:00:45.300> are

you know I think Kentucky proved that
they<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.340> play<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.690> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I guess they lost games about that you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.460 
I guess they lost games about that you
know<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:23.119> just<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.360> got<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.780> bad<00:01:25.170> luck<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
know it's just we got the bad luck of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.390 
know it's just we got the bad luck of
the<00:01:25.650> draw<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.950> think

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the draw you know one you know I think

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.310 
the draw you know one you know I think
you<00:01:32.640> gotta<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> an<00:01:32.970> efficient<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.600> offense<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you gotta be an efficient on offense and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.230 
you gotta be an efficient on offense and
take<00:01:34.530> advantage<00:01:34.950> whenever<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.729> give<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
take advantage whenever they give you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.230 
take advantage whenever they give you
stuff<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.460> switch<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.030> much

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
stuff and you know they switch so much

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
stuff and you know they switch so much
you<00:01:39.570> made<00:01:39.869> those<00:01:40.170> guys<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.619> pretty<00:01:40.770> mobile

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
you made those guys are pretty mobile

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
you made those guys are pretty mobile
when<00:01:41.549> they<00:01:41.700> switch<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.020> think

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
when they switch and now they you think
