00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.450
 bring new news about 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.820
 2015 weight licenses and other things that 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
 they revealed themselves recently not today 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.840
 I want to waste time so 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.840
 let's get to the point quickly 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.779
 the first news is that unfortunately 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.480
 lost the license of the Chilean league to 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.790
 fifa hands we will only have five 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.640
 chilean teams colo colo de chile 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.220
 catholic university o'higgins and union 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.170
 Spanish this is a real bucket of 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.690
 cold water for all the fans 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.260
 Chileans and this news was totally 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.260
 unexpected 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.050
 It's 2015 got the license of two 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.320
 German teams Borussia 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.420
 mönchengladbach vfl wolfsburg so 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.870
 now in total we would have five teams 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.870
 german 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.480
 the next news does not have to do 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.790
 with licenses but with the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.700
 requirements to play the game on the pc 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.710
 I'm going to leave this image for about 30 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.280
 seconds to read it and compare with 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.800
 your pc 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.070
 in my case I am very satisfied with these 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.070
 Requirements 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.659
 ah 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.310
 now I'm going with a news not so 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.720
 new but that are important and can 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.720
 there are people who have not heard 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.600
 the Brazilian league will have all the 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.880
 licensed equipment and we will also have 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.890
 with the Basque da gama in the section of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.350
 other South American teams along with 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.510
 the Chileans mentioned above but there 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.060
 a problem not all players 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.130
 they will have their real life name only 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.110
 the corinthians cruzeiro teams 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.090
 imagine yourself and palmeiras will have the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.610
 names of each of your players 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.590
 Real life great players without 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.810
 their real names like kaká or rogelio 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.480
 phoenix will be called each and rogelio 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.850
 respectively it is expected that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.270
 through dlcs add more names 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.270
 real 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.540
 good friends this is all for today a 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.310
 fast video but I think with 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.320
 valuable information 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.970
 Konami said that on October 15 he will 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.110

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.110
