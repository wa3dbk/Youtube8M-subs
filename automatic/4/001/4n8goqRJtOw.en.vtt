00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.780 
like his scramble building I like his
toughness<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.930> think<00:01:45.440> Aaron<00:01:45.680> Rodgers<00:01:46.040> makes<00:01:46.610> a

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
toughness I think Aaron Rodgers makes a

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.760 
toughness I think Aaron Rodgers makes a
difference<00:01:47.120> you<00:01:47.450> can<00:01:47.630> just<00:01:47.810> tell<00:01:48.050> in<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.740> end

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
difference you can just tell in the end

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.040 
difference you can just tell in the end
who's<00:01:49.340> got<00:01:49.610> championship-caliber<00:01:50.420> material

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
who's got championship-caliber material

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.070 
who's got championship-caliber material
and<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.500> think<00:01:51.800> Aaron<00:01:52.490> Rodgers<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.570> one<00:01:53.780> to

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
and I think Aaron Rodgers is the one to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.230 
and I think Aaron Rodgers is the one to
take<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:54.530> thing<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:54.950> get<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.640> done<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.000> I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
take this thing and get it done and I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.899 
take this thing and get it done and I
predicted<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.840> green<00:01:57.020> bay<00:01:57.200> packers<00:01:57.490> win<00:01:58.490> the

predicted the green bay packers win the

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.760 
predicted the green bay packers win the
NFC<00:01:59.210> Championship<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.140> we're<00:02:00.440> going<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.650> see

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770
