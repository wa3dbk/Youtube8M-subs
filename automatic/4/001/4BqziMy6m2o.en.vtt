these<00:01:14.420> are<00:01:14.659> approaches<00:01:15.140> not<00:01:15.409> used<00:01:15.890> in

conventional medicine now there are many

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.669 
conventional medicine now there are many
reasons<00:01:19.939> for<00:01:20.299> this<00:01:20.539> but<00:01:20.600> perhaps<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.469> biggest

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
reasons for this but perhaps the biggest

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.630 
reasons for this but perhaps the biggest
one<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.369> that<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.810> relatively<00:01:24.640> low-cost

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
one is that it is a relatively low-cost

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.889 
one is that it is a relatively low-cost
