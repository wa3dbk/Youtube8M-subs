use it alright and we're going to use
two<00:01:29.369> different<00:01:29.400> examples<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.470> let's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
two different examples of that and let's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.840 
two different examples of that and let's
go<00:01:32.009> ahead<00:01:32.390> into<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:35.479> image<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.850> this

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
go ahead into an image here we have this

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.010 
go ahead into an image here we have this
image<00:01:39.360> right<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:41.240> alright<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.509> saw<00:01:42.780> this

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
image right here alright you saw this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.740 
image right here alright you saw this
one<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> last<00:01:43.860> lesson<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.600> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
one in the last lesson and if you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.530 
one in the last lesson and if you
remember<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:47.220> did<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.850> straight<00:01:48.299> line

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
remember we did a straight line

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899 
remember we did a straight line
selection<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> way<00:01:49.860> across<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.250> water's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
selection all the way across the water's

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.319 
selection all the way across the water's
edge<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> free<00:01:52.380> hand<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:53.329> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
edge and then a free hand up the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.469 
edge and then a free hand up the
hillside<00:01:54.659> let's<00:01:55.470> zoom<00:01:55.979> up<00:01:56.219> real<00:01:56.700> tight<00:01:57.180> on

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
hillside let's zoom up real tight on

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.280 
hillside let's zoom up real tight on
that<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> clean

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that and what you see you see a clean

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.050 
that and what you see you see a clean
edge<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:03.049> hard<00:02:04.100> hard<00:02:05.100> means<00:02:05.490> no

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
edge but it's not hard hard means no

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.660 
edge but it's not hard hard means no
pixels<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.890> couple<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.459> three

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
pixels at all there's a couple of three

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.260 
pixels at all there's a couple of three
pixels<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.450> softness<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.379> even<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.090> edge

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
pixels of softness here even in the edge

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.820 
pixels of softness here even in the edge
of<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.020> trees

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
of the trees

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.450 
of the trees
just<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:15.150> softness<00:02:15.990> if<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:16.980> were<00:02:17.190> to

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
just a little softness if we were to

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.340 
just a little softness if we were to
make<00:02:17.790> remember<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.600> definition<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:21.350> feather

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
make remember the definition of feather

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.760 
make remember the definition of feather
is<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.180> thickness<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.570> softness<00:02:25.140> measured

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
is the thickness and softness measured

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.130 
is the thickness and softness measured
in<00:02:26.120> pixels<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.740> last<00:02:29.160> lesson<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.480> use

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
in pixels and in that last lesson I use

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.890 
in pixels and in that last lesson I use
two<00:02:31.560> pixels<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.220> didn't<00:02:32.520> explain<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.240> if<00:02:33.600> we

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
two pixels and didn't explain it if we

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.620 
two pixels and didn't explain it if we
had<00:02:34.020> used<00:02:34.350> 0<00:02:35.010> which<00:02:35.430> means<00:02:35.460> it's<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.030> hard<00:02:36.300> edge

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
had used 0 which means it's a hard edge

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.470 
had used 0 which means it's a hard edge
and<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.430> make<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> little<00:02:39.090> selection

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
and I just make a little selection

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.880 
and I just make a little selection
select<00:02:40.380> any<00:02:40.590> ocean<00:02:40.860> here<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.790> come<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.990> do

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
select any ocean here and come up and do

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.070 
select any ocean here and come up and do
a<00:02:43.920> straight<00:02:44.070> line<00:02:44.610> over<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.750> just

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
a straight line over to here and just

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.210 
a straight line over to here and just
work<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.980> area<00:02:48.170> right<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.230> here<00:02:51.800> there<00:02:52.800> we<00:02:52.980> go

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
work this area right in here there we go

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.130 
work this area right in here there we go
look<00:02:54.180> at<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.390> under<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.870> quick<00:02:55.410> mask<00:02:55.910> notice

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
look at it under the quick mask notice

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.760 
look at it under the quick mask notice
how<00:02:58.140> harsh<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.190> edge<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.870> jaggedy<00:03:01.530> and

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
how harsh the edge is it's jaggedy and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.810 
how harsh the edge is it's jaggedy and
it's<00:03:02.250> absolutely<00:03:02.959> hard<00:03:03.959> in<00:03:04.290> other<00:03:04.470> places<00:03:04.830> so

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
it's absolutely hard in other places so

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.070 
it's absolutely hard in other places so
if<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.180> make<00:03:06.450> an<00:03:06.750> adjustment<00:03:08.690> let's<00:03:09.690> just<00:03:09.810> say

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
if I make an adjustment let's just say

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.370 
if I make an adjustment let's just say

trees it's absolutely identifiable and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.620 
trees it's absolutely identifiable and
that's<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.840> giveaway<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.650> Photoshop<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:24.030> on<00:03:24.570> the
