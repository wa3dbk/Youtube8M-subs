00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
will be of some rain-x so let's get

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.140 
okay we've got the Windex set to Windex
phase<00:01:44.450> done<00:01:44.870> glass<00:01:45.800> is<00:01:46.070> nice<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.550> clean<00:01:46.760> but

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
phase done glass is nice and clean but

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.650 
phase done glass is nice and clean but
there's<00:01:47.810> probably<00:01:48.290> still<00:01:48.620> a<00:01:48.680> few<00:01:49.070> little<00:01:49.280> tiny

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
there's probably still a few little tiny

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.470 
there's probably still a few little tiny
smears<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:51.020> what-have-you<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:51.890> there<00:01:52.070> so

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
smears and what-have-you on there so

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.730 
smears and what-have-you on there so
we're<00:01:53.480> going<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.660> take<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.960> steel<00:01:54.200> wool<00:01:54.440> and

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
we're going to take the steel wool and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:13.620 
we're going to take the steel wool and
get<00:01:55.430> started<00:01:55.790> on<00:01:55.910> that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.510 

finished<00:02:14.630> phase<00:02:15.230> two<00:02:15.590> with<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.220> steel<00:02:16.489> wool

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
finished phase two with the steel wool

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.800 
finished phase two with the steel wool
so<00:02:17.090> far<00:02:17.390> we<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:18.050> been<00:02:18.410> at<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.800> for<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.670> total<00:02:20.450> of

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
so far we have been at it for a total of

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.339 
so far we have been at it for a total of
about<00:02:21.110> five<00:02:21.680> minutes<00:02:22.599> maybe<00:02:23.599> slightly<00:02:23.989> less

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
about five minutes maybe slightly less

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.940 
about five minutes maybe slightly less
than<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.430> next<00:02:25.550> step<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.709> dust<00:02:27.709> off

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
than that so the next step is dust off

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.890 
than that so the next step is dust off
the<00:02:28.160> windshield<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.849> get<00:02:29.180> rid<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.420> any<00:02:29.569> steel

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the windshield and get rid of any steel

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.199 
the windshield and get rid of any steel
wool<00:02:30.170> remnants<00:02:30.769> on<00:02:30.950> there<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.459> then<00:02:31.760> we<00:02:31.970> will

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
wool remnants on there and then we will

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.410 
wool remnants on there and then we will
apply<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.440> rain-x<00:02:33.860> now<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.700> thing<00:02:35.060> about<00:02:35.269> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
apply the rain-x now the thing about the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.990 
apply the rain-x now the thing about the
rain-x<00:02:35.599> is<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.380> put<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.709> on<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.760> little

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
rain-x is you put it on in a little

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.270 
rain-x is you put it on in a little
circular<00:02:38.480> motion<00:02:39.019> cover<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.130> whole

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
circular motion cover the whole

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.059 
circular motion cover the whole
windshield<00:02:40.610> let<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.360> dry<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.810> haze<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.530> then

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
windshield let it dry to a haze and then

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.340 
windshield let it dry to a haze and then
buff<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.819> off<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.360> then<00:02:44.900> you're<00:02:45.049> good<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.230> go

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
buff it off and then you're good to go

00:02:45.350 --> 00:03:18.070 
buff it off and then you're good to go

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.170 

we<00:03:19.080> have<00:03:19.260> applied<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.890> rain-x<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
we have applied the rain-x to the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.650 
we have applied the rain-x to the
windshield<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.080> as<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.220> see<00:03:23.630> we<00:03:24.630> are

getting a hazy film over the glass so
we're<00:03:33.210> just<00:03:33.240> about<00:03:33.660> ready<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:34.050> wipe<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.710> off

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.710 

and<00:03:56.739> there<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:57.010> have<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:59.640> about<00:04:00.640> ten<00:04:01.510> minutes

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
and there you have it about ten minutes

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.440 
and there you have it about ten minutes
altogether<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:05.760> think<00:04:06.760> that's<00:04:06.970> going<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.209> take

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
altogether I think that's going to take

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.490 
altogether I think that's going to take
care<00:04:07.720> of<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:07.989> now<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.709> next<00:04:08.860> time<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.430> rains

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
care of it now the next time it rains

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.020 
care of it now the next time it rains
we'll<00:04:11.500> just<00:04:11.709> see<00:04:11.860> how<00:04:12.010> good<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.459> water<00:04:12.670> runs

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
we'll just see how good the water runs

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.990 
we'll just see how good the water runs
off<00:04:13.890> until<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:14.950> speak<00:04:15.280> with<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.580> again<00:04:15.700> and

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
off until I speak with you again and

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.489 
off until I speak with you again and
even<00:04:16.120> after<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:18.220> stay<00:04:18.459> safe
