00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
in the future and so malleable it's

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.640 
in the future and so malleable it's
changed<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:29.910> many<00:02:30.000> times<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.900> feels<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.440> it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
changed so many times it feels like it

changed so many times it feels like it
doesn't<00:02:31.860> matter<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.580> what<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.910> think<00:02:33.180> comic

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
doesn't matter and what I think comic

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.479

continuity<00:03:03.870> which<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> very<00:03:04.380> smart<00:03:04.650> thing

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
continuity which is a very smart thing

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.620 
continuity which is a very smart thing
about<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.340> well<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.610> think<00:03:05.700> Geoff<00:03:06.390> Johns

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
about this is well I think Geoff Johns

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.690 
about this is well I think Geoff Johns
loves<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.350> Legion<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.830> he<00:03:08.070> was<00:03:08.190> using<00:03:08.430> them<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
loves the Legion and he was using them a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.789 
loves the Legion and he was using them a
lot<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.060> time<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.720> continuity<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> very<00:03:10.590> real

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
lot and time and continuity a very real

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.170 
lot and time and continuity a very real
way<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> think<00:03:11.400> he's<00:03:11.549> trying<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.820> make<00:03:12.000> them

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
way and I think he's trying to make them

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.150 
way and I think he's trying to make them
relevant<00:03:12.390> again<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.019> mean<00:03:13.320> when<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.890> Legion
