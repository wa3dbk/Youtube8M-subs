corner<00:01:24.930> which<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.350> good<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.189> want

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
corner which is good because you want

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.219 
corner which is good because you want
the<00:01:26.460> most<00:01:26.580> concentration<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.360> color<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.810> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.240 
that you prefer I tend not to touch the
tail<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.360> my<00:02:30.599> brow<00:02:30.780> at<00:02:30.959> all<00:02:31.110> because<00:02:31.440> once

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
tail of my brow at all because once

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.759 
tail of my brow at all because once
again<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:33.090> area<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.630> typically<00:02:34.110> washed<00:02:34.470> out

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
again that area is typically washed out

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.440 
again that area is typically washed out
in<00:02:34.920> photographs<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.000> good<00:02:36.090> idea<00:02:36.239> to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
in photographs so it's a good idea to

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.809 
in photographs so it's a good idea to
leave<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.750> strong<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.100> over<00:02:38.400> softened

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
leave it strong and if you over softened

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.759 
leave it strong and if you over softened
just<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.239> ahead<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.600> fill<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.230> those<00:02:40.350> areas

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
just go ahead and fill in those areas

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.949 
just go ahead and fill in those areas
again<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.310> your<00:02:41.430> Mac<00:02:41.610> 266<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.630> whatever<00:02:42.840> is
