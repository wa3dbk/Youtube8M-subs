00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.760 
feet of this and then I'm going to go
down<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.700> other<00:02:41.730> side<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.930> when<00:02:43.230> i<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
down the other side so when i get to the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.100 
down the other side so when i get to the
other<00:02:43.890> side<00:02:44.190> i'll<00:02:44.730> let<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.210> know<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.720> i<00:02:46.050> can

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
other side i'll let you know and i can

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.600 
other side i'll let you know and i can
show<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> little<00:02:47.040> better<00:02:47.280> but

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
show it to you a little better but

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.380 
show it to you a little better but
that's<00:02:47.820> what<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:49.080> series<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.830> loops

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
that's what this is the series of loops

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.450 
that's what this is the series of loops
hold<00:02:51.390> through<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.870> holes<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:53.450> through<00:02:55.460> the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
hold through the holes and through the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.570 
hold through the holes and through the
next<00:02:56.670> loop<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.690> reach<00:02:58.380> through<00:02:58.860> grab<00:02:59.160> that

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
next loop so reach through grab that

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.570 
next loop so reach through grab that
thing<00:03:00.050> pull<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.200> pull<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:02.390> go<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.630> next<00:03:03.810> one

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
thing pull it pull it go to the next one

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.620 
thing pull it pull it go to the next one
26<00:03:05.580> feet<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.300> then<00:03:08.150> turn<00:03:09.150> around<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
26 feet of this and then turn around and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.620 
26 feet of this and then turn around and
do<00:03:10.110> another<00:03:10.200> 26<00:03:10.830> feet<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.940> i'll<00:03:12.270> see<00:03:12.300> on<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
do another 26 feet so i'll see on the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.110 
do another 26 feet so i'll see on the
other<00:03:12.840> side
