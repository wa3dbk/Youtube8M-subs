00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello to you with you hinter this 34 series 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.390
 losing equal experiments which 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.519
 Vorsk paired with Qatar 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.099
 the replicator is a special mechanism 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.200
 which creates various items from 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.960
 liquid matter to craft 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.930
 replicator we will need a fortified 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.160
 stone fortified glass 3 or port to 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.570
 f and 2 high voltage transformers 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.310
 followed we have it fixed 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.160
 it looks like in this way better 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.500
 just put it so that you have 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.230
 turned to the left the matter generator 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 on the right, store the templates next to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.690
 the keeper of the patterns was the scanner so 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.660
 way can immediately be 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.360
 generated loss to apply to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.309
 replicator and in riply qatar choose 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.860
 various items you need 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.289
 create by taking templates from custodians 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.449
 templates because if you don't have 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.520
 next to the clinic templates then you can't 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.410
 choose what item to create you 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.500
 here will be unavailable and the field can 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.470
 of course how are you and matter generator 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 put in the distance and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.659
 generated matter injected by 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.670
 pipes but you too will be much more difficult 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.369
 will require more resources 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.270
 or if you have zero build craft or 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.490
 real craft 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 you save first generated 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.700
 matter in big tanks and then from 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.659
 him rocking the matter and pumping in and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.430
 in the replicator but the most optimal 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.850
 the compact version is like this 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.869
 accommodation now immediately be possible and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.430
 I give him the matter to submit to the replicator 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.020
 store from templates allows in ripley 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.930
 Qatar choose an item on which 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.000
 you need to create here 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.320
 matter replicator can be from different angles 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.399
 top bottom side back for example from i 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.399
 now turn on the engine 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.409
 here matter went off and when she 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:13.160
 fully come along the roads here we are 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:17.450
 see an increase here we see lies with us 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.739
 to mother we will increase so interfaces 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.480
 the replicator here is the reservoir 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.280
 where is shown the amount of liquid matter in 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.500
 this moment 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.430
 two cells here fit the capsules with 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.140
 mothers I gather empty capsules here 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.800
 this button is responsible for stopping 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.920
 process 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.250
 this button is responsible for creating one 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.130
 units of this item but this one 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.170
 button is responsible for the constant creation 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:53.600
 this item until you run out 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:56.530
 energy or matter in the replicator can 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.170
 maximum put accelerator and 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.579
 ejector ejector it is necessary 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.010
 in order for items 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.530
 the replicator automatically fell into 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.200
 a chest without the use of various pipes 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.320
 and complement mechanisms example if 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.989
 put we see us catching people 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.170
 immediately moved to the chest if we 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:23.269
 pull out it will be here again 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:25.850
 stay out of the matter generator 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.829
 adjacent standing all matter transfer to 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.989
 replicator must be put 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.350
 improvement liquid push out or we 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.010
 see matter here with us here 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.010
 any 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.050
 you can certainly add some more 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.630
 accelerators it will speed up the process of creating 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.850
 various items the only negative 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.040
 what before you create any 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.410
 the subject you must him 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.410
 scan in scanner 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.810
 then either write it on crystal 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.150
 the disk of which here will be crisp either 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.709
 if you have a number of templates to keep near 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.930
 save it to the template savers 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.000
 only then here choose this 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.190
 thing 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.739
 if the replicator is getting old you can 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.190
 select it here for example on my disk 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.680
 saved iridium kind I save it 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.080
 the keeper of the patterns and now I have it 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.530
 available fine stop click here with us 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.020
 iridium species 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.330
 I start the process of creating it 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.470
 spit it up the hordes of creating a very long and 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.620
 requires a large amount 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.720
 electricity and liquid matter so y 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.070
 me electricity is over well yes 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.479
 okay principle i told you 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.160
 you can dismantle the matter generator 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.620
 using a wrench or electric key 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.720
 so take the key lessons or wrench and 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.940
 right click all of us 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.160
 his mother's generator was being repaired 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.570
 lying on it all thank you for your attention 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.860
 put likes subscribe to my 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.860
 channel and see you soon
