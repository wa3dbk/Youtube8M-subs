00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.190 

in<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.909> lesson<00:00:03.179> we'll<00:00:03.480> be<00:00:03.629> learning<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.170> to

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
in this lesson we'll be learning how to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.340 
in this lesson we'll be learning how to
write<00:00:04.680> an<00:00:04.920> equation<00:00:05.279> for<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:06.060> linear<00:00:06.600> table<00:00:07.170> of

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
write an equation for a linear table of

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.270 
write an equation for a linear table of
values<00:00:08.599> so<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> first<00:00:09.990> thing<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.710> we<00:00:11.130> need

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
values so the first thing that we need

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.100 
values so the first thing that we need
to<00:00:11.370> know<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.059> basic<00:00:12.599> form<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.019> a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
to know is what the basic form of a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.320 
to know is what the basic form of a
linear<00:00:13.349> equation<00:00:13.559> looks<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
linear equation looks like and the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.230 
linear equation looks like and the
standard<00:00:15.809> form<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.500> linear<00:00:16.619> equation<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.430> y

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
standard form of a linear equation is y

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.590 
standard form of a linear equation is y
equals<00:00:18.350> MX<00:00:20.210> plus<00:00:21.210> B<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:23.090> it's<00:00:24.090> always<00:00:24.449> going

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
equals MX plus B and it's always going

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.300 
equals MX plus B and it's always going
to<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> same<00:00:25.170> format<00:00:25.650> all<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.099> need<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
to be in the same format all we need to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.390 
to be in the same format all we need to
fill<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.699> are<00:00:27.029> M<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.930> B<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.500> Y<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.859> X<00:00:29.039> parts

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
fill in are M and B so the Y and X parts

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.009 
fill in are M and B so the Y and X parts
will<00:00:29.580> never<00:00:29.730> change<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.840> figure

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
will never change we just have to figure

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.709 
will never change we just have to figure
out<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:32.130> our<00:00:32.160> rate<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> starting<00:00:33.390> point<00:00:33.570> are

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
out what our rate and starting point are

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.540 
out what our rate and starting point are
our<00:00:33.930> slope<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.559> y-intercept<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.399> are

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
our slope and y-intercept is are

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.080 
our slope and y-intercept is are
sometimes<00:00:35.940> called<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:37.140> M<00:00:37.670> which<00:00:38.670> goes<00:00:38.879> before

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
sometimes called so M which goes before

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.569 
sometimes called so M which goes before
the<00:00:39.329> X<00:00:39.510> represents<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> rate<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.219> table

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the X represents the rate of your table

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.860 
the X represents the rate of your table
so<00:00:41.760> let's<00:00:41.910> figure<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.270> how<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.450> find<00:00:42.750> that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
so let's figure out how to find that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.590 
so let's figure out how to find that
first<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:45.390> find<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> rate<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.789> need<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> find<00:00:48.210> my

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
first to find the rate I need to find my

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.939 
first to find the rate I need to find my
change<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.410> Y<00:00:49.469> over<00:00:50.239> my<00:00:51.239> change<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:52.020> X<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.800> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
change in Y over my change in X and so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.850 
change in Y over my change in X and so
this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> way<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.430> measuring<00:00:53.760> how<00:00:54.000> quickly

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
this is a way of measuring how quickly

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.090 
this is a way of measuring how quickly
the<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.480> table<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> growing<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> look<00:00:58.949> at

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the the table is growing so to look at

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
the the table is growing so to look at
my<00:00:59.250> change<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.850> Y<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.809> I'm<00:01:00.930> looking<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
my change in Y what I'm looking for is

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
my change in Y what I'm looking for is
just<00:01:01.590> how<00:01:01.859> much<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.219> Y's<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.670> changing<00:01:03.030> my

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
just how much my Y's are changing my

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
just how much my Y's are changing my
every<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.080> first<00:01:04.379> row<00:01:04.619> it's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
every time so for this first row it's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.179 
every time so for this first row it's
decreasing<00:01:05.580> by<00:01:05.700> 8<00:01:06.049> while<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.229> x<00:01:07.500> change<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
decreasing by 8 while my x change is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.980 
decreasing by 8 while my x change is
positive<00:01:08.970> 12

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
positive 12

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
positive 12
so<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> means<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.340> slope<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.270> first

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so that means my slope for this first

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.170 
so that means my slope for this first
row<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.950> equal<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.460> negative<00:01:14.700> 8

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
row is going to be equal to negative 8

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.130 
row is going to be equal to negative 8
over<00:01:15.750> 12<00:01:17.060> now<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> order<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.960> linear

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
over 12 now in order for it to be linear

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
over 12 now in order for it to be linear
every<00:01:19.920> row<00:01:20.159> has<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.509> same<00:01:22.159> slope<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
every row has to have the same slope so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.550 
every row has to have the same slope so
if<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.210> look<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.509> my<00:01:24.689> wide<00:01:24.900> change<00:01:25.170> over<00:01:25.409> X

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
if I look at my wide change over X

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
if I look at my wide change over X
change<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> second<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.600> my<00:01:27.960> Y

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
change from the second one this one my Y

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.460 
change from the second one this one my Y
is<00:01:28.229> increasing<00:01:28.590> by<00:01:29.130> 4<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.909> my<00:01:30.540> X<00:01:30.810> change<00:01:31.259> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
is increasing by 4 and my X change is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.340 
is increasing by 4 and my X change is
minus<00:01:32.220> 6<00:01:32.579> now<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.509> might<00:01:33.720> look<00:01:33.750> different<00:01:34.049> at

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
minus 6 now this might look different at

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
minus 6 now this might look different at
first<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.340> might<00:01:35.579> also<00:01:35.909> realize<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.299> if

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
first but you might also realize that if

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.080 
first but you might also realize that if
I<00:01:36.659> write<00:01:36.960> change<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.619> Y<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:37.770> change<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.369> X<00:01:38.430> I'm

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
I write change in Y over change in X I'm

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.810 
I write change in Y over change in X I'm
going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.900> negative<00:01:39.930> 4<00:01:40.650> 6<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
going to get negative 4 6 which is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
going to get negative 4 6 which is
actually<00:01:42.180> equivalent<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> negative<00:01:43.049> 8<00:01:43.470> 12<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
actually equivalent to negative 8 12 and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.069 
actually equivalent to negative 8 12 and
if<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.610> were<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.360> every<00:01:45.509> row<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> my

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
if I were to do this for every row of my

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.289 
if I were to do this for every row of my
table<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.340> find<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
table what I would find was that the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.240 
table what I would find was that the
fractions<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.140> got<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.500> my<00:01:49.560> slope<00:01:49.979> would

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
fractions that I got for my slope would

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580 
fractions that I got for my slope would
always<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.729> equivalent<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> good

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
always be equivalent now it's a good

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.190 
always be equivalent now it's a good
idea<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.009> reduce<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.960> so

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
idea to reduce this as much as we can so

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.420 
idea to reduce this as much as we can so
I'm<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> go<00:01:55.560> ahead<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.860> reduce<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
I'm going to go ahead and reduce it to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.819 
I'm going to go ahead and reduce it to
negative<00:01:56.759> 2/3<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:59.420> that's<00:02:00.420> my<00:02:00.750> slope<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
negative 2/3 and that's my slope and

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.469 
negative 2/3 and that's my slope and
that's<00:02:02.040> what's<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> go<00:02:02.759> before<00:02:03.240> X

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that's what's going to go before X

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
that's what's going to go before X
that's<00:02:03.810> my<00:02:03.930> M<00:02:04.200> value<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.250> my<00:02:05.369> equation<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that's my M value so my equation is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.469 
that's my M value so my equation is
going<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.180> y<00:02:06.360> equals<00:02:06.750> negative<00:02:06.960> 2/3<00:02:07.890> times

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
going to be y equals negative 2/3 times

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.130 
going to be y equals negative 2/3 times
X<00:02:09.649> plus<00:02:10.649> whatever<00:02:11.250> my<00:02:11.459> B<00:02:11.760> value<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:12.959> there

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
X plus whatever my B value is now there

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.900 
X plus whatever my B value is now there
are<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> couple<00:02:13.379> ways<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
are a couple ways you

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.060 
are a couple ways you
find<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.270> B<00:02:14.450> value<00:02:14.900> if<00:02:15.110> you're<00:02:15.680> dealing<00:02:16.040> with

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
find the B value if you're dealing with

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.270 
find the B value if you're dealing with
the<00:02:16.280> table<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.850> has<00:02:17.230> zero<00:02:18.230> for<00:02:18.560> X<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.070> if<00:02:19.160> I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
the table that has zero for X so if I

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.420 
the table that has zero for X so if I
had<00:02:19.520> maybe<00:02:20.180> another<00:02:20.540> row<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:20.960> here<00:02:21.470> where<00:02:22.130> X

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
had maybe another row in here where X

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.780 
had maybe another row in here where X
was<00:02:22.700> zero<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.840> knew<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.230> y<00:02:24.380> value<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:25.490> B

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
was zero and I knew the y value my B

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.760 
was zero and I knew the y value my B
value<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.300> always<00:02:26.660> going<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.930> right<00:02:27.200> here

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
value is always going to be right here

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.020 
value is always going to be right here
next<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.030> where<00:02:29.240> X<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.840> zero<00:02:30.460> but<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.610> table

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
next to where X is zero but this table

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.400 
next to where X is zero but this table
doesn't<00:02:32.240> have<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.020> I'm<00:02:33.110> going<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.260> have

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
doesn't have that so I'm going to have

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.460 
doesn't have that so I'm going to have
to<00:02:33.560> figure<00:02:33.770> out<00:02:33.920> what<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.280> different<00:02:34.670> way

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
to figure out what it is a different way

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.140 
to figure out what it is a different way
so<00:02:36.470> what<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.680> can<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.310> use<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.760> part<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.030> my

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
so what I can do is use the part of my

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.730 
so what I can do is use the part of my
equation<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.110> far

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
equation that I have so far

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.850 
equation that I have so far
which<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.280> y<00:02:40.490> equals<00:02:40.820> negative<00:02:40.880> two-thirds<00:02:41.630> X

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
which is y equals negative two-thirds X

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.650 
which is y equals negative two-thirds X
see<00:02:42.860> what<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.310> gets<00:02:43.610> me<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:44.240> see<00:02:44.510> what

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
see what that gets me and then see what

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.420 
see what that gets me and then see what
I<00:02:44.690> need<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.050> add<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.830> get<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.130> number

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
I need to add to it to get the number

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.580 
I need to add to it to get the number
that<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.640> want<00:02:46.820> so<00:02:47.750> what<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.380> is

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
that I want so what I like to do is

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.560 
that I want so what I like to do is
actually<00:02:48.800> add<00:02:49.100> sort<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.910> middle<00:02:50.210> column

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
actually add sort of a middle column

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.470 
actually add sort of a middle column
into<00:02:50.690> my<00:02:50.780> table<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:52.970> middle<00:02:53.270> column

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
into my table and in this middle column

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.750 
into my table and in this middle column
I'm<00:02:53.870> going<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.230> write<00:02:54.590> whatever<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.220> get<00:02:55.550> when<00:02:55.730> I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
I'm going to write whatever I get when I

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.500 
I'm going to write whatever I get when I
do<00:02:56.150> negative<00:02:56.870> two-thirds<00:02:57.620> X<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.420> then<00:02:59.420> I'm

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
do negative two-thirds X and then I'm

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.360 
do negative two-thirds X and then I'm
going<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.690> see<00:02:59.870> how<00:03:00.050> far<00:03:00.320> away<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.590> am<00:03:00.920> from<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
going to see how far away I am from the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.900 
going to see how far away I am from the
Y<00:03:01.520> value<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.180> actually<00:03:02.360> want<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.490> if<00:03:04.490> X<00:03:04.730> is

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
Y value that I actually want so if X is

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.020 
Y value that I actually want so if X is
three<00:03:05.770> let's<00:03:06.770> see<00:03:07.010> one<00:03:07.310> third<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.700> three<00:03:07.880> would

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
three let's see one third of three would

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.240 
three let's see one third of three would
be<00:03:08.150> one<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:08.960> need<00:03:09.080> negative<00:03:09.530> two-thirds<00:03:10.070> so

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
be one but I need negative two-thirds so

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.290 
be one but I need negative two-thirds so
that's<00:03:10.430> going<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.700> be<00:03:11.060> negative<00:03:11.740> two<00:03:14.890> if<00:03:16.060> X<00:03:17.060> is

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
that's going to be negative two if X is

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.400 
that's going to be negative two if X is
15<00:03:17.959> then<00:03:18.830> let's<00:03:19.520> see<00:03:19.730> two<00:03:19.970> thirds<00:03:20.240> of<00:03:20.420> 15<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.020> 10

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
15 then let's see two thirds of 15 is 10

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.630 
15 then let's see two thirds of 15 is 10
but<00:03:21.709> it's<00:03:21.830> negative<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.430> would<00:03:22.550> be

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
but it's negative so this would be

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.790 
but it's negative so this would be
negative<00:03:23.060> 10<00:03:27.400> when<00:03:28.400> x<00:03:28.820> equals<00:03:29.390> 9<00:03:29.720> if<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.560> find

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
negative 10 when x equals 9 if I find

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.790 
negative 10 when x equals 9 if I find
negative<00:03:31.070> 2/3<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.850> 9<00:03:32.030> well<00:03:32.270> 2/3<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.780> 9<00:03:32.990> is<00:03:33.170> 6<00:03:33.530> so

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
negative 2/3 of 9 well 2/3 of 9 is 6 so

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.220 
negative 2/3 of 9 well 2/3 of 9 is 6 so
negative<00:03:34.160> 2/3<00:03:34.490> of<00:03:34.580> 9<00:03:34.730> will<00:03:34.880> be<00:03:34.910> negative<00:03:35.330> 6<00:03:38.230> and

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
negative 2/3 of 9 will be negative 6 and

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.860 
negative 2/3 of 9 will be negative 6 and
so<00:03:39.950> what<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.430> need<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.760> figure<00:03:40.970> out<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.360> how<00:03:41.390> far

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
so what I need to figure out is how far

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.420 
so what I need to figure out is how far
away<00:03:42.110> am<00:03:42.380> i<00:03:42.620> from<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.040> number<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.400> I

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
away am i from the number that I

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.560 
away am i from the number that I
actually<00:03:43.640> want<00:03:44.150> well<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.810> go<00:03:44.989> from<00:03:46.060> negative<00:03:47.060> 2

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
actually want well to go from negative 2

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.280 
actually want well to go from negative 2
to<00:03:47.600> 20<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.200> have<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.560> add<00:03:49.270> 22<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.959> go<00:03:51.080> from

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
to 20 I have to add 22 to go from

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.880 
to 20 I have to add 22 to go from
negative<00:03:51.500> 10<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.010> 12<00:03:52.580> I<00:03:52.880> have<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.060> add<00:03:53.270> 22<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.770> go

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
negative 10 to 12 I have to add 22 to go

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.580 
negative 10 to 12 I have to add 22 to go
from<00:03:55.100> negative<00:03:55.310> 6<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.940> 16<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.780> add<00:03:56.900> 22

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
from negative 6 to 16 I have to add 22

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.180 
from negative 6 to 16 I have to add 22
so<00:03:58.220> 2<00:03:58.280> negative<00:03:59.030> 2/3<00:03:59.870> X<00:04:00.020> gets<00:04:00.500> me<00:04:00.680> part<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.130> the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
so 2 negative 2/3 X gets me part of the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.430 
so 2 negative 2/3 X gets me part of the
way<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.459> my<00:04:01.670> Y<00:04:01.850> value<00:04:02.300> but<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.840> get<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.110> rest<00:04:03.320> of

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
way to my Y value but to get the rest of

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.460 
way to my Y value but to get the rest of
the<00:04:03.560> way<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.680> have<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:03.980> add<00:04:04.100> 22<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.360> my<00:04:05.510> V<00:04:05.810> my<00:04:06.170> B

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
the way I have to add 22 so my V my B

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.479 
the way I have to add 22 so my V my B
value<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.890> going<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.250> be<00:04:07.400> plus<00:04:08.140> 22<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.470> if<00:04:10.370> I

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
value is going to be plus 22 and if I

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.640 
value is going to be plus 22 and if I
were<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.730> fill<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.090> my<00:04:11.209> table<00:04:11.630> next<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.989> 0

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
were to fill in my table next to 0

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.430 
were to fill in my table next to 0
that's<00:04:13.040> where<00:04:13.310> 22<00:04:13.940> would<00:04:14.120> go<00:04:14.300> because<00:04:15.110> our<00:04:15.260> B

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
that's where 22 would go because our B

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.800 
that's where 22 would go because our B
value<00:04:15.470> is<00:04:15.800> also<00:04:16.040> found<00:04:16.459> on<00:04:16.640> our<00:04:16.700> table<00:04:17.359> next<00:04:17.630> to

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
value is also found on our table next to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.590 
value is also found on our table next to
0<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:19.190> my<00:04:19.340> final<00:04:19.700> equation<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.180> going<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.390> be<00:04:20.480> y

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
0 so my final equation is going to be y

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.860 
0 so my final equation is going to be y
equals<00:04:20.959> negative<00:04:21.109> 2/3<00:04:21.770> x<00:04:22.010> plus<00:04:22.370> 22<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.450> that's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
equals negative 2/3 x plus 22 and that's

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.510 
equals negative 2/3 x plus 22 and that's
how<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:24.110> can<00:04:24.350> write<00:04:24.560> an<00:04:24.770> equation<00:04:25.100> for<00:04:25.460> a

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
how you can write an equation for a

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.240 
how you can write an equation for a
linear<00:04:25.729> table
