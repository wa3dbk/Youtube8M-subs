one not two not three but a whole feast
of<00:00:22.769> archers<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.550> fact<00:00:24.269> 214<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.260> together<00:00:25.380> can

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
of archers in fact 214 or together can

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.070 
of archers in fact 214 or together can
be<00:00:25.830> used<00:00:26.150> of<00:00:27.150> course<00:00:27.210> barbarians<00:00:27.960> are

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080

be used of course barbarians are
optional<00:00:28.519> what<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:29.849> means<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.300> that

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
optional what that really means is that

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.479 
optional what that really means is that
you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.779> chase<00:00:31.019> curbs<00:00:31.320> without<00:00:32.040> using<00:00:32.340> too

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
you can chase curbs without using too

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.830 
you can chase curbs without using too
many<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.850> these<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.320> let's<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.620> started<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> in

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
many of these so let's get started so in

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.799 
many of these so let's get started so in
this<00:00:37.079> first<00:00:37.320> replay<00:00:38.300> it's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> pretty<00:00:39.570> tough

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
this first replay it's a pretty tough

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900 
this first replay it's a pretty tough
base<00:00:40.050> actually<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.190> half<00:00:41.430> leg<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.760> half

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
base actually you know half leg in half

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
base actually you know half leg in half
lava<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> first<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.280> really

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
lava so first of all it's really

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.529 
lava so first of all it's really
important<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> take<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.110> more<00:00:46.289> toes<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
important to take out that more toes to

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.270 
important to take out that more toes to
max<00:00:48.539> level<00:00:49.309> lightning<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.360> fact<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:52.280> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
max level lightning or in fact to the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.950 
max level lightning or in fact to the
second<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> highest<00:00:53.910> level<00:00:54.300> lightnings<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
second to highest level lightnings and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.069 
second to highest level lightnings and
take<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.770> any<00:00:55.980> more<00:00:56.280> tile<00:00:56.550> whatsoever<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
take out any more tile whatsoever so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.950 
take out any more tile whatsoever so
take<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.500> more<00:00:58.770> tasks<00:00:59.510> in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> areas<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
take out more tasks in the areas that

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
take out more tasks in the areas that
you<00:01:01.140> want<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.410> deploy<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.190> archers<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.699> then

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you want to deploy your archers and then

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.230 
you want to deploy your archers and then
deploy<00:01:03.149> them<00:01:03.390> nice<00:01:03.870> low<00:01:04.350> line<00:01:04.939> all<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.180> way

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
deploy them nice low line all the way

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
deploy them nice low line all the way
around<00:01:06.470> now<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.619> you're<00:01:07.770> trying<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.189> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
around now what you're trying to do is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270 
around now what you're trying to do is
soften<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> outside<00:01:09.659> defenses<00:01:10.500> when

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
soften up the outside defenses when

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.130 
soften up the outside defenses when
you're<00:01:11.430> choosing<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.939> base<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.540> must<00:01:12.720> really

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
you're choosing a base you must really

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
you're choosing a base you must really
look<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.710> basis<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.250> there's<00:01:14.400> lots<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
look for basis where there's lots of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.969 
look for basis where there's lots of
exposed<00:01:16.400> exposed<00:01:17.400> buildings<00:01:18.770> because<00:01:19.770> it's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
exposed exposed buildings because it's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.190 
exposed exposed buildings because it's
caught<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.220> quite<00:01:20.400> common<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:21.200> so

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
caught they're quite common really so

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.600 
caught they're quite common really so
you<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.470> draw<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.890> line<00:01:23.040> across<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
you just draw the line across and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
you just draw the line across and
probably<00:01:26.610> getting<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.850> answer<00:01:26.970> about<00:01:27.270> 25<00:01:27.869> 26

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
probably getting an answer about 25 26

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.740 
probably getting an answer about 25 26
percent<00:01:28.829> maybe<00:01:29.250> 30<00:01:29.520> percent<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
percent maybe 30 percent just with that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.730 
percent maybe 30 percent just with that
first<00:01:31.020> initial<00:01:31.259> line<00:01:33.229> now<00:01:34.229> when<00:01:34.560> you're

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
first initial line now when you're

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
first initial line now when you're
choosing<00:01:34.770> bases<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.790> might<00:01:35.970> want<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> choose

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
choosing bases you might want to choose

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.380 
choosing bases you might want to choose
one<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.810> doesn't<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.310> heroes<00:01:38.310> or<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.180> hit

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
one that doesn't have heroes or the hit

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
one that doesn't have heroes or the hit
you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.350> hero<00:01:40.650> or

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you know it's not like one hero or

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
you know it's not like one hero or
they're<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> center<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.810> you

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
they're right in the center because you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
they're right in the center because you
know<00:01:43.290> dealing<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> heroes's<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.820> know

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
know dealing with the heroes's you know

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.600 
know dealing with the heroes's you know
just<00:01:45.149> another<00:01:45.450> complication<00:01:46.520> barbarians<00:01:47.520> are

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
just another complication barbarians are

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.109 
just another complication barbarians are
quite<00:01:47.790> handy<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.119> tanking<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:51.000> do

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
quite handy for tanking so really do

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.370 
quite handy for tanking so really do
know<00:01:51.210> where<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.479> wizard<00:01:51.780> came<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
know where that wizard came from but I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.600 
know where that wizard came from but I
really<00:01:52.590> wanted<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> focus<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.399> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
really wanted to focus in that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.330 
really wanted to focus in that
particular<00:01:53.850> area<00:01:54.060> because<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:55.340> builder

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
particular area because as a builder

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.429 
particular area because as a builder
site<00:01:56.490> builders<00:01:56.939> house<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> plinth

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
site builders house and the plinth

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.670 
site builders house and the plinth
are<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.920> lowest<00:01:59.990> hit<00:02:00.990> points<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.469> any<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
are the lowest hit points of any a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.190 
are the lowest hit points of any a
building<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.880> very<00:02:03.000> cheap<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.630> can

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
building so in there very cheap you can

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.990 
building so in there very cheap you can
actually<00:02:04.439> take<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.520> builders<00:02:05.850> hope

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
actually take out then or builders hope

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.139 
actually take out then or builders hope
with<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> lightning<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.079> need<00:02:07.259> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
with a lightning that you really need to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630 
with a lightning that you really need to
so<00:02:10.049> at<00:02:10.229> least<00:02:10.289> over<00:02:10.619> reading<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.340> carry-all

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so at least over reading just carry-all

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.839 
so at least over reading just carry-all
like<00:02:11.909> there's<00:02:12.690> no<00:02:12.840> rage<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.290> quite<00:02:13.500> at<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:13.849> and
