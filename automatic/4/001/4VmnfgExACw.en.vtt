 Well, I have a small batch 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:05.989
 about 2 thousand 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.979
 or somewhere else 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.099
 m 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.259
 it will be a shame of the countries 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.869
 the fact that their city one more time I gave it to her 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.869
 he says 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.619
 on the way to the district hospital 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 so 17 people 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.729
 all assets ooo and 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:32.829

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.060
 one 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 I do not know 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.380
 but just look at the situation 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.010
 and simple rules answered with a question 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.010
 house 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.560
 at the station 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.920
 at the construction site 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.980
 im picket honor june 13 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.660
 as an exception 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.770
 no real economic 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.500
 children 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.540
 m scientists hold a rally 4 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
 but look 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.910
 why is it why is it generally grown 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.270
 although legislative 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.759
 Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Emergency Situations 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.110
 which support 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.430
 as reported ria news yekaterinburg 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.970
 also the project of the document is 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.620
 Andrew 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.620
 in the process 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.690
 so until the end of the year it would be wrong 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.690
 for fate 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.809

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.859
 it is very little associated with 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.859
