00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
it's going to be almost impossible the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.999 
it's going to be almost impossible the
top<00:01:14.360> his<00:01:15.080> performance<00:01:15.619> against<00:01:15.830> Paul

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
top his performance against Paul

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.830 
top his performance against Paul
Williams<00:01:16.280> that's<00:01:16.610> one<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.420> things<00:01:17.479> that

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
Williams that's one of the things that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.679 
Williams that's one of the things that
is<00:01:18.110> up<00:01:18.439> against<00:01:18.860> him<00:01:19.040> wherever<00:01:19.790> he<00:01:20.119> does<00:01:20.390> it's

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
is up against him wherever he does it's

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.770 
is up against him wherever he does it's
going<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.930> be<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.940> secondary<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.300> his<00:01:23.540> last

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
going to be a secondary to his last

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.500 
going to be a secondary to his last
performance<00:01:23.990> with<00:01:24.470> wings<00:01:24.680> but<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.700> think<00:01:26.030> this

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
performance with wings but I think this

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.150 
performance with wings but I think this
is<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:26.660> a<00:01:26.870> fight<00:01:27.080> that's<00:01:27.290> necessary<00:01:27.890> he<00:01:28.070> has

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
is just a fight that's necessary he has

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.440 
is just a fight that's necessary he has
to<00:01:28.340> get<00:01:28.430> out<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.850> way

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
to get out of the way

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.240

do<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.860> think<00:02:58.069> if<00:02:58.159> you<00:02:58.280> would<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.459> been

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
do you think if you would have been

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.130 
do you think if you would have been
training<00:02:59.090> Miguel<00:02:59.390> Cotto<00:02:59.569> when<00:02:59.840> he<00:02:59.900> pulled

training Miguel Cotto when he pulled

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.259 
training Miguel Cotto when he pulled
Manny<00:03:00.319> Pacquiao<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.519> fight<00:03:01.730> would<00:03:01.909> have

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
Manny Pacquiao and the fight would have

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.179 
Manny Pacquiao and the fight would have
not<00:03:02.480> been<00:03:02.629> in<00:03:02.750> catchweight<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.769> results

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
not been in catchweight the results

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.759 
not been in catchweight the results
would<00:03:04.280> have<00:03:04.340> been<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:04.549> different<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.769> believe

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
would have been just different I believe

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.979 
would have been just different I believe
that<00:03:06.980> if<00:03:07.069> I<00:03:07.220> had<00:03:07.370> been<00:03:07.579> training<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.810> air

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
that if I had been training the air

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.460 
that if I had been training the air
course<00:03:09.700> taught<00:03:10.700> by<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:11.480> manufacturer<00:03:12.200> and

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
course taught by the manufacturer and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.210 
course taught by the manufacturer and
they<00:03:13.040> never<00:03:13.220> look<00:03:13.400> at<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.780> 447<00:03:15.069> results<00:03:16.069> for

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
they never look at the 447 results for

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.280 
they never look at the 447 results for
the<00:03:16.280> window<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:16.819> think<00:03:17.450> many<00:03:17.720> as<00:03:17.900> one<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
the window I think many as one of the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.770 
the window I think many as one of the
greatest<00:03:18.530> pilots<00:03:19.010> cover<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:20.120> not<00:03:20.450> saying

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
greatest pilots cover and not saying

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.470 
greatest pilots cover and not saying
that<00:03:20.930> he<00:03:20.959> would<00:03:21.200> not<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:21.530> one<00:03:21.769> device<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:23.239> see

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
that he would not have one device I see

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.849 
that he would not have one device I see
that's<00:03:23.690> why<00:03:23.900> did<00:03:24.170> not<00:03:24.319> like<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:24.650> would<00:03:24.769> have

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
that's why did not like you would have

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.120 
that's why did not like you would have
been<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.010> good<00:03:25.190> for<00:03:25.549> office
