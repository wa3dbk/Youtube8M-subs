00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 you start by cutting out the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.589
 individual parts 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.540

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.479
 element I first cut with the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.830
 then I put it on that 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.420
 white toned paper and draw it off 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.270
 then it cuts out again and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.150
 then I have the backbone of the piece 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.960
