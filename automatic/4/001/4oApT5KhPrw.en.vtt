00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.759
 i'm hungry today i have a good one for you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.440
 the news finally feed returns to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.550
 the previous course of the video will go out 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.530
 pretty often 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.540
 interesting write in the comments which 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.490
 heading you most want to see and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.619
 in general, I had a press account 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.039
 this is windows where these tanks are so i started 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.769
 ride stb-1 and me tank very 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.390
 liked naguchuy there are of course their 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.300
 the pros and cons of which we are today 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 talk but also wants to notice in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 first tank is very often compared 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 leopard 1 well yes outwardly they are a bit 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 similar but if you look already on 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.440
 the characteristics of dog very much 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 differences to compare these two tanks 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 Firstly, this is a Japanese tank 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 German therefore precision weapons 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.460
 of course lame at leopard to accuracy 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.860
 better, but like all Japanese 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.469
 they are very fast such dpm per minute 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.690
 also peculiarly tall 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.180
 than leopard even higher than u there 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.399
 have the same configuration i'm talking 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.629
 about any boxes of cola you see that with 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.390
 fire extinguisher by the way the game 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.610
 the chance of his engine burning so the state 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.810
 12 percent and leopards-1 seems to be 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.640
 As far as I remember, ten in general 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.560
 stopping by with my 53 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.580
 maximum kilometers here here on 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.950
 islet in general 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.020
 This tactic on the island is very good 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.270
 for out pawns for quick special 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.820
 strikes now I won't even talk 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 but what kind of speed 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 more than 50 kilometers on the pad they sometimes 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.270
 It does not have time to call in because 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.790
 I meet 3 4 lines of enemies that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.350
 go to the hill and look left and Plato 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.360
 creeps and start shooting at me 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.390
 so I stop square somewhere 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.030
 there are two examples in those bushes i'm standing and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.979
 starts shooting down the hill 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.290
 in this way I would tank like 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.020
 I would like to Huslia through the Far rink seen 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.049
 and you leave the enemy tries on you 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.820
 shoot and you drive back so therefore 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.369
 it happens to ricochet to a distant rink 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.030
 falls and as if the damage does not pass in 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.399
 generally understandable 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.710
 then on the armor they say that the leopard 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.840
 Of course on armor and the same as stb-1 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.270
 guys go to tth go look 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.340
 the towers are much better armored 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.560
 she is semicircular she is very often 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.630
 ricochet shells especially landmine from the arts 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.620
 not included with the same frequency as 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.810
 leopard 1 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.600
 with full damage and it can't nobody 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.700
 please understand playing the leopard 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.980
 one you will become forehead you will 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.800
 to stand as a wolf in any kind of art with full 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.010
 damage to you will throw limbs fall 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.319
 what to say about art-1 he firstly 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.660
 there is better armor than better 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.130
 Leopard has more than one hundred 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.640
 millimeters and it only says 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.489
 that art with full damage of course with so with 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.709
 turntables we do not throw but the board in no way 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.660
 case don't let for artboard better 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.250
 lived bombs catch well of course if you 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.260
 succeed it because you yourself know 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.829
 as sometimes art throws where it 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.810
 throws 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.360
 you don't even expect it to fly 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.130
 brick to you but it happens so 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.470
 try to turn attacks on art 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.989
 forehead still keeps both yourself so blow 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.190
 there is also a slope from the sea soon 2 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.650
 distance will be set according to you 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.600
 artillery so armor of course 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.610
 different and so many vanchots 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.709
 At least today I did not catch on as the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.019
 on the leopard, one played specifically on 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.510
 these two tanks then the declension of the gun 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.950
 quite excellent tool declension is better 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.230
 even how best is the same as 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.090
 Americans some down goes down 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.640
 great but there is one such minus 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.190
 gun up raise there only 13 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.570
 like degrees sometimes of course you do this 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.640
 do not feel especially on any there 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.410
 himmelsdorf though if shoot 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.870
 from a distance up the hill it is likely 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.579
 feel just the same in general on 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.010
 Some cards will be hard especially 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.959
 in the mines when you rub the bumps and 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.700
 shoot it there on top who will be on 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.709
 the hill will be extremely difficult therefore 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.090
 initially understand that you have a weapon 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.130
 so it does not rise 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.640
 use such positions to hold 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.800
 height 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.100
 in the distance and try shooting with 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.100
 someone a long span and and 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.080
 In general, with the review we figured out there 410 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.180
 meters with modules from more precisely 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.620
 equipment that puts me 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.290
 stack ram stabilizer 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.480
 vertical guidance and ventilation if u 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.040
 you crew is generally bad there is one perk 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.410
 let's say I would put in your place 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.560
 Coated Optics tell you why in 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.110
 first she gives more reviews on 10 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.090
 percent is you know yes well done in 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.130
 second, which gives you a general overview of the game 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.750
 firstly for the light of course do 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.480
 the initial light to do at all for 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.640
 light during the game and what gives the light itself 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.820
 light gives of course loans and one here 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.010
 did you know this guys loans and experience topics 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.650
 the most you faster will swing the crew you 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.810
 will be more generally effective in this 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.890
 the fight that is i have there 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.620
 radio interception i have berlin and eye 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.260
 I see far without even as they say 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.570
 enlightened optics plus itself 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.600
 ventilation yes this is some how much 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.210
 there are meters of survey, I remember we calculated 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.280
 there with a guy one so guys 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.530
 pick the right equipment under 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.960
 as i told you what equipment i am 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.810
 I drive as much to carry you as much gold 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.690
 decide yourself, but I would 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.190
 drove around 60 percent at 40 but 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.340
 this would be the way I would like 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.930
 half in total the fight went very 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.330
 good as you see it is 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.280
 to shoot for five thousand plus damage 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.290
 left and 5 left art 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.540
 I understand about where artillery is 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.880
 so I'm going to her dynamics on the tank 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.340
 wonderful 53 kilometer well this is not for you 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.080
 jokes for haircut is quite normal 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.840
 especially for screeds that have corners 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.210
 for staining that there is a weapon and common 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.729
 for cars that are so not 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.550
 the fact that even mobility and maneuverability 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.250
 rather, even the general tried to call in 201 but 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.060
 here it is fast just for me 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.950
 disorientated so i'm a little 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.630
 confused began to put on her fifth 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.610
 I forgot about the mouth at all 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.010
 call in here she tried to me at all 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.660
 aim at this aunt lichku and 5 bye me 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.700
 nastrelivaet again art me 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.350
 x-ray shines it was a mistake it was 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.790
 immediately to the right of Arta dovorachivat 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.440
 but here I am leaving the sides are risking but killing 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.510
 and the fifth remains hanging above and to it 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.760
 shoots down and if they sleep now 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.220
 most likely will die he exchanged with him 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.680
 shots and 5 did not break well reload 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.840
 and 5 faster in general, such a fight 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.340
 work out now we will see the results 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.580
 and let us down a little 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.020
 as a result of stb-1 I hope you fight 1 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.730
 if you like like 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.320
 tell your friends but on this 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.320
 the video is not over yet
