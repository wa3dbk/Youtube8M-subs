00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
get an idea of the width of these wheels

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.939 
get an idea of the width of these wheels
and<00:00:39.079> what<00:00:39.199> kind<00:00:39.379> of<00:00:39.410> riding<00:00:39.769> they<00:00:39.890> were

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
and what kind of riding they were

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.910 
and what kind of riding they were
designed<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:40.399> do<00:00:40.579> as<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.390> can<00:00:41.539> see<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.379> 80<00:00:42.620> mil

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
designed to do as you can see the 80 mil

designed to do as you can see the 80 mil
concepts<00:00:43.730> are<00:00:43.999> better<00:00:44.960> for<00:00:45.260> your<00:00:45.320> ad<00:00:45.469> wheel

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
concepts are better for your ad wheel

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.049 
concepts are better for your ad wheel

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
higher speed riding and racing and we'll

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.669 
higher speed riding and racing and we'll
get<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:57.499> close-up<00:00:58.039> of<00:00:58.159> the<00:00:58.339> core<00:00:58.609> here<00:00:59.440> as<00:01:00.440> you

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679
