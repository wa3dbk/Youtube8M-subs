 Followers on Twitter 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.140
 It will be a pleasure to have a toothbrush to learn more about grammar. 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.410
 everyday life of our language 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.269
 well in room 8 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.630
 We are going to talk about the difference. 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.110
 doubts in the air 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.330

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.020
 and the air 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.540
 with hiv acute accent 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.970
 of the old bar indicating idea of ​​space and time 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.359
 when it comes to nominees recently 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.139
 can apply to take 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:00.760
 with the penny gaia 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.090
 to the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.250
 without heating and CNH 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.540
 but each of these forms have specific terms depending on the situation 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.080
 nice 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.790
 in the everyday of people write without giving much importance but the cultured norm 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.040
 years argues about the differences between air 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 to sell and I preposition 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.840
 let's look at the example of a use situation in the next week's song from 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 pink singer 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.789
 so much 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.200
 go tomorrow at the river 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.350
 it occurs 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.680
 there can be no month 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.520
 There's no money 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.290
 no no no 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.030
 in hama 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.030
 brook 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.590
 well 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.500
 we will see 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.440
 when I said he referred 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.460
 al 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.759
 What still can happen? 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.759
 that has not yet happened spain an idea of ​​future 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.739
 what is charged is a proposal is here 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.739
 a few days these days have not yet 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.739
 they arrived they will arrive 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.279
 they will be transposed by john c 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 That is why the preposition 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:39.219
 as forbidden the saints the preposition air when it comes to a 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.150
 space that is to come or the physical space to be 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.409
 for example 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.669
 He'll be home in two hours. 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.089
 they came back from a trip in a month 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.319
 from now until we arrive in the city of sorocaba 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.729
 the years in the air will van der 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.089
 with a sharp accent in the air 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.829
 when it comes to a time frame that has passed or 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.140
 in some cases 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.799
 physical space already covered 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.499
 for example 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.459
 He left home two hours. 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.269
 to 30 kilometers we find class 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.269
 to play and we talked to her a lot 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.259
 My father retired to each state. 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.079
 In this case we can replace the air, so observe the constructions 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.659
 He left the house almost two hours. 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.899
 fact ten years my father the dossier 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.830
 the 30 kilometers we found for the mother 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.830
 not to shock and we talked to her a lot 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.540
 we should now have a very interesting example in music at two steps from 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.540
 paradise of evandro mosque 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.129
 not 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.129
 1 there was no statement 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:10.980
 when I became 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.709
 not 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.709
 at the time of the aggression anyway 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.870
 michael lohan we passed 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.479
 embittering the bento 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.000
 tomorrow 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.030
 do not fear 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.430
 we leave here the first 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.430
 away from home for over a week 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.349
 in this sense 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.650
 the idea is that across the value chain dr 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.990
 of these 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.400
 This is something that has already happened. 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.439
 in the case of the first square 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.129
 the amount of time that has passed 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.749
 and the second tranche 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.039
 the physical space that has already been covered 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:13.589
 different from your last tour 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.169
 and these two spaces 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.740
 whoever is detained another politician if found for rubbish 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.949
 these two spaces last year 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.020
 lisbon diap does not happen 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.210
 So squid to the proposal I can not use 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.889
 should welcome you 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.069
 Then goes the tip 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.110
 the one of the verb to have always when to have passed 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.139
 the replacement 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.139
 always controversial idea of ​​future 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.189
 Once again, thank you very much for your attention. 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:55.659

 up until 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.889
 then followed 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:08.979
 Lastly 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.699
 all the bibliography that I use to elaborate the classes 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.460
