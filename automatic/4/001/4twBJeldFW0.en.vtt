00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.779
 hello guys and welcome back to tennis.it 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.380
 in today's review life we ​​want 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:26.750
 talk about the first google tablet that is 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.090
 the nexus 7 as well as books with the name nexus 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.369
 7 features a 7-inch display 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.500
 in fact if with luca in that market of 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.750
 low cost 7 inch tablet like the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.829
 kindle fire the 7-inch galaxy tab 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.469
 it has enough dimensions 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:50.870
 compact indeed we are talking about the 18 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:54.260
 19.19 small 8 cm long 12 of 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:00.260
 width and 10 in fact it is thick 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:03.050
 thickness as you can see is reduced 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.110
 to the bone with regards to the display 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.060
 we find a display we say in the media 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.130
 at 1080 for 800 with 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.750
 with a quality we say not excellent but 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.310
 however good I am used to a 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.740
 retina display then any display 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.510
 me since before I find 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.700
 qualitatively poorer but due 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.380
 to my habit of using the ipad 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.270
 however, the contents are clearly visible 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.550
 even if we are precisely a 7 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:39.320
 inch and I'll show you for example 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:40.850
 twitter that is still quite usable 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.770
 on this display certainly more comfortable 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.410
 of a smartphone but a little less 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.780
 comfortable of an ipad that just on the display 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.390
 by 10 inches from us by 7 inches or later 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.420
 a galaxy tab that is just a 10 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.700
 inches as a display and a negative note 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.350
 of the display and also resides in the software 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.530
 and anyway android jelly beans that are 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.690
 the presence of these capacitive keys 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.260
 placed precisely in the display that limit 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.899
 space and this was a choice 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.640
 precisely weighted by google why 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.160
 however it gives on the set it produced 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.760
 this tablet because the edges anyway 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.100
 they must remain free to allow 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.330
 an ease of control with the game is 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.640
 always a car game we can 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.739
 place your thumbs here without touching 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.480
 any capacitive keys that 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.360
 usually in android smartphones are 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.370
 positioned below for what concerns 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.470
 connectivity is precisely wifi 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.060
 therefore the data network is not present 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.810
 there is possibility to insert the sim like 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.550
 in the ipad like from the kalac sitab and therefore 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.140
 if you are outdoors and just use 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.350
 internet you can't do that unless 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.340
 you are not present a free wifi 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.050
 speed and direction is very valid 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.989
 valid because the quad core processor 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.330
 tegra te with a gigabyte of ram support 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.150
 so the tablet is exceptional for i 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.040
 games but also to perform 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.690
 applications I open a title that already 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.580
 it had part previously so it opens 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.180
 immediately we can begin 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.720
 immediately playing like hearing the audio 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.350
 coming out of the speaker 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.270
 even when the quality is good we can 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.810
 start playing immediately without 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.050
 wait for 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.200
 the last of excruciating waits you have the 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.870
 processor responds very well to commands 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.239
 reactive in fact you can close you can 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.880
 go to the various ASPs without waiting 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.530
 wait too long 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.370
 open youtube we ask for youtube 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.110
 speed does not have the slightest lag e 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.989
 view content on this display 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.330
 it's comfortable in the middle meaning it's comfortable 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.920
 because the tablet itself is comfortable 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.080
 because you can put it in your pocket because 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.250
 weighs 340 grams just so it is 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.780
 very light 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.150
 for example, I put it in my pocket 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.040
 of the suit and there was very fine thing that 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.019
 I can not do with the iPad is in the bag 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.390
 and feels it doesn't feel because it weighs 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.690
 very little, however, just on the display 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.890
 by 7 inches which is however a group e 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.690
 a compromise that must be made 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.640
 must pay to have a 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.280
 convenience arrangement like mine that 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.720
 this tablet offers more than other tablets 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.549
 of large size 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.320
 and as for the others 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.269
 hardware features we find 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.609
 precisely microphone to make video calls 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.130
 also supported by a mail camera 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.789
 frontally 12 megapixel last for 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.500
 video calls via Skype nfc e 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.620
 gps accelerometer to use it as 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.960
 magnetometer and gyroscope navigator for 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.110
 regarding both Android and 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.820
 4.2 of the 4.1 jelly bean so the last one 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.640
 version of android and micro usb in the 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:48.520
 lower part for charging and jack from 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:50.860
 3.5 for the headphones the back and to me 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.389
 love it very much and all pricked with the 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.869
 logo nexus 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.179
 excavated and inside the cover e 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:05:01.219
 side button seats placed in the 

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:02.899
 left side with sleep key or 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.879
 shutdown 

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:08.019
 the thing that disappointed me a little in this 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.399
 tablet is a bit the display we say that 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:11.509
 only for the dimensions because 

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:13.669
 obviously we're talking about a tablet 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.469
 of this size, but more than anything else 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.419
 quality as I said before was 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:20.029
 I'm used to not retina so I am 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.739
 used to say better but yes 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.419
 could do more obviously we are 

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:26.389
 speaking of a negative note in the middle 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.069
 because in any case a tablet that costs 249 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.459
 euros even less depending on the 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:34.309
 offers must absolutely have 

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:35.990
 of google compromises to a come down to 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:37.999
 compromises to make a tablet that 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.639
 is valid because quad core one gigabyte 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:43.550
 of ram 8 16 gigabytes of memory maybe 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.240
 riad also the 32 model shortly e 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.880
 are of 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.819
 excellent features for a 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.860
 tablet that costs little is cheap and that 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:54.330
 advice to buy especially a 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.710
 who needs in a tablet like this 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.210
 that is valid in any case 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.970
 hardware and above all banks for i 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.500
 games is an excellent game console and 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.380
 with a display so that anyway 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.389
 allows the use of content e 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.669
 the edges are comfortable in the eyes 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.710
 allow wider in the part 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:15.800
 superior and possess allow the 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.940
 kidnapped a solid and comfortable grip and mother 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.789
 I do not recommend it to those who need a 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.530
 tablet for work for those who love to watch 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.210
 movie because it's awkward or watching movies 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.569
 i'm a 7 inch though can't 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.949
 seem the safest that uncomfortable is 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.870
 however it is conveniently beaten with one 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.759
 single hand point to make you understand how much 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.970
 it's light veil compares with a 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.750
 ipad on the fly passages however understand the 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.750
 difference between the two 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.870
 as you can see the difference is there and 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.599
 how would you have devices so if you are 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.150
 looking for a tablet is light and comfortable to 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:53.490
 to bring back then the nexus is that it can 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.030
 be perfect for you but if you have to 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.460
 have to buy a tablet for 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.930
 work or you want the best from 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.210
 your tablet and applications that you don't 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.930
 they simply adapted 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.840
 smartphone apps that don't 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.650
 are adapted or you want to surf 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.469
 via the sim or you want a display 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.469
 which is much more valid and much more o 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:18.389
 less with many more pixels available 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:20.400
 then we advise you to turn towards 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.370
 other devices like the ipad like 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.210
 galaxy tab like galaxy note 10 etc. 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.150
 etc. etc. 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.150
 and that's all and see you next
