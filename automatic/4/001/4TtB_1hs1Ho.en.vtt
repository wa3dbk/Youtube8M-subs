that's<00:00:36.090> when<00:00:36.270> you're<00:00:36.390> starting<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:36.870> over<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
that's when you're starting all over a

everything<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.210> fact<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.199> rule<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> thumb<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
everything in fact the rule of thumb is

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.470 
everything in fact the rule of thumb is
if<00:00:44.129> you're<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.519> area<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.120> trying<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
if you're the area that you're trying to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.529 
if you're the area that you're trying to
maintain<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.589> least<00:00:46.710> 50%<00:00:47.219> grass<00:00:47.850> then

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
maintain has at least 50% grass then

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.389 
maintain has at least 50% grass then
let's<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.109> ahead<00:00:49.199> and<00:00:49.530> renovate<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.160> because

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
let's go ahead and renovate it because

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.130 
let's go ahead and renovate it because
it's<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.609> lot<00:00:50.789> cheaper<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.359> a<00:00:51.449> lot<00:00:51.480> easier<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it's a lot cheaper and a lot easier to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.380 
it's a lot cheaper and a lot easier to
do<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.980> theory<00:00:53.339> is<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.699> we're<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
do and the theory is this we're going to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
do and the theory is this we're going to
promote<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> health<00:00:55.109> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> grass<00:00:55.679> which<00:00:55.980> is

promote the health of the grass which is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
promote the health of the grass which is

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.390 
heat can also be the biggest challenge
to<00:03:36.210> full<00:03:36.390> establishment<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.740> keep<00:03:37.920> grass<00:03:38.160> seed

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
to full establishment so keep grass seed

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.640 
to full establishment so keep grass seed
moist<00:03:38.640> until<00:03:39.120> germination<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.960> continue<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
moist until germination and continue to

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:50.600 
moist until germination and continue to
water<00:03:40.830> until<00:03:41.190> established

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.490 

so<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.730> key<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> healthy<00:03:52.270> lawn<00:03:52.600> is<00:03:52.810> not<00:03:53.110> one

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
so the key to a healthy lawn is not one

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.080 
so the key to a healthy lawn is not one
that's<00:03:53.710> watered<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.250> fertilized<00:03:54.730> all<00:03:54.940> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
that's watered and fertilized all the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.760 
that's watered and fertilized all the
time<00:03:55.300> but<00:03:55.960> when<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.170> comes<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.410> irrigation

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
time but when it comes to irrigation

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.430 
time but when it comes to irrigation
just<00:03:57.160> infrequent<00:03:57.940> but<00:03:58.120> deeply<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.750> then<00:03:59.350> the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
just infrequent but deeply and then the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.350 
just infrequent but deeply and then the
fertilization<00:03:59.770> just<00:04:00.400> periodically<00:04:00.970> with<00:04:01.330> a

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
fertilization just periodically with a

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.330 
fertilization just periodically with a
slow<00:04:01.660> release<00:04:01.840> non-burning<00:04:02.560> form<00:04:03.040> or<00:04:03.310> even

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
slow release non-burning form or even

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.550 
slow release non-burning form or even
compost<00:04:04.060> but<00:04:04.600> if<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.780> do<00:04:04.900> that<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.380> keep

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
compost but if you do that you can keep

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.110 
compost but if you do that you can keep
your<00:04:05.680> lawn<00:04:05.860> looking<00:04:06.160> great<00:04:06.400> all<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.880> time

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
your lawn looking great all the time

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.030 
your lawn looking great all the time
while<00:04:07.420> being<00:04:07.900> kinder<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.470> environment<00:04:08.530> -
