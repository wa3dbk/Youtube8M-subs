bracket<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.910> way<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.270> works<00:02:55.720> its<00:02:57.060> we

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
bracket and the way this works its we

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.170 
bracket and the way this works its we
take<00:02:58.630> out<00:02:58.840> our<00:02:58.870> oay

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
take out our oay

take out our oay
head<00:03:01.180> breather<00:03:02.310> components<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.459> we<00:03:03.790> replace

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
head breather components and we replace

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.680 
head breather components and we replace
these<00:03:04.860> with<00:03:05.880> I'll<00:03:06.880> do<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.090> review<00:03:07.239> on<00:03:07.510> those

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
these with I'll do a review on those

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.830 
these with I'll do a review on those
later<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:09.300> mounts<00:03:10.300> up<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.570> head

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
later and that mounts up to the head

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.880 
later and that mounts up to the head
then<00:03:11.620> your<00:03:11.800> moon<00:03:12.010> eyes<00:03:12.900> backing<00:03:13.900> plate<00:03:14.140> mounts

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
then your moon eyes backing plate mounts

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.650
