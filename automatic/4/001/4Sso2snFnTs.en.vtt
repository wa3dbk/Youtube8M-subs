00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030

with a four-point-oh average so that's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.630 
with a four-point-oh average so that's
that's<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.049> crazy<00:02:48.350> part<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.190> graduate

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.589 
one reason why my hair is looking funky
right<00:03:56.459> now<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:56.909> I<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.090> came<00:03:57.330> from<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.569> gym

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
right now is I just came from the gym

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.180 
right now is I just came from the gym
because<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.530> don't<00:03:58.680> know<00:03:58.769> if<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:58.920> know<00:03:59.069> eyes

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
because I don't know if you know eyes

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.500 
because I don't know if you know eyes
notice<00:03:59.610> in<00:04:00.060> my<00:04:00.269> face<00:04:00.860> but<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:02.370> have<00:04:03.030> lost<00:04:03.269> weight

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
notice in my face but I have lost weight

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.400 
notice in my face but I have lost weight
and<00:04:03.959> I've<00:04:04.830> lost<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.250> practice

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
and I've lost the practice

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.980 
and I've lost the practice
was<00:04:07.530> approximately<00:04:08.340> 40

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
was approximately 40

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.760 
was approximately 40
around<00:04:10.170> here<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.530> was<00:04:11.100> originally<00:04:11.370> way<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:12.770> was

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
around here I was originally way I was

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.810 
around here I was originally way I was
originally<00:04:13.920> laying<00:04:14.340> like<00:04:14.640> between<00:04:15.830> 185<00:04:16.830> 190

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
originally laying like between 185 190

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.740 
originally laying like between 185 190
ranging<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.810> right<00:04:19.080> now<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:20.570> usually<00:04:21.570> into

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
ranging and right now I usually into

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
ranging and right now I usually into
like<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.930> 149<00:04:22.410> 150<00:04:24.350> that's<00:04:25.350> where<00:04:25.500> i'm<00:04:25.620> at<00:04:25.740> now

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
like a 149 150 that's where i'm at now

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.260

that's my goal weight don't want to go

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.050 
that's my goal weight don't want to go
any<00:04:27.420> lower<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:28.200> gave<00:04:28.650> myself<00:04:28.860> leeway<00:04:29.460> between

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
any lower I gave myself leeway between

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.980 
any lower I gave myself leeway between
150<00:04:30.540> 150<00:04:30.930> for<00:04:31.140> just<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.670> possibly<00:04:32.870> gain<00:04:33.870> an

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
150 150 for just to possibly gain an
