doesn't<00:00:50.520> matter<00:00:50.610> where<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.320> set<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.620> down<00:00:52.850> now

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
doesn't matter where and set it down now

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
doesn't matter where and set it down now
it<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.420> each<00:00:54.570> tech<00:00:54.780> there's<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> twin<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.590> each

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it in each tech there's a twin of each

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.720 
it in each tech there's a twin of each
card<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.690> for<00:00:57.690> instance<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:59.989> Jack<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.170> Clubs

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
card there for instance is Jack of Clubs

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.490

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
would be the twin of the jack of spades
kind<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.820> black<00:01:06.030> twins<00:01:06.390> and

then for the red it would be hearts and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520 
then for the red it would be hearts and
diamonds<00:01:08.549> would<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.939> twins<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.990> we're<00:01:10.470> going

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
diamonds would be twins so we're going

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.690 
diamonds would be twins so we're going
to<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> tell<00:01:11.130> them<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.369> you're<00:01:11.580> going

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to do is you tell them that you're going

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
to do is you tell them that you're going
to<00:01:11.790> predict<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> twin<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> their<00:01:13.110> cards<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
to predict the twin of their cards so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.520 
to predict the twin of their cards so
you<00:01:13.560> take<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.520> we'll<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:14.939> mark<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.530> where

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you take it and we'll just mark it where

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.990 
you take it and we'll just mark it where
they've<00:01:16.680> done<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.580> tell<00:01:17.729> them<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> take

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
they've done it so you tell them to take

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
they've done it so you tell them to take
the<00:01:18.150> card<00:01:18.390> which<00:01:18.570> their<00:01:18.810> middle<00:01:19.020> card<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:20.220> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the card which their middle card can you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.870 
the card which their middle card can you
set<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.610> aside<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:22.220> I'm<00:01:23.220> look<00:01:23.490> at<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> right

and you're taking lemon tea but you took

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.670 
and you're taking lemon tea but you took
the<00:01:30.299> deck<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.630> don't<00:01:30.780> need<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> anymore<00:01:31.200> set

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the deck you don't need it anymore set

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
the deck you don't need it anymore set

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
basically you want the twin of their

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.149 
basically you want the twin of their
card<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:37.200> gonna<00:01:37.290> look<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:37.740> okay<00:01:38.100> so

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
card so I'm gonna look at it now okay so

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.580 
card so I'm gonna look at it now okay so
it's<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> five<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.729> diamonds<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.079> made<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's the five of diamonds so it I made a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
it's the five of diamonds so it I made a
prediction<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.970> enforce<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> cut<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
prediction not enforce them to cut the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.060 
prediction not enforce them to cut the
deck<00:01:43.110> anywhere<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> let<00:01:43.740> them<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
deck anywhere you let them know that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.399 
deck anywhere you let them know that
like<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.280> didn't<00:01:44.490> force<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.290> cut<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
like I didn't force you you cut it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.749 
like I didn't force you you cut it
wherever<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.710> want<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.130> chose<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.460> card

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
wherever you want you chose this card
