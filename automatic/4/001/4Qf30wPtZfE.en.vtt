00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 in the blue on the blue cross court 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.470
 it usually rains 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.190
 today the one who cries is the hobby of the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.650
 machine 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.350
 sergio good so much was talked about borghi's 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.150
 tomtos matosas boy ends true 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.010
 sergio good being the technician is the time 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.270
 better choice than matosas for example 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.270
 from true blue cross 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.300
 I do not think that's a decision 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.789
 unpopular that he has made blue cross very 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.270
 unpopular and a decision 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.400
 that to me at least to me at least 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.720
 I do not like me I do not think I think that 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.629
 that's why I had a fantastic opportunity 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.250
 to try another style to check with 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.199
 another type of condition another type of 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.150
 personality and I had it at hand and 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.739
 I was like matosas who also wanted to 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.350
 a rematch against the america that is the 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.730
 great rival I suppose I black blue and was 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.160
 a good opportunity to find a 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.500
 coach who had found in turn 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.940
 a failure in the america and blue cross what 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.070
 discarded he did it aside not what 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.719
 took advantage and was the class and won the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.550
 heading to blue cross and then you had to 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.469
 Tomás Boy Tomás Boy 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.020
 controller of that cut of that line 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.009
 maybe a little more atrabancado maybe 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.090
 a little bit more complicated in character 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.090
 recent so that he is usually made of tomás 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.539
 boy the rubbish to the pains 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.270
 pressure and we came out with a technician from 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.280
 low profile as did the doctor created 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.170
 Blue was a technical low profile 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.420
 has forgiveness of the director of his pain and 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.220
 and does not agree its transcendence and its 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.030
 need and agree what happens in the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.190
 Mexican soccer 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.659
 of the town they talked about alfaro I do not know if 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.400
 he did not want to come in blue cross was talked about 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.320
 borghi I do not know if they did not fix or not 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.630
 he wanted to come in america he was talking about 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.670
 know it even and we end up hungry and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.560
 sergio good marin and what happens that the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.409
 foreign technician is not taking you 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.080
 I believe that the promoters 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.070
 promoters handle the subject many times 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 the language of the coach is the same 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.140
 wheel of fortune good 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.060
 Alejandro the theme of sergio good 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.950
 agroazul was managed by the promoter 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.679
 they work as reason and point we like or 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.600
 they do not say that the testimony is not another 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.550
 thing is in these five reinforcements you 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.259
 like you do not want no signature you do not david 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.380
 it should be a technical body I join 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.420
 we grab a good promoter and we do not 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.370
 let's go but another sport look for a 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.989
 producer for not no better better leave it 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.410
 well that easy better that 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.410
 salvation
