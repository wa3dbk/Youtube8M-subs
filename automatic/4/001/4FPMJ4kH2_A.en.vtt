00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
recently replaced my tripod head this is

recently replaced my tripod head this is
my<00:00:10.769> old<00:00:10.889> one<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.340> my<00:00:11.460> velbon<00:00:11.849> pH<00:00:12.290> 556<00:00:13.639> and

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
my old one this is my velbon pH 556 and

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.740 
my old one this is my velbon pH 556 and
it<00:00:16.379> came<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:16.590> my<00:00:16.920> DV<00:00:17.520> 40<00:00:17.940> tripod<00:00:18.539> legs<00:00:19.460> and

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
it came with my DV 40 tripod legs and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.700 
it came with my DV 40 tripod legs and
the<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> reasons<00:00:22.230> why<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.410> hasn't

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the one of the reasons why this hasn't

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.900 
the one of the reasons why this hasn't
been<00:00:22.949> replaced<00:00:23.300> up<00:00:24.300> until<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.949> is<00:00:25.949> because<00:00:26.400> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
been replaced up until now is because it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.009 
been replaced up until now is because it
first<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.359> all<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> came<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> little

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
first of all it came with the little

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.880 
first of all it came with the little
tripods<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:30.289> actually<00:00:31.289> performed

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
tripods and I actually performed

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.580 
tripods and I actually performed
basically<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> mean<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> give<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.559> was<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
basically what I mean to give you was a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.080 
basically what I mean to give you was a
few<00:00:34.950> exceptions<00:00:35.370> things<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> always<00:00:35.880> kind

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
few exceptions things that I always kind

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.290 
few exceptions things that I always kind
of<00:00:36.320> bugged<00:00:37.320> me<00:00:37.670> but<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> thing<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:38.940> reason

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
of bugged me but the thing that reason

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.119 
of bugged me but the thing that reason
why<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> didn't<00:00:40.079> play<00:00:40.379> sometimes<00:00:40.800> though<00:00:40.950> was

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
why I didn't play sometimes though was

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.410 
why I didn't play sometimes though was
because<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.610> got<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.270> nice

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
because it's got a really really nice

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.459 
because it's got a really really nice
fluid<00:00:43.260> pan<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> remarkably<00:00:45.960> smooth

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
fluid pan this is a remarkably smooth

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
fluid pan this is a remarkably smooth
fluid<00:00:47.460> pan<00:00:48.829> for<00:00:49.829> something<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.430> cheap<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
fluid pan for something so cheap you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.700 
fluid pan for something so cheap you
wouldn't<00:00:51.600> expect<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.500> really

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
wouldn't expect it to be but it's really

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.549 
wouldn't expect it to be but it's really
nice<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.030> perfect<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.510> panning<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
nice it was perfect for panning and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.130 
nice it was perfect for panning and
gliding<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> think<00:00:56.280> time<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.610> my<00:00:56.699> glider<00:00:57.140> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
gliding and think time on my glider it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.979 
gliding and think time on my glider it's
just<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:59.070> smooth<00:00:59.989> however

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
just really really really smooth however

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.100 
just really really really smooth however
a<00:01:02.120> couple<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.300> things<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.629> made<00:01:03.960> this

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a couple of things that really made this

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
a couple of things that really made this
thing<00:01:04.350> very<00:01:04.739> undesirable<00:01:05.100> especially

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
thing very undesirable especially

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.230 
thing very undesirable especially
working<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:06.659> glider<00:01:07.760> was<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.970> fact<00:01:09.150> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
working with my glider was the fact that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
working with my glider was the fact that
if<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.510> wanted<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:09.990> any<00:01:10.170> tilting<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
if I wanted to do any tilting this is a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.010 
if I wanted to do any tilting this is a
tension<00:01:12.150> based<00:01:12.450> tilt<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:14.299> anytime<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.869> want

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
tension based tilt and anytime you want

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.050 
tension based tilt and anytime you want
to<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.140> any<00:01:16.650> smooth<00:01:16.920> feel<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.850> really

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to do any smooth feel thing you really

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.999 
to do any smooth feel thing you really
can't<00:01:18.299> unless<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.170> unless<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.470> loosen<00:01:19.830> all

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
can't unless you unless you loosen all

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.130 
can't unless you unless you loosen all
the<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.450> very<00:01:21.780> very

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the way and you really are very very

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.760 
the way and you really are very very
very<00:01:22.500> very<00:01:22.920> careful<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.060> gentle<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.229> steady

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
very very careful and gentle and steady

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
very very careful and gentle and steady
with<00:01:25.979> your<00:01:26.130> hand<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.880> even<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.479> there

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
with your hand but even if you get there

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
with your hand but even if you get there
appear<00:01:28.710> starts<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.520> against<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> other

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
appear starts to go against the other

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.179 
appear starts to go against the other
part<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> plastic<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
part of the plastic so know you can it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.620 
part of the plastic so know you can it
wasn't<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:32.790> good<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.150> tension<00:01:33.390> based

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
wasn't very good at this tension based

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.410 
wasn't very good at this tension based
and<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> best<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:36.000> other<00:01:36.030> thing<00:01:36.329> I

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and not the best the other thing I

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120 
and not the best the other thing I
really<00:01:36.450> really<00:01:36.900> hated<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
really really hated about this is the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.300 
really really hated about this is the
fact<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> fixed<00:01:39.270> position

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
fact that it's got a fixed position

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.999 
fact that it's got a fixed position
handle<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:42.750> doesn't<00:01:43.200> adjust<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> move

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
handle it doesn't adjust it as I move

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.340 
handle it doesn't adjust it as I move
out<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:45.540> trying<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
out of the way if you're trying to to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.310 
out of the way if you're trying to to
glide<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.130> pan<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.579> same<00:01:47.909> time<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.540> as

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
glide and pan and same time with this as

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.030 
glide and pan and same time with this as
you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.680> keep<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.100> knocking<00:01:50.640> into

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
you can see keep on knocking into

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.400 
you can see keep on knocking into
that's<00:01:51.430> real<00:01:51.640> well<00:01:52.600> my<00:01:52.690> solution<00:01:53.050> is<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.260> take

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
that's real well my solution is to take

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.340 
that's real well my solution is to take
off<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.920> handle<00:01:54.280> like<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.390> then<00:01:56.050> use<00:01:56.170> my

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
off the handle like this and then use my

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.090 
off the handle like this and then use my
hand<00:01:56.710> but<00:01:56.920> my<00:01:57.070> hand<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:58.180> tripod<00:01:58.780> head<00:01:59.170> to

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
hand but my hand on the tripod head to

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.330 
hand but my hand on the tripod head to
do<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.940> painting<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.830> while<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.130> works

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
do the painting and the while it works

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.400 
do the painting and the while it works
it's<00:02:03.700> not<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.390> most<00:02:04.570> steady<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.260> it

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
it's not the most steady and it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.550 
it's not the most steady and it
certainly<00:02:05.650> isn't<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.980> most<00:02:06.100> smooth<00:02:06.550> so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
certainly isn't the most smooth so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.240 
certainly isn't the most smooth so
something<00:02:08.560> that's<00:02:08.590> always<00:02:08.890> been<00:02:09.070> kind<00:02:09.100> of

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
something that's always been kind of

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.590 
something that's always been kind of
bugging<00:02:09.400> me<00:02:09.580> for<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.730> long<00:02:09.820> time<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.270> wanted

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
bugging me for a long time so I wanted

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.680 
bugging me for a long time so I wanted
to<00:02:10.720> replace<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.730> found<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.360> really

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
to replace it and I found a really

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.440 
to replace it and I found a really
really<00:02:14.020> good<00:02:14.170> upgrade<00:02:14.530> from<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
really good upgrade from this on the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.570 
really good upgrade from this on the
internet<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.960> I'm<00:02:17.050> showing<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.650> right<00:02:17.710> now

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.520 

so<00:02:21.580> here<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.910> my<00:02:22.030> new<00:02:22.180> tripod<00:02:22.630> head<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.410> is

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
so here is my new tripod head this is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.040 
so here is my new tripod head this is
also<00:02:23.680> as<00:02:23.860> from<00:02:24.040> velbon<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.240> bail<00:02:25.480> flow<00:02:25.750> 9

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
also as from velbon it's a bail flow 9

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.480 
also as from velbon it's a bail flow 9
pH<00:02:26.560> 368<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.770> other<00:02:29.860> one<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.280> got<00:02:30.430> a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
pH 368 and like the other one it's got a

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.320 
pH 368 and like the other one it's got a
nice<00:02:30.730> fluid<00:02:31.620> pan<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.430> also<00:02:33.550> has<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:34.060> fluid

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
nice fluid pan but it also has a fluid

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.330 
nice fluid pan but it also has a fluid
tilt<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:36.910> extremely<00:02:37.660> smooth<00:02:38.050> in<00:02:38.980> fact

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
tilt and it's extremely smooth in fact

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.740 
tilt and it's extremely smooth in fact
this<00:02:39.940> rivals<00:02:40.390> some<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.140> Fratto

this rivals some of that and Fratto

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.850 
this rivals some of that and Fratto

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
kind of an unexpected thing is this

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.620 
kind of an unexpected thing is this
quick<00:03:50.590> release<00:03:50.830> plate<00:03:51.100> it's<00:03:52.060> nice<00:03:52.270> when<00:03:52.450> it's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
quick release plate it's nice when it's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.820 
quick release plate it's nice when it's
got<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.840> cork<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.260> everything<00:03:53.500> but<00:03:53.680> that's

got the cork and everything but that's

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.050 
got the cork and everything but that's
not<00:03:54.040> what<00:03:54.160> makes<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.400> special<00:03:54.459> what<00:03:54.820> makes<00:03:54.940> it

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
not what makes it special what makes it

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.990 
not what makes it special what makes it
special<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:56.050> that<00:03:56.110> when<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.680> release<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.340> it

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
special is that when you release it it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.270 
special is that when you release it it
basically<00:03:58.570> will<00:03:59.140> keep<00:03:59.410> this<00:03:59.709> whole<00:03:59.859> tab<00:04:00.040> comes

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
basically will keep this whole tab comes

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.809 
basically will keep this whole tab comes
up<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.030> locks<00:04:01.329> it<00:04:01.600> in<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.840> open<00:04:02.140> position

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
up and it locks it in the open position

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.300 
up and it locks it in the open position

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
up right away and within I think I think

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.659 
up right away and within I think I think
about<00:05:18.720> 24<00:05:19.080> hours<00:05:19.169> they<00:05:20.159> were<00:05:20.220> out<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.460> stock
