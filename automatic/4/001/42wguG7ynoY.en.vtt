00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.980
 The first thing we have done today is 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.740
 mix wheat flour or corn starch 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.359
 salt paprika eggs oil and with this 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.670
 mix we have made creation in the way 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.770
 traditionally later and themselves 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.290
 to the lamb shank with vegetables in 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.269
 a wok we fill the three we fold 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.249
 in the way of lubia and fry them in 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.280
 abundant oil that was fine 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.600
 hot 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.730
 we are simply going to place in all the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.730
 half of the bittersweet looking 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.380
 we place here bittersweet indicates this 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.500
 peach with first stop being 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.610
 it's hotter 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.610
 I just did it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.160
 also now yes 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.160
 the moon 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.540
 because they intervene the mother mass of 250 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.540
 grams of flour 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 m 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.280
 anything any other aroma 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 spectacular 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.910
 ascentic before famous types 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.290
 the recipe fairly simple be respected 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.520
 the proportions if it fails to respect 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.720
 the proportions of the royal because it 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.720
 they open very easily 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.500
 thought not as a close- up what 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.250
 it's a 1st 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.250
 a scene 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:01.600
 at that moment why 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.400
 with beer 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.500
 I have Chinese sticks here to make it 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.640
 very small to be able to grab one of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.640
 are you so I 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.520
 with hand
