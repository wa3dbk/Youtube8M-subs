top on the contractor saw the way the
sauce<00:00:18.810> top<00:00:19.140> technology<00:00:19.590> works<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.430> there's

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
sauce top technology works is there's

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.100 
sauce top technology works is there's
this<00:00:20.759> print<00:00:21.060> cartridge<00:00:21.480> that's<00:00:21.689> mounted

this print cartridge that's mounted
below<00:00:22.259> the<00:00:22.560> saw<00:00:22.740> blade<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.849> it<00:00:23.970> does<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.390> this

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
below the saw blade but it does is this

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.749 
below the saw blade but it does is this
microprocessor<00:00:24.930> puts<00:00:25.739> a<00:00:25.829> small<00:00:26.130> electrical

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
microprocessor puts a small electrical

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.330 
microprocessor puts a small electrical
charge<00:00:27.090> into<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> blade<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.349> monitors<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
charge into the blade and monitors it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.689 
charge into the blade and monitors it
and<00:00:30.089> your<00:00:30.539> body<00:00:30.779> has<00:00:31.259> a<00:00:31.410> natural<00:00:31.529> ability<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
and your body has a natural ability to

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.610 
and your body has a natural ability to
absorb<00:00:32.940> electricity<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.080> when<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.320> come<00:00:34.500> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
absorb electricity so when you come in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.430 
absorb electricity so when you come in
contact<00:00:34.830> with<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.430> blade<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:36.420> draw<00:00:36.989> some<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
contact with the blade you draw some of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590 
contact with the blade you draw some of
that<00:00:37.559> current<00:00:37.980> off<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.430> detects<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> drop<00:00:39.390> in

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that current off it detects the drop in

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.920 
that current off it detects the drop in
voltage<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.610> releases<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.059> aluminum

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
voltage and releases the this aluminum

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.380 
voltage and releases the this aluminum
block<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.440> into<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> blade<00:00:44.220> and<00:00:44.460> stops<00:00:45.150> the

block up into the blade and stops the
blade<00:00:45.830> additionally<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:47.839> we<00:00:48.839> take<00:00:49.019> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
blade additionally the we take the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.719 
blade additionally the we take the
momentum<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.830> blade<00:00:50.040> spinning<00:00:50.339> at<00:00:50.549> about

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
momentum of the blade spinning at about

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.810 
momentum of the blade spinning at about
3,500<00:00:51.210> rpm<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.250> quick<00:00:53.519> release

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
3,500 rpm and we have a quick release

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630 
3,500 rpm and we have a quick release
mechanism<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.900> arbor<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.220> does<00:00:56.400> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
mechanism on the arbor what it does is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.579 
mechanism on the arbor what it does is
it<00:00:56.670> stops<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.540> blade<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:58.110> moves<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
it stops the blade and then moves the

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.229 
it stops the blade and then moves the
blade<00:00:58.799> down<00:00:59.070> below<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.610> surface<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.089> the

your car so it goes quick so this today
at<00:01:10.470> M&amp;M<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.880> use<00:01:12.090> carrot

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
at M&amp;M I'm and actually use carrot

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.240 
at M&amp;M I'm and actually use carrot
because<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> take<00:01:13.710> care<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
because it can take care it is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.150 
because it can take care it is
conductive<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.120> part<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.720> my<00:01:15.870> body<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:17.010> I

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
conductive and it's part of my body if I

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.770 
conductive and it's part of my body if I
just<00:01:17.310> put<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> carrot<00:01:17.910> down<00:01:18.060> there<00:01:18.240> itself<00:01:18.540> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
just put the carrot down there itself it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990 
just put the carrot down there itself it
wouldn't<00:01:19.110> set<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.440> off<00:01:19.590> usually<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.640> use<00:01:20.670> on

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
wouldn't set it off usually we use on

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.730 
wouldn't set it off usually we use on
dog<00:01:21.300> but<00:01:21.480> at<00:01:21.600> Eminem<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> carrots<00:01:24.740> believe

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
dog but at Eminem or the carrots believe

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.030 
dog but at Eminem or the carrots believe
there's<00:01:26.070> don't<00:01:26.310> hear<00:01:26.970> ya<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.680> what<00:01:28.830> I'm<00:01:28.920> going

there's don't hear ya so what I'm going

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.290 
there's don't hear ya so what I'm going
to<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.370> I'm<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.940> going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.120> power

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
to do is I'm going to I'm going to power

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.330 
to do is I'm going to I'm going to power
up<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.659> saw<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.050> show<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.130> quick

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
up the saw and show you what the quick

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.000 
up the saw and show you what the quick
diagnostic<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.270> goes<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.750> goes<00:01:34.440> through<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
diagnostic it goes to goes through and

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.960 
diagnostic it goes to goes through and
then<00:01:35.100> we're<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> go<00:01:35.580> ahead<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
then we're going to go ahead and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.200 
then we're going to go ahead and
activate<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.720> thing<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:38.040> first<00:01:38.730> of<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:38.970> when

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
activate this thing so first of all when

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.350 
activate this thing so first of all when
i<00:01:39.240> turn<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> power<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.700> get<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.880> couple<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
i turn the power on I get a couple of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.790 
i turn the power on I get a couple of
diagnostic<00:01:42.960> lights<00:01:43.170> right<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.710> the
