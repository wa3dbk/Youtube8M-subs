00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
about before I do a big rail or a big

is absolutely nothing you have to
personally<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.070> clear<00:00:29.279> my<00:00:29.310> mind

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
personally I have to clear my mind

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
personally I have to clear my mind
before<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.480> even<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.840> try<00:00:31.109> something

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
before I can even like try something

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.229 
before I can even like try something
like<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.949> I'm<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.700> rolling<00:00:32.969> up<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
like that if I'm like rolling up the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.740 
like that if I'm like rolling up the
rail<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.620> think<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.520> something<00:00:35.760> before<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
rail and I think of something before I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.560 
rail and I think of something before I
do<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> trick<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.640> start<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
do the trick I have to like start to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.410 
do the trick I have to like start to
like<00:00:39.719> stop<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:39.989> start<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.559> again<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.420> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
like stop and start all over again and I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
like stop and start all over again and I
have<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.989> completely<00:00:43.620> clear-headed

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
have to like be completely clear-headed

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.400 
have to like be completely clear-headed
before<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.059> trick<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.079> I'm

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
before I do the trick so I think I'm

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
before I do the trick so I think I'm
more<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.610> head<00:00:47.789> first<00:00:47.969> than<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
more of a like in my head first than a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
more of a like in my head first than a
lot<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.510> other<00:00:48.629> people<00:00:48.930> I'm<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:50.100> example

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
lot of other people I'm just an example

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.180 
lot of other people I'm just an example
to<00:00:50.489> show<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.120> back<00:00:51.989> probably<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.829> year<00:00:53.129> or

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to show that is back probably a year or

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.979 
to show that is back probably a year or
two<00:00:53.370> ago<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:53.969> trying<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.480> big<00:00:54.809> old

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
two ago when I was trying this big old

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.279 
two ago when I was trying this big old
kinked<00:00:55.379> rail<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.800> school<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:57.109> was<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
kinked rail at my school I was with a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.180 
kinked rail at my school I was with a
few<00:00:58.500> friends<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.809> right<00:01:00.809> before<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.469> popped<00:01:01.920> my

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
few friends and right before I popped my

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.539 
few friends and right before I popped my
friend<00:01:02.579> coughed<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.739> when<00:01:04.739> he<00:01:04.890> coughed<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
friend coughed and when he coughed all I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.770 
friend coughed and when he coughed all I
could<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:05.820> about<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.330> head<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> like

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
could think about in my head is like

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.300 
could think about in my head is like
that<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.350> would<00:01:07.470> sound<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.070> broke

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that but it would sound like if I broke

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
that but it would sound like if I broke
my<00:01:08.460> rib<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.299> an<00:01:09.420> oddly<00:01:09.780> like

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
my rib this was like an oddly like

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.859 
my rib this was like an oddly like
mucousy<00:01:10.439> cough<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.979> right<00:01:11.939> after<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> fall<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
mucousy cough and right after I fall I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.899 
mucousy cough and right after I fall I
slipped<00:01:13.470> off<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.619> rail<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> my<00:01:14.400> chest<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
slipped off the rail and my chest on the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.200 
slipped off the rail and my chest on the
rail<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> broke<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:15.869> rib<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.520> cough<00:01:17.520> exactly

rail and broke my rib and cough exactly

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
rail and broke my rib and cough exactly
like<00:01:18.360> he<00:01:18.479> did<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.799> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.009> goes<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
like he did so that just kind of goes to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
like he did so that just kind of goes to
show<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.729> what<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.360> will<00:01:21.540> happen<00:01:21.689> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
show like what you think will happen is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570 
show like what you think will happen is
what<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> happen<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> most

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
what is going to happen for the most

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.320 
what is going to happen for the most
part<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:25.290> why<00:01:25.530> most<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.430> skateboarding

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
part so that's why most of skateboarding

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.469 
part so that's why most of skateboarding
is<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:28.189> like<00:01:29.189> picturing<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.909> doing<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> chick

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is is like picturing you doing the chick

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
is is like picturing you doing the chick
and<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:30.810> you'll<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> trick<00:01:31.650> if

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and then you'll actually do the trick if

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010 
and then you'll actually do the trick if
you're<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> chick<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.630> think

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you're going up the chick and you think

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
you're going up the chick and you think
you're<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.229> gonna<00:01:34.470> land<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.159> chances

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you're not gonna land it then chances

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.039 
you're not gonna land it then chances
are<00:01:35.970> you're<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.329> land<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> unless<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
are you're not gonna land it unless you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
are you're not gonna land it unless you
get<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.259> lucky<00:01:37.530> start<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.549> something

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
get really lucky start on something

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.270 
get really lucky start on something
smaller<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.750> you're<00:01:40.049> trying<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> ollie<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
smaller if you're trying to ollie a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.030 
smaller if you're trying to ollie a
based<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.700> set<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.899> warm<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> smaller

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
based a set then warm up on a smaller

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.249 
based a set then warm up on a smaller
stay<00:01:44.280> set<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> trick<00:01:45.899> down<00:01:46.049> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
stay set and get the trick down that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.749 
stay set and get the trick down that
you're<00:01:46.350> trying<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> smaller<00:01:47.490> stair

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you're trying just off the smaller stair

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.340 
you're trying just off the smaller stair
set<00:01:48.000> until<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.689> feel<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.170> comfortable

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
set until you feel really comfortable

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
set until you feel really comfortable
with<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.130> then<00:01:50.280> go<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> bigger<00:01:50.909> one

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
with it and then go to the bigger one

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.990 
with it and then go to the bigger one
and<00:01:51.950> what<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:54.950> let's<00:01:55.950> say<00:01:56.130> I'm<00:01:56.250> trying<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
and what I do is let's say I'm trying to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
and what I do is let's say I'm trying to
kickflip<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> drop

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
kickflip the drop

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.860 
kickflip the drop
before<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> actually<00:01:59.730> track<00:02:00.150> keeping<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.660> drop

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
before I actually track keeping the drop

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.930 
before I actually track keeping the drop
I'll<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.410> little<00:02:01.620> like<00:02:01.890> fake<00:02:02.280> attempt<00:02:02.700> where

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
I'll do a little like fake attempt where

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.680 
I'll do a little like fake attempt where
I<00:02:02.970> sort<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.330> like

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
I sort of just like

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.410 
I sort of just like
fling<00:02:04.020> myself<00:02:04.200> down<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.040> get<00:02:05.940> like<00:02:06.180> my

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
fling myself down it and get like my

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
fling myself down it and get like my
knees<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.900> body<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:08.070> broken<00:02:08.369> into

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
knees and body and all that broken into

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.580 
knees and body and all that broken into
the<00:02:08.850> impact<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.200> gets<00:02:10.350> me<00:02:10.470> more

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the impact and that just gets me more

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.140 
the impact and that just gets me more
comfortable<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.220> actually<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.700> down<00:02:11.820> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
comfortable with actually going down the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.910 
comfortable with actually going down the
gap<00:02:12.330> because<00:02:12.780> once<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.320> first<00:02:13.380> like

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
gap because once you get that first like

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.560 
gap because once you get that first like
initial<00:02:14.450> carcass<00:02:15.450> toss<00:02:15.840> out<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> way<00:02:16.800> then

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
initial carcass toss out of the way then

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.160 
initial carcass toss out of the way then
you're<00:02:18.570> going<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.750> feel<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.959> lot<00:02:19.110> more

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
you're going to feel a lot more

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.500 
you're going to feel a lot more
comfortable<00:02:19.440> with<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.190> with<00:02:20.940> rails<00:02:21.240> I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
comfortable with it and with rails I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.170 
comfortable with it and with rails I
love<00:02:21.959> doing<00:02:22.230> big<00:02:22.410> rails<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.950> my<00:02:23.910> little

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
love doing big rails and my little

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.650 
love doing big rails and my little
secret<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:25.110> always<00:02:26.070> be<00:02:27.060> ready<00:02:27.450> to

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
notice all the like big rails that I do

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.830 
notice all the like big rails that I do
have<00:02:31.980> something<00:02:32.489> pleasant<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> other

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
side of them as in like grass or dirt or

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.449 
side of them as in like grass or dirt or
not<00:02:36.390> stairs<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.170> not<00:02:37.320> rocks<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.130> not<00:02:38.250> bad

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.970 
not stairs and not rocks and not bad
things<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.120> that's<00:02:39.540> because<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:40.800> you're

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
things and that's because like if you're

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.160 
things and that's because like if you're
going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.280> fifty-fifty<00:02:41.730> rail<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.810> jump

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
going to fifty-fifty rail and you jump

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.449 
going to fifty-fifty rail and you jump
off<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.530> side<00:02:43.739> you're<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> land<00:02:44.310> in

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
off to the side you're going to land in

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.420 
off to the side you're going to land in
grass<00:02:44.670> or<00:02:44.850> whatever<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.280> is

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
grass or whatever it is and that just is

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.250 
grass or whatever it is and that just is
way<00:02:47.940> easier<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.540> get<00:02:48.660> comfortable<00:02:48.989> with<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
way easier to get comfortable with the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.780 
way easier to get comfortable with the
rail<00:02:49.440> because<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:49.950> jump<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.400> jump

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
rail because you can just jump on jump

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.370 
rail because you can just jump on jump
off<00:02:50.940> super<00:02:51.239> quick<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.660> then<00:02:52.140> eventually

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
off super quick and then eventually

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.449 
off super quick and then eventually
you're<00:02:52.620> going<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.800> get<00:02:52.890> more<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.160> more<00:02:53.220> down

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
you're going to get more and more down

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.610 
you're going to get more and more down
the<00:02:53.580> rail<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.940> that's<00:02:54.480> pretty<00:02:54.810> much<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.470> how

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the rail and that's pretty much just how

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.770 
the rail and that's pretty much just how
I<00:02:55.650> do<00:02:55.800> big<00:02:56.100> rails<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.489> just<00:02:56.670> jump<00:02:57.300> off<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> side

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
I do big rails I just jump off the side

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.210 
I do big rails I just jump off the side
a<00:02:57.840> few<00:02:57.989> times<00:02:58.230> get<00:02:58.500> comfortable<00:02:58.830> with<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.040> and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
a few times get comfortable with it and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.940 
a few times get comfortable with it and
then<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.459> fully<00:02:59.730> commit<00:03:00.290> commitment<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.440> key

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
then just fully commit commitment is key

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.580 
then just fully commit commitment is key
if<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.280> don't<00:03:02.910> commit<00:03:03.290> chances<00:03:04.290> are<00:03:04.440> you're

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
if you don't commit chances are you're

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.110 
if you don't commit chances are you're
not<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.920> land<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.160> trick<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.610> can

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
not going to land the trick I can

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.520 
not going to land the trick I can
understand<00:03:06.510> not<00:03:06.720> committed<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.320> first

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
understand not committed on the first

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.990 
understand not committed on the first
trial<00:03:07.799> if<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.100> was<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.400> talking<00:03:08.670> about<00:03:08.790> just

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
trial if I was just talking about just

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.420 
trial if I was just talking about just
to<00:03:09.150> get<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.390> feel<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.840> trick<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.739> after

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
to get the feel of the trick but after

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.350 
to get the feel of the trick but after
that<00:03:11.580> you're<00:03:11.790> going<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.000> want<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.180> start

comfortable committing is for me at

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.509 
comfortable committing is for me at
least<00:03:19.110> let's<00:03:19.470> say<00:03:19.560> I'm<00:03:19.650> trying<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.950> kickflip<00:03:20.340> if

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
least let's say I'm trying a kickflip if

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.640 
least let's say I'm trying a kickflip if
I<00:03:21.090> catch<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.630> kickflip<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.080> then<00:03:22.260> kick<00:03:22.470> out

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
I catch the kickflip and then kick out

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.740 
I catch the kickflip and then kick out
then<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> know<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.640> next<00:03:23.850> time<00:03:24.000> I'll<00:03:24.299> be<00:03:24.510> able

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
then I know that next time I'll be able

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.870 
then I know that next time I'll be able
to<00:03:24.840> not<00:03:24.989> kick<00:03:25.200> out<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.530> land<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.700> sort

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
to not kick out and land it so it sort

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.190 
to not kick out and land it so it sort
of<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.239> work<00:03:27.600> your<00:03:27.810> way<00:03:27.900> up<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.049> it

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
like first you just throw yourself down

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.580 
like first you just throw yourself down
the<00:03:29.640> gap<00:03:29.820> then<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.810> flick<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.380> trick

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
the gap then you like flick the trick

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.080 
the gap then you like flick the trick
but<00:03:31.799> don't<00:03:31.950> really<00:03:32.190> catch<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.820> sort<00:03:33.060> of

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
but don't really catch it just sort of

but don't really catch it just sort of
bail<00:03:33.330> out<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.870> then<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.110> catch<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.470> trick

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680

not a good idea that's definitely

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.870 
not a good idea that's definitely
pushing<00:04:01.320> your<00:04:01.440> limits<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:02.310> if<00:04:02.430> you've<00:04:02.610> like

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
rolling up to a trick and I start to

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.150 
rolling up to a trick and I start to
think<00:04:23.570> something<00:04:24.139> I<00:04:24.289> immediately<00:04:24.680> stop

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
think something I immediately stop

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.379 
think something I immediately stop
because<00:04:25.400> I've<00:04:25.520> learned<00:04:25.699> my<00:04:25.940> lesson<00:04:26.210> from<00:04:26.240> that

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
I've like thought something and then

see how it works so that's about it it's
really<00:05:02.930> hard<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.289> explain<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.740> mental<00:05:04.010> side

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
really hard to explain the mental side

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.379 
really hard to explain the mental side
of<00:05:04.190> skateboarding<00:05:04.789> because<00:05:04.910> everyone's

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
of skateboarding because everyone's

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.390 
of skateboarding because everyone's
brain<00:05:05.690> is<00:05:05.900> sort<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.139> different<00:05:06.500> but<00:05:06.830> that's

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
brain is sort of different but that's

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.939 
brain is sort of different but that's
how<00:05:07.550> my<00:05:07.669> brain<00:05:07.880> works<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:08.449> know<00:05:08.780> that<00:05:09.289> a<00:05:09.530> lot<00:05:09.650> of

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
how my brain works I know that a lot of

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.589 
how my brain works I know that a lot of
other<00:05:10.070> people's<00:05:10.490> brains<00:05:10.610> work<00:05:10.940> like<00:05:11.150> that<00:05:11.180> too

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
other people's brains work like that too

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.830 
other people's brains work like that too
um<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:13.610> it's<00:05:13.820> been<00:05:13.970> working<00:05:14.150> for<00:05:14.270> me<00:05:14.539> so<00:05:14.810> I

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
um and it's been working for me so I

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.200 
um and it's been working for me so I
suggest<00:05:15.349> that<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:15.680> listen<00:05:16.190> to<00:05:16.280> my<00:05:16.370> brain<00:05:16.639> and

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
suggest that you listen to my brain and

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.270 
suggest that you listen to my brain and
program<00:05:17.870> your<00:05:18.050> brain<00:05:18.169> could<00:05:18.770> be<00:05:18.830> like<00:05:19.039> my

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
program your brain could be like my

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.540 
program your brain could be like my
brain<00:05:19.580> we<00:05:20.240> can<00:05:20.389> share<00:05:20.690> brain<00:05:21.110> waves<00:05:21.380> would<00:05:22.340> be

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
brain we can share brain waves would be

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.370 
brain we can share brain waves would be
