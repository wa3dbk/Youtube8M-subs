 ok then that we were going to start with 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.130
 this video tutorial 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 to 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.590
 a new video and one of our 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.430
 songs only is to train you 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.800
 I already have versions 14 of we see the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.270
 version of 14 and good is nascent the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.890
 You can download directly from the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.270
 official page of the match com that you 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.180
 I'm going to be discarded, I'll be 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.010
 leaving here in the description of the video 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.990
 you only have that the products and we have 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.920
 version and simply there you go to 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.350
 download the new version ok weighs 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.530
 about 2 gigs and when you read it 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.570
 installing them will ask you what 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.110
 version you want installed and the pro katz 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.600
 the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.549
 study 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.130
 and all these versions that we have here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.869
 so as not to make you alone so long 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.759
 I recommend that you activate the study 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.650
 because it is the one that has more all the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.850
 tools that will be available 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.750
 in the full and good version here 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.840
 simply add a sphere of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:08.179
 store and this one floor and activate the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.430
 options of amazed which girls that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.430
 and added a shadow and well we have 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.290
 great improvements here in this one version 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.480
 of which I liked the most is the one 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.200
 sculpt that right now I'll follow you 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.200
 so that it works 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.120
 we have new parameters on this side 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.560
 because it changes a little bit of the version 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.989
 previous we have improvements in 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.800
 found labels buttocks tag 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.020
 he has not tried all he said that 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.319
 that's not a completely environment 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.000
 different from what we had previously 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.000
 I am a little more elegant and as you see here 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.470
 it's a little better 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.709
 another of the differences we have and 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.690
 without the render options here by 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.080
 example the global lighting that is 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.480
 that if here in effects the sampling is 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.459
 separate from the small piece and rancid that in the 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.350
 previous version were these two 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.800
 parameters together 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.890
 and good 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.850
 we have environmental exposure 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.240
 we practically have the same 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.240
 parameters 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.810
 and well let's do a render here 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.810
 small 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.870
 how do you see the foot basically not 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.060
 nothing changes our 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.659
 our interface is practically what 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.810
 same that the only thing that changes are the 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.209
 that until now I've seen are these 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.590
 tools that they put us and also 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.629
 teaches what is the use of 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.630
 Sculpting tool let's add 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.920
 a plane the plane 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.420
 let's put the 800 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.560
 for 800 then be avoidable with the key 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.870
 0 by clicking on this on this 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.710
 tool and we're going to right click 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.310
 on the plane 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.640
 you will go 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.859
 to sculpt and you're going to subdivide and you 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.139
 This label will appear on the 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.090
 sculpting tag by selecting the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.380
 plan everything has been sculpting again 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.720
 Brushes 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.920
 and here we have different brushes like 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.310
 you can notice it here you can go adjusting 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.760
 the size and precision 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.210
 that you want and good this tool is 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.850
 he told us in a previous video 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.300
 that he only apologizes or 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.460
 you'll find in programs like bruce and 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.370
 school pressing moon box 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.180
 but good here we already have builds 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.370
 cinema 4d forgiveness no longer incorporates them that 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.849
 it's pretty good at least for me 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.370
 it's something that I like in programs like 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.150
 this 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.950
 and good 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.420
 I hope you download this little 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.570
 demo version 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.300
 what are two girls and good to try 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.940
 get the full version but I 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 I imagine they are in a few weeks 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.840
 two weeks or so in what 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.300
 someone has been robin hood 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.409
 ok then as soon as I have it either 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.849
 to publish them 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.849
 aquino in a video tutorial 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.069
 he knew of some video tutorial and already you 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.120
 I said the link so you discard it 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.060
 but it's good to do a little more 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.229
 forward in what led to getting and 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.169
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:48.949
 this little introduction about the 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:50.480
 cinema 4d the moon the depression to 14 and 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.980
 by the way 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.900
 there are many of you good we are 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.690
 watching the tutorial 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.340
 al ferrari ok we are going to do it did not arrive 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.650

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.720
 like but still reached 30 are the 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.570
 enough to cheer him up ok 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.580
 then I guess it's going to be a 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.130
 series of tutorials on modeling 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.020
 so that we get a nice result 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.370
 then I say goodbye to you guys I hope that 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.250
