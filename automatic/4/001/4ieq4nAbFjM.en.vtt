00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.959
 with dear friends with you faces and today 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.269
 I want to show you one cool 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.360
 the thing I built on my own 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.180
 this is a factory for the production of holiday 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.160
 automatically he completely 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:25.630
 automated it was remove it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.060
 but she is not the essence of Satan what is it about 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.670
 whether it is for now he absolutely 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.730
 automated right down to the warehouse here 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.990
 he warehouse is the occupancy level 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.840
 cane that is how you see today 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.530
 about that with us he starts automation 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.320
 fill 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.940
 there is and just as well we can go there and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.420
 fill that is here it is worth 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.420
 funnel 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.510
 damn it is necessary to close the hole and all she 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.079
 went up now go over here 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.050
 our warehouse will be filled this level 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:10.060
 occupancy one such light bulb 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:16.479
 denotes one double chest ie 1 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.520
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 10 chests which 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.850
 They want this away so that the sound does not 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.850
 interfered with 10 chests that 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.689
 work for this plant constantly 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.610
 the scheme is fully automated in volume 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.710
 The plan that you need in nifiga do not need 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.960
 do other than just collect 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.200
 necessary as a terrible veteran 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.500
 filled during this time from what 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.409
 This whole mechanism consists of those 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.539
 elements that I have already 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:52.759
 invented by someone I just gathered them 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.590
 It was in such a scheme that my one was 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:00.280
 I wanted to build something big 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:03.140
 turned out the name is reed and so look 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.330
 at first itâ€™s automatic 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.060
 activator he works on the principle 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.100
 activated firstly growing up 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.480
 reed need length i see 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.739
 12 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.739
 grows up 3 and 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.950
 About the whole circuit is activated that is all 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.189
 great everything is super then next 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.120
 option is it activated by day that is 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.819
 if a 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:39.609
 the brightest peak of the day is about him 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:42.760
 with set 6 500 it seems you see 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:46.239
 changed the time of day he activated 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.239
 then if we 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:56.359
 7008 s I donâ€™t remember how much 888 10 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.769
 Russian will it be closed and porsche and 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.739
 pistons and 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.299
 that is, in any case, it is activated 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.780
 no matter how after that you can 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:11.829
 listen bang does not start to fall 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.829
 cane in the elevator for 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.540
 what is the name of the left to loot she him 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.760
 right will call you show he 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.190
 not quite compact so i already found 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.840
 The circuit is more compact than this but not 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.630
 less that is, here it is the elevator it rises 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:33.290
 up up up up here is the beginning of the whole 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.440
 snow falls in this bag 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.930
 coil bolt in the funnels and funnels 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.599
 he comes here and raises them up you see 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.920
 pop pop and up here it is in the top 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:53.430
 funnel with funnels it goes here and 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.079
 here we are using corporate code and 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.720
 It's easy how not to call perov 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.630
 I do not remember , I activate this block 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.870
 lamp 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.180
 accordingly when the box 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.380
 there is some kind of loot 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:14.040
 nothing but here we have come on 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.070
 Further loot to us fill this us 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.600
 need a little scale now we have it on 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.600
 I will show you now 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.160
 So 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.970
 interesting is not enough to fill 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.970
 there is a box 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:39.849
 then we have another Cooper here 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.819
 which we fill him too 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.250
 necessarily and in the midst of that we 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.770
 it turns out we and the full three boxes and 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.770
 is if we throw here now 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:55.090
 another if we are of a Chamber of 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.370
 caught fire that is, we already have four 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.669
 chests ie three fully filled 4 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.650
 is filled in the process level so 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.289
 let's say charging our farm 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.180
 that is, all four of these mechanisms or 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.650
 how many mechanisms are there automatic 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.360
 start that is it works for us 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.219
 several times a day 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.270
 creeper starts her creeper come on 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.270
 say everything to me 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:30.240
 thanks dude so the mechanism farm itself 2 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.350
 the mechanism we get is the price 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.960
 on somatic 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.880
 of enough stock is with us 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.970
 as much as you like and in what 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.260
 height depending on loading chunks 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:48.710
 already on visit so about the height and 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.830
 and let's take a look at how 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.020
 elevator 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.460
 that is , I think elevators can do here 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.590
 because it has already activated itself in 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.300
 some time the bright sun and the mechanism 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.970
 started working that is the elevator lifts 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.050
 all goods up and indicator supplement 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.760
 the warehouse that is all enough 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.740
 automatic you only need to collect 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.740
 all look op op 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.360
 He already was filled want so quickly 1 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:23.020
 2 3 4 5 6 for 8 days 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.420
 yes ok fast and not particularly you 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:30.520
 delivers steaming over the cane 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:31.240
 or I'll be there for something else probably 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.600
 everything 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.220
 the card itself you can download below in 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.220
 describing it somewhere 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:45.880
 thank you there was a lead fishing rod not 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.030
 forget to subscribe to new meetings 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.030
 until
