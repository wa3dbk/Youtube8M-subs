stainless<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.630> sustainless<00:00:36.989> shorty<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.540> yeah

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
stainless it sustainless shorty and yeah

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.060 
stainless it sustainless shorty and yeah
I<00:00:39.570> mean<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.870> think<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.649> looks<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.920> lot

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
what I did is I put the back end

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.899 
what I did is I put the back end
assembly<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.600> break<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.250> tensioner

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
assembly on break you know tensioner

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.410 
assembly on break you know tensioner
plates<00:01:30.210> etc<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.490> something<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.299> do

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
plates etc you know just something to do

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
I had absolutely nothing to do and yes

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
I had absolutely nothing to do and yes
so<00:01:36.659> yesterday<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> was<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.350> ready<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> go<00:01:38.070> as

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so yesterday I was all ready to go as

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.590 
so yesterday I was all ready to go as
you<00:01:38.310> could<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> should<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.119> my<00:01:39.240> piston

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you could see I should have my piston

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.190 
you could see I should have my piston
all<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.900> RAF<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.549> here<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.790> vertex<00:01:42.689> forty

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
all and RAF to here is a vertex forty

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.039 
all and RAF to here is a vertex forty
eight<00:01:43.320> point<00:01:43.590> five<00:01:43.829> millimeter<00:01:44.399> piston

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
eight point five millimeter piston

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
eight point five millimeter piston
teflon<00:01:46.049> coating<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> reason<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.850> went

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
teflon coating now the reason I went

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.609 
teflon coating now the reason I went
with<00:01:48.149> vertex<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.020> they're<00:01:49.229> aluminum

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
with vertex is because they're aluminum

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.280 
with vertex is because they're aluminum
pistons<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.899> bore<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
pistons is what in the the the bore the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
pistons is what in the the the bore the
cylinder<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.740> aluminum<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.250> well<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
cylinder is aluminum as well so the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
cylinder is aluminum as well so the
expansion<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.049> contraction<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> heat

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
expansion and contraction with the heat

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.969 
expansion and contraction with the heat
and<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.000> cooling<00:02:00.149> down<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> motor

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
and the cooling down of the motor

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
and the cooling down of the motor
they're<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.430> do<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.030> may<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
they're if they do they may do it at the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.839 
they're if they do they may do it at the
same<00:02:04.409> rate<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.809 

we<00:02:10.849> have<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.329> new<00:02:12.069> 2009<00:02:13.069> KX<00:02:14.950> 85j<00:02:15.950> option<00:02:16.489> open

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
we have the new 2009 KX 85j option open

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.250 
we have the new 2009 KX 85j option open
here's<00:02:16.969> the<00:02:17.090> head<00:02:17.239> actually<00:02:17.420> cuz<00:02:18.109> that
