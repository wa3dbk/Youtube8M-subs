00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.359
 so good afternoon today decided to write 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.510
 small di answer about 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.019
 Is it possible to bury and check the oil in 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.139
 motor 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:23.779
 on the engine running and so we start 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:27.320
 motor started the engine 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.320
 fertility work 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.280
 worthy of 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:43.410
 work him grief and jumps like you again 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.410
 normally open for different traffic jams 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.020
 Yes there is 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.840
 how can he then be a spectator 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.510
 although on the street breasts and you can pour 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.040
 quietly 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.700
 just did not have to pour a little 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.700
 that's why we take oil 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.440
 I will lose the cork 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.940
 and add 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.750
 I just approach to the problem 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.750
 carbide 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.450
 play butter 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.230
 this 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.230
 little by little 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.110
 let's go! 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.590
 neatly on the wall is just 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.760
 carry on not played well, somewhere here so 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.980
 we have Odessa problem it can 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.640
 Spray the oil can be poured oil 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.640
 and so this is my video answers to the question 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.240
 is it possible to pour oil on the running 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.860
 engine 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.920
 as we saw that it is possible but 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.620
 neatly desirable to use 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.300
 any funnel to just butter 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.240
 did not splash out of the oil cap 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.760
 that's the only reason why not 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160
 it is advisable to pour oil on the running 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.620
 engine but if you need such 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.980
 need let's say you burned out 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.320
 starter or some other situation that you 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.900
 you can not make the village who sits down 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.680
 battery you can't start it 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.520
 need to get there 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.190
 your oil goes away you have slammed somewhere 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.540
 million can be a situation when leaves 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.840
 oil forehead trash can 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.329
 somewhere the gasket really broke through here 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.810
 so on oil goes away and you talk about it 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.239
 know you need to get to the place 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.140
 pour on the hot mass open 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:53.269
 of course the coolant is hot 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.040
 Well, I will not show it so it 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.040
 fraught with consequences 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.120
 Already Eugene has a video where he is 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.280
 tested 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.519
 engine blew it there visually 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.560
 I understand why you can not open but 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.319
 very neat that they throw out very 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.000
 lots of liquid from directly 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.150
 radiator, that is, it needs to be done very 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.609
 neat with a rag to protect your 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.659
 hands inside it should be bigger 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:23.419
 in order and that is preferably away 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.960
 in a mitten so that we can then 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.660
 quickly remove it all if 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.070
 hot coolant you have you 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.090
 only a rag should fall completely 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.620
 close and nets here in principle everything 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.710
 Thanks for attention 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.930
 I hope that I fully responded to 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.930
 This question thank you all
