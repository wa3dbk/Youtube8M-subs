00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
have some ideas on how to build their

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.450 
have some ideas on how to build their
own<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:36.170> got<00:00:37.170> online<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.070> looking<00:00:38.370> at

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
own I got online and I was looking at

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.720 
own I got online and I was looking at
stands<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.329> tank<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:41.100> prices<00:00:41.579> were

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
stands for this tank and the prices were

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.860 
stands for this tank and the prices were
astronomical

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
astronomical

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.690 
astronomical
eight<00:00:43.110> nine<00:00:43.500> hundred<00:00:43.950> dollars<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.489> thought

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
eight nine hundred dollars I thought

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.869 
eight nine hundred dollars I thought
that<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.000> ridiculous<00:00:45.739> I<00:00:46.739> went<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that was ridiculous I went to the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
that was ridiculous I went to the
hardware<00:00:48.090> store<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.780> bought<00:00:48.960> some<00:00:49.230> lumber

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
hardware store and I bought some lumber

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.400 
hardware store and I bought some lumber
and<00:00:49.910> built<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.090> own<00:00:51.270> stand<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.260> it's

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and built my own stand and I think it's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.090 
and built my own stand and I think it's
better<00:00:52.620> than<00:00:52.829> anything<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.460> could<00:00:53.730> buy

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
better than anything that I could buy

better than anything that I could buy

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
plywood at Home Depot the way I designed

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
plywood at Home Depot the way I designed
this<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:56.310> stand<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:58.409> frame<00:01:58.799> itself<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.200> what

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
this the stand the frame itself is what

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.950 
this the stand the frame itself is what
holds<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> tank<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.250> basically<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> built<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
holds the tank up basically I built a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.229 
holds the tank up basically I built a
box<00:02:04.469> frame<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.090> studs<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.819> build<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
box frame out of studs you can build it

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
box frame out of studs you can build it
as<00:02:09.390> tall<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.899> want<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.470> think<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.890> did<00:02:11.039> mine

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
as tall as you want I think I did mine

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.110 
as tall as you want I think I did mine
like<00:02:11.459> 36<00:02:11.970> inches<00:02:12.360> or<00:02:12.540> something

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
like 36 inches or something

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.430 
like 36 inches or something
so<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:14.420> built<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.810> box<00:02:15.140> out<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.860> studs<00:02:16.730> and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
so I just built a box out of studs and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.680 
so I just built a box out of studs and
that's<00:02:18.440> what<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.769> tank<00:02:19.010> sits<00:02:19.370> on<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.360> studs

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
that's what the tank sits on the studs

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.040 
that's what the tank sits on the studs
inside<00:02:21.200> or<00:02:21.530> as<00:02:21.650> as<00:02:22.099> wide<00:02:22.519> as<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.970> tank<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
inside or as as wide as the tank the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.199 
inside or as as wide as the tank the
same<00:02:24.349> dimensions<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.519> thickness<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
same dimensions the thickness the

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.020 
same dimensions the thickness the
wideness<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.940> length<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:30.819> then<00:02:31.819> what<00:02:32.000> I

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
wideness and the length and then what I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.520 
wideness and the length and then what I
did<00:02:32.150> from<00:02:32.480> there<00:02:32.690> was<00:02:32.980> put<00:02:33.980> these<00:02:34.300> plywood

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
did from there was put these plywood
