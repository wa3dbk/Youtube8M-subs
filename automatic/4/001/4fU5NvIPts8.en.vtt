00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.049
 it was his first working day today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.370
 cleaning assistant under the interim 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.720
 coach phillip cocu 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.019
 kees van der weerden trainer of the b1 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.059
 but also old player of vitesse nec and 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.380
 of course psv 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.059
 last week just about that 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.410
 to actually do this role was 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.699
 surprised 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.980
 yes and no first yes yes because of course 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.650
 i also think yes baby have two 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 trainers who are very ambitious and who 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.949
 who have little experience and then 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.510
 they might go looking 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.890
 to someone who has more experience 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.250
 another side 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 no, because I think I am doing very well together 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 can work with those two and that i 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.500
 probably there is very good pass with 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120
 name file you can of course for a long time 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.129
 we played together at vitesse 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.410
 when you both broke through to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 well I think they are both whole 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 long because I think ernest is out 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 then rented one 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.440
 no nec nec and so I broke through and out 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.120
 just after that went to vitesse and got there 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 I encounter four 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.359
 well these three know each other so coki and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.090
 of the weather the games together at vitesse 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.299
 of the were and often together at nec and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.590
 the three of them played together at psv 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.510
 he is good so just a real one 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.000
 group of friends 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.189
 I think that it talked about 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 is that we have each other's qualities 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.299
 must recognize and recognize and and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 give an honest opinion about it 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.110
 about things you see 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.720
 we simply have to discuss that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.939
 and we just have to indicate that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.740
 or should filip indicate that he is just the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.000
 responsible for that and that 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.049
 So he still provides only 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.700
 We must always be able to have discussions 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.710
 can carry on very good friends 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720
 be very critical of each other 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.890
 I think that yes must yes yes you must 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.170
 dare to tell each other the truth 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.430
 otherwise it makes little sense and the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.049
 role of chris van der eerden within the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.000
 selection of psv becomes that of the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.399
 assistant trainer who as much as possible 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.020
 between the player is in the middle of the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.729
 player group as it were the role that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.820
 phillip cocu lately too 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.920
 fulfilled filip has that the past 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.320
 done at the Dutch national team 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.320
 and before the farmer left psv 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.509
 also done as a third man and he knows what 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.689
 asked and philips looks into it 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.179
 me as a person also between the 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.450
 group and I think I though 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.030
 reasonably possible 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.110
 such as between the players how 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.220
 respond this morning you do 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.069
 For example, knowledge entered your 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.510
 past as a player to psv you at nec 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.370
 vitesse 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.250
 all players I mean don't think so 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.810
 everyone knows how the past felt about it 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.239
 there is a world that looks like i think 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.880
 actually not that important because 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.069
 it is today determined of today 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 how do i stand in a group and a it 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.000
 history has it, I do not count 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.030
 It is now again how you stand for one 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.819
 group and how do you treat an approach you 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.630
 players what is your ambition 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.099
 well ambition is actually what i am now 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.680
 cooperate for two months 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.239
 with with filip and ernest and quality 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.040
 tendon again 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.630
 yes this is actually almost green come 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.670
 must say true but of course i am 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.019
 ambitious I want to be just like that 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.510
 other two 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.000
 so where the ceiling is in it works 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.569
 not but I think this is a very good one 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.569
 step yes
