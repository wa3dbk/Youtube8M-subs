00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
as it dies it actually pops out it's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.790 
as it dies it actually pops out it's
Betty<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> thing<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.530> catch<00:02:43.769> it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
you shoot it back all you want but it's

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.870 
you shoot it back all you want but it's
already<00:02:48.360> dead<00:02:48.660> now<00:02:49.170> what<00:02:50.100> actually<00:02:50.550> happened

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
already dead now what actually happened

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.580 
already dead now what actually happened
here<00:02:51.030> by<00:02:51.120> accident<00:02:51.330> was<00:02:51.989> there<00:02:52.200> was<00:02:52.560> a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
here by accident was there was a

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.199 
here by accident was there was a
canister<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:54.239> like<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.390> canister<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:56.209> stasis

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
canister it's like a canister of stasis

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.800 
canister it's like a canister of stasis
I<00:02:57.660> guess<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.040> sort<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.700> blue<00:03:00.239> white

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
I guess this is a sort of a blue white

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.819 
I guess this is a sort of a blue white
glow<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:02.310> thisis<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.120> other<00:03:03.420> cyst<00:03:03.900> so

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
glow and it's thisis this other cyst so

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.979 
glow and it's thisis this other cyst so
what<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.220> actually<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.760> do<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.870> know

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
what you actually have to do you know

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.280 
what you actually have to do you know
this<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.400> know<00:03:08.489> done<00:03:08.730> quite<00:03:09.030> by<00:03:09.180> accident

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
this was you know done quite by accident

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.310 
this was you know done quite by accident
and<00:03:10.290> you'll<00:03:10.530> see<00:03:10.739> as<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.070> get<00:03:11.220> close<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:12.320> it's

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
and you'll see as I get close to it it's

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.310 
and you'll see as I get close to it it's
not<00:03:13.590> quite<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.430> stasis<00:03:14.970> taz<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.360> would<00:03:15.570> be<00:03:15.780> you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
not quite as stasis taz it would be you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.289 
not quite as stasis taz it would be you
know<00:03:16.440> when<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.010> use<00:03:17.160> actually<00:03:17.579> using<00:03:17.910> your

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
know when you use actually using your

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.140 
know when you use actually using your
stasis<00:03:18.570> device<00:03:19.019> from<00:03:19.200> your<00:03:19.380> plasma<00:03:20.280> cutter<00:03:20.489> so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
stasis device from your plasma cutter so

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.750 
stasis device from your plasma cutter so
we<00:03:21.299> caught<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.780> we<00:03:21.959> shot<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.230> back<00:03:22.670> there's<00:03:23.670> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
we caught it we shot it back there's a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.400 
we caught it we shot it back there's a
bouncing<00:03:24.150> betty<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.989> look<00:03:25.200> for<00:03:25.380> those

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
bouncing betty so look for those

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.530 
bouncing betty so look for those
canisters<00:03:25.920> those<00:03:26.459> white<00:03:26.760> or<00:03:27.000> blue<00:03:27.239> glowing

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
canisters those white or blue glowing

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.699 
canisters those white or blue glowing
canisters<00:03:28.310> because<00:03:29.310> they<00:03:29.489> contain<00:03:30.140> stasis<00:03:31.140> in

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
canisters because they contain stasis in

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.009 
canisters because they contain stasis in
all<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.489> shoot<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.760> canister<00:03:33.420> you

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
all you do is shoot the canister you

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.229 
all you do is shoot the canister you
know<00:03:34.140> nearby<00:03:34.590> or<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:35.579> even<00:03:35.610> just<00:03:36.000> shoot

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
know nearby or you know even just shoot

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.479 
know nearby or you know even just shoot
it<00:03:36.299> with<00:03:36.390> your<00:03:36.540> plasma<00:03:36.989> cutter<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.500> it'll

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
it with your plasma cutter and it'll

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.300 
it with your plasma cutter and it'll
stasis<00:03:39.060> those<00:03:39.450> cysts<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.590> then<00:03:40.920> when<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.160> get

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
stasis those cysts and then when you get

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.800 
stasis those cysts and then when you get
close<00:03:41.549> it'll<00:03:41.910> shoot<00:03:42.090> up<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.329> bouncing<00:03:42.690> betty

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
close it'll shoot up a bouncing betty

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.870 
close it'll shoot up a bouncing betty
you<00:03:43.109> catch<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.739> with<00:03:43.829> Kinesis<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.640> throw

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
you catch it with Kinesis and you throw

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.640 
you catch it with Kinesis and you throw
it<00:03:44.970> back<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> little<00:03:46.470> more

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
it back so it is a little more

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.990 
it back so it is a little more
complicated<00:03:47.040> than<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.760> initially

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
complicated than that I initially

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.849 
complicated than that I initially
thought<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.720> thought<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.260> could<00:03:49.440> actually

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
thought I thought you could actually

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.220 
thought I thought you could actually
shoot<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:51.120> would<00:03:51.209> pop<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:52.019> betty

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
shoot it and it would pop the the betty

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.470 
shoot it and it would pop the the betty
out<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.220> could<00:03:53.430> shoot<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:53.970> back<00:03:54.090> at<00:03:54.359> it

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
out and you could shoot it back at it

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.880 
out and you could shoot it back at it
but<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.690> already<00:03:54.900> dead<00:03:55.170> at<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:55.470> point<00:03:55.530> so

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
but it's already dead at that point so

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.650 
but it's already dead at that point so
you<00:03:56.040> can't<00:03:56.250> do<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.519> way<00:03:56.790> anyways<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.630> hope

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
you can't do it that way anyways I hope

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.860 
you can't do it that way anyways I hope
that<00:03:58.049> helps<00:03:59.209> yeah<00:04:00.209> for<00:04:00.420> more<00:04:00.540> strategy

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
that helps yeah for more strategy

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.870 
that helps yeah for more strategy
