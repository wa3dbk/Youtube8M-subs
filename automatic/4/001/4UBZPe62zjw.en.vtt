00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
line and this came out it's pretty much

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.100 
line and this came out it's pretty much
the<00:02:34.720> same<00:02:35.079> thing<00:02:35.280> I've<00:02:36.280> enjoyed<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.420> get<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
the same thing I've enjoyed it I get the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.720 
the same thing I've enjoyed it I get the
same<00:02:38.290> amount<00:02:38.349> of<00:02:38.620> hold<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.099> got<00:02:39.310> from<00:02:39.489> the
