00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.960 
deeply into my fibers and I wasn't think
about<00:01:18.910> how<00:01:19.150> when<00:01:19.420> I<00:01:19.510> move<00:01:19.780> through<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.260> city

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
are certain places where I'll and more

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.560 
are certain places where I'll and more
than<00:01:26.170> others<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.680> in<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:27.670> body<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.119> work<00:01:28.360> I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
than others and in this body of work I

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.670 
than others and in this body of work I
was<00:01:28.660> really<00:01:28.900> kind<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.140> dealing<00:01:29.470> with<00:01:29.500> this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
was really kind of dealing with this

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.469 
was really kind of dealing with this
idea<00:01:29.890> let's<00:01:30.550> take<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.790> look<00:01:31.030> at<00:01:31.119> some<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.330> your

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
idea let's take a look at some of your

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.210 
idea let's take a look at some of your
large<00:01:31.750> pieces<00:01:32.080> out<00:01:32.350> here

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.460 

how<00:01:35.340> across<00:01:40.490> now<00:01:41.490> does<00:01:41.730> this<00:01:41.760> relate<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.470> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
how across now does this relate to the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.700 
how across now does this relate to the
neoplastic<00:01:43.890> Scism<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> somebody<00:01:44.730> like

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
neoplastic Scism of somebody like

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.680 
neoplastic Scism of somebody like
Mondrian<00:01:46.710> monsey<00:01:47.160> on<00:01:47.280> validly<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.420> those

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
Mondrian monsey on validly all those

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.120 
Mondrian monsey on validly all those
guys<00:01:49.190> yeah<00:01:50.190> I've<00:01:50.400> got<00:01:50.550> that<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:50.970> DNA<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
guys yeah I've got that in my DNA and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.950 
guys yeah I've got that in my DNA and
another<00:01:53.130> thing<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.610> noticing<00:01:53.940> is<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.300> my

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
another thing I was noticing is that my

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.740 
another thing I was noticing is that my
wall<00:01:55.460> did<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.640> did<00:01:56.910> you<00:01:57.060> change<00:01:57.330> over<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
wall did you did you change over to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.720 
wall did you did you change over to
painting<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.470> canvas<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.220> seem<00:01:59.580> to

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
painting on canvas because I seem to

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.970 
painting on canvas because I seem to
think<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.000> uh<00:02:00.120> a<00:02:00.690> lot<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.620> your<00:02:01.740> previous

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
think that uh a lot of your previous

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.460 
think that uh a lot of your previous
paintings<00:02:02.520> were<00:02:02.730> on<00:02:03.000> panels<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.840> wanted<00:02:04.260> some

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
paintings were on panels I wanted some

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.200 
paintings were on panels I wanted some
of<00:02:04.590> these<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.770> had<00:02:05.280> wanted<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.640> make<00:02:05.910> bigger

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
of these I had wanted to make bigger

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.449 
of these I had wanted to make bigger
work<00:02:06.480> and<00:02:06.870> panels<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.130> impractical

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
work and panels have just impractical

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.010 
work and panels have just impractical
for<00:02:08.910> large<00:02:09.240> work<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.940> feel<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
for large work and I feel like the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.640 
for large work and I feel like the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
own body as a dancer when I was young

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.860 
own body as a dancer when I was young
and<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:23.800> sort<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.459> upright<00:03:24.970> posture<00:03:25.330> that

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
and that sort of upright posture that

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.650 
and that sort of upright posture that
you<00:03:26.050> take<00:03:26.520> on<00:03:27.520> stage<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.480> project<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:31.120> idea

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
you take on stage and project the idea

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.030 
you take on stage and project the idea
of<00:03:31.690> being<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.930> vertical<00:03:32.380> being<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.980> a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
of being a vertical being on a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.559 
of being a vertical being on a
horizontal<00:03:33.519> plane<00:03:34.140> really<00:03:35.140> fascinates<00:03:35.860> me

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
horizontal plane really fascinates me

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.840 
horizontal plane really fascinates me
this<00:03:37.569> room<00:03:38.110> is<00:03:38.620> ruled<00:03:38.950> by<00:03:39.040> gravity<00:03:39.730> and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
this room is ruled by gravity and

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.830 
this room is ruled by gravity and
and<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.740> that<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.430> natural<00:03:45.270> grid<00:03:45.570> it

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
and so that that that natural grid it

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.770 
and so that that that natural grid it
just<00:03:46.020> as<00:03:46.200> its<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.280> did<00:03:47.460> I<00:03:47.610> feel<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.180> my<00:03:48.240> own

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
just as its I did I feel it in my own

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.350 
just as its I did I feel it in my own
body<00:03:49.020> very<00:03:49.800> deeply<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.820> that's<00:03:51.030> where<00:03:51.240> the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
body very deeply so that's where the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.390 
body very deeply so that's where the
crossing<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.980> vertical<00:03:52.980> versus<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
crossing the vertical versus the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.940 
crossing the vertical versus the
horizontal<00:03:53.910> when<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.840> say<00:03:55.140> when<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.440> say<00:03:55.500> lines

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
horizontal when I say when I say lines

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.430 
horizontal when I say when I say lines
that<00:03:56.280> are<00:03:56.400> slightly<00:03:56.700> askew<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.480> makes<00:03:57.720> me<00:03:57.870> it

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
that are slightly askew it makes me it

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.620 
that are slightly askew it makes me it
makes<00:03:58.500> me<00:03:58.680> uncomfortable<00:03:59.220> crazy<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.330> now

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
makes me uncomfortable crazy and now

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.410 
makes me uncomfortable crazy and now
that<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.110> artists<00:04:01.530> exploit<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.420> that

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
that that artists exploit that that

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.570 
that that artists exploit that that
sense<00:04:03.840> but<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.470> my<00:04:04.590> work<00:04:04.800> I'm<00:04:04.950> trying<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.370> I'm

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
sense but in my work I'm trying to I'm

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.240 
sense but in my work I'm trying to I'm
really<00:04:05.880> trying<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.710> deliver<00:04:07.710> a<00:04:07.830> sense<00:04:08.130> of

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
peace let's look at some of the stuff

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.890 
peace let's look at some of the stuff
that<00:04:10.020> are<00:04:10.170> bad<00:04:10.380> green<00:04:10.680> turtles<00:04:11.690> these<00:04:12.690> are<00:04:12.840> not

that are bad green turtles these are not
smaller<00:04:13.710> pieces<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.310> you've<00:04:14.610> got<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.850> suite<00:04:15.270> of

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
smaller pieces and you've got a suite of

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.330 
smaller pieces and you've got a suite of
works<00:04:15.720> on<00:04:15.960> panel<00:04:16.440> over<00:04:16.710> here<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:20.250> know

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
works on panel over here and you know

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.450 
works on panel over here and you know
you're<00:04:20.489> talking<00:04:20.670> about<00:04:20.940> mondrian<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.460> you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
you're talking about mondrian but you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.890 
you're talking about mondrian but you
don't<00:04:23.670> have<00:04:23.820> any<00:04:24.060> too<00:04:24.180> hard<00:04:24.390> edges<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.750> mean

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
don't have any too hard edges I mean

don't have any too hard edges I mean
you're<00:04:25.020> working<00:04:25.350> in<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.530> horizontal<00:04:25.860> and
