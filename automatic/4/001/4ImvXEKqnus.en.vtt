00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.990
 games gmbh a specialist with 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.599
 Welcome to the fight prices here 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.570
 a new episode of fifa 14 ultimate 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.430
 team pack opening and in the year if you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.130
 this consequence is the thumb learning 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.779
 up there and looks like even if the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.580
 video descriptions there is a link to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.529
 apple nokia there you can cheap 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 get coins or gravel or game cards 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.510
 and in the year like you might just 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.460
 I do not comment live because 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 Unfortunately my microphone was not 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 connected but my printer there 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.329
 I always have to share such a cable 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 are usb cables and that's why it has everything 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 not worked out and yes I did 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.200
 just shown that tony pulled 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.230
 I have and Sauvignon team of the season 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.699
 and that's certainly do not even 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.199
 I thought that was so bad 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.000
 very good toni the old nose will not 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.809
 at bayern munich luca toni it would have 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 be exactly 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.049
 luca toni is already pretty 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.810
 old by now and yes I have stop 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.840
 also pulled and we do now directly 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.310
 from here on 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.990
 right we see quite cool player of the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.229
 day you see how old this recording 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.750
 I could not upload because that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.850
 big problem was that i got married 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.080
 have on the weekend that is not a problem 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.720
 but I could not do that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.100
 upload and that comes to me 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.470
 no internet in the new apartment in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.930
 moment abel and that's all very much 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.369
 very well we are doing this 50th here 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.560
 kapek on the first there it is not yet 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.540
 noticed and we get a team there 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.079
 imprint or team on this player 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.659
 namely palette is an ev 84er strength 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.450
 has simon active and 87 heads is so 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.210
 not even that is unfortunately only 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.869
 That's why he does not hold you like that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.030
 very valuable 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.030
 the rest is not so great either 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.180
 not really cool not redeemed 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.350
 so nothing to me alexandre pato but otherwise 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.890
 rest is so keeps you in the limits 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.840
 and last episode has that with 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.030
 somehow did not work out the last 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.950
 both follow where else or with me 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.959
 the andré the vettel of the countries 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.840
 have taken up why that is so white 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.500
 I do not have no idea just not 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.400
 worked and therefore a böe cologne 5 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.110
 and in the year so here is hopefully 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.190
 all there so I now see straight 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.780
 when commenting 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.570
 the sound is not there because it is not 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.640
 worked but the face cam is there 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.000
 and yes, I'll just try it 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.489
 notepad because that's cool and yes 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.230
 So far, palette worked well 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.200
 pulled here and constantly stuck 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.030
 already five microphones and there we go 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.090
 I complain there too 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.110
 a little bit rv 85 tempo 80 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.019
 dribbling 90 the 586 heads 86 fitting 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.360
 83 just shoot a super beast as 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.720
 rv can almost make the storm 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.140
 is stronger than any other storms 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.209
 So ultra strong and now I show 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.680
 just that I usb cable not 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.660
 So I have to connect the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.700
 Recording is interrupting and the same 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.140
 it goes live then warmly 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.549
 finally i have welcome here too 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.829
 Sarah and I forgot I have before 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.930
 I had something over there and usb over there 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.630
 the other device and no matter 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.579
 yes we have now drawn maicon here 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.570
 he is not so bad maicon 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.390
 good is the author works for with 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.280
 ferdinand we still have it here 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.519
 that's not so good at packing everything 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.390
 what we can do in the club maicon 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.560
 be there 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.340
 rv as very good very good and we have 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.900
 yet 51 Kapek when the next 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.360
 lospech, of course, says the whole thing 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.730
 Rosberg but no one has heard that 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.320
 because it works here with announce 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.209
 and I also said things like yes 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.510
 I'm not so good at the principle 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.790
 do not know how expensive maicon is 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.530
 before was not that I know just 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.170
 everything is not so confused by 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.940
 this whole story here with the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:23.380
 the whole k 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:26.670
 well, no matter ok last bad luck and uli man 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.670
 the camera is missing so megawatt 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.690
 pico one again does not hurt too bad 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.490
 good pizarro bulk florentine or 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.620
 fiorentina very interesting two 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:47.190
 pizarros but not such a good player 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.990
 can become again with badstuber 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.690
 take nothing else 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.270
 pity with pizarro too bad too bad pity 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:01.290
 look right after what the good 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.290
 Maicon worth is not so much believe 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.690
 maicon is the question what is that 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:13.530
 dessert the resort maicon not 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.530
 to forget 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.960
 to hear as many think is there 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:28.360
 yes I think that's ok 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.000
 was 402,000 yes okay by fv 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.170
 Of course not bad at all 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.350
 that is not so wrong me 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:40.530

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.150

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.660

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.320
