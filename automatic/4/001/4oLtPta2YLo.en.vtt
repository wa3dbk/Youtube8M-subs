00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.080 
usually a source of negative feelings I
don't<00:01:45.770> think<00:01:45.950> I've<00:01:46.070> ever<00:01:46.100> run<00:01:46.520> into<00:01:46.700> anyone

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
don't think I've ever run into anyone

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.510 
don't think I've ever run into anyone
who<00:01:47.119> thought<00:01:47.360> 13<00:01:47.810> was<00:01:47.990> lucky<00:01:48.229> but<00:01:49.040> everyone

who thought 13 was lucky but everyone

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.920 
who thought 13 was lucky but everyone
here<00:01:49.700> thinks<00:01:50.030> 13<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.479> lucky
