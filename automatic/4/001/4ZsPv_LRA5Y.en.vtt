the<00:00:12.210> way<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.599> works<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.080> after<00:00:13.410> you

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
the way this works is that after you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.000 
the way this works is that after you
activate<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.580> countdown<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.139> nuke<00:00:16.379> all

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
activate the countdown for the nuke all

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.370 
activate the countdown for the nuke all
you<00:00:17.279> do<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.609> immediately<00:00:18.390> jump<00:00:18.869> off<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.260> edge

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
you do is immediately jump off the edge

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.620 
you do is immediately jump off the edge
right<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.770> like<00:00:20.100> i<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.609> you'll<00:00:21.300> spawn

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
right here like i do and you'll spawn

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.150 
right here like i do and you'll spawn
over<00:00:21.990> there<00:00:22.140> that's<00:00:22.350> how<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.619> know<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> works

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
over there that's how you know it works

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.980 
over there that's how you know it works
you're<00:00:23.760> gonna<00:00:23.850> get<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.090> teammate<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.630> revive

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
you're gonna get a teammate to revive

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.450 
you're gonna get a teammate to revive
you<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.240> then<00:00:27.380> this<00:00:28.380> weird<00:00:28.769> thing<00:00:29.010> happens
