three varieties here which is the fine

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.290 
three varieties here which is the fine
favored<00:00:57.649> variety<00:00:58.190> which<00:00:58.339> is<00:00:58.370> only<00:00:58.760> used<00:00:59.030> for

special high really lemony here it's

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.029 
special high really lemony here it's
really<00:01:56.630> really<00:01:56.810> nice<00:01:57.020> it's<00:01:57.320> burgundy<00:01:57.859> and

pinkish color when it's ripe when it's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.529 
pinkish color when it's ripe when it's
ready<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:01.070> be<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.490> be<00:02:01.579> harvested<00:02:01.999> and<00:02:02.270> what

ready to be to be harvested and what
kind<00:02:02.749> of<00:02:02.869> science<00:02:03.289> is<00:02:03.439> actually<00:02:03.679> grown<00:02:04.130> to

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
kind of science is actually grown to

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.010 
kind of science is actually grown to
well<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.030> wouldn't<00:02:05.299> it<00:02:05.479> wouldn't<00:02:05.659> get<00:02:05.810> that

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
well it wouldn't it wouldn't get that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.130 
well it wouldn't it wouldn't get that
much<00:02:06.229> louder<00:02:06.469> than<00:02:06.619> this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
much louder than this

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.779 
much louder than this
actually<00:02:07.409> slightly<00:02:07.740> fuller<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.670> fuller

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
actually slightly fuller and fuller

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.639 
actually slightly fuller and fuller
styrofoam<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.929> will<00:02:10.020> get<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.319> up<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
styrofoam and you will get about up to

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.040 
styrofoam and you will get about up to
sixty<00:02:11.039> cocoa<00:02:11.340> beans<00:02:11.520> from<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.390> 11<00:02:12.750> really

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
sixty cocoa beans from this 11 really

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.380 
sixty cocoa beans from this 11 really
you<00:02:13.560> know<00:02:13.680> that's<00:02:14.340> right<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:15.360> have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
you know that's right and then we have

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.180 
you know that's right and then we have
the<00:02:15.660> nine<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:16.050> nine<00:02:16.110> which<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.709> good<00:02:16.920> up<00:02:17.010> at

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the nine one nine which is good up at

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.830 
the nine one nine which is good up at
the<00:02:17.250> bottom<00:02:17.550> here<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.600> little

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the bottom here and this is a little

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.670 
the bottom here and this is a little
princess

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.010 

basically<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.220> pod<00:02:23.750> screen<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
basically this pod screen in the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.440 
basically this pod screen in the
beginning<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.440> then<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.680> sets<00:02:25.860> yellow<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.270> how

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
beginning and then it sets yellow so how

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.000 
beginning and then it sets yellow so how
long<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.959> actually<00:02:28.290> change<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.709> get<00:02:28.800> into

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
long this is actually change to get into

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.280 
long this is actually change to get into
this<00:02:29.100> change<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.580> takes<00:02:29.700> about<00:02:29.880> well<00:02:30.810> from<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
this change it takes about well from the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.680 
this change it takes about well from the
flower<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> pod<00:02:32.550> finished<00:02:33.360> part

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
flower to the to the pod finished part

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.150 
flower to the to the pod finished part
it<00:02:33.810> takes<00:02:34.020> about<00:02:34.110> six<00:02:34.380> months<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.950> will<00:02:35.070> be

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
it takes about six months this will be

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.229 
it takes about six months this will be
probably<00:02:35.340> ready<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.700> about<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.910> week's<00:02:36.120> time

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
that protect the pods and we do that by

that protect the pods and we do that by
covering<00:02:50.370> them<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.730> netting<00:02:51.150> all<00:02:51.930> right<00:02:52.140> we

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
covering them with netting all right we

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.610 
covering them with netting all right we
also<00:02:52.470> use<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.160> Hawks<00:02:53.480> as<00:02:54.480> predators<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.380> scare

and basically the Amerindians they use
these<00:03:41.040> dirt<00:03:41.400> ovens<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.300> next<00:03:42.600> stage<00:03:42.750> is

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
these dirt ovens and the next stage is

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.070 
these dirt ovens and the next stage is
in<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:44.580> then<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:46.040> important<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.840> heat

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
in the and then it's important the heat

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.230 
in the and then it's important the heat
that<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.470> held<00:03:49.740> it<00:03:49.950> was<00:03:50.100> even<00:03:50.520> more<00:03:50.550> intense

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
that that held it was even more intense

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.660 
that that held it was even more intense
than<00:03:51.330> your<00:03:52.110> normal<00:03:52.290> cooking<00:03:52.830> oven<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.370> from

future<00:04:11.070> generations<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.880> see<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.730> the

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
future generations I see so this is the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.030 
future generations I see so this is the
first<00:04:18.269> time<00:04:18.660> sign<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.200> fermentation<00:04:19.890> is

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
first time sign of the fermentation is

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.199 
first time sign of the fermentation is
that<00:04:20.160> right<00:04:20.340> that's<00:04:20.519> right<00:04:20.669> this<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> very

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
that right that's right this is a very

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.020 
that right that's right this is a very
first<00:04:21.930> 600<00:04:22.440> pods<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.550> we're<00:04:23.669> harvesting

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
first 600 pods that we're harvesting

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.000 
first 600 pods that we're harvesting
that's<00:04:24.630> right<00:04:24.810> from<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.260> estate<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:25.860> a

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
that's right from the estate this is a

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.270 
that's right from the estate this is a
very<00:04:26.460> very<00:04:26.729> first<00:04:27.120> column<00:04:27.500> initial<00:04:28.500> that's<00:04:29.070> my

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
very very first column initial that's my

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.570 
very very first column initial that's my
office<00:04:29.610> that's<00:04:29.970> right<00:04:30.210> first<00:04:30.750> 600<00:04:31.350> pods

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
office that's right first 600 pods

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.010 
office that's right first 600 pods
fantastic<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.210> we<00:04:33.450> had<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.630> fermentation

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
fantastic so and we had a fermentation

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.200 
fantastic so and we had a fermentation
going<00:04:34.410> for<00:04:34.590> couple<00:04:34.890> days<00:04:34.919> now<00:04:35.220> 40<00:04:35.700> now<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:36.060> it's

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
going for couple days now 40 now so it's

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.709 
going for couple days now 40 now so it's
time<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.750> tell<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.020> beans<00:04:37.290> show<00:04:37.740> me

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
time to tell the beans show me

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.699 
time to tell the beans show me
look<00:04:40.719> at<00:04:40.899> that<00:04:41.080> that's<00:04:41.589> right<00:04:41.909> this<00:04:42.909> is<00:04:42.969> a<00:04:43.209> very

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:43.709 
look at that that's right this is a very

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:46.979 
look at that that's right this is a very
efficient<00:04:44.709> first<00:04:45.069> 48<00:04:45.520> hours<00:04:45.729> of<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.719> first

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:46.989 
efficient first 48 hours of the first

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:48.899 
efficient first 48 hours of the first
cocoa<00:04:47.379> planted<00:04:47.830> at<00:04:47.919> Tobago<00:04:48.219> coke<00:04:48.459> with<00:04:48.639> sticks

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
cocoa planted at Tobago coke with sticks

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.699 
cocoa planted at Tobago coke with sticks
so<00:04:49.360> basically<00:04:49.689> we're<00:04:49.899> gonna<00:04:50.019> be<00:04:50.110> turning<00:04:50.589> the

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:50.709 
so basically we're gonna be turning the

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:52.199 
so basically we're gonna be turning the
beans<00:04:50.889> sort<00:04:51.459> of<00:04:51.580> what's<00:04:51.759> down<00:04:51.909> at<00:04:51.999> the<00:04:52.089> bottom

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:52.209 
beans sort of what's down at the bottom

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.659 
beans sort of what's down at the bottom
is<00:04:52.569> what<00:04:52.749> we<00:04:52.899> need<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.139> get<00:04:53.259> at<00:04:53.379> the<00:04:53.439> top<00:04:53.669> and

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
is what we need to get at the top and

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.699 
is what we need to get at the top and
it's<00:04:54.849> turning<00:04:55.179> people<00:04:55.269> how<00:04:55.779> turning<00:04:56.559> so

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:56.709 
it's turning people how turning so

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:58.350 
it's turning people how turning so
you're<00:04:56.889> getting<00:04:57.279> each<00:04:57.669> is<00:04:57.999> gonna<00:04:58.179> ferment

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
you're getting each is gonna ferment

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.989 
you're getting each is gonna ferment
exactly<00:04:59.199> the<00:04:59.319> same<00:04:59.649> and<00:05:00.249> that<00:05:00.550> is<00:05:00.729> going<00:05:00.909> to

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:00.999 
exactly the same and that is going to

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.790 
exactly the same and that is going to
result<00:05:01.149> in<00:05:01.509> good<00:05:01.659> quality<00:05:01.839> that's<00:05:02.439> right<00:05:02.649> you

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
result in good quality that's right you

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.290 
result in good quality that's right you
want<00:05:02.979> an<00:05:03.039> even<00:05:03.339> fermentation<00:05:04.059> and<00:05:04.149> that's

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
want an even fermentation and that's

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.139 
want an even fermentation and that's
only<00:05:04.449> achieving<00:05:04.989> small<00:05:05.379> boxes<00:05:06.099> small<00:05:06.489> sweat

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:07.149 
only achieving small boxes small sweat

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:08.999 
only achieving small boxes small sweat
boxes<00:05:07.599> and<00:05:07.989> this<00:05:08.319> is<00:05:08.469> a<00:05:08.499> very<00:05:08.739> full

boxes and this is a very full
traditional<00:05:09.819> way<00:05:09.969> of<00:05:10.269> of<00:05:10.689> drying<00:05:11.050> because

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:11.589 
traditional way of of drying because

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:13.320 
traditional way of of drying because
this<00:05:11.769> is<00:05:11.919> what<00:05:12.069> gives<00:05:12.189> us<00:05:12.369> a<00:05:12.519> finest<00:05:12.969> quality

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
this is what gives us a finest quality

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.480 
this is what gives us a finest quality
cocoa<00:05:13.509> this<00:05:14.199> is<00:05:14.289> more<00:05:14.499> time<00:05:14.709> consuming<00:05:14.740> more

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
cocoa this is more time consuming more

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.119 
cocoa this is more time consuming more
laborious<00:05:16.059> but<00:05:16.809> vinegar<00:05:17.169> mix<00:05:17.379> would<00:05:17.589> do<00:05:17.709> it<00:05:17.889> I

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
laborious but vinegar mix would do it I

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.919 
laborious but vinegar mix would do it I
almost<00:05:18.550> feel<00:05:18.909> nervous<00:05:19.179> about<00:05:19.419> putting<00:05:19.809> my

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:19.929 
almost feel nervous about putting my

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:21.089 
almost feel nervous about putting my
hands<00:05:20.169> in<00:05:20.319> there<00:05:20.469> in<00:05:20.559> case<00:05:20.589> I'm<00:05:20.889> going<00:05:21.009> to
