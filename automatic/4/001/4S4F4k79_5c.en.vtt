00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi all guys i'm rain e 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.520
 welcome to this new recession on 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.520
 dead and kraft 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.010
 this is a server actions divided into 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.509
 world where they will find themselves mainly 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.270
 the modality is just three ways 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.270
 sections doing workstations 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.950
 where in practice it will be possible to reign 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.180
 territories I think anyone 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 I think you know how to plug in 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 infections however for those who do not 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.900
 know how to create species 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.910
 of clans we say where the players can 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.510
 enter and have common bases 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.000
 protected the second edward mode 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.790
 blocks here it happens just doing ward 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.220
 lots where there are in practice 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.809
 kind of protected areas where you can 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.220
 build what you want 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.290
 to take possession of one of these 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.710
 buildable areas will have to be slashed 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.440
 spin out sider others transported to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.520
 just the eight here we will be free to 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.490
 build and have a protected area where 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.470
 to be able to express our creativity 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.740
 the last mode to the world group ii 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.600
 and it is precisely by doing the clever where in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.299
 practice you get free pegs 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.970
 regardless of which faction you are 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.220
 that is normally belongs if you are in 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.590
 one the same faction two players not not 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.840
 they can be hit instead in this work 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.859
 apparently the buyers can strike between 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.899
 them independently of the faction 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.759
 let's get straight to the point then from the point 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.409
 view of the presentation the server 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.929
 takes 7 points out of 10 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.179
 because despite the spawn is well 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.950
 nice and well done the world are not 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.479
 very accessible and in general the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.520
 game modes are not explained 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.189
 through for example books or 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.189
 signs from the point of view of 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.189
 playability the server 28 points out of 10 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.140
 because in any case there is balance between the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.880
 various players both between the lives and the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.680
 users normal users 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.320
 the gameplay seems to me anyway 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.820
 quite quiet and still player 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.320
 they seem quite cordial and 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.460
 respectful 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.620
 from the point of view of moderation 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.660
 server takes 9 points out of 10 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.020
 because I could see that there is a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.030
 good anti cheat and despite not there 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.310
 are online moderators at the time 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.200
 chat is however quite quiet e 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.000
 there are not too many spam messages 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.490
 from the point of view of creativity in 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.190
 server takes 6 points out of 10 because of the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.960
 end there are no innovative things 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.520
 compared to other servers if not maybe 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.340
 the scoreboard to the side 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.310
 so I deliberately 6 points 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.620
 total in server take 30 points out of 40 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.300
 because mainly for the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.090
 diversification that I could not 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.160
 note how I explained earlier though 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.590
 moderation and gameplay have 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.060
 got very high scores for today 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.910
 da rain is everything 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.030
 I greet you and the next review 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.030
 Hello
