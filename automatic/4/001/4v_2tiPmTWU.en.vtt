00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.069
 it's in the root 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.810

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.959
 spaces have 32 c and entered another folder 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.780
 of them will be named - with the 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:04.310
 command on a website 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:06.870
 hc point x 0 space 7h c or d point x 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.519
 ready the message does not appear 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.620
 as done with sex 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.060

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.099
 let's rename another bad without fear of it 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:22.919
 xv space against gas and diesel 7 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.230
 We're entering again without a message. 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.910
 command in space 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.890
 system 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.709
 32 let's copy another cop file 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.450
 very important space exactly hit 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.730
 point point bar 7 hc where xz is still 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.860
 a file copied as 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.320
 executed because now you can 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.220
 give as an example you will leave the screen and 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.220
 ask to restart your computer 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.489
 soon confirming 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.349
 we do not go in if we do not 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.379
 so so and therefore no password 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.709
 We also did not enter booting service 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.870
 - we verify that without entering password 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.410
 We not enter a'll have to put 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.250
 so this good in that part is easy you 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.600
 have 5 2 or more shift fast 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.130
 the command itself will appear for this 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.270
 we did the command here on this screen 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:36.930
 we put the z space control command 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:40.080
 is short to support to and has as an example 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.699
 will open the windows user account 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.199
 What is it, you can do it all? 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.620
 this can create add / remove 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.330
 Bonus users simply remove so 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.789
 new password and put blank gives 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.509
 only ok it will clear the password of the 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.620
 user 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.150
 if I wanted to enter a password and 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.229
 I would leave it blank to be 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.419
 simpler 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.680
 we here put us out 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.699
 from this screen 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.400
 now just go back to be entered 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:08.310
 goal is always very simple 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.710
 good now you have two options you can think 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.130
 thus enabling command to be 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.570
 remove the password or revert if you 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.639
 do you want to leave it 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.710
 just do not do anything so I 'll show you 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.930
 now how to revert to the floor system 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.699
 no error since we play a function of the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.770
 windows on the other they can interfere 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.930
 in the application use good now let's 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.449
 start the computer but this time without 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.800
 windows cd and what when f8 for what 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.800
 it gives you the option to boot 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.300
 good on that boot screen you go 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:46.199
 choose the mode of security against the 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.199
 bridge of command 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.949
 yesterday it will install and use windows 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.080
 will open the same control screen and 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.000
 command we caused previously 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.710
 remembering that the process of reverting is 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.150
 different from the process that we made the 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.900
 commands then this screen that goes 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.449
 to function 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.100
 good it will show up here with ready already 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:14.590
 carried out the commands of a command 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:16.660
 easy cup space 7h c-130 space 70 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.310
 wake up in the windows file it goes 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.350
 ask if you want to replace me 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.440
 I did not choose 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.570
 You press yes yes and inter time. 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.910
 it looks like a file to copy only this 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.280
 now you may have to hold onto the 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.720
 audio dell will appear on the screen 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.910
 mine installation will only select 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.590
 here in this site and will ask 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.750
 reboot ready by doing so 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.060
 system is as original I hope to have 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.510
