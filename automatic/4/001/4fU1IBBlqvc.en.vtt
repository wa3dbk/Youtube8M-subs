there's some map templates out there we

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.110 
there's some map templates out there we
can<00:03:53.959> download<00:03:54.310> if<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.459> found<00:03:55.610> one<00:03:55.730> we'll<00:03:55.910> put<00:03:55.940> in

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
a idea of where the boundaries are for

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.280 
a idea of where the boundaries are for
underwater<00:04:04.280> I'm<00:04:05.180> gonna<00:04:05.360> go<00:04:05.540> ahead<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:05.870> try

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
underwater I'm gonna go ahead and try

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.820 
underwater I'm gonna go ahead and try
this<00:04:07.420> another<00:04:08.420> time<00:04:08.870> let's<00:04:09.200> see<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.530> delete

find one of those Maps yeah I'll get you
guys<00:04:43.419> one<00:04:43.599> of<00:04:43.629> the<00:04:43.780> link<00:04:44.259> in<00:04:44.469> the<00:04:44.919> description

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
guys one of the link in the description

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.700 
guys one of the link in the description
of<00:04:45.699> like<00:04:46.389> a<00:04:46.479> template<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.080> boundaries<00:04:47.439> and

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
of like a template of the boundaries and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.779 
of like a template of the boundaries and
stuff<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.129> where<00:04:48.219> you<00:04:48.280> can<00:04:48.400> put<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.639> in<00:04:48.759> that

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
stuff and where you can put it in that

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.679 
stuff and where you can put it in that
but<00:04:49.659> let's<00:04:50.050> hopefully<00:04:50.379> it<00:04:50.770> goes<00:04:50.949> right<00:04:51.189> here

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
but let's hopefully it goes right here

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.129 
but let's hopefully it goes right here
and<00:04:52.689> just<00:04:53.289> kind<00:04:53.979> of<00:04:54.009> risk<00:04:54.219> in<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:55.020> but<00:04:56.020> yeah

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
and just kind of risk in that but yeah

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.990 
and just kind of risk in that but yeah
this<00:04:56.379> is<00:04:56.439> really<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.889> awesome<00:04:57.340> effect<00:04:57.669> that<00:04:57.909> you

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
this is really a awesome effect that you

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.379 
this is really a awesome effect that you
can<00:04:58.029> do<00:04:58.240> this<00:04:59.110> underwater<00:04:59.529> glitch<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.389> yeah

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
can do this underwater glitch and yeah

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.850 
can do this underwater glitch and yeah
right<00:05:01.539> here<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.810> says<00:05:01.930> return<00:05:02.229> to<00:05:02.349> battlefield

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
right here it says return to battlefield

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.459 
right here it says return to battlefield
but<00:05:03.180> maybe<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.539> have<00:05:04.719> to<00:05:04.750> spawn<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.199> little

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
but maybe you have to spawn a little

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.200 
but maybe you have to spawn a little
close<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.860> surface<00:05:06.069> from<00:05:06.430> that<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.849> don't

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
close to the surface from that I don't

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.320 
close to the surface from that I don't
really<00:05:07.389> know<00:05:07.539> for<00:05:07.569> sure<00:05:07.889> but<00:05:08.889> yeah<00:05:09.849> I'll<00:05:10.090> leave

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
really know for sure but yeah I'll leave

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.110 
really know for sure but yeah I'll leave
a<00:05:10.360> little<00:05:10.800> boundary<00:05:11.800> template<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.669> you<00:05:13.090> can

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
and give that a shot it's probably one

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.360 
and give that a shot it's probably one
of<00:05:40.419> the<00:05:40.539> best<00:05:40.659> slender<00:05:41.020> bands<00:05:41.259> around<00:05:41.740> I<00:05:42.219> would

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
of the best slender bands around I would

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.249 
of the best slender bands around I would
say<00:05:42.550> just<00:05:43.180> because<00:05:43.360> I'm<00:05:43.659> not<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:43.839> big<00:05:44.050> fan<00:05:44.229> of

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
say just because I'm not a big fan of

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.559 
say just because I'm not a big fan of
Slenderman<00:05:44.879> just<00:05:45.879> because<00:05:46.060> I<00:05:46.089> don't<00:05:46.479> think

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:46.569 
Slenderman just because I don't think

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.679 
Slenderman just because I don't think
the<00:05:46.810> game<00:05:46.960> is<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.379> fun<00:05:47.740> on<00:05:48.089> Halo<00:05:49.089> Kustoms

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:49.689 
the game is that fun on Halo Kustoms

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.679 
the game is that fun on Halo Kustoms
but<00:05:50.349> this<00:05:51.310> is<00:05:51.490> probably<00:05:51.789> the<00:05:51.909> most<00:05:52.270> exciting

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:52.689 
but this is probably the most exciting

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.170 
but this is probably the most exciting
ones<00:05:53.080> that<00:05:53.439> I<00:05:53.469> played<00:05:53.800> so<00:05:54.039> far<00:05:54.069> and<00:05:54.699> it<00:05:55.000> really

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
ones that I played so far and it really

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.059 
ones that I played so far and it really
sets<00:05:55.539> like<00:05:55.779> a<00:05:55.839> eerie<00:05:56.199> tone<00:05:56.529> and<00:05:56.860> everything

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
sets like a eerie tone and everything

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.950 
sets like a eerie tone and everything
