we did have the loot system change it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.819 
we did have the loot system change it
didn't<00:03:02.280> add<00:03:02.519> or<00:03:02.910> subtract<00:03:03.420> any<00:03:03.629> resources<00:03:04.170> but

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
didn't add or subtract any resources but

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.170 
didn't add or subtract any resources but
with<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> new<00:03:05.069> mines<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.579> pumps<00:03:05.879> it<00:03:05.910> would

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
with the new mines and pumps it would

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.280 
with the new mines and pumps it would
increase<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> amount<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.930> resources

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
increase the amount of resources

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.720 
increase the amount of resources
available<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.250> think<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.519> would<00:03:08.609> make

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
available and I think it would make

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.819 
available and I think it would make
people<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.060> lot<00:03:09.209> happier<00:03:09.569> even<00:03:10.440> though<00:03:10.709> they

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
people a lot happier even though they

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.979 
people a lot happier even though they
did<00:03:10.980> like<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> new<00:03:11.459> one<00:03:11.760> gem<00:03:12.000> boost<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.569> feel

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
did like the new one gem boost I feel

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.330 
did like the new one gem boost I feel
like<00:03:13.079> if<00:03:13.230> they<00:03:13.349> added<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.680> level<00:03:13.920> 12<00:03:14.129> mines

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
like if they added the level 12 mines

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220 
like if they added the level 12 mines
level<00:03:14.760> 12<00:03:15.030> pumps<00:03:15.209> people<00:03:15.810> would<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.049> really

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
level 12 pumps people would be really

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.990 
level 12 pumps people would be really
receptive<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.819> know<00:03:17.970> that

we'll see that sometime soon as well and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.159 
we'll see that sometime soon as well and
then<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.880> course<00:03:23.910> number<00:03:24.329> 5<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.810> definitely

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
then of course number 5 I definitely

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.599 
then of course number 5 I definitely
want<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.410> see<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> new<00:03:25.739> troop<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.190> game<00:03:26.370> I

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
want to see a new troop in the game I

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.030 
want to see a new troop in the game I
think<00:03:27.480> correct<00:03:28.230> me<00:03:28.349> if<00:03:28.470> I'm<00:03:28.620> wrong<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
think correct me if I'm wrong the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.440 
think correct me if I'm wrong the
witches<00:03:29.430> were<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.760> last<00:03:29.940> thing<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.239> come<00:03:30.269> out

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
witches were the last thing to come out

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.569 
witches were the last thing to come out
and<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.870> was<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.989> couple<00:03:31.319> months<00:03:31.440> ago<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.430> I'm

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
and that was a couple months ago so I'm

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.120 
and that was a couple months ago so I'm
hoping<00:03:32.910> we<00:03:33.030> see<00:03:33.209> something<00:03:33.450> soon<00:03:33.900> um<00:03:34.200> it

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
hoping we see something soon um it

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.620 
hoping we see something soon um it
doesn't<00:03:35.370> necessarily<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.239> be<00:03:36.329> something

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
doesn't necessarily have to be something

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.150 
doesn't necessarily have to be something
that<00:03:36.750> blows<00:03:36.989> us<00:03:37.200> away<00:03:37.319> it<00:03:37.680> could<00:03:37.769> be<00:03:37.919> something

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
that blows us away it could be something

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.670 
that blows us away it could be something
equivalent<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.329> giant<00:03:39.840> just<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.440> dark

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680

elixir for my guess there's a Valkyrie

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.180 
elixir for my guess there's a Valkyrie
for<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.500> I'd<00:03:43.590> really<00:03:43.829> like<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.010> see

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
for that but I'd really like to see

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.319 
for that but I'd really like to see
another<00:03:44.400> troop<00:03:44.639> in<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.819> game<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.150> always

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329
