00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:10.670
 hello together here under a heap 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.679
 the smc 720 hides the ssc 720 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.589
 is a chromebook with the google 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.109
 operating system chrome os and as always 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.390
 before I get there for a doctorate is Zellmer 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.369
 it once very briefly the scope of delivery 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.490
 in the scope of supply contain it once 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.980
 international documentation about 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.039
 safety regulations and the guarantee 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.350
 addresses then we have here once 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.540
 buy a quickstart guide that 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.550
 means here you will be in a few 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.200
 steps explained like a chromebook 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.329
 works because it is something 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.730
 other than a windows 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.500
 operating system 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.550
 then we have here quite normal in the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.609
 move the power adapter with charger and 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.649
 the chromebook to ourselves 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.750
 comeback here has a sd 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.570
 memory card slot, we've got one here 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.859
 USB connection 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.590
 then we have the possibility one 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.300
 kensington lock to connect 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.950
 on the other side is then 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.670
 again the connection for the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.190
 Charging socket of the HDMI output as well 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.160
 another usb port and the connection for 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:23.750
 a headset with headphones and microphone 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:27.620
 then we basically have no more here 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.450
 many more garbage connections needs 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:36.970
 but not because the most important 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:42.440
 has the combo with buy the c7 120 has one 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.660
 11.6 inches large tft display the whole 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.340
 is dull that's nice that is 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.170
 Does not reflect that and you can do it too 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.720
 just use it outside now 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.700
 Especially in summer we are important 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.200
 have an intel celeron processor with 2 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.120
 x 1 4 gigahertz 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.560
 we have two gigabytes of RAM 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.840
 inside is a 16 gigabyte ssd 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.880
 installed 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.479
 In addition, there is the Chromebook 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:12.790
 Googled Waidspeicher des 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.430
 400 gb extra into your own google yes 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.830
 a hd webcam is with wlan with the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.200
 at bluetooth with the battery life 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.450
 is always about six 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.739
 hours 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.209
 something is now on a chromebook 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.870
 especially resp 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.350
 What is different in the reason is that 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.720
 at the chromebook, all the apps about that 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.410
 Internet run or the internet related 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.569
 become 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.910
 there is no so no need now 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.260
 extra programs install but one 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.290
 then just go into the apps 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.610
 then write programs with triangle 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:57.400
 spreadsheet google player 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.170
 hangouts possibilities google maps also 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.569
 all google applications are the same 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.360
 and you have the possibility over 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.580
 the chrome store other programs 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.459
 so to speak for a chromebook 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.790
 have been developed to retrieve and to 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.790
 to install 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.450
 that means he can be short once 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.709
 leaf through what then everything gives here 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.480
 you look for the right one 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.060
 programs that you have right now 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.130
 you want to use then there's 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.420
 then offline apps too 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.810
 working completely without 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.030
 Internet connection online apps and such 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.890
 continue with the book itself is natural 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.400
 Also to say everything here 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.859
 is installed so write programs 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.810
 For example, you can also offline 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.180
 that means you are not on here 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.530
 an internet connection instructed 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.750
 but you can easily on the go 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.700
 edit and write documents 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.049
 even when you 're at home is quite comfortable 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.870
 Just then again via the internet 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.200
 ship or then in 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.519
 save his google drive 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.640
 so much of the sc 720 chromebook me 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.780
 Hope you liked it and see you
