00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
that's one that's quite difficult to get

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.070 
that's one that's quite difficult to get
your<00:02:11.349> head<00:02:11.470> around<00:02:11.620> but<00:02:12.099> as<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.400> online

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
your head around but as the online

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
into keyboard presses so you look up to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.210 
into keyboard presses so you look up to
go<00:02:27.120> up<00:02:27.270> back<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.960> go<00:02:28.050> back<00:02:28.080> lift<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.040> then

go up back to go back lift and then
right<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.640> that's<00:02:30.270> that's<00:02:30.870> how<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.110> control

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
right and that's that's how you control

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.930 
right and that's that's how you control
that<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:31.920> that's<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.610> one<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.790> everybody

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
