00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.750
 hello today I bring you an idea for 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.400
 reuse medium fabric scraps I'll 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.710
 to use a pair of metals to make 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.840
 some decoration figures in this case 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.730
 I'm using a stamped scrap and 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.650
 another one of a raw fabric that is going to be for 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.930
 the back and how are you going to see 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.610
 the truth is that I feel a bit like if 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.619
 It's prettier or uglier 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.440
 in any case I will put right 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.650
 with right and improve right with 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.450
 right these two fabrics and then 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.970
 using a bit of wadding that in my 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.370
 case is a water upholstery the wadding 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.079
 more bad that there is so the floor 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.730
 use for this type of decorations 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.149
 the patterned fabric will touch the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.100
 wadding and we will have just above the fabric 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.079
 that will go in the back in this case 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.240
 I'm going to make a heart I'm going to paint it 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.650
 raised hand 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.650
 if my pen works 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.960
 I seem to know 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.370
 the importance of hearts for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.470
 course you can do the figure type 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.050
 what you want but if you are going to do 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.409
 very important heart that in this peak 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.810
 from here 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.630
 in this peak from the top of the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.329
 heart instead of finishing sewing in 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.829
 the tip and continue here what 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.229
 we're going to do is blame that 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.869
 tip and when we get to this point 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.569
 give about two or three stitches in straight 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:32.409
 to then be able to turn it around well 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:34.149
 heart I already have one finished I do not know 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.640
 yes the truth that I think it does not look very 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.310
 well because because the thread is also 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.899
 white but I've made two stitches in 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.609
 this sense instead of ending like this in 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.200
 peak I made two stitches in this 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.299
 sense to be able to enter well with the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.740
 scissors up here as per the part of 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:53.070
 back we put the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.520
 the fabric that we stamped 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.630
 I'm going to give you a cut here 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.630
 in cross shape 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.380
 that's where I'm going to turn it around 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.840
 in this way we also save ourselves 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.530
 have to leave a hole in a side 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.530
 from the heart 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.360
 and we give it back here because 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.140
 then you will see that it is not going to 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.350
 watch 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.130
 it seems to me that they only catch a little small 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.690
 but hey, it seems that he turns around well 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.550
 we put the finger well for what 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.670
 to turn it around correctly 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.910
 all the fabrics then we can iron 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.160
 a little so that we do not stay 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.490
 so wrinkled because of course giving him the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.490
 return 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.660
 and at this point what I'm going to do is 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.720
 use a little bit of felt and 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.050
 glue glue thermos possible for 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.220
 cover this hole here 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.460
 and at the same time 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.240
 the skewer stick in the part where 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.170
 we have made the opening I am going to place a 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.170
 some glue 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.300
 I'll put the skewer on it 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.920
 usually making it match with 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.710
 the bottom peak for a bit 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.710
 better then when we turn around 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.310
 and we already have a heart that we can 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.920
 click with the stick on top of a 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.720
 cake or any table decoration 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.790
 of sweet birthdays and so on and 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.100
 course and 8 a heart but you can 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.120
 use the way you want 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.500
 I hope that everything that 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.300
 I explained if you found it useful 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.739
 I like it and subscribe to my 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.190
