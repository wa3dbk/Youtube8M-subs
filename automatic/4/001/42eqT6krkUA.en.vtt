00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
what sucks is that this really could

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.930 
what sucks is that this really could
have<00:01:48.140> been<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.260> good<00:01:48.470> game<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:49.340> controls<00:01:49.729> feel

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.910 
have been a good game the controls feel
really<00:01:50.270> good<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.170> can<00:01:51.290> fly<00:01:51.470> around<00:01:51.619> and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
really good so you can fly around and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.500 
really good so you can fly around and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
problem is though you're flying all

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.999 
problem is though you're flying all
around<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.869> you<00:01:59.930> have<00:02:00.050> 18<00:02:00.470> missiles<00:02:00.800> trying

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
to hit you in the ass so you have to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.999 
to hit you in the ass so you have to
constantly<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.170> barrel<00:02:03.560> roll<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.920> you're

constantly be a barrel roll and you're
doing<00:02:04.280> loops<00:02:04.490> or<00:02:04.729> doing<00:02:04.970> something<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.810> lose

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
doing loops or doing something to lose

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.420 
doing loops or doing something to lose
them<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.500> all<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.740> want<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.950> do<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.159> get<00:02:07.340> to

them and all you want to do is get to

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.370 
them and all you want to do is get to
the<00:02:07.490> next<00:02:07.759> little<00:02:08.060> orange<00:02:08.450> objective<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.259> it

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
the next little orange objective and it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.800 
the next little orange objective and it
really<00:02:10.280> kills<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.610> fun<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.510> makes<00:02:11.540> you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
to say that I'm happy to be done with it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.920 
to say that I'm happy to be done with it
because<00:02:16.760> there<00:02:16.910> was<00:02:17.090> really<00:02:17.360> glimmers<00:02:17.900> of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
because there was really glimmers of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.120 
because there was really glimmers of
hope<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.350> here<00:02:18.470> there's<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.709> whole<00:02:18.860> bunch<00:02:19.070> of

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
hope in here there's a whole bunch of

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.949 
hope in here there's a whole bunch of
different<00:02:19.220> armors<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.820> can<00:02:19.940> unlock<00:02:20.209> but<00:02:20.840> the

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
different armors you can unlock but the

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.330 
different armors you can unlock but the
problem<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.440> get<00:02:21.620> those<00:02:21.769> Armour<00:02:22.070> unlocked

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
problem is to get those Armour unlocked

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.440 
problem is to get those Armour unlocked
you<00:02:22.489> have<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.670> go<00:02:22.790> play<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.030> thing<00:02:23.269> called

the it could be good it could be bad

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.140 
the it could be good it could be bad
side<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.739> does<00:02:52.010> not<00:02:52.190> suffer<00:02:52.670> from<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.970> same

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.340 
Wii ps2 PSP side the gameplay is
completely<00:03:14.329> different<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:15.110> your

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
completely different you have your

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.140 
completely different you have your
different<00:03:15.709> levels<00:03:16.160> although<00:03:16.400> they<00:03:16.579> are<00:03:16.730> since

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
different levels although they are since

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.280 
different levels although they are since
they're<00:03:17.269> using<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.570> same<00:03:17.720> cutscenes<00:03:17.989> they

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
they're using the same cutscenes they

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.750 
they're using the same cutscenes they
are<00:03:18.380> somewhat<00:03:18.739> different<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:19.130> terms<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.519> what

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
are somewhat different in terms of what

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.280 
are somewhat different in terms of what
you'll<00:03:19.910> be<00:03:19.970> seeing<00:03:20.269> what

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
you'll be seeing what

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.380 
you'll be seeing what
the<00:03:21.830> problem<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.250> here<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.940> levels<00:03:23.300> are

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
the problem is here that the levels are

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.119 
the problem is here that the levels are
just<00:03:23.510> horribly<00:03:23.900> generic<00:03:24.349> lots<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.739> times<00:03:24.920> it's

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
just horribly generic lots of times it's

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.650

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
textures which look alright on the PSP

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.830 
textures which look alright on the PSP
but<00:03:28.550> when<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.730> put<00:03:28.879> them<00:03:28.940> onto<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.239> big<00:03:29.510> screen

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840

my Weaver laundromat but you get the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.430 
my Weaver laundromat but you get the
idea<00:03:49.640> this<00:03:50.209> game<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.629> same<00:03:50.840> thing<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.319> it's

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
idea this game is the same thing so it's

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.110 
idea this game is the same thing so it's
kind<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.680> short<00:03:51.860> if<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.489> are<00:03:52.610> dead<00:03:52.819> set<00:03:53.060> on
