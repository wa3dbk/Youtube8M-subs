the<00:00:39.239> best<00:00:39.570> map<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> mob<00:00:40.440> density<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.149> not

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the best map for a mob density but not

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
the best map for a mob density but not
so<00:00:42.270> much<00:00:42.360> anymore<00:00:42.649> storm<00:00:43.649> halls<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.950> by<00:00:44.100> the

to the unknown depths now it's also a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.950 
to the unknown depths now it's also a
similar<00:01:58.920> mob<00:01:59.130> types<00:01:59.420> once<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.540> constructs

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
similar mob types once it constructs

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.700 
similar mob types once it constructs
skeletons<00:02:01.560> imps<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.250> rap<00:02:02.400> giants<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.900> if

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
skeletons imps some rap giants and if

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.930 
skeletons imps some rap giants and if
you<00:02:04.800> spiders<00:02:05.190> here<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:07.640> that's<00:02:08.640> cool

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
you spiders here and there that's cool

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:59.130 
you spiders here and there that's cool
and<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:10.739> giant<00:02:11.100> empty<00:02:11.340> path<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.820> well

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.390 

so<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.200> would<00:03:00.440> just<00:03:00.470> clear<00:03:00.800> out<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.040> zone<00:03:01.250> as

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
so you would just clear out this zone as

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.940 
so you would just clear out this zone as
well<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.879> then<00:03:02.110> go<00:03:03.110> back<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.319> clear<00:03:03.920> out

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
well and then go back and clear out

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.699 
well and then go back and clear out
realm<00:03:04.519> of<00:03:04.610> shadows<00:03:04.640> if<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.120> want<00:03:05.510> um<00:03:05.959> since<00:03:06.620> it

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
realm of shadows if you want um since it

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.559 
realm of shadows if you want um since it
was<00:03:06.830> nerfed<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.129> little<00:03:07.370> bit<00:03:07.489> it's<00:03:07.730> not<00:03:08.180> as<00:03:08.420> good

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
was nerfed a little bit it's not as good

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.970 
was nerfed a little bit it's not as good
as<00:03:08.750> these<00:03:08.840> other<00:03:09.049> two<00:03:09.170> zones<00:03:09.379> anymore<00:03:09.769> but

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
as these other two zones anymore but

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.240 
as these other two zones anymore but
it's<00:03:10.099> still<00:03:10.280> really<00:03:10.340> easy<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:12.290> I<00:03:12.860> just

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
it's still really easy and I I just

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.289 
it's still really easy and I I just
cleared<00:03:13.459> out<00:03:13.580> i<00:03:13.610> think<00:03:13.730> its<00:03:14.000> course<00:03:14.209> clearing

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.280

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.760 

and<00:05:06.540> what's<00:05:06.930> called<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.199> day<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:09.410> can<00:05:10.410> walk<00:05:10.590> in

and what's called a day so can walk in
here<00:05:11.100> go<00:05:11.370> into<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.639> soul<00:05:11.850> stone<00:05:11.970> chamber<00:05:12.270> this

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
here go into a soul stone chamber this

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.200 
here go into a soul stone chamber this
is<00:05:12.990> really<00:05:13.139> not<00:05:13.530> worth<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.889> he<00:05:14.790> does<00:05:14.940> take<00:05:15.150> a

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
is really not worth it he does take a

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:23.170 
is really not worth it he does take a
little<00:05:15.810> bit<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:16.020> time<00:05:16.199> to<00:05:16.320> kill<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.500> believe

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.480 

but<00:05:24.180> I<00:05:24.210> mean<00:05:24.360> he<00:05:24.419> does<00:05:24.570> drop<00:05:24.810> items<00:05:25.280> like<00:05:26.280> an

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
but I mean he does drop items like an

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.110 
but I mean he does drop items like an
elite<00:05:26.699> back<00:05:26.880> or<00:05:27.090> something<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:32.000> think<00:05:33.000> I

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
elite back or something so I think I

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.400 
elite back or something so I think I
have<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.240> wrong<00:05:33.419> spec<00:05:33.780> right<00:05:34.020> now<00:05:34.139> to<00:05:34.199> do

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
have the wrong spec right now to do

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:51.149 
have the wrong spec right now to do
that's<00:05:35.070> not<00:05:35.250> cool

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.350 

guys<00:05:52.159> so<00:05:52.370> much<00:05:52.430> better<00:05:52.699> than<00:05:52.879> his<00:05:53.029> goobers

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
guys so much better than his goobers

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.320 
guys so much better than his goobers
version<00:05:57.310> all<00:05:58.310> right<00:05:58.490> so<00:05:58.699> that<00:05:58.999> wasn't<00:05:59.210> so<00:05:59.300> bad

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
version all right so that wasn't so bad
