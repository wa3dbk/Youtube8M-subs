00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.650
 some food that I take when I 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:17.220
 I'm going to walk when I'm going to do it. 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 I'm going camping and it's fast food. 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.600
 very good to carry in my backpack and I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.689
 I really like it a lot 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:32.040
 initially we have here are the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 capuchin hearts remembering seeing 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.980
 nothing demanding I 'm just saying it's very 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.370
 good, very simple to do 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.739
 this one here is for example the classic 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.100
 just put water and put inside the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.930
 cup is already a great food fits in 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.690

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.309
 compact and very cheap 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 each one on the market close to my 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.170
 house and ninety cents 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.170
 this is chocolate which I like 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.180
 this one is the main main 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:16.229
 The food I like to buy is 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:25.590
 a chicken an apsa chicken breast that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:29.390
 it's shredded for you guys live in a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.390
 metal packaging 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.280
 You can see it comes in a zign package . 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.740
 the middle of the entire grid line and this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.829
 here, all you have to do is put a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.259

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.560
 done 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.979
 sometimes I put some broth of 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 chicken is only to give a boost in flavor 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.790
 very light 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.170
 does not need refrigeration and has a 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.149
 low sodium content does not have 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.590
 preservative and is ready to consume the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.319
 which I think is very important. 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.410
 do not need a refrigerator do not need the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.250

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:21.350
 I'll do it with this one 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.830
 rice that rice is a round at t 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.290
 It's a win in Brazil, it's good and it's enough. 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.420
 You make one like normal rice though 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.300
 has a different taste 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.450
 this rice costs 2 reais in the market 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.680
 near my house and it is very delicious 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.380
