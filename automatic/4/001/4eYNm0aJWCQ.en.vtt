00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
past edgewood there they're out there

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.520 
past edgewood there they're out there
doing<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:21.090> pumping<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
doing some pumping and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
there's this retaining wall here it's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.490 
there's this retaining wall here it's
about<00:01:38.450> six<00:01:39.450> feet<00:01:39.750> from<00:01:40.440> best<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.460> guess<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
about six feet from best I can guess and

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.270 
about six feet from best I can guess and
they're<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.830> worried<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.130> it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
they're not really worried about it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.830 
they're not really worried about it
coming<00:01:44.490> over<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> top<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.510> seen

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
coming over the top but they have seen

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.590 
coming over the top but they have seen
it<00:01:45.960> come<00:01:46.740> over<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.979> top<00:01:47.040> before<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it come over the top before and and it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
it come over the top before and and it
is<00:01:48.750> possibility<00:01:49.409> i<00:01:49.440> guess<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:49.979> it's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
is possibility i guess but it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:14.300 
is possibility i guess but it's
reinforced<00:01:50.910> pretty<00:01:51.119> well<00:01:51.300> obviously

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310

the city workers i spoke with here so
they've<00:02:16.950> been<00:02:16.980> pumping<00:02:17.489> since<00:02:17.790> three<00:02:18.450> o'clock

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
they've been pumping since three o'clock

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.960 
they've been pumping since three o'clock
this<00:02:18.959> morning<00:02:19.080> non-stop<00:02:20.010> they're<00:02:20.459> using<00:02:20.819> a

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
this morning non-stop they're using a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.370 
this morning non-stop they're using a
four<00:02:21.810> inch<00:02:21.989> line<00:02:22.319> here<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.890> pump<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.250> water

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
four inch line here to pump the water

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.620 
four inch line here to pump the water
what's<00:02:25.380> happening<00:02:25.830> here<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
what's happening here is that the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.470 
what's happening here is that the
pressure<00:02:27.959> from<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.470> ice<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.970> making<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
pressure from the ice is making the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.800 
pressure from the ice is making the
pressure<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.080> good<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.440> there<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.040> high<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
pressure so good on there so high on the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.259 
pressure so good on there so high on the
river<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.319> forcing<00:02:34.920> water<00:02:35.550> back<00:02:36.000> up

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
river that it's forcing water back up

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.790 
river that it's forcing water back up
through<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> ground<00:02:36.690> here<00:02:37.260> if<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.620> kind

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
through the ground here if you can kind

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.940 
through the ground here if you can kind
of<00:02:37.890> see

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
of see

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.470 
of see
there's<00:02:40.280> kind<00:02:40.520> of<00:02:40.580> some<00:02:40.640> bubbling<00:02:41.120> effect

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
there's kind of some bubbling effect

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.540 
there's kind of some bubbling effect
there<00:02:41.750> it's<00:02:42.170> there's<00:02:42.560> no<00:02:42.739> drain<00:02:43.099> there<00:02:43.370> it's

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
there it's there's no drain there it's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.380 
there it's there's no drain there it's
just<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.879> crack<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.599> in<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.410> cement<00:02:45.890> that's

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
just a crack in the in the cement that's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.059 
just a crack in the in the cement that's
water<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.510> coming<00:02:47.660> bubbling<00:02:48.140> back<00:02:48.349> up<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.860> so
