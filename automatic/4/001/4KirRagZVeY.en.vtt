00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.779 
one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:40.090> fact<00:04:40.630> iphone<00:04:41.200> 4<00:04:41.530> delivers<00:04:42.010> up<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.250> forty

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.390 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty
percent<00:04:43.150> more<00:04:43.419> talk<00:04:43.630> time

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
percent more talk time

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.689 
percent more talk time
we<00:04:46.180> started<00:04:46.750> with<00:04:47.280> completely<00:04:48.280> opposing

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
we started with completely opposing

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.240 
we started with completely opposing
goals<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.810> we<00:04:50.080> wanted<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.440> make<00:04:50.620> this<00:04:50.740> iphone

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
goals and we wanted to make this iphone

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.490 
goals and we wanted to make this iphone
more<00:04:51.880> capable<00:04:52.419> we<00:04:52.690> wanted<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.020> add<00:04:53.229> more

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
more capable we wanted to add more

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.310 
more capable we wanted to add more
feature<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.310> yet<00:04:55.180> at<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.360> same<00:04:55.419> time<00:04:55.630> we

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
feature and yet at the same time we

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.810 
feature and yet at the same time we
wanted<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.620> make<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.889> smaller<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.460> even

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
wanted to make it smaller and even

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.210 
wanted to make it smaller and even
thinner<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.449> that<00:04:59.259> led<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.470> some<00:04:59.800> really

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
thinner and that led to some really

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.810 
thinner and that led to some really
surprising<00:05:00.400> innovation<00:05:02.280> we<00:05:03.280> developed<00:05:03.430> an

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
surprising innovation we developed an

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.719 
surprising innovation we developed an
entirely<00:05:04.330> new<00:05:04.539> grade<00:05:05.050> stainless<00:05:05.710> steel<00:05:06.220> that

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
entirely new grade stainless steel that

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.290 
entirely new grade stainless steel that
after<00:05:07.060> machining<00:05:07.479> is<00:05:08.139> incredibly<00:05:09.070> strong<00:05:09.460> but

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
after machining is incredibly strong but

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.740 
after machining is incredibly strong but
also<00:05:10.479> remarkably<00:05:11.289> precise<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:13.090> steel<00:05:13.389> frame

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
also remarkably precise the steel frame

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.320 
also remarkably precise the steel frame
functions<00:05:14.350> as<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.530> antenna<00:05:15.070> but<00:05:15.490> also<00:05:15.789> the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
functions as the antenna but also the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.300 
functions as the antenna but also the
primary<00:05:16.570> structure<00:05:17.350> giving<00:05:17.889> us<00:05:18.100> more

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
primary structure giving us more

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.379 
primary structure giving us more
internal<00:05:18.850> volume<00:05:20.550> we<00:05:21.550> also<00:05:21.699> developed<00:05:22.300> a

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
internal volume we also developed a

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.300 
internal volume we also developed a
custom<00:05:22.780> glass<00:05:22.960> that's<00:05:23.620> comparable<00:05:24.160> in

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
custom glass that's comparable in

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.730 
custom glass that's comparable in
strength<00:05:24.639> to<00:05:24.820> sapphire<00:05:25.180> crystal<00:05:25.780> but<00:05:26.560> about

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
strength to sapphire crystal but about

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.600 
strength to sapphire crystal but about
30<00:05:27.070> times<00:05:27.430> harder<00:05:28.120> than<00:05:28.300> plastic<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:30.400> glass

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
an amazing new iphone but it's the fact
