00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.170
 tailgate closer can 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.240
 serve the usual spring is not my idea 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.550
 looked at yu tuba 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 people suggest who is the door spring 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.529
 put but one suggested that you can 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.130
 with clutch link classics use 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.439
 already finished springs perfect it 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.990
 block and small finalized to 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:31.320
 eliminate creaking and on the ends of the springs 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.230
 put on a cambric is isolation from ordinary 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.230
 I will wear the copper wire for the second hour 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.000
 homemade bouquet 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.219
 and 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.010
 the rest is cut off a little this thing 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.200
 I finished when I get tired 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:09.110
 set on u so here 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.270
 the hole is edge sharp so i 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.030
 did again the cambric court edge 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.420
 which end hooks on this 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.229
 a hole but a spring cling 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:26.440
 the body starts to creak 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:28.520
 I drilled a hole here it is a number 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.619
 why chose to know because here 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.119
 the metal is layered on each other in 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.970
 overlapping is the thickest place and 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.190
 picked up just such a butterfly and knows what 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.820
 from the bike probably now i go there 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.420
 will install 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.420
 and I will spring for him 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.229
 that's really to 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:42.000
 That's how it happened here for the body is not 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:51.060
 catches and here she came here 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:53.060
 so that more tightly if anyone pasted 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.360
 insulation certainly heavily weights 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.200
 the cover then you need to wear a second spring 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.480
 to the other side 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.730
 I have already tried 2 dressed shoots 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.730
 very strong enough and one spring
