00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.320
 agricultural production 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.560
 it is practically impossible at this time 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.070
 do it economically if you do not have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.319
 a system of 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.560
 in the genre 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.890
 garcÃ­a ferrer 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.100
 we go to the network 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.999
 and what are the components 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.040
 that has an irrigation system 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.420
 It's very important 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.890
 for example the card 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.620
 it is not advisable to always do it 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.589
 I've seen 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.880
 on the doctor's farm 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.290
 figueredo where the pastures work to encourage them 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.860
 everything is palpating work dad watering present we're going to follow the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 indications the engineer 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.080
 what we have seen 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.290
 the irrigation system in general in all its components 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.540
 let's go on to specifically detail each one 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.520
 and those elements 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.890
 those are the different types of filters 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.960
 very good time 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.880
 that we can go using an irrigation system 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.970
 we have filters 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.420
 Of discs 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.750
 what are acts 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.610
 which for 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.610
 do cd san roque maintenance somewhere 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.560
 and he is cleaning the discs 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.950
 we have mesh filter 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.690
 what can it be and ports 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.740
 smaller mesh filter section 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.730
 larger disk filter 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.730
 the mechanism for all filters is the same 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.840
 how do you use the filter 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.720
 Larger or more children according to the flow of water that we want to filter 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.050
 the composition of the filters 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.520
 They are all the same 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.430
 we have 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.230
 a place of water entry 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.970
 he went inside 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.210
 the water is filtered and we have a place 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.070
 where the bossa filters 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.720
 the lesson of the filter 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.659
 It depends 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.600
 of water quality 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.759
 and of degree 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.190
 to which we want to filter the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.439
 I know we have 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.849
 very dirty water 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.439
 we would have to put a filter battery 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.519
 or do filter staging of a filter that 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.609
 retain larger particles 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.950
 following a filter to retain smaller particles and so follow 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.179
 promotion is about adapting the repression of particles that we want 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.549
 The filters 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.569
 currently used are very long-lasting devices 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.139
 extremely 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.909
 easy use and maintenance 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.029
 and with proper use 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:38.839
 and a live maintenance 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:42.029
 could last - a very long year in the irrigation system 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.529
 now we come perhaps one of the main components of any 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.719
 inmate system that are the emitters 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.019
 tenth emitter is because they are an organism for which is they come out of the water 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.849
 they are mainly mcpherson type once 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.700
 pablo a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.599
 Drip irrigation mechanism 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.719
 sprinklers we have many types from the smallest 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.609
 like cherry tree that are within the category mini sprinklers 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.510
 juventus 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.400
 called micros people who use between or control greenhouses 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.899
 accurate climbers 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.989
 we might even have these are a little bigger are bronze 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.730
 this person can reach 30 meters from 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.569
 60 meters in diameter 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.519
 pulling 3,500 in a thousand liters now at a pressure of four kilos 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.879
 we are people stops I see 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.229
 extensive agriculture we could rear grasslands 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.319
 we could reader 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.029
 pazos to say the people 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.990
 we do not have a whole range of these people 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.180
 efe position 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.530
 in a radius of 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.379
 8 12 meters which have infinite 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.390
 infinite use infinite applications this for example are designed for inmate of 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.439
 bananas 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.629
 for their design they have one from the peculiarity of having 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.200
 an angle of jet naan below which makes the water allow what they allow 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.319
 that water 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.969
 penetrate what I was the one of the banana plantation 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.819
 that personal type is called persuasive hammer 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.999
 by the mechanism will be articulated 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.060
 which has 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.319
 Water 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.069
 comes out through the keel or the peg one for this one 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:19.359
 screw 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.359
 that serves to be able to determine degree 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.370
 diffusion that will have the water jet 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.840
 thorpe has returned more than that this picture has made the turn of the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.520
 people 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.849
 the sprinklers 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.430
 Hammer type work almost in the same way 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.099
 in these bigger 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.520
 we also have not worked in the same way the water volpe to the 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.240
 martyrdom 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.080
 and with that 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.099
 how to achieve 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.689
 I prefer people 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.540
 within the category of myth reads sprinklers 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.320
 we have the so-called micros people 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.560
 those are ones 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.870
 sprinklers 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.380
 generally they have radios of one like 5 to 5 or 6 meters of radio dam 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.430
 and with everything to the outside and not in those in such and three hundred liters per hour 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.520
 its use 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.520
 privacy or who among many can be used 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.740
 for irrigation control of manors climate control of harpoons 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.039
 of young 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.860
 adje to swim you can use some similar in control of cante and frost 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.500
 can also be used for fire control here we can see 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.180
 in a demonstration sprinkler the internal mechanisms that have these 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.590
 sprinkler types and the way in which the mother pipe is connected that is 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.210
 means of a flexible union 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.800
 also that the person can be this movement 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.470
 in case someone steps out 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.629
 let's finish 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.559
 a type of pipe 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.199
 drip irrigation 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.190
 this pipe is related to 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.699
 show the drip road turn that is in 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.430
 this one particularly from a compensated dropper which they have 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.009
 multiple exits is coming soon 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.680
 2 liters for now at a compiled pressure 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.430
 the drip irrigation pipe 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.020
 they can be of many types 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.949
 they come in many diameters 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.369
 external and internal 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.460
 I would play also 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.650
 The spesor 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.449
 of the walls of the pipe of otero 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.710
 can go from the treasure must 100 microns 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.339
 up to 1500 microns and it depends on the use that is going to be given 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.339
 here we have two people from two different generations 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.610
 we have the traditional hammer type sprinklers 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.300
 that have been used for a long time 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.300
 and we have this new thickness range 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.129
 in which we have no presence of any external mechanism 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.199
 as we have no hammer people 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.909
 these personnel have internal mechanisms 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:49.469
 what they allow that the duration of the same is much greater to the people 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.129
 hammer type 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:52.999
 the uniformity of irrigation 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:55.889
 that these characters achieve is much greater 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.960
 that the hammer type sprinklers 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.650
 the ease or use they have
