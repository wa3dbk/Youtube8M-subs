this video a couple of times and it
didn't<00:00:56.850> work<00:00:56.879> out<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.230> obsidian<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.829> still

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
didn't work out so the obsidian is still

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
didn't work out so the obsidian is still
in<00:00:59.250> place<00:00:59.750> you'll<00:01:00.750> need<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.109> put<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> obsidian

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
in place you'll need to put the obsidian

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.030 
in place you'll need to put the obsidian
one<00:01:03.120> block<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> either<00:01:03.899> side<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.860> two

and again just to the right of center ok
now<00:01:45.180> we're<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.509> dig<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.340> track

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
now we're going to dig out the track

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.200 
now we're going to dig out the track
areas<00:01:50.000> go<00:01:51.000> down<00:01:51.240> two<00:01:51.630> blocks<00:01:52.170> wide<00:01:52.970> one<00:01:53.970> deep

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
areas go down two blocks wide one deep

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.859 
areas go down two blocks wide one deep
and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.420> now<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.479> are<00:01:57.750> at

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
and then go down one more now we are at

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.260 
and then go down one more now we are at
the<00:01:58.020> level<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.439> want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.890> at<00:01:59.180> we're<00:02:00.180> going

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the level we want to be at we're going

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.459 
the level we want to be at we're going
to<00:02:00.329> dig<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:01.909> three-wide<00:02:03.799> too<00:02:04.799> tall<00:02:06.020> by<00:02:07.020> four

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
to dig out a three-wide too tall by four

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.510 
to dig out a three-wide too tall by four
deep<00:02:07.799> area

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.760 

okay<00:02:13.520> with<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.970> done<00:02:14.300> we're<00:02:15.260> going<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.440> also

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
okay with that done we're going to also

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.290 
okay with that done we're going to also
dig<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:17.270> same<00:02:17.630> exact<00:02:18.380> angle<00:02:18.850> back<00:02:19.850> on<00:02:20.150> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
dig the same exact angle back on the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.270 
dig the same exact angle back on the
other<00:02:20.450> side<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.080> when<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.410> lay<00:02:21.590> our<00:02:21.770> track<00:02:21.830> it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
other side so when we lay our track it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.449 
other side so when we lay our track it
will<00:02:22.370> come<00:02:22.550> straight<00:02:22.790> down<00:02:23.860> at<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.069> end<00:02:25.250> of

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
will come straight down at the end of

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.340 
will come straight down at the end of
the<00:02:25.640> three<00:02:25.910> by<00:02:26.060> four<00:02:26.120> area<00:02:26.720> I'm<00:02:26.930> going<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.170> dig

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
the three by four area I'm going to dig

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.010 
the three by four area I'm going to dig
out<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.770> more<00:02:27.980> block<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:29.180> represents<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
out one more block this represents the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.930 
out one more block this represents the
entrance<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.740> exit<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.430> tunnel<00:02:31.760> I'm

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
entrance and exit to the tunnel I'm

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.400 
entrance and exit to the tunnel I'm
going<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> put<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> torch<00:02:32.780> there<00:02:33.020> just<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.380> that

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
going to put a torch there just so that

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.710 
going to put a torch there just so that
we<00:02:33.590> remember<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.190> let's<00:02:35.150> go<00:02:35.300> dig<00:02:35.540> out<00:02:35.660> the

definitely want to light the areas where
your<00:05:03.379> track<00:05:03.650> is<00:05:03.830> underground<00:05:04.250> so<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.090> don't

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
your track is underground so you don't

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.649 
your track is underground so you don't
have<00:05:05.419> monsters<00:05:06.020> spawn<00:05:06.560> in<00:05:06.889> those<00:05:07.159> areas<00:05:07.659> I

would also suggest not putting your

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.020 
would also suggest not putting your
tracks<00:05:11.599> on<00:05:11.870> dirt<00:05:12.319> just<00:05:12.770> because<00:05:13.099> grass<00:05:13.550> will

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
tracks on dirt just because grass will

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.700 
tracks on dirt just because grass will
still<00:05:14.300> spawn<00:05:15.190> animals<00:05:17.409> put<00:05:18.409> our<00:05:18.530> other

other<00:05:23.449> wiring<00:05:23.840> in<00:05:24.169> place<00:05:24.909> and<00:05:25.909> i'll<00:05:26.000> show<00:05:26.060> you

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
other wiring in place and i'll show you

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.820 
other wiring in place and i'll show you
how<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.509> do<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.840> switch<00:05:27.139> which<00:05:27.379> is<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.560> little

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
how to do the switch which is a little

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.520 
how to do the switch which is a little
different<00:05:30.039> okay<00:05:31.039> so<00:05:31.099> onto<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.699> switch<00:05:32.530> right

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
different okay so onto the switch right

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.950 
different okay so onto the switch right
here<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:35.180> where<00:05:35.449> we're<00:05:35.569> going<00:05:35.690> to<00:05:35.750> put<00:05:35.810> our

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
here it's where we're going to put our

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.629 
here it's where we're going to put our
switch<00:05:36.729> just<00:05:37.729> at<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.389> very<00:05:38.419> first<00:05:38.840> drop<00:05:39.199> block

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
switch just at the very first drop block

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.709 
switch just at the very first drop block
now<00:05:40.639> we're<00:05:40.789> going<00:05:40.909> to<00:05:40.969> dig<00:05:41.210> out<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.479> block

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
now we're going to dig out the block

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.790 
now we're going to dig out the block
below<00:05:42.169> it<00:05:42.560> and<00:05:44.080> then<00:05:45.080> we're<00:05:45.199> going<00:05:45.289> to<00:05:45.349> dig<00:05:45.590> one

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
below it and then we're going to dig one

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.480 
below it and then we're going to dig one
block<00:05:46.069> back<00:05:46.430> from<00:05:46.729> that<00:05:46.969> and<00:05:48.219> one<00:05:49.219> block<00:05:49.460> to

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
block back from that and one block to

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.730 
block back from that and one block to
the<00:05:49.699> side<00:05:50.030> to<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.449> right<00:05:50.569> of<00:05:50.930> that<00:05:50.960> now<00:05:51.409> this

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
the side to the right of that now this

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.740 
the side to the right of that now this
way<00:05:52.009> I'm<00:05:52.639> going<00:05:52.849> to<00:05:52.909> go<00:05:53.120> ahead<00:05:53.210> and<00:05:53.330> dig<00:05:53.629> out

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
way I'm going to go ahead and dig out

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.860 
way I'm going to go ahead and dig out
all<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.409> blocks<00:05:54.710> up<00:05:54.949> top<00:05:55.250> except<00:05:55.940> for<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.719> one

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
all the blocks up top except for the one

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.649 
all the blocks up top except for the one
that's<00:05:57.080> holding<00:05:57.199> the<00:05:57.500> switch<00:05:58.479> so<00:05:59.479> this

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
that's holding the switch so this

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.600 
that's holding the switch so this
basically<00:05:59.870> makes<00:06:00.409> a<00:06:00.590> u-shape<00:06:01.190> of<00:06:02.319> red<00:06:03.319> dust

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
basically makes a u-shape of red dust

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.159 
basically makes a u-shape of red dust
that<00:06:04.610> goes<00:06:04.849> from<00:06:05.120> just<00:06:05.479> below<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.900> switch

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
that goes from just below the switch

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.040 
that goes from just below the switch
back<00:06:06.800> to<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:07.009> obsidian<00:06:07.580> block<00:06:07.880> as<00:06:08.719> you<00:06:08.930> can

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
back to the obsidian block as you can

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.399 
back to the obsidian block as you can
see<00:06:09.819> we<00:06:10.819> turn<00:06:11.060> that<00:06:11.240> on<00:06:11.300> it<00:06:11.930> powers<00:06:12.229> the

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
see we turn that on it powers the

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.219 
see we turn that on it powers the
obsidian<00:06:13.039> block<00:06:13.630> okay<00:06:14.630> so<00:06:14.690> I'm<00:06:14.930> going<00:06:15.080> to<00:06:15.110> go

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
obsidian block okay so I'm going to go

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.749 
obsidian block okay so I'm going to go
ahead<00:06:15.259> and<00:06:15.469> cover<00:06:15.650> that<00:06:15.919> back<00:06:16.159> up<00:06:16.400> by<00:06:16.699> just

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
ahead and cover that back up by just

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.120 
ahead and cover that back up by just
putting<00:06:17.120> blocks<00:06:17.479> at<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:17.840> top<00:06:18.050> level<00:06:18.469> now<00:06:19.069> you

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
putting blocks at the top level now you

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.730 
putting blocks at the top level now you
can<00:06:19.370> only<00:06:19.580> see<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:20.060> initial<00:06:20.539> redstone<00:06:21.469> our

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
can only see the initial redstone our

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.300 
can only see the initial redstone our
