00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.709
 obviously the practice does its game in the sense that in any case very important 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.119
 then 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.389
 we divide the movements quickly 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.849
 bento bento 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.259
 tooth bento 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.409
 otherwise 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:20.400
 bento 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.839
 inside 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:22.810
 out more 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.839
 fuorissimo 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.099
 bento 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.099
 ben ten 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.570
 okay me 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.990
 finished with this here from hopefully it was helpful 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.540
 to what 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.000
 if it remains for me to say it is only about 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.920
 do a lot of practice because it is important and only practice sluts 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.320
 can you help me 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.970
 to make this movement with your stomach you will succeed so much better 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.180
 so if you want to learn belly dancing you have to learn this movement 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.730
 why 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.500
 It's useless 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.300
 it is especially then it is not the only movement s important nadal webank is 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300
 because then there are also 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.390
 other movements a lot 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.970
 + loose to do with the hips etc. then 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.980
 texts - go and check your stomach that 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.750
 perhaps the most difficult part to manage temp check vat on the sides has 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.320
 asked your back to your bust especially 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.560
 it is so important to remember that many people think of belly dancing 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.040
 that you have to keep your legs fixed this is not true because for example of in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.160
 a movement 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.510
 called monkeys 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510
 pandorine above all as we have said before 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.689
 the legs must be removed at your sides then 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.450
 position this way and the monkey 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 would be in practice 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 the alternation of this movement making my mind fast 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.819
 and therefore at this moment 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.049
 the legs have two
