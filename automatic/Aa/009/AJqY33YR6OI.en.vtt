00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that and then your gimbal itself now I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.280 
that and then your gimbal itself now I
have<00:01:01.710> been<00:01:01.859> told<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:03.470> it<00:01:04.470> will<00:01:04.680> come<00:01:05.010> with

my favorite but you know box it will
come<00:01:20.360> already<00:01:21.360> pre-made<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:24.780> believe<00:01:25.260> from

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
come already pre-made and I believe from

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.770 
come already pre-made and I believe from
what<00:01:25.860> I've<00:01:26.010> been<00:01:26.040> told

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
what I've been told

what I've been told
pre-configured<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> anyway<00:01:30.420> seeing<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pre-configured so anyway seeing is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.650 
pre-configured so anyway seeing is
believing

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
believing

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.090 
believing
I<00:01:35.570> see<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> few<00:01:37.080> use<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.530> probably<00:01:37.860> recognize

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
I see a few use will probably recognize

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:48.490 
I see a few use will probably recognize
the<00:01:38.880> gimbal<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:44.060> again<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:45.330> rubbers<00:01:46.580> I

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
the gimbal and again these rubbers I

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.470 
the gimbal and again these rubbers I
would<00:01:49.500> say<00:01:49.650> too<00:01:49.710> soft<00:01:51.440> far<00:01:52.440> too<00:01:52.740> soft

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
would say too soft far too soft

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.920 
would say too soft far too soft
yeah<00:01:54.480> but

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
yeah but

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.289 
yeah but
anyway<00:01:58.399> there's<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.520> quick<00:02:00.149> look<00:02:00.390> at<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> board

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
anyway there's a quick look at the board

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.649 
anyway there's a quick look at the board
you'll<00:02:03.299> access<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:05.149> all<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> wires<00:02:06.450> are

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
you'll access there to all the wires are

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.309 
you'll access there to all the wires are
coming<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:06.960> through<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.350> more<00:02:07.700> we<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:08.729> at<00:02:08.970> top

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
coming up through the more we are at top

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.160 
coming up through the more we are at top
so<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.530> will<00:02:10.679> give<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.009> your<00:02:12.019> v60<00:02:13.400> unimpeded

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
so it will give you your v60 unimpeded

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:26.150 
so it will give you your v60 unimpeded
which<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.349> nice<00:02:16.590> feature<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:25.040> it's<00:02:26.040> gonna

which is a nice feature and it's gonna

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.860 
which is a nice feature and it's gonna
cut<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.730> think<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.239> back<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.840> wires<00:02:32.870> sure

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
cut you think on the back of wires sure

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.890 
cut you think on the back of wires sure
you<00:02:34.049> get<00:02:34.940> there<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.060> go<00:02:36.150> gonna<00:02:36.569> pull<00:02:36.750> out

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
you get there we go gonna pull out

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:45.500 
you get there we go gonna pull out

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
believe it so as you can see a lot

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.170 
believe it so as you can see a lot
easier<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> recognize<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:50.370> motor<00:02:51.060> on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
easier to recognize it and this motor on

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.809 
easier to recognize it and this motor on
the<00:02:51.239> top<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:53.700> we<00:02:53.849> see<00:02:54.060> will<00:02:54.269> will<00:02:54.690> see

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
the top is as we see will will see

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.030 
the top is as we see will will see
there's<00:02:56.819> four<00:02:57.120> holes<00:02:57.360> for<00:02:57.920> obviously<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
there's four holes for obviously the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.319 
there's four holes for obviously the
standoffs<00:03:00.859> the<00:03:01.859> rubber<00:03:02.100> side<00:03:02.549> must<00:03:02.850> admit<00:03:03.150> I'm

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
standoffs the rubber side must admit I'm

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.400 
standoffs the rubber side must admit I'm
a<00:03:03.359> bit<00:03:03.600> disappointed<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.560> they<00:03:05.069> look<00:03:05.489> very

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410

to do is put together I need to say
swatch<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:47.030> swap<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.180> over<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:49.519> connect<00:03:50.519> up

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
swatch this swap this over a connect up

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.410 
swatch this swap this over a connect up
to<00:03:50.910> your<00:03:51.030> computer<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:52.940> get<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> few<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.299> the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
to your computer and get a few of the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.479 
to your computer and get a few of the
old<00:03:55.549> standoffs<00:03:56.549> I'll<00:03:57.239> probably<00:03:57.569> put<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.959> on<00:03:58.079> a

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
old standoffs I'll probably put it on a
