00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.389
 hello people, we are going to make a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.800
 mouth color lip tip 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.750
 but natural as the tone used in the middle and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.750
 so let's go to the step by step 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.399
 So we'll start with the base. 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:38.129
 use that which is a medium pipe 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.350
 Look at this true-to-life color of lips 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.050
 base to break some of this rose 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 you saw it now and then 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.129
 distressed the color of lipstick that I intend 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.760
 I've already won and half almost never 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.569
 but then I do not want to always paint the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.469
 lips 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:01:02.280
 so I use base to break this color 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.470
 strong as she applied a lipstick 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:16.790
 So today we 're going to go out first and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:16.790
 button cute sneaker or pink apply 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:26.210
 not like that without stopping a little bit him well 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.210
 clear 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.570
 slightly 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.789
 and then we can use it now it can be a 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.799
 Light pink but wear it pink rose 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.450
 gum going 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.450
 I will apply it in the center of the lips 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 I mix 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:11.720
 and left in the center looks just very cool 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.630
 It's natural, it's cool because it's a new 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.820
 way of using your mouth because people 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.080
 ends up doing everything in the same tone 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.080
 and it gets very natural 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.710
 if you have spent what you like and leave 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.230
 doubt or your comment 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.230
 the one after the blog a kiss and until the next
