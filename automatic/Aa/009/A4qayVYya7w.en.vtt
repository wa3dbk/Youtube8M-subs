different<00:00:08.099> game<00:00:08.340> modes<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.639> could<00:00:08.820> be

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
different game modes that could be

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.820 
different game modes that could be
factored<00:00:09.360> into<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.809> game<00:00:10.050> if<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.349> does<00:00:10.559> come

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
factored into this game if it does come

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.709 
factored into this game if it does come
into<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.219> future<00:00:11.610> now<00:00:11.820> guys<00:00:12.389> I've<00:00:12.599> actually

into the future now guys I've actually
got<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> spare<00:00:13.500> copy<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.309> escape<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.820> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
copy of The Escapist on Steam so the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.080 
copy of The Escapist on Steam so the
first<00:00:22.500> aspect<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> escape<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.029> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
first aspect for the escape is for it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120 
first aspect for the escape is for it
being<00:00:24.330> an<00:00:24.449> actual<00:00:24.539> multiplayer<00:00:25.350> co-op<00:00:25.680> game

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
being an actual multiplayer co-op game

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.279 
being an actual multiplayer co-op game
will<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> idea<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.480> game-mode<00:00:27.779> where

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
will be the idea of a game-mode where

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.679 
will be the idea of a game-mode where
both<00:00:28.590> players<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.490> work<00:00:29.730> together<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
both players have to work together to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
both players have to work together to
escape<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> prison<00:00:31.560> together<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.759> this

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
escape the prison together so this

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330 
escape the prison together so this
requires<00:00:33.260> communication<00:00:34.260> teamwork<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
requires communication teamwork and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.889 
requires communication teamwork and
cooperation<00:00:35.550> working<00:00:36.210> towards<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.870> common

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
cooperation working towards a common

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.639 
cooperation working towards a common
goal

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
goal

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.250 
goal
which<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.579> will<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.760> quite<00:00:38.790> unique<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
which I think will be quite unique for a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.830 
which I think will be quite unique for a
game<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.800> nature<00:00:41.129> now<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.329> two<00:00:42.510> players

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
game of this nature now with two players

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.720 
game of this nature now with two players
playing<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.440> prison<00:00:43.829> presents<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> whole<00:00:44.520> lot

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
playing one prison presents a whole lot

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.459 
playing one prison presents a whole lot
of<00:00:44.760> different<00:00:45.210> opportunities<00:00:45.450> such<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.140> one

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of different opportunities such as one

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.950 
of different opportunities such as one
player<00:00:46.770> may<00:00:47.399> want<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> distract<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.390> guard<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
player may want to distract a guard or a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
player may want to distract a guard or a
different<00:00:49.289> cellmate<00:00:49.829> while<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> other

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
different cellmate while the other

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.340 
different cellmate while the other
player<00:00:50.850> continues<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.629> work<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:51.960> their<00:00:52.110> escape

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
player continues to work on their escape

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
player continues to work on their escape
plan<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.949> either<00:00:53.070> stealing<00:00:53.520> cells<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.239> stuff

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
plan but either stealing cells of stuff

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.600 
plan but either stealing cells of stuff
on<00:00:54.780> people's<00:00:55.050> cells<00:00:55.260> while<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.010> distraction

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
on people's cells while the distraction

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.209 
on people's cells while the distraction
is<00:00:56.760> still<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.649> two<00:00:58.829> players

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is still going on so the two players

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.860 
is still going on so the two players
will<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.460> prison<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> gives<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> chance<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
will in prison it gives you a chance to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.689 
will in prison it gives you a chance to
really<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:02.039> two<00:01:02.250> players<00:01:02.609> can

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
really see what what two players can

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.910 
really see what what two players can
come<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.049> game<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.439> already<00:01:04.650> so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
come up with and the game was already so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
come up with and the game was already so
flexible<00:01:05.489> until<00:01:05.760> how<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> escape

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
flexible until how you want to escape

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.719 
flexible until how you want to escape
this<00:01:07.350> could<00:01:07.530> open<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.920> whole<00:01:07.950> different<00:01:08.670> new

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this could open up a whole different new

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.570 
this could open up a whole different new
array<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.540> things<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> even<00:01:10.830> items<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
array of things and even items of the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.890 
array of things and even items of the
other<00:01:11.760> players<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> use<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> work<00:01:12.720> together

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
other players can use to work together

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.590 
other players can use to work together
and<00:01:13.260> communicate<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.280> perhaps<00:01:14.790> communication

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and communicate so perhaps communication

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
and communicate so perhaps communication
could<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.810> done<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.200> in-game<00:01:16.350> by<00:01:16.830> writing

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
could be done with in-game by writing

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.980 
could be done with in-game by writing
letters<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> each<00:01:17.790> other<00:01:18.000> actual<00:01:18.390> talking<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
letters to each other actual talking to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.469 
letters to each other actual talking to
each<00:01:19.140> other<00:01:19.290> via<00:01:19.860> typing<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.520> texts<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:20.939> why

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
each other via typing or texts or why

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
each other via typing or texts or why
not<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> game<00:01:22.320> you'll<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.650> able<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.070> go<00:01:23.250> in

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
not have a game you'll be able to go in

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
not have a game you'll be able to go in
and<00:01:23.610> put<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.060> where<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.509> play<00:01:24.750> alongside

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and put it where you can play alongside

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
and put it where you can play alongside
with<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.619> friend<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.159> home<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.729> communicate

with your friend at home and communicate

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
with your friend at home and communicate
through<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.960> way<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.100> guys

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
through that way so what do you guys

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.980 
through that way so what do you guys
think<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.729> idea<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.420> gamer<00:01:30.630> where<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
think of this idea of a gamer where you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719 
think of this idea of a gamer where you
have<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.409> escape<00:01:31.770> together<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> gamer

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
have to escape together and the gamer

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.270 
have to escape together and the gamer
cannot<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.360> completed<00:01:33.780> unless<00:01:34.020> both<00:01:34.650> both

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
cannot be completed unless both both

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.399 
cannot be completed unless both both
players<00:01:35.670> escape<00:01:36.299> either<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> same<00:01:37.110> time

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
players escape either at the same time

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
players escape either at the same time
or<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.710> after<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> other<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.729> cannot<00:01:39.030> be

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
or one after the other but cannot be

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.719 
or one after the other but cannot be
completed<00:01:39.479> until<00:01:39.659> both<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.590> them<00:01:40.729> actually

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
completed until both of them actually

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
completed until both of them actually
escape<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.299> prison<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.780> teamwork<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.470> must

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
escape the prison so teamwork is a must

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.310 
escape the prison so teamwork is a must
another<00:01:44.939> idea<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.540> game<00:01:45.750> mode<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.990> quite<00:01:46.170> an

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
another idea for a game mode is quite an

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.020 
another idea for a game mode is quite an
obvious<00:01:46.470> one<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:47.880> pretty

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
obvious one and it is what I'm pretty

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
obvious one and it is what I'm pretty
much<00:01:48.210> calling<00:01:48.540> verses<00:01:49.229> where<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.829> basically

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
much calling verses where it's basically

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.270 
much calling verses where it's basically
who<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.880> escape<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.659> fastest<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:53.100> two

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
who can escape the fastest and with two

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
who can escape the fastest and with two
players<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.000> map<00:01:54.210> trying<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.780> escape<00:01:55.020> this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
players of one map trying to escape this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.950 
players of one map trying to escape this
could<00:01:55.829> open<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.579> lot<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.090> funny<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.719> also

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
could open up a lot of funny and also

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530 
could open up a lot of funny and also
very<00:01:58.229> interesting<00:01:58.740> ways<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.420> sabotaging<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
very interesting ways of sabotaging the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.719 
very interesting ways of sabotaging the
other<00:02:00.719> player<00:02:01.110> say<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.250> player<00:02:02.579> is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
other player say if one player is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
other player say if one player is
digging<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.149> hole<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.360> escape<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> prison<00:02:04.140> from

can continue your own plans so this can

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.119 
can continue your own plans so this can
be<00:02:19.469> opened<00:02:19.709> up<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.859> a<00:02:19.889> lot<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> different

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
sabotage and you get you use prison

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.500 
sabotage and you get you use prison
guards<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.280> also<00:02:23.519> other<00:02:23.670> cellmates<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.329> your

true advantage to sabotage other players
to<00:02:26.939> make<00:02:27.090> sure<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.599> escape<00:02:28.019> first

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
to make sure you escape first

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.220 
to make sure you escape first
I<00:02:28.590> think<00:02:29.219> this<00:02:29.459> versus<00:02:30.209> option<00:02:30.719> it<00:02:30.780> could<00:02:31.109> be

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
I think this versus option it could be

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.319 
I think this versus option it could be
most<00:02:31.590> useful<00:02:31.709> online<00:02:32.340> playing<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:33.000> actual

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
most useful online playing with actual

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.839 
most useful online playing with actual
random<00:02:33.719> players<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.260> say<00:02:34.889> you<00:02:34.950> are<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.609> both

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
random players and say you are you both

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.819 
random players and say you are you both
playing<00:02:36.180> even<00:02:36.569> more<00:02:36.750> players<00:02:37.109> are<00:02:37.349> playing<00:02:37.530> in

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
playing even more players are playing in

you had to escape the prison allowing
the<00:03:08.430> other<00:03:08.579> player<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.239> win<00:03:09.449> so<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.599> think<00:03:09.689> this

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the other player to win so I think this

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.929 
the other player to win so I think this
is<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:09.989> very<00:03:10.319> interesting<00:03:11.159> option<00:03:11.340> here<00:03:11.699> guys

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
is a very interesting option here guys

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.030 
is a very interesting option here guys
is<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.209> who<00:03:12.359> can<00:03:12.510> escape<00:03:12.750> first<00:03:13.199> who<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.919> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
is it who can escape first who is the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.369 
is it who can escape first who is the
fastest<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:15.269> think<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.599> this<00:03:15.989> go<00:03:16.139> up<00:03:16.199> and

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
fastest and I think it's this go up and

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.619 
fastest and I think it's this go up and
up<00:03:16.469> a<00:03:16.560> lot<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.829> funny<00:03:17.250> scenarios<00:03:17.669> specially

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
up a lot of funny scenarios specially

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.849 
up a lot of funny scenarios specially
when<00:03:18.780> we're<00:03:19.049> trying<00:03:19.139> to<00:03:19.290> stop<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.799> other

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
when we're trying to stop the other

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.949 
when we're trying to stop the other
player<00:03:20.220> from<00:03:20.489> escaping<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:21.180> final<00:03:21.569> game<00:03:21.750> mode

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
player from escaping the final game mode

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.780 
player from escaping the final game mode
is<00:03:22.139> one<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.319> actually<00:03:22.470> thought<00:03:22.889> was<00:03:23.009> like<00:03:23.579> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
is one I actually thought was like the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.520 
is one I actually thought was like the
most<00:03:23.970> interesting<00:03:24.569> one<00:03:24.720> out<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.199> the<00:03:25.500> three

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
most interesting one out of the three

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.580 
most interesting one out of the three
and<00:03:26.009> is<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.669> idea<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.209> one<00:03:27.509> player<00:03:27.870> becomes<00:03:28.349> a

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
and is the idea of one player becomes a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.369 
and is the idea of one player becomes a
warden<00:03:29.069> or<00:03:29.280> god<00:03:29.699> whilst<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.750> other<00:03:30.989> player

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
warden or god whilst the other player

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.789 
warden or god whilst the other player
remains<00:03:31.949> as<00:03:32.159> a<00:03:32.400> prisoner<00:03:33.090> now<00:03:33.689> as<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.019> god<00:03:34.439> you

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
remains as a prisoner now as a god you

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.979 
remains as a prisoner now as a god you
are<00:03:34.949> not<00:03:34.979> able<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:35.609> which<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.659> of<00:03:36.689> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
are not able to know which one of the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.629 
are not able to know which one of the
prisoners<00:03:37.439> is<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.919> other<00:03:38.099> player<00:03:38.459> unless

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
prisoners is the other player unless

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.640 
prisoners is the other player unless
they<00:03:39.030> unless<00:03:39.449> they<00:03:39.629> do<00:03:39.689> something<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:40.139> reveal

themselves<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:42.290> creates<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.470> lot<00:03:43.680> of

stop him from escaping this game mode
the<00:04:03.689> issue<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.319> could<00:04:04.829> take<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> while

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
the issue is that it could take a while

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.520 
the issue is that it could take a while
to<00:04:05.669> do<00:04:05.849> especially<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.079> playing<00:04:07.379> with

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
to do especially if you playing with

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.959 
to do especially if you playing with
slowness<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.859> your<00:04:07.979> guard<00:04:08.310> because<00:04:08.489> sometimes

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
slowness on your guard because sometimes

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.179 
slowness on your guard because sometimes
these<00:04:09.120> plans<00:04:09.449> take<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.719> while<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:11.069> be

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
these plans take a while to to be

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.339 
these plans take a while to to be
established<00:04:11.459> but<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.329> really<00:04:12.629> pushes

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
established but that really pushes

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.559 
established but that really pushes
players<00:04:13.979> to<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.250> limit<00:04:14.549> as<00:04:14.669> to<00:04:14.819> how<00:04:14.849> secret

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
players to the limit as to how secret

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.439 
players to the limit as to how secret
and<00:04:15.719> how<00:04:15.870> much<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.469> hide<00:04:17.060> your<00:04:18.060> escape

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
and how much can you hide your escape

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.899 
and how much can you hide your escape
plan<00:04:18.690> from<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.989> guard<00:04:19.229> as<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> god<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:20.070> expect

plan from a guard as a god I I expect

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.730 
plan from a guard as a god I I expect
you<00:04:21.060> would<00:04:21.180> have<00:04:21.359> blocked<00:04:21.719> vision<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.590> won't

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
you would have blocked vision you won't

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.529 
you would have blocked vision you won't
have<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.949> same<00:04:23.190> vision<00:04:23.400> as<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.669> player<00:04:24.150> does

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
but you have to somehow work out

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.930 
but you have to somehow work out
who

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
who

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.910 
who
one<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.180> those<00:04:27.270> prisoners<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:27.990> there<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.470> an

one of those prisoners in there is an
actual<00:04:29.220> player<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.850> what<00:04:30.390> is<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.630> actual

escape plan this could be sort of

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.790 
escape plan this could be sort of
finding<00:04:33.570> clues<00:04:33.810> saying<00:04:34.140> okay<00:04:34.410> one<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.650> my

beat<00:04:42.810> up<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.200> God<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.860> who<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.610> how<00:04:44.910> how<00:04:45.510> can

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
beat up that God and who and how how can

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.400 
beat up that God and who and how how can
you<00:04:45.810> stop<00:04:46.050> them

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
you stop them

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.500 
you stop them
so<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:47.190> would<00:04:47.670> be<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:48.030> very<00:04:48.420> interesting

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
so this would be a very interesting

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.420 
so this would be a very interesting
gamer<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.590> there'd<00:04:49.770> be<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> lot<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.400> know

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
gamer but there'd be a lot of you know

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.980 
gamer but there'd be a lot of you know
catches<00:04:51.000> that<00:04:51.090> needs<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.330> be<00:04:51.390> sort<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.690> fixed

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
catches that needs to be sort of fixed

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.410 
catches that needs to be sort of fixed
for<00:04:52.200> it<00:04:52.370> but<00:04:53.370> pretty<00:04:53.550> much<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.940> could<00:04:54.240> be

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
for it but pretty much it could be

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.760 
for it but pretty much it could be
interesting<00:04:54.720> it<00:04:54.990> says<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.200> have<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.380> figure

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
interesting it says you have to figure

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.680 
interesting it says you have to figure
out<00:04:55.860> who<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.190> prisoner<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:56.760> well<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.390> puller

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
out who the prisoner is well that puller

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.160 
out who the prisoner is well that puller
has<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:58.140> avoid<00:04:58.590> being<00:04:58.950> detected<00:04:59.720> it<00:05:00.720> would<00:05:00.870> it

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
has to avoid being detected it would it

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.690 
has to avoid being detected it would it
would<00:05:01.260> make<00:05:01.440> it<00:05:01.560> like<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.710> true<00:05:01.800> escapist
