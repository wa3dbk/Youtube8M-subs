mildew<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> primary<00:00:47.820> reasons

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
mildew was one of the primary reasons

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
mildew was one of the primary reasons
that<00:00:48.840> hot<00:00:49.080> production<00:00:49.590> left<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> Northeast

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that hot production left the Northeast

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.299 
that hot production left the Northeast
back<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.330> the<00:00:51.449> eighteen<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.199> early<00:00:52.559> 1900s

back in the eighteen and early 1900s
downy<00:00:54.090> mildew<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.900> severe<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.309> there

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
downy mildew was so severe and there

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
downy mildew was so severe and there
were<00:00:56.610> very<00:00:57.330> few<00:00:57.840> ways<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> control<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.769> at<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
were very few ways to control it at that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
were very few ways to control it at that
time<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.120> essentially<00:01:00.540> drove

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
time that it essentially drove

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
time that it essentially drove
production<00:01:01.500> West<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:02.460> there<00:01:02.579> were<00:01:02.670> drier

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
weather which we had a lot of in the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.820

spring<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:12.000> areas<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.450> Vermont<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.440> once

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
spring in areas like Vermont so once

causing problems in in our new hop yards
what<00:01:22.740> we've<00:01:22.920> tried<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.550> this<00:01:23.850> year<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
what we've tried to do this year to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.980 
what we've tried to do this year to
control<00:01:24.690> downy<00:01:24.930> mildew<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.800> to<00:01:26.310> perform

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
control downy mildew is to perform

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
control downy mildew is to perform
mechanical<00:01:28.190> control<00:01:29.190> system<00:01:29.670> called

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
mechanical control system called

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.840 
mechanical control system called
crowning<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.830> crowning<00:01:31.830> is<00:01:32.130> essentially

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
crowning and crowning is essentially

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.719 
crowning and crowning is essentially
removing<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.930> top<00:01:34.320> portion<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> hop

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
removing the top portion of the hop

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.780 
removing the top portion of the hop
crown<00:01:36.180> before<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.590> plant<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.159> starts<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
crown before the plant really starts to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.780 
crown before the plant really starts to
grow<00:01:39.119> very<00:01:39.390> much<00:01:39.650> downy<00:01:40.650> mildew<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.490> an

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
grow very much downy mildew is an

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
grow very much downy mildew is an
obligate<00:01:42.299> parasite<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.110> therefore<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> needs

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
obligate parasite and therefore it needs

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.480 
obligate parasite and therefore it needs
living<00:01:45.090> plant<00:01:45.420> tissue<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.170> survive<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
living plant tissue to survive so the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.510 
living plant tissue to survive so the
downy<00:01:47.729> mildew<00:01:48.110> mycelium<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.070> fungal

mildew<00:02:00.229> mycelium<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.470> grow<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.860> those<00:02:02.009> buds

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
mildew mycelium will grow in those buds

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.120 
mildew mycelium will grow in those buds
when<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> buds<00:02:03.960> open<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.650> primary

early<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> season<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.850> if<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.810> crown<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
early in the season so if you crown the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.410 
early in the season so if you crown the
plant<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:16.890> cut<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.370> top<00:02:17.579> part<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> crown

off about a half inch of the crown then

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.100 
off about a half inch of the crown then
you'll<00:02:22.350> remove<00:02:22.769> some<00:02:23.700> if<00:02:24.030> not<00:02:24.299> hopefully<00:02:24.540> most

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
you'll remove some if not hopefully most

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
would say we we had good success we

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.270 
would say we we had good success we
don't<00:02:39.510> have<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> commercial<00:02:40.319> crown<00:02:40.830> early

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
don't have a commercial crown early

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.220 
don't have a commercial crown early
they<00:02:41.490> have<00:02:41.700> out<00:02:42.030> west<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.510> built<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.990> crown

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
they have out west so we built a crown

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.949 
they have out west so we built a crown
er<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.100> see<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> video<00:02:45.090> we

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
er and you can see that in the video we

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.100 
er and you can see that in the video we
came<00:02:46.230> through<00:02:46.680> about<00:02:47.040> two<00:02:47.700> weeks<00:02:47.970> ago<00:02:48.330> when

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
came through about two weeks ago when

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.290 
came through about two weeks ago when
the<00:02:49.440> plants<00:02:49.800> were<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.340> starting<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.910> show

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
the plants were just starting to show

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.080 
the plants were just starting to show
buds<00:02:51.630> we<00:02:52.500> probably<00:02:52.920> should<00:02:53.459> have<00:02:53.490> crowned<00:02:53.940> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
buds we probably should have crowned a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.170 
buds we probably should have crowned a
little<00:02:54.360> bit<00:02:54.510> earlier<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:56.130> that's<00:02:56.730> when<00:02:57.030> we

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
little bit earlier but that's when we

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.940 
little bit earlier but that's when we
had<00:02:57.360> time<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.750> do<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.020> we<00:02:58.290> came<00:02:58.500> out<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
had time to do it so we came out and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.729 
had time to do it so we came out and
crown<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.340> plants<00:02:59.730> we<00:03:00.239> cut<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.660> half<00:03:00.870> top

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
crown the plants we cut the half top

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.729 
crown the plants we cut the half top
half<00:03:02.040> into<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> crown<00:03:02.760> off<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:04.050> most<00:03:04.380> every

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
half into the crown off of most every

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.380 
half into the crown off of most every
plant<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.430> course<00:03:05.459> we<00:03:05.850> left<00:03:06.090> some

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
plant and of course we left some

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.650 
plant and of course we left some
controls<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.530> field<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:08.040> see<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.540> would

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
controls in the field to see if it would

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.130 
controls in the field to see if it would
stunt<00:03:10.020> growth<00:03:10.340> or<00:03:11.340> not<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.630> see<00:03:12.870> here

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
stunt growth or not you can see here

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.780 
stunt growth or not you can see here
this<00:03:13.260> was<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> plant<00:03:13.830> that<00:03:14.040> was<00:03:14.160> crowned<00:03:14.489> two

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
this was a plant that was crowned two

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.690 
this was a plant that was crowned two
weeks<00:03:15.000> ago<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.720> see<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.080> crown<00:03:16.610> where<00:03:17.610> it

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
weeks ago you can see the crown where it

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.720 
weeks ago you can see the crown where it
was<00:03:17.820> cut<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.989> can<00:03:19.170> also<00:03:19.350> see<00:03:19.830> where<00:03:20.459> new

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
was cut and you can also see where new

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.940 
was cut and you can also see where new
buds<00:03:21.060> are<00:03:21.360> pushing<00:03:21.630> out<00:03:21.930> from<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> crown<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
buds are pushing out from the crown and

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.000 
buds are pushing out from the crown and
starting<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.640> regrow<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:25.019> at<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.380> point<00:03:25.650> our

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
starting to regrow so at this point our

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.759 
starting to regrow so at this point our
assumption<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.819> crowning<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:28.350> obviously

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
assumption is that crowning it obviously

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.100 
assumption is that crowning it obviously
has<00:03:28.980> slowed<00:03:29.250> growth<00:03:29.580> but<00:03:30.209> it's<00:03:30.690> starting<00:03:30.959> to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
has slowed growth but it's starting to

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.990 
has slowed growth but it's starting to
regrow<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.830> hopefully<00:03:32.340> we<00:03:32.489> didn't<00:03:32.760> do<00:03:32.970> too

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
regrow so hopefully we didn't do too

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.680 
regrow so hopefully we didn't do too
much<00:03:33.480> damage<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.170> hopefully<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.190> removed<00:03:35.690> any

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
much damage and hopefully we removed any

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.750 
much damage and hopefully we removed any
of<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.959> downy<00:03:37.200> mildew<00:03:37.350> mycelium<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.580> top

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
of the downy mildew mycelium in the top

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.320 
of the downy mildew mycelium in the top
of<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.000> crown<00:03:39.920> next<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.580> crown<00:03:41.850> plant<00:03:42.180> we

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
of the crown next to the crown plant we

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.570 
of the crown next to the crown plant we
do<00:03:42.510> have<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.750> control<00:03:43.260> here<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.550> a

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
do have a control here and this is a

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.240 
do have a control here and this is a
plant<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.360> was<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:45.959> crowned<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:47.070> can

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
plant that was not crowned and you can

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.039 
plant that was not crowned and you can
see<00:03:47.430> it's<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.730> little<00:03:47.910> bit<00:03:48.060> further<00:03:48.480> ahead<00:03:48.690> in

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
see it's a little bit further ahead in

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.759 
see it's a little bit further ahead in
growth<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:50.040> don't<00:03:50.579> see<00:03:50.940> any<00:03:51.180> stunted<00:03:51.810> plants<00:03:52.079> at

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
growth I don't see any stunted plants at

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.560 
growth I don't see any stunted plants at
this<00:03:52.980> point<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.610> maybe<00:03:53.880> this<00:03:54.090> one<00:03:54.329> does<00:03:54.540> not

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
this point so maybe this one does not

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.370 
this point so maybe this one does not
have<00:03:55.160> downy<00:03:56.160> mildew<00:03:56.310> in<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.060> crown<00:03:57.299> but<00:03:58.110> we

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
have downy mildew in the crown but we

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.300 
have downy mildew in the crown but we
will<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:58.739> comparing<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.350> if<00:04:01.350> if<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:02.070> crown

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
will be comparing to see if if the crown

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.789 
will be comparing to see if if the crown
plant<00:04:02.640> does<00:04:03.570> indeed<00:04:03.959> have<00:04:04.170> less<00:04:04.410> downy<00:04:04.680> mildew

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
plant does indeed have less downy mildew

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:12.470 
plant does indeed have less downy mildew
and<00:04:05.430> also<00:04:06.120> if<00:04:06.329> there's<00:04:06.540> any<00:04:06.799> impact<00:04:07.799> on<00:04:08.010> yield
