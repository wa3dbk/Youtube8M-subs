has<00:02:59.000> been<00:02:59.630> detected<00:02:59.900> off<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.320> western<00:03:00.770> mix

has been detected off the western mix
Portland<00:03:01.520> coast<00:03:02.590> quite<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.620> number<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:03.950> times

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
Portland coast quite a number of times

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.250 
Portland coast quite a number of times
probably<00:03:04.580> somewhere<00:03:05.330> between<00:03:05.390> five<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:05.930> ten

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
probably somewhere between five and ten

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.430 
probably somewhere between five and ten
times<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:07.070> our<00:03:07.280> satellite<00:03:07.790> receivers<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:09.260> we

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
times on our satellite receivers so we

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960 
times on our satellite receivers so we
know<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.680> program<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.460> working<00:03:10.670> that

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
know that program is working that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.420 
know that program is working that
program<00:03:11.390> is<00:03:11.540> really<00:03:11.660> based<00:03:11.989> on<00:03:12.380> learning<00:03:13.160> more

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
program is really based on learning more

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.520 
program is really based on learning more
about<00:03:13.640> their<00:03:14.000> movements<00:03:14.390> behaviors<00:03:14.959> the

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
about their movements behaviors the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.440 
about their movements behaviors the
timing<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.130> their<00:03:16.310> movement<00:03:16.850> where<00:03:17.120> they<00:03:17.300> are

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
timing of their movement where they are

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.750 
timing of their movement where they are
particular<00:03:18.020> times<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.440> year<00:03:18.650> whether<00:03:19.489> they

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
particular times of year whether they

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.690 
particular times of year whether they
actually<00:03:20.480> frequent<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.590> for<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.280> short

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
actually frequent that for a short

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.190 
actually frequent that for a short
period<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.970> time<00:03:23.030> or<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.510> long<00:03:23.750> period<00:03:24.050> of<00:03:24.140> time

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
period of time or a long period of time

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.979 
period of time or a long period of time
so<00:03:25.160> obviously<00:03:25.850> that's<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.390> long<00:03:26.540> term<00:03:26.840> research

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
so obviously that's a long term research

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.400 
so obviously that's a long term research
research<00:03:27.860> projects<00:03:29.140> hopefully<00:03:30.140> they'll<00:03:30.260> give

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
research projects hopefully they'll give

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.630 
research projects hopefully they'll give
us<00:03:30.500> some<00:03:30.530> more<00:03:30.709> information<00:03:30.860> then<00:03:31.459> we'll

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
us some more information then we'll

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.510 
us some more information then we'll
understand<00:03:32.270> their<00:03:32.390> behavior<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.810> bit<00:03:32.989> better

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
understand their behavior a bit better

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.979 
understand their behavior a bit better
now<00:03:34.520> this<00:03:34.700> latest<00:03:34.880> incident<00:03:35.330> will<00:03:35.660> inevitably

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
now this latest incident will inevitably

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.020 
now this latest incident will inevitably
ignite<00:03:36.950> calls<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.400> some<00:03:37.580> quarters<00:03:38.000> for

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
ignite calls in some quarters for
