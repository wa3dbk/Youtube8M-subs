okay<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.159> let's<00:01:29.340> measure<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.880> results

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.050 

okay<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:53.390> here<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:53.929> go<00:01:54.670> all<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.729> would<00:01:56.030> say

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
that's exactly the same so there we have

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.679 
that's exactly the same so there we have
it<00:02:03.159> both<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.460> juicers<00:02:04.880> perform<00:02:05.299> very<00:02:05.539> low

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689
