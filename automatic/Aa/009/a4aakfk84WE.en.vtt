they is a oh five Jeep Liberty with an
overheating<00:00:05.670> problem<00:00:06.180> especially<00:00:06.540> when<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
overheating problem especially when the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.650 
overheating problem especially when the
air<00:00:07.170> condition<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.710> long<00:00:11.240> where's<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.420> Jeep

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
air condition is long where's the Jeep

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.960 
air condition is long where's the Jeep
has<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.230> code<00:00:16.250> could<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.310> something<00:00:17.850> wrong

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
has this code could be something wrong

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.810 
has this code could be something wrong
to<00:00:18.210> fan<00:00:18.480> uh<00:00:18.510> electrical<00:00:19.350> system

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.300 

so<00:00:25.420> again<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:25.780> car<00:00:25.990> overheats

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.119 

right<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.210> running<00:00:30.450> normal

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.250 

so<00:00:34.609> I'm<00:00:34.699> going<00:00:34.879> to<00:00:34.910> do<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.149> test<00:00:35.539> on<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.989> cooling

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
so I'm going to do a test on the cooling

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.790 
so I'm going to do a test on the cooling
fan<00:00:37.030> okay<00:00:38.030> this<00:00:38.239> is<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.690> relay<00:00:39.260> with<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.559> cover

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
fan okay this is a relay with the cover

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.770 
fan okay this is a relay with the cover
are<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:40.579> I'm<00:00:40.730> going<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.000> use<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.390> test<00:00:41.660> the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
are that I'm going to use the test the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.680 
are that I'm going to use the test the
cooling<00:00:42.140> thing

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.460 

right<00:00:50.260> now<00:00:50.440> it's<00:00:50.680> could<00:00:50.980> put<00:00:51.310> them<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:52.470> the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
right now it's could put them to the

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.119 
right now it's could put them to the
low-speed<00:00:54.040> side<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:57.579> with<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.760> low<00:00:58.000> speed<00:00:58.330> fan<00:00:58.720> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
low-speed side or with a low speed fan a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:14.060 
low-speed side or with a low speed fan a
operation<00:01:00.129> of<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.340> cooling<00:01:00.610> cane

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.990 

so<00:01:14.550> by<00:01:14.700> hiddenness

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.670 

so<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.149> and

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.090 

fans<00:01:25.310> should<00:01:25.580> operate

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:41.469 

nothing<00:01:31.909> go<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.360> thing

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.630 

and<00:01:42.020> now<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.170> get<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.530> test<00:01:42.860> real<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.250> hooked<00:01:43.490> up

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
and now I get the test real a hooked up

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.810 
and now I get the test real a hooked up
to<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:43.880> high<00:01:44.090> speed<00:01:44.450> side<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.759> for<00:01:46.759> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
to the high speed side of the for the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.580 
to the high speed side of the for the
high<00:01:46.969> speed<00:01:47.270> fan<00:01:50.020> I'm<00:01:51.020> going<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.229> flick<00:01:51.439> the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
high speed fan I'm going to flick the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.950 
high speed fan I'm going to flick the
switch

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:13.670 

here<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> fans<00:01:56.190> started

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:26.800 

switch

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:37.740 

like<00:02:27.810> this

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.309 

go<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.850> low-speed<00:02:39.850> side

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.569 

and<00:02:43.890> does<00:02:44.099> not<00:02:44.129> offer<00:02:46.010> now<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.129> going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> test

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
and does not offer now I'm going to test

00:02:47.579 --> 00:03:02.390 
and does not offer now I'm going to test
for<00:02:47.760> continuity<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.780> relay

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.210 

that's<00:03:03.200> low<00:03:04.200> speed

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.730 

I<00:03:10.280> speed<00:03:11.270> so<00:03:11.690> there's<00:03:11.900> power<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.350> both<00:03:12.500> the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
I speed so there's power to both the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.949 
I speed so there's power to both the
relay

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959
