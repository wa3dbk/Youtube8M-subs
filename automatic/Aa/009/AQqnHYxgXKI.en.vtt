things<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.780> should<00:04:07.900> be<00:04:07.930> doing<00:04:07.989> with<00:04:08.980> there's

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
things I should be doing with there's

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.380 
things I should be doing with there's
other<00:04:09.250> kinds<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.610> videos<00:04:09.819> of<00:04:09.970> like<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.209> make

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
other kinds of videos of like to make

other kinds of videos of like to make
and<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:11.140> figure<00:04:11.410> if<00:04:11.500> no<00:04:11.590> one's<00:04:11.800> watching<00:04:11.950> them

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220

and I figure if no one's watching them
that<00:04:12.819> kind<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.120> takes<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.420> pressure<00:04:14.200> off<00:04:14.380> way

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
that kind of takes the pressure off way

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.960 
that kind of takes the pressure off way
to<00:04:14.650> do<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.830> particular<00:04:15.160> thing<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.640> think<00:04:15.819> still
