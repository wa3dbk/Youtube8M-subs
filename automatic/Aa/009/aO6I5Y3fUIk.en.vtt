to do is change about twenty or thirty

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.139 
to do is change about twenty or thirty
percent<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.180> water<00:00:34.219> every<00:00:35.219> every<00:00:35.850> two

emphasize<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.360> enough<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
emphasize it enough you got to do it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.779 
emphasize it enough you got to do it
once<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.770> figure<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.829> how<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.430> it's

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
once you figure out how to do it it's

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.260 
once you figure out how to do it it's
done<00:00:50.820> rather<00:00:51.149> quickly<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.969> happens<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
done rather quickly and what happens is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.250 
done rather quickly and what happens is
there's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> couple<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> ways<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.989> do<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there's a couple of ways to do it you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
there's a couple of ways to do it you
could<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.680> could<00:00:58.829> suck<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.789> out<00:00:59.969> like

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
could you could suck this out like

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.670 
could you could suck this out like
you're<00:01:00.329> sucking<00:01:00.539> gasoline<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.260> get<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you're sucking gasoline and get get a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.359 
you're sucking gasoline and get get a
stream<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:03.710> however<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.100> good<00:01:05.339> at

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
stream going however if you get good at

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.899 
stream going however if you get good at
it<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> stream

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it what you can do is is get a stream

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
it what you can do is is get a stream
going<00:01:09.240> here<00:01:09.810> show<00:01:10.619> how<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:12.650> get

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
going here show how we do this here get

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.910 
going here show how we do this here get
that<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:15.049> there<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.770> the

that going and there there we have the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
that going and there there we have the
water<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:18.180> we're<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> do

is we're going to we're going to of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.880 
is we're going to we're going to of
course<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> suck<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> fish<00:01:22.740> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
course you don't want to suck a fish of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.440 
course you don't want to suck a fish of
course<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.460> we're<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> go<00:01:24.210> in

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
course what we're just going to go in

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.560 
course what we're just going to go in
the<00:01:25.020> corner<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> creates

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the corner and as you see it creates

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.920 
the corner and as you see it creates
turbulence<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.619> you're<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.220> suck<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
turbulence and you're going to suck that

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
turbulence and you're going to suck that
the<00:01:30.930> debris<00:01:31.970> out<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> go<00:01:34.680> into

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the debris out and it's going to go into

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
the debris out and it's going to go into
your<00:01:34.979> bucket<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.930> now<00:01:38.750> believe<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:39.990> not

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
your bucket here now believe it or not

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.109 
your bucket here now believe it or not
you<00:01:40.380> don't<00:01:40.650> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.979> get<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.610> dirt<00:01:41.820> up

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you don't want to get all the dirt up

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.319 
you don't want to get all the dirt up
that<00:01:43.049> sounds<00:01:43.560> sounds<00:01:44.340> odd<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.000> don't

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that sounds sounds odd but you don't

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
that sounds sounds odd but you don't
want<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> get<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> dirt<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.409> because<00:01:46.770> that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
want to get all the dirt up because that

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.109 
want to get all the dirt up because that
dirt<00:01:48.500> affords<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.710> biological<00:01:50.640> filtration

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
dirt affords some biological filtration

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.870 
dirt affords some biological filtration
so<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:52.020> want<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.290> clean<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.700> dirt

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
so you don't want to clean all the dirt

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.630 
so you don't want to clean all the dirt
up<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.270> only<00:01:54.450> go<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.930> halfway<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:56.189> leave

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
up so only go about halfway down leave

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.520 
up so only go about halfway down leave
leave<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.299> dirt<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.049> won't<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.439> able

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
leave that dirt that you won't be able

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.539 
leave that dirt that you won't be able
to<00:01:58.740> see<00:01:59.070> anyway<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> gravel<00:02:01.649> where<00:02:02.280> you

to see anyway in the gravel where you
can't<00:02:02.909> see<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:04.619> yet<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:06.530> provides<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
can't see it and yet it provides the

glass

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
glass
you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.830> get<00:02:14.010> all<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.310> dirt<00:02:14.610> out<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:16.020> that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
you can get all that dirt out so that
