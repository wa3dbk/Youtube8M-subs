00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.600 

now<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.320> rock<00:05:46.650> on<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:46.980> website<00:05:47.310> they<00:05:47.430> say

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
now the rock on the website they say

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.960

that<00:05:47.790> it's<00:05:47.970> a<00:05:48.060> matte<00:05:48.240> formula<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:49.320> I<00:05:50.250> will<00:05:50.760> say

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
that it's a matte formula and I will say

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.760
