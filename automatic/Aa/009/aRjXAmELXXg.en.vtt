do<00:00:32.950> this<00:00:33.130> lesson<00:00:33.489> in<00:00:33.579> three<00:00:33.820> sections<00:00:34.120> because

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
do this lesson in three sections because

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.760 
do this lesson in three sections because
there's<00:00:34.750> three<00:00:35.110> different<00:00:35.230> progressions

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
there's three different progressions

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.540 
there's three different progressions
you're<00:00:36.070> gonna<00:00:36.190> have<00:00:36.400> to<00:00:36.520> learn<00:00:37.079> here's<00:00:38.079> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
you're gonna have to learn here's the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:01:28.460 
you're gonna have to learn here's the
speed

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.210 

here's<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.620> next<00:01:29.860> progression<00:01:30.010> of<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.490> speed

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.770 

slow<00:01:39.220> down<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.880> I'm<00:01:40.090> gonna<00:01:40.210> name<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.510> chords

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
slow down and I'm gonna name the chords

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:50.250 
slow down and I'm gonna name the chords
G<00:01:41.650> major<00:01:48.720> here's<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.870> third<00:01:50.080> progression

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
G major here's the third progression

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.900 
G major here's the third progression
which<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.130> guess<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.400> could<00:01:51.550> say<00:01:51.700> it's<00:01:51.850> the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
which I guess you could say it's the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.240 
which I guess you could say it's the
course<00:01:52.240> where<00:01:52.840> he<00:01:52.930> says<00:01:53.170> uh<00:01:53.200> keep<00:01:53.560> on<00:01:53.770> skank

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
course where he says uh keep on skank

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.970 
course where he says uh keep on skank
and<00:01:54.490> Ronnie<00:01:54.930> starts<00:01:55.930> on<00:01:56.050> an<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.260> major<00:01:56.470> here<00:01:56.890> it

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
and Ronnie starts on an a major here it

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.430 
and Ronnie starts on an a major here it
is<00:01:57.070> up<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.250> speed
