read the things that it promises here on
the<00:01:30.060> website<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.990> says<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.439> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the website so it says this is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
the website so it says this is
incredibly<00:01:31.950> rich<00:01:32.189> stuff<00:01:32.430> three<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.759> one

incredibly rich stuff three and one

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.109 
incredibly rich stuff three and one

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
represents a new approach to foundation

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.830 
represents a new approach to foundation
powered<00:01:36.119> by<00:01:36.270> Japanese<00:01:36.750> technology<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.920> um

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
powered by Japanese technology it's um

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.819 
powered by Japanese technology it's um
which<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.200> neat<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.500> says<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
which is really neat it says here that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
which is really neat it says here that
it's<00:01:41.040> decided<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.430> both<00:01:41.579> men<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.970> women<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it's decided for both men and women and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.630 
it's decided for both men and women and
I<00:01:42.780> haven't<00:01:43.110> seen<00:01:43.380> many<00:01:43.860> websites<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.490> that

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
I haven't seen many websites do that

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.539 
I haven't seen many websites do that
even<00:01:44.790> though<00:01:44.880> anyone<00:01:45.810> wears<00:01:46.020> foundation<00:01:46.590> it's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
even though anyone wears foundation it's

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880 
even though anyone wears foundation it's
really<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.329> know<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.590> fact<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
really I don't know I like the fact that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.380

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it probably doesn't have the SPF I'm

it probably doesn't have the SPF I'm
gonna<00:02:06.240> trust<00:02:06.420> them<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.500> don't

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
gonna trust them on that but I don't

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.279 
gonna trust them on that but I don't
know<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.220> tinted<00:02:08.580> moisturizer<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.360> me<00:02:09.539> suggests

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
know a tinted moisturizer to me suggests

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.980 
know a tinted moisturizer to me suggests
like<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> sheer<00:02:11.180> coverage<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
like a sheer coverage and this is a

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.900 
like a sheer coverage and this is a
solid<00:02:13.320> medium<00:02:13.680> coverage<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> me<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:14.880> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
solid medium coverage so to me it's a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.510 
solid medium coverage so to me it's a
little<00:02:15.060> more<00:02:15.300> than<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.750> moisturizer<00:02:16.520> but

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
little more than to do moisturizer but

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.860 
little more than to do moisturizer but
it<00:02:17.640> says<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:17.940> an<00:02:18.000> ideal<00:02:18.300> moisturizer

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
it says it's an ideal moisturizer

it says it's an ideal moisturizer
sunscreen<00:02:19.260> foundation<00:02:20.250> again<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.270> would<00:02:21.540> say

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
sunscreen foundation again I would say

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.270 
sunscreen foundation again I would say
that<00:02:21.810> my<00:02:21.900> skin<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.170> pretty<00:02:22.320> moisturized<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
that my skin is pretty moisturized and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.040 
that my skin is pretty moisturized and
it<00:02:23.580> works<00:02:23.760> as<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> foundation<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.690> I'm<00:02:24.840> gonna

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
it works as a foundation so I'm gonna

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.700 
it works as a foundation so I'm gonna
give<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.770> those<00:02:26.070> two<00:02:26.130> claims<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.620> that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
give it those two claims it's just that

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.380 
give it those two claims it's just that
it<00:02:28.800> uses<00:02:29.040> our<00:02:29.130> evolutionary<00:02:29.670> context<00:02:30.210> of

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it uses our evolutionary context of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.660 
it uses our evolutionary context of
botanicals<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.220> fights<00:02:32.460> free<00:02:32.640> radicals

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
botanicals the fights free radicals

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.940 
botanicals the fights free radicals
which<00:02:33.660> again<00:02:34.080> those<00:02:34.410> are<00:02:34.560> anti-aging

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
which again those are anti-aging

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.800 
which again those are anti-aging
benefits<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.550> can't<00:02:35.760> speak<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.180> those<00:02:36.300> based<00:02:36.630> on

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
benefits I can't speak to those based on

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.470

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
strip and it didn't melt off so it does

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.130
