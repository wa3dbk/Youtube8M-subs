00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.449 

the<00:00:14.230> big<00:00:14.379> insight<00:00:14.709> this<00:00:14.889> season<00:00:15.250> on<00:00:15.339> the

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
the big insight this season on the

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.960 
the big insight this season on the
mercurial<00:00:15.820> vapor<00:00:15.969> 8<00:00:16.270> is<00:00:16.449> really<00:00:16.810> around<00:00:17.169> speed

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
mercurial vapor 8 is really around speed

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.090 
mercurial vapor 8 is really around speed
moving<00:00:18.970> from<00:00:19.210> speed<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:20.680> explosive<00:00:21.279> speed

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.060 

so<00:00:25.000> for<00:00:25.150> those<00:00:25.240> fast<00:00:25.570> players<00:00:25.870> have<00:00:26.320> an<00:00:26.590> extra

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
so for those fast players have an extra

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.950 
so for those fast players have an extra
edge<00:00:27.250> that<00:00:27.280> explosiveness<00:00:28.210> is<00:00:28.570> really<00:00:28.810> going

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
edge that explosiveness is really going

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.240 
edge that explosiveness is really going
to<00:00:29.020> be<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.290> key<00:00:29.470> to<00:00:29.500> separate<00:00:30.040> them<00:00:30.220> from

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
to be the key to separate them from

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.620 
to be the key to separate them from
their<00:00:30.550> opponents<00:00:31.060> during<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.420> game<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:37.540> of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
their opponents during the game one of

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.760 
their opponents during the game one of
the<00:00:37.690> areas<00:00:37.720> are<00:00:37.930> going<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.110> see<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.530> biggest

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
the areas are going to see the biggest

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.830 
the areas are going to see the biggest
difference<00:00:39.040> is<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.700> traction<00:00:40.060> system<00:00:40.239> and

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
difference is the traction system and

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.000 
difference is the traction system and
probably<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.140> most<00:00:41.260> noticeable<00:00:41.650> when<00:00:41.890> you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
probably the most noticeable when you

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.410 
probably the most noticeable when you
first<00:00:42.190> look<00:00:42.370> at<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.489> buddh<00:00:42.700> because<00:00:43.330> the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
first look at the buddh because the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.790 
first look at the buddh because the
studs<00:00:43.690> are<00:00:43.840> gone<00:00:43.989> from<00:00:44.170> particularly<00:00:44.650> in<00:00:44.739> the

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
studs are gone from particularly in the

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.640 
studs are gone from particularly in the
heel<00:00:45.010> two<00:00:45.280> steps<00:00:45.580> to<00:00:45.730> one<00:00:46.059> step<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:47.290> simple

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
heel two steps to one step the simple

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.869 
heel two steps to one step the simple
reason<00:00:47.800> why<00:00:48.070> we've<00:00:48.250> done<00:00:48.430> that<00:00:48.580> is

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
reason why we've done that is

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.119 
reason why we've done that is
penetration<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:50.170> be<00:00:50.260> an<00:00:50.320> explosive<00:00:50.920> player

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
penetration to be an explosive player

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.070 
penetration to be an explosive player
need<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.610> be<00:00:51.670> fast<00:00:52.000> in<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.449> fast<00:00:52.720> out<00:00:52.930> the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
need to be fast in and fast out the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.080 
need to be fast in and fast out the
ground<00:00:53.260> if<00:00:53.830> you<00:00:53.949> look<00:00:54.100> at<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.309> front<00:00:54.670> edge<00:00:54.850> and

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
ground if you look at the front edge and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.310 
ground if you look at the front edge and
the<00:00:55.180> back<00:00:55.360> edge<00:00:55.600> does<00:00:55.870> what<00:00:56.020> we<00:00:56.140> call

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
the back edge does what we call

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.310 
the back edge does what we call
buttresses<00:00:56.949> they<00:00:57.610> provided<00:00:58.180> stability<00:00:58.330> so

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
buttresses they provided stability so

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.840 
buttresses they provided stability so
you<00:00:59.409> really<00:00:59.620> get<00:00:59.710> two<00:00:59.949> things<00:01:00.159> in<00:01:00.370> one<00:01:00.400> stud

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
you really get two things in one stud

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.630 
you really get two things in one stud
faster<00:01:01.720> than<00:01:01.870> out<00:01:02.050> fast<00:01:02.830> ability<00:01:03.339> when

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
faster than out fast ability when

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.990 
faster than out fast ability when
cutting<00:01:03.909> left<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.390> right<00:01:05.580> 20<00:01:06.580> otherwise<00:01:06.790> you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
cutting left and right 20 otherwise you

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.219 
cutting left and right 20 otherwise you
might<00:01:07.120> notice<00:01:07.360> if<00:01:07.720> you're<00:01:07.870> familiar<00:01:07.990> with

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
might notice if you're familiar with

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.560 
might notice if you're familiar with
mercurial<00:01:08.680> t4<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.340> central<00:01:09.700> stud<00:01:10.000> we

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
mercurial t4 is the central stud we

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.090 
mercurial t4 is the central stud we
truly<00:01:10.780> isn't<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.229> central<00:01:11.620> point<00:01:11.830> in<00:01:12.040> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
truly isn't a central point in the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.590 
truly isn't a central point in the
highest<00:01:12.400> pressure<00:01:12.610> area<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.120> foot<00:01:13.330> a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
highest pressure area of the foot a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.450 
highest pressure area of the foot a
reason<00:01:14.290> why<00:01:14.350> we<00:01:14.440> put<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:14.710> n<00:01:14.830> is<00:01:14.860> really<00:01:15.310> that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
reason why we put that n is really that

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.130 
reason why we put that n is really that
a<00:01:15.670> higher<00:01:15.909> pressure<00:01:16.180> point<00:01:16.690> really<00:01:16.960> means

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
a higher pressure point really means

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.160 
a higher pressure point really means
that's<00:01:17.380> why<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.590> need<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.830> most<00:01:18.010> traction<00:01:19.170> we

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
that's why you need the most traction we

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that's why you need the most traction we
look<00:01:20.320> at<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.470> silhouette<00:01:20.680> from<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.979> side

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
look at the silhouette from the side

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.170 
look at the silhouette from the side
you're<00:01:21.490> going<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.670> notice<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:22.000> big<00:01:22.120> difference

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
you're going to notice a big difference

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.300 
you're going to notice a big difference
from<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.630> last<00:01:22.840> mercurial<00:01:23.229> vapor<00:01:23.409> aid<00:01:23.710> the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
from the last mercurial vapor aid the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.520 
from the last mercurial vapor aid the
tower<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.729> lot<00:01:24.850> lower<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.990> arch<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.290> lot

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
tower is a lot lower the arch is lot

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.679 
tower is a lot lower the arch is lot
more<00:01:26.710> sculpted<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:27.610> even<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.909> plate<00:01:28.119> itself<00:01:28.479> is

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
more sculpted and even a plate itself is

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.450 
more sculpted and even a plate itself is
a<00:01:28.719> lot<00:01:28.840> more<00:01:28.990> sculpted<00:01:29.439> around<00:01:29.619> it<00:01:29.740> arch<00:01:29.979> on

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
a lot more sculpted around it arch on

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.459 
a lot more sculpted around it arch on
top<00:01:30.969> of<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.240> we've<00:01:31.479> actually<00:01:31.630> added<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:32.229> very

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
top of that we've actually added a very

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.529 
top of that we've actually added a very
soft<00:01:32.799> matte<00:01:33.189> finish<00:01:33.549> which<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.329> hand

soft matte finish which to the hand
touch<00:01:34.689> is<00:01:34.869> very<00:01:35.140> very<00:01:35.289> soft<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:36.189> also<00:01:36.369> allows

touch is very very soft but also allows

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.510 
touch is very very soft but also allows
you<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:37.000> have<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.119> better<00:01:37.360> touch<00:01:37.689> on<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.930> ball

vapor aid has a brand new color to
launch<00:01:44.380> with<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.890> colors<00:01:45.609> called<00:01:45.789> mango<00:01:46.180> and

launch with the colors called mango and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:47.599 
launch with the colors called mango and
this<00:01:46.450> takes<00:01:46.659> color<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:47.109> a<00:01:47.140> new<00:01:47.320> dimension

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
this takes color to a new dimension

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.950 
this takes color to a new dimension
within<00:01:48.609> birth<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:49.149> explosive<00:01:49.659> speed<00:01:49.810> we

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
within birth of explosive speed we

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.719 
within birth of explosive speed we
wanted<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.289> color<00:01:50.530> represented<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.369> newness
