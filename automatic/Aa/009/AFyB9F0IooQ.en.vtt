00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
it's not really a problem for me because

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.850 
it's not really a problem for me because
I<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:26.970> cut<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.810> little<00:02:27.840> shorter<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.680> then

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
I just cut it a little shorter and then

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.900 
I just cut it a little shorter and then
I<00:02:29.510> um<00:02:30.799> make<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.920> go<00:02:32.069> through<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.400> hole<00:02:32.610> and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
I um make you go through the hole and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.199 
I um make you go through the hole and
then<00:02:33.349> tie<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.379> string<00:02:34.830> around<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.340> really<00:02:36.000> tight

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
then tie a string around it really tight

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.449 
then tie a string around it really tight
and<00:02:36.830> then<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:39.480> usually<00:02:40.019> stays<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:41.430> that

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
and then it usually stays like that

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.589 
and then it usually stays like that
pretty<00:02:42.890> for<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.010> pretty<00:02:44.190> long<00:02:44.430> time<00:02:44.599> I'm
