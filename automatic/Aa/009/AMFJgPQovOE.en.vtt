sequence and to get started you want to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.160 
sequence and to get started you want to
overlap<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> first<00:00:56.520> three<00:00:56.879> boxes<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:58.020> the

next three boxes so you just fold that
over<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:02.760> insert<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.300> hook<00:01:03.600> from

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
over here and you insert your hook from

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.530 
over here and you insert your hook from
through<00:01:05.700> both<00:01:06.060> sets<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.260> loops<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:08.010> through<00:01:08.760> 1d

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
through both sets of loops or through 1d

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.530 
through both sets of loops or through 1d
set<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.960> loops<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:11.010> I've<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:12.299> from

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
set of loops so I've got I'm going from

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.539 
set of loops so I've got I'm going from
front<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> back<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.650> I'm<00:01:13.860> lining<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
front to back and I'm lining up the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.510 
front to back and I'm lining up the
boxes<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.920> like<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:18.530> okay<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.770> then

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
boxes just like this okay and then

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.200 
boxes just like this okay and then

continue in the pattern now so I'm going
to<00:01:42.750> skip<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.399> box<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.790> pick<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> next<00:01:45.689> box

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
to skip a box and pick up the next box

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.780 
to skip a box and pick up the next box
skip<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> next<00:01:47.460> box<00:01:47.820> pick<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> next<00:01:49.049> box

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
skip pick up skip pick up and skip pick

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.910 
skip pick up skip pick up and skip pick
up<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.990> pattern<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> be

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
up now the pattern is going to be

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
up now the pattern is going to be
picking<00:01:59.189> up<00:01:59.430> eight<00:01:59.670> loops<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
picking up eight loops but in the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.399 
picking up eight loops but in the
beginning<00:02:01.909> these<00:02:02.909> double<00:02:03.750> loops<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:04.200> count

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
beginning these double loops will count

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.160 
beginning these double loops will count
as<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.790> doesn't<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.360> exact<00:02:06.899> as

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
as one so it doesn't have to be exact as

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.230 
as one so it doesn't have to be exact as
long<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
long as you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.390 
long as you
have<00:02:08.660> about<00:02:09.170> eight<00:02:09.500> there<00:02:09.920> in<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.280> beginning

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
have about eight there in the beginning

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.960 
have about eight there in the beginning
so<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.900> very<00:02:12.140> last<00:02:12.470> loop<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.070> leave<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
so the very last loop you leave in the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.420 
so the very last loop you leave in the
head<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.360> your<00:02:14.510> hook<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:16.070> grab

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
head of your hook like that and you grab

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.210 
head of your hook like that and you grab
the<00:02:16.970> rest<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.510> loops<00:02:17.750> with<00:02:18.110> your<00:02:18.860> with

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
the rest of the loops with your with

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.430 
the rest of the loops with your with
this<00:02:19.430> finger<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.000> your<00:02:20.060> thumb<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:21.200> turn

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
this finger and your thumb and you turn

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.020 
this finger and your thumb and you turn
the<00:02:21.650> head<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.100> hook<00:02:22.280> down<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:24.260> pull

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
these over like this and if I were

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.059 
these over like this and if I were
continuing<00:05:34.449> on<00:05:34.599> at<00:05:34.900> this<00:05:35.050> point<00:05:35.319> and<00:05:35.650> if<00:05:35.889> I'm

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
continuing on at this point and if I'm

continuing on at this point and if I'm
working<00:05:36.430> with<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.699> stitch<00:05:36.940> markers<00:05:37.389> i<00:05:37.539> would

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
working with the stitch markers i would

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.279 
working with the stitch markers i would
just<00:05:37.840> take<00:05:38.110> this<00:05:38.289> one<00:05:38.349> out<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.990> then<00:05:40.990> put<00:05:41.259> that

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
just take this one out and then put that

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.600 
just take this one out and then put that
there<00:05:43.319> so<00:05:44.319> that's<00:05:44.620> not<00:05:44.830> going<00:05:45.039> anywhere<00:05:45.400> if<00:05:45.520> I

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
there so that's not going anywhere if I

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.790 
there so that's not going anywhere if I
drop<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:46.090> or<00:05:46.210> if<00:05:46.300> I<00:05:46.360> need<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:46.599> set<00:05:46.840> it<00:05:46.960> down<00:05:47.110> so

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800
