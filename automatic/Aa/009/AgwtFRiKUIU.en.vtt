00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello friends with you car your 74 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.710
 today we look at the next 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.559
 modification for the game spintires it came out 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.470
 yesterday it is ford f 200 version first from 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.210
 given the mod of the case and still there with him alone 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.109
 man we have seen none 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.970
 modification about pickups because 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.650
 they deal with me 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.109
 the impression that they are engaged in some 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.250
 pickups and no longer something 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.940
 that is , I do not remember them exactly now 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.600
 lie I will not say which of them but they 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.239
 Sit there and actually stamp here 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.200
 pickup pickup and quite interesting and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.690
 quite well done and that is well 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.920
 in some here bends look through 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.320
 all the same polygons but naturally very 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 many polygons goes to the roof on the hood 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.820
 that is, on the places where you need 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.500
 good roundness okay yes good 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 roundness here is the texture correctly 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 very competently from this mod thing then 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:22.259
 i'm saying no here is not carp so 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:28.049
 light light work did not understand but yet there 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.900
 cant that is to him at a distance well then 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.049
 there is it his cant naturally i think 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.540
 that he will correct this version 1 as he 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 then approved, but I think that the second 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.950
 versions will stick in the trunk will 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.149
 put as in his previous version 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.240
 some repair glasses and top will 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.390
 stand arc that will keep the headlights 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.439
 that is, lighting on such because 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.119
 cars used to go hunt i don't 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.110
 I know who is not there in the desert hunt 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.039
 but they hunt them 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.039
 Okay, in general, that he put him 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.039
 wheels 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:31.959
 this time the disk probably changed mine 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:33.910
 videos are watching now 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.410
 disk and taboo are varied this can not 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.959
 to please 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.830
 let me go on these pipe rolled 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.459
 little by little 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.910
 he is in principle not so say not very much 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.010
 fast and goes very quiet 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.840
 if you turn on better but we are even quieter 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:56.980
 let's go in principle, of course now 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.280
 we are driving a model machine from him 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.739
 You can search a lot, that is, I 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.019
 Now the authors guys do not specify mods 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.569
 whip because i don't see any 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.110
 point to indicate the authors of the mod because 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.290
 we have 99 percent and nine tenths 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.260
 then we have envelopes I will not do anything 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.290
 argue about this mod 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.120
 that is, I do not know know I do not know 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.739
 tell where it came from but animation 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.450
 he has very good pendants we 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.430
 see that is, the thyristors are very cool 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.350
 swing shock absorbers work well behind 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.359
 I think it makes no sense to watch 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.700
 because this is the same brain only 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.390
 reversed along with 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.900
 springs 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.440
 and he is not cool do not turn the wheels then 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.900
 there is no driving spin what else 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.030
 You can say in this fashion what is not 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.010
 cameras in the cockpit this is a huge minus i'm not 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.019
 I know on what bolt the camera is on 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:02.709
 the roof that is, I don't know, I don't understand 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.200
 just that who can understand me 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.500
 explain in the cut 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.769
 or Verka why you need a camera 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.680
 for example from the roof or from the hood that is, I 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.930
 never understood why 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.959
 do and understand where to make a camera from 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.440
 third person like here and make a camera 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.270
 in the cabin that is but everyone else here in 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.490
 nfs including yes there are cameras from the hood 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.090
 still some cameras to Tomsk sweat with 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.090
 bumper 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.440
 by the way the differential four-wheel drive we 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.600
 not included guys now I rotate the wheel 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:52.600
 back and forth snorkel no natural we 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:55.780
 we take damage but by the way damage and I would not 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.650
 said he was so big 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.550
 huge we have blows let's turn on 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.970
 all about her first pump 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.669
 cons huge for a huge cross 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.950
 just monstrous passability that is 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:17.169
 you yourself have all seen no problems 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.000
 he was not passable but what else 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.860
 can be said for this model I think that 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.770
 nothing that is something like this 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.030
 the model is not clear for what if there is 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:35.039
 UAZ on to the bolt here is this model but it 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:38.950
 it is not up to me that the model is doing business 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:43.479
 or who they were doing here people do 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:46.240
 such modifications mean we will 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:50.760
 consider them means we will 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.300
 repelled from this photo with you was 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:57.000
 Karabash 74 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.039
 subscribe guys to public in to 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.590
 necessarily because we all have questions 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.770
 decide there I told you a hundred times already what 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.370
 all non-video comments 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.950
 all comments will be erased I read 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:16.389
 all that is not relevant to this video 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:19.660
 I wash safely some questions 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:25.000
 if you have to me personally you can 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:30.580

 group cap eat and chat with me in 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.110
 in the end I am always happy to talk with 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.340
 by people 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:42.070

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:46.380
