 and the world championship as you said time 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:10.110
 little and here are yourselves what kind of bar are you in 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.530
 Generally put when it is still in 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.530
 Russia 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.470
 shame will not be later and 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:38.640
 but other bread plans just exist 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:40.590
 will not be able to ask these questions all the same 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.390
 how much was thought worth meeting 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.149
 I thought for a long time because I was very 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.300
 responsibly where what situation 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.250
 comes across i understand 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:03.800
 if we are victims 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:05.990
 concerns the press together get meaning 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.720
 No, but then immediately the question is how much you 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.780
 You will be open because life is important , 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:24.550
 trying to be open actually if 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:30.320
 I did not communicate when writing written 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:33.410
 contrive dong giving gives it a little and one 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.539
 line pulled out of meaning therefore 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.789
 willing to communicate is actually better 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:43.330
