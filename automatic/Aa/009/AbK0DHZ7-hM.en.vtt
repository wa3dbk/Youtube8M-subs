00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
really know why I mean I guess it's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.110 
really know why I mean I guess it's
easy<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.740> build<00:02:13.890> sorta<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.790> honestly

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
easy to build sorta but I honestly

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.330 
easy to build sorta but I honestly
prefer<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.750> bobbing<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:16.320> on<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.220> one

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
back and forth a little bit the screen

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.180 
back and forth a little bit the screen
kind<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.780> moves<00:02:27.930> back<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.380> forth<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.920> tiny

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
kind of moves back and forth it's a tiny

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.830 
kind of moves back and forth it's a tiny
bit<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.550> know<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:29.850> see<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.030> block<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.510> my

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
bit you know you can see the block in my

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.930 
bit you know you can see the block in my
hand<00:02:31.140> especially<00:02:31.470> brings<00:02:32.400> out<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.610> whole

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
hand especially brings out that whole

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.270 
hand especially brings out that whole
bobbing<00:02:33.330> thing<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.590> said<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.770> prefer

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
bobbing thing so I like I said I prefer

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.760 
bobbing thing so I like I said I prefer
honestly<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.910> do<00:02:36.060> I'm<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.930> creative<00:02:37.350> mode<00:02:37.380> it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
honestly I do I'm in creative mode it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.230 
honestly I do I'm in creative mode it
might<00:02:38.100> be<00:02:38.280> slightly<00:02:38.520> easier<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.970> other<00:02:39.060> way

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
might be slightly easier the other way

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.210 
might be slightly easier the other way
but<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.990> still<00:02:40.380> would<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.830> then<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.070> just

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
but I still would have it then I just

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.800 
but I still would have it then I just
think<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.520> weird<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.880> feels<00:02:42.180> weird<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> me<00:02:42.690> be

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
think it's weird it feels weird to me be

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.720 
think it's weird it feels weird to me be
walking<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:43.740> feel<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.070> I'm<00:02:44.190> gliding<00:02:44.670> you

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
walking but feel like I'm gliding you

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.040 
walking but feel like I'm gliding you
know<00:02:44.850> right<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.180> when<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.420> walk<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.780> feel

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
know right now when you walk you feel

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.480 
know right now when you walk you feel
like<00:02:46.230> you're<00:02:46.440> walking<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> ground<00:02:47.250> so

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
like you're walking on the ground so

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.220 
like you're walking on the ground so
anyway<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.720> preference<00:02:48.930> thing

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
anyway it's just a preference thing

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.900 
anyway it's just a preference thing
though<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.650> guys<00:02:49.770> like<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.160> then<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.760> could

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
though you guys like that then you could

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.460 
though you guys like that then you could
turn<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.180> off<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.540> yourself<00:02:52.230> glide

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
turn it off and have yourself glide

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.110 
turn it off and have yourself glide
around<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.890> ghost<00:02:53.100> if<00:02:53.850> that's<00:02:54.030> what

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
around like a ghost if that's what

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.500 
around like a ghost if that's what
you're<00:02:54.240> into<00:02:54.330> now<00:02:55.250> fixed<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.430> mob<00:02:57.000> effects<00:02:57.270> not

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
you're into now fixed a mob effects not

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.199 
you're into now fixed a mob effects not
being<00:02:57.810> removed<00:02:58.110> after<00:02:58.380> death<00:02:59.190> fixed<00:02:59.820> crashes

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
being removed after death fixed crashes

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.400 
being removed after death fixed crashes
with<00:03:00.360> skins<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.870> guess<00:03:01.050> people<00:03:01.080> were

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
with skins I guess people were

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.840 
with skins I guess people were
experiencing<00:03:01.860> some<00:03:02.010> issues<00:03:02.100> with<00:03:02.310> those<00:03:02.610> I

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
experiencing some issues with those I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.850 
experiencing some issues with those I
personally<00:03:03.390> did<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.170> played<00:03:04.410> around<00:03:04.500> skins

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
personally did not I played around skins

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.410 
personally did not I played around skins
a<00:03:04.950> bit<00:03:05.160> didn't<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.670> any<00:03:05.850> issues<00:03:06.209> but

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
a bit didn't have any issues but

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.790 
a bit didn't have any issues but
apparently<00:03:06.870> some<00:03:07.020> people<00:03:07.050> did<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.650> good

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
apparently some people did so it's good

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.430 
apparently some people did so it's good
to<00:03:07.890> know<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.520> now<00:03:08.640> fixed<00:03:09.060> fish<00:03:09.570> hook<00:03:09.780> now<00:03:09.990> d

in the game fix arrow being picked up by
player<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.620> mid-air<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.670> those<00:03:18.180> are<00:03:18.300> kind<00:03:18.330> of

interesting bugs with the arrows I guess

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.560 
interesting bugs with the arrows I guess

still working on it right now but at

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.120 
still working on it right now but at
it's<00:04:03.060> closer<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.870> what<00:04:04.500> they<00:04:04.650> actually<00:04:04.890> want

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130
