00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.640
 Diving 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.530
 many wonder why I was 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.710
 with my guitarist at home 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.229
 writing songs and then I 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.530
 I wanted to look for a name that was 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.440
 that had agreement with what was my 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.810
 mom my classic genre then the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:43.149
 because, as I am a fan of the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.149

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.149
 England 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.520
 well our lyrics are always 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.250
 inspired 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:28.010
 the everyday test they go around 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:31.040
 of the person the subject 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.689
