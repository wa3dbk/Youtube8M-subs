 Kamakura neglected Good morning Good morning for you, Chuo 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:21.510
 In that 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.039
 It 's been so long for me to take a video 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.710

 It is also that first, because now Kedomo I'm gone matches at lest age appear to Myosai 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.260
 If it is a normal search to discover Kyosai 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.989
 Quite easily 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.989
 that the end portal can not be found 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:57.940
 Dig all after that, leaving Well I artifacts is the Toka Well such that stone year'm there 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:03.640
 In other words , thinking about exposing the fortress 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:11.700
 It Hitakara not another another No, that in you is but a refreshing end border has been the search 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:14.250
 Well, this is the opposite of stone bricks, destroying artifacts more and more 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.550
 So to speak, growing up 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:24.750
 It is a fortress that began searching for the end port to avoid getting lost 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.580
 By the way, space Well this is painted mosquitoes vacant lot this fatigue 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.900

 Well luxury or rather the strengthening strengthening of Enchantment nude in Hakobidashi all from here towards the library 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.460
 But 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.800
 I used to make an enchantment 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.159
 so 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.020
 Finally 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:50.780

 Yes, it is the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.460

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.920

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.860
 It's around here I say break the volume and say break and say 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.370

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.810
 Where this wall was broken 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.580

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.650
 It is a yes boater that silver fish does not come out 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:48.860
 Finally I was able to find the end 4 barrels 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:53.340
 It's not stupid , but because the fortress is quite large, it's quite a fortress. 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.569
 Though not destroying at a very high rate so much 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.700
 Well about After all, 20 percent will feel that broke 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.990

 Finally 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.720
 I can go to the end 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.720
 In particular say 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.190
 It is true but this is true 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.650
 When we found the end portal 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.740
 Saying that 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.010

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:45.930
