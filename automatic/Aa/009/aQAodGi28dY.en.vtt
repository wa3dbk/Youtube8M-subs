now okay the main problem as you guys
know<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.140> watch<00:03:03.290> my<00:03:03.530> last<00:03:03.769> video<00:03:04.010> if<00:03:04.280> you

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
know if you watch my last video if you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.850 
know if you watch my last video if you
haven't<00:03:04.640> go<00:03:04.910> check<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.329> out<00:03:05.450> on<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:06.349> channel

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
haven't go check it out on my channel

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.940 
haven't go check it out on my channel
but<00:03:07.400> as<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:07.879> guys<00:03:08.030> know<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.720> stated<00:03:09.470> earlier<00:03:09.680> in

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
but as you guys know I stated earlier in

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.190 
but as you guys know I stated earlier in
my<00:03:10.040> last<00:03:10.220> video<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.150> maps<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:11.629> this<00:03:11.930> game

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
my last video that the maps in this game

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.970 
my last video that the maps in this game
are<00:03:12.530> not<00:03:12.890> good<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.959> reason<00:03:15.200> why<00:03:15.590> they<00:03:15.860> are

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
are not good and the reason why they are

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.930 
are not good and the reason why they are
not<00:03:16.190> good<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.670> because<00:03:17.180> they<00:03:17.840> are<00:03:17.989> small

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
not good is because they are small

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.580 
not good is because they are small
actually<00:03:19.940> they<00:03:20.269> are<00:03:20.480> pretty<00:03:20.750> big<00:03:21.049> but<00:03:21.319> if<00:03:21.470> you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
actually they are pretty big but if you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.840 
actually they are pretty big but if you
think<00:03:21.620> about<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.100> in<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.370> way<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.519> I'm

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
think about it in a way that I'm

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.490 
think about it in a way that I'm
thinking<00:03:23.359> about<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.989> will<00:03:24.139> realize<00:03:24.470> that

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
thinking about it you will realize that

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.470 
thinking about it you will realize that
they<00:03:24.799> are<00:03:24.829> small<00:03:25.160> because<00:03:25.489> there<00:03:25.700> are<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:25.819> many

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
they are small because there are so many

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.039 
they are small because there are so many
corners<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:27.799> many<00:03:28.069> close<00:03:28.489> distance<00:03:29.359> combat

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
corners in so many close distance combat

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.860 
corners in so many close distance combat
areas<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.889> the<00:03:31.340> maps<00:03:31.579> like<00:03:32.209> this<00:03:32.420> right<00:03:32.690> here

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
areas on the maps like this right here

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.449 
areas on the maps like this right here
that<00:03:33.019> guy<00:03:33.200> just<00:03:33.290> turned<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.680> corner<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.130> I

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
of the spots where you're shooting at

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.080 
of the spots where you're shooting at
people<00:03:41.180> uh<00:03:41.950> there's<00:03:42.950> well<00:03:43.130> it's<00:03:43.310> only<00:03:43.400> like<00:03:43.669> 10

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
people uh there's well it's only like 10

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.030 
people uh there's well it's only like 10
feet<00:03:44.299> away<00:03:44.450> from<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:44.870> 25<00:03:45.200> feet<00:03:45.440> away<00:03:45.530> from<00:03:45.680> you

not<00:03:46.579> really<00:03:46.849> on<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.150> map<00:03:47.359> but<00:03:47.569> on<00:03:47.660> most<00:03:47.840> maps

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
not really on this map but on most maps

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.920 
not really on this map but on most maps
that<00:03:48.739> is<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.130> case<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:50.269> don't<00:03:50.569> want<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
that is the case and I don't want to

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.020 
that is the case and I don't want to
have<00:03:51.139> to<00:03:51.470> keep<00:03:52.069> shooting<00:03:52.459> at<00:03:52.579> people<00:03:52.730> from

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
have to keep shooting at people from

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.180 
have to keep shooting at people from
five<00:03:53.239> feet<00:03:53.450> away<00:03:53.510> from<00:03:53.750> me<00:03:53.930> because<00:03:54.650> then<00:03:54.980> it's

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
five feet away from me because then it's

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.039 
five feet away from me because then it's
like<00:03:55.340> hard<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.669> aim<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.090> all<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:56.480> stuff<00:03:56.690> and

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
like hard to aim and all that stuff and

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.650 
like hard to aim and all that stuff and
usually<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:58.310> do<00:03:58.430> there's<00:03:58.730> like<00:03:58.880> 20<00:03:59.239> corners

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
usually you do there's like 20 corners

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.110 
usually you do there's like 20 corners
on<00:03:59.900> every<00:04:00.500> single<00:04:00.709> map<00:04:01.040> so<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.849> don't<00:04:02.000> know

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
on every single map so you don't know

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120 
on every single map so you don't know
what<00:04:02.299> corner<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.750> look<00:04:03.019> at<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.950> always

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
what corner to look at and you always

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.129 
what corner to look at and you always
get<00:04:04.459> shot<00:04:04.730> from<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.030> side<00:04:05.269> or<00:04:05.569> from<00:04:05.840> behind

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
get shot from the side or from behind

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.559 
get shot from the side or from behind
and<00:04:06.500> I'm<00:04:07.400> probably<00:04:07.609> gonna<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.000> fucking

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
and I'm probably gonna have to fucking

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.210 
and I'm probably gonna have to fucking
put<00:04:08.810> two<00:04:08.959> game<00:04:09.169> plays<00:04:09.380> on<00:04:09.530> this<00:04:09.739> because<00:04:09.919> this

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
put two game plays on this because this

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.729 
put two game plays on this because this
is<00:04:10.340> too<00:04:10.370> much<00:04:10.489> of<00:04:10.639> a<00:04:10.819> long<00:04:11.000> video<00:04:11.209> but<00:04:11.739> anyways

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
is too much of a long video but anyways

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.309 
is too much of a long video but anyways
another<00:04:13.609> problem<00:04:14.209> with<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.510> maps<00:04:14.720> besides

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
another problem with the maps besides

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.089 
another problem with the maps besides
them<00:04:15.680> being<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.609> like<00:04:17.060> short<00:04:17.870> distance<00:04:18.410> combat

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
them being so like short distance combat

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.480 
them being so like short distance combat
is<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.940> because<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.900> there<00:04:21.620> are<00:04:21.890> so

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
is that because of that there are so

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.610 
is that because of that there are so
many<00:04:22.760> situations<00:04:23.570> where<00:04:24.349> you<00:04:24.380> are

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
many situations where you are

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.790 
many situations where you are
outnumbered<00:04:24.860> like

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.209 
happen like I was the one basically
running<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.539> game<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.229> how<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:13.889> played<00:05:14.190> out

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
running the game and how it played out

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.670 
running the game and how it played out
but<00:05:15.060> in<00:05:15.180> games<00:05:15.449> like<00:05:15.629> this<00:05:15.870> in<00:05:16.139> modern<00:05:16.469> warfare

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
but in games like this in modern warfare

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.950 
but in games like this in modern warfare
3<00:05:16.889> because<00:05:17.729> of<00:05:17.969> the<00:05:18.120> fact<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.479> there<00:05:18.659> are<00:05:18.719> so

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
3 because of the fact that there are so

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.040 
3 because of the fact that there are so
many<00:05:19.110> corners<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.889> a<00:05:20.340> lot<00:05:20.520> of<00:05:20.610> situations

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
many corners and a lot of situations

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.779 
many corners and a lot of situations
where<00:05:22.050> there's<00:05:22.800> multiple<00:05:23.039> people<00:05:23.550> that<00:05:23.699> you

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
where there's multiple people that you

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.730 
where there's multiple people that you
have<00:05:23.909> to<00:05:24.060> shoot<00:05:24.240> at<00:05:24.539> you're<00:05:25.169> not<00:05:25.379> the<00:05:25.560> one

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
have to shoot at you're not the one

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.770 
have to shoot at you're not the one
really<00:05:26.099> engaging<00:05:26.610> in<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.060> gunfights<00:05:27.539> you're

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
really engaging in the gunfights you're

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.110 
really engaging in the gunfights you're
just<00:05:27.960> being<00:05:28.169> brought<00:05:28.500> into<00:05:28.740> them<00:05:29.009> randomly<00:05:29.430> so

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
just being brought into them randomly so

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.330 
just being brought into them randomly so
you<00:05:30.210> it's<00:05:30.659> hard<00:05:30.960> for<00:05:31.169> rushes<00:05:31.529> for<00:05:31.889> that<00:05:32.069> reason

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
you it's hard for rushes for that reason

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.029 
you it's hard for rushes for that reason
and<00:05:32.789> another<00:05:33.419> problem<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.139> a<00:05:34.169> lot<00:05:34.319> of<00:05:34.590> people

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
and another problem that a lot of people

and another problem that a lot of people
are<00:05:35.539> experiencing<00:05:36.539> is<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:37.259> lag<00:05:37.740> compensation

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
are experiencing is the lag compensation

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.189 
are experiencing is the lag compensation
in<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:39.090> connection<00:05:39.449> and<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:39.960> hit<00:05:40.080> detection

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
in the connection and the hit detection
