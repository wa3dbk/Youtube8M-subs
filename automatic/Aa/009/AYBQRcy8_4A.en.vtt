00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.060 
what's going on I've watched anime
prices<00:00:28.560> drop<00:00:29.460> dramatically<00:00:30.060> over<00:00:30.900> my<00:00:31.170> time<00:00:31.769> as

an<00:00:32.399> anime<00:00:32.730> fan<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.649> promise<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.340> always

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
an anime fan and the promise was always

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.970 
an anime fan and the promise was always
that<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> drop<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> price<00:00:37.079> people<00:00:37.829> will

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that if you drop the price people will

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.100 
that if you drop the price people will
buy<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> however<00:00:39.450> people<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.870> buying

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
buy more of it however people are buying

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.549 
buy more of it however people are buying
less<00:00:40.469> anime<00:00:40.920> now<00:00:41.100> than<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.550> were<00:00:42.379> 10<00:00:43.379> years

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
less anime now than they were 10 years

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.590 
less anime now than they were 10 years
ago<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.000> actually<00:00:45.829> born<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.600> an

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
ago and is actually born out in an

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.410 
ago and is actually born out in an
employee<00:00:48.870> Jenny<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.320> actually<00:00:49.710> said<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
employee Jenny on actually said that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.880 
employee Jenny on actually said that
sales<00:00:51.420> these<00:00:51.629> days<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:51.989> about<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> third<00:00:52.410> what

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
sales these days are about a third what

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.549 
sales these days are about a third what
they<00:00:53.010> were<00:00:53.070> ten<00:00:53.520> years<00:00:53.699> ago

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
they were ten years ago

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.959 
they were ten years ago
so<00:00:55.640> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:58.500> anime<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.190> priced<00:00:59.609> lower

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
so you know the anime is priced lower

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.410 
so you know the anime is priced lower
and<00:01:00.420> they're<00:01:00.960> still<00:01:01.199> selling<00:01:01.469> less<00:01:02.149> that's<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and they're still selling less that's a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.190 
and they're still selling less that's a
problem<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.020> companies

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
problem so I think what these companies

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.289 
problem so I think what these companies
are<00:01:07.470> doing<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.890> they're<00:01:07.979> saying<00:01:08.040> look<00:01:08.430> there

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
are doing is they're saying look there

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.179 
are doing is they're saying look there

and who are interested in this stuff and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.050 
and who are interested in this stuff and

going<00:01:51.630> cheap<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:52.890> sufficient<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.729> not

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
going cheap is not sufficient it's not

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.510 
going cheap is not sufficient it's not
working<00:01:54.479> for<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:55.380> lot<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.799> shows<00:01:55.979> some<00:01:56.280> shows

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
working for a lot of shows some shows

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.569 
working for a lot of shows some shows
are<00:01:56.700> doing<00:01:56.880> fine<00:01:57.180> obviously<00:01:57.920> but<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.189> overall

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
are doing fine obviously but the overall

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.990 
are doing fine obviously but the overall
trend<00:01:59.759> is<00:02:00.540> negative<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.130> these<00:02:02.490> companies<00:02:02.820> are

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
trend is negative so these companies are

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.420 
trend is negative so these companies are
bucking<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.270> trend<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.840> say<00:02:03.990> hey<00:02:04.250> we<00:02:05.250> can

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
bucking that trend to say hey we can

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
bucking that trend to say hey we can
probably<00:02:05.670> sell<00:02:06.090> enough<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> those

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
probably sell enough just to those

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.800 
probably sell enough just to those
hardcore<00:02:07.259> fans<00:02:08.239> now<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.660> certainly

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
hardcore fans now you can certainly

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
hardcore fans now you can certainly
debate<00:02:10.140> whether<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> good<00:02:10.560> or<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.800> bad

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
debate whether that's a good or a bad

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.640 
debate whether that's a good or a bad
thing<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> point<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.170> actually

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
thing but the point is that is actually

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.270 
thing but the point is that is actually
working

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
working

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.370 
working
in<00:02:14.370> fact<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.970> know<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.420> working<00:02:15.660> when<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
in fact I know it's working when the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.200 
in fact I know it's working when the
fate/zero<00:02:16.560> box<00:02:17.160> set<00:02:17.400> was<00:02:17.580> announced<00:02:18.030> I

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
fate/zero box set was announced I

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.920 
fate/zero box set was announced I
noticed<00:02:18.840> several<00:02:19.140> older<00:02:20.040> fans<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.610> knew

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
noticed several older fans that I knew

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.510 
noticed several older fans that I knew
were<00:02:21.930> writing<00:02:22.230> things<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.620> well<00:02:23.280> i

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
were writing things like well i

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.580 
were writing things like well i
pre-ordered<00:02:23.940> my<00:02:24.240> own<00:02:24.480> copy<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.110> we'll<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.440> if

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
pre-ordered my own copy but we'll see if

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.390 
pre-ordered my own copy but we'll see if
this<00:02:25.740> works

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
this works

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.880 
this works
and<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.940> saw<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.570> said<00:02:28.290> several

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and I saw this you know said several

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.460 
and I saw this you know said several
different<00:02:29.130> times<00:02:29.280> by<00:02:29.490> different<00:02:29.760> people<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
different times by different people and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.449 
different times by different people and
the<00:02:31.470> fact<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.830> these<00:02:32.040> companies<00:02:32.220> are

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
the fact that these companies are

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.250 
the fact that these companies are
continuing<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.060> offer<00:02:33.240> these<00:02:33.570> expensive<00:02:34.050> box

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
continuing to offer these expensive box

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.510 
continuing to offer these expensive box
sets<00:02:34.530> indicates<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.310> working

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
sets indicates that it's working

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.949 
sets indicates that it's working
otherwise<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.270> would<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.390> dropped<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
otherwise it would have dropped to the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.500 
otherwise it would have dropped to the
whole<00:02:37.110> program<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.459> think<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.360> can

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
whole program so I think you can

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.270 
whole program so I think you can
certainly<00:02:39.660> argue<00:02:39.870> whether<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
certainly argue whether this is a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.250 
certainly argue whether this is a
positive<00:02:41.970> trend<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.390> industry<00:02:42.660> as<00:02:42.900> a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
positive trend for the industry as a

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.230 
positive trend for the industry as a
whole<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.740> point<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.070> this<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.910> how<00:02:45.060> these

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
whole but the point is this is how these

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.080 
whole but the point is this is how these
companies<00:02:45.480> are<00:02:45.660> making<00:02:45.900> money<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.920> know<00:02:47.090> most

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
companies are making money you know most

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.560 
companies are making money you know most
anime<00:02:48.930> fans<00:02:49.170> are<00:02:49.440> not<00:02:49.709> buying<00:02:50.239> DVDs<00:02:51.239> and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
anime fans are not buying DVDs and

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.260 
anime fans are not buying DVDs and
blu-ray<00:02:51.989> discs<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.489> not<00:02:53.880> selling

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
blu-ray discs it's just not selling

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.900 
blu-ray discs it's just not selling
people<00:02:54.600> are<00:02:54.660> not<00:02:54.989> buying<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.650> stuff<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.340> so

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
people are not buying this stuff and so

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.610 
people are not buying this stuff and so
I<00:02:57.180> think<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.750> companies<00:02:58.020> are<00:02:58.140> saying<00:02:58.350> well<00:02:58.590> we

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
I think the companies are saying well we

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.410 
I think the companies are saying well we
might<00:02:58.860> as<00:02:58.890> well<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.190> out<00:02:59.220> after<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.060> customers

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
might as well go out after the customers

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.160 
might as well go out after the customers
who<00:03:00.510> actually<00:03:00.690> do<00:03:01.200> pay<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.220> money<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.810> then

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
who actually do pay the money and then

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.320 
who actually do pay the money and then
if<00:03:04.380> other<00:03:04.560> folks<00:03:04.709> don't<00:03:04.890> get<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.130> DVDs<00:03:05.489> well

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
if other folks don't get the DVDs well

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.350 
if other folks don't get the DVDs well
that's<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:08.250> unfortunate<00:03:08.910> let's<00:03:09.239> be

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
that's the that's unfortunate let's be

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.270 
that's the that's unfortunate let's be
honest<00:03:09.690> there<00:03:10.080> torrenting<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.650> any<00:03:10.890> way<00:03:11.130> or

they're getting it off streams they're

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.240 
they're getting it off streams they're
watching<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.810> anyway<00:03:13.170> because<00:03:13.709> folks<00:03:14.070> are

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
watching it anyway because folks are

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.510 
watching it anyway because folks are
finding<00:03:14.430> ways<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:15.360> watching<00:03:16.020> these<00:03:16.260> things<00:03:16.650> so
