00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.629 

I<00:04:41.960> know<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:42.949> looks<00:04:43.130> kind<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.400> weird<00:04:43.550> because

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
I know it looks kind of weird because

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.930 
I know it looks kind of weird because
the<00:04:43.880> menu<00:04:44.090> 8<00:04:44.210> head<00:04:44.509> is<00:04:44.720> just<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.139> cylinder<00:04:45.710> but

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
the menu 8 head is just a cylinder but

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.360 
the menu 8 head is just a cylinder but
that<00:04:46.940> right<00:04:47.120> there<00:04:47.320> just<00:04:48.320> good<00:04:48.650> job<00:04:48.860> guys<00:04:49.070> but

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
that right there just good job guys but

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.700 
that right there just good job guys but
yeah<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.539> just<00:04:50.750> really<00:04:51.139> like<00:04:51.289> that<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.530> don't

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
yeah I just really like that I don't

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.930 
yeah I just really like that I don't
know<00:04:51.800> why<00:04:51.979> but<00:04:52.160> that's<00:04:52.250> such<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.610> nice

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
know why but that's such a nice

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.310 
know why but that's such a nice
attention<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.509> detail<00:04:53.570> because<00:04:54.080> they<00:04:54.199> could

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
attention to detail because they could

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.950 
attention to detail because they could
have<00:04:54.410> just<00:04:54.560> left<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:54.830> blank<00:04:55.539> but<00:04:56.539> no<00:04:56.780> they

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
have just left that blank but no they

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.920 
have just left that blank but no they
actually<00:04:57.289> printed<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.710> nice<00:04:58.930> articulation

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
actually printed it nice articulation

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.840 
actually printed it nice articulation
