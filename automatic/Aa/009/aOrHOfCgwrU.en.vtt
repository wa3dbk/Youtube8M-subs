the boot of the car and they're really

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.820 
the boot of the car and they're really
like<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> home<00:00:20.760> from<00:00:21.000> home<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.990> inside<00:00:22.590> them

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
like a home from home so inside them

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.800 
like a home from home so inside them
you'll<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.220> separate<00:00:23.880> compartments<00:00:24.660> for

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
you'll have separate compartments for

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.109 
you'll have separate compartments for
sleeping<00:00:25.289> you'll<00:00:25.830> have<00:00:26.039> an<00:00:26.130> area<00:00:26.279> perhaps<00:00:26.670> for

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
sleeping you'll have an area perhaps for

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.480 
sleeping you'll have an area perhaps for
cooking<00:00:27.359> maybe<00:00:28.349> somewhere<00:00:28.800> even<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> dog

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
cooking maybe somewhere even for the dog

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.429 
cooking maybe somewhere even for the dog
to<00:00:29.699> sleep<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.240> there's<00:00:30.420> plenty<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.840> room<00:00:31.140> that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560 
to sleep so there's plenty of room that
really<00:00:32.160> designed<00:00:32.550> as<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.759> say<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.239> homes

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
really designed as I say to be homes

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500 
really designed as I say to be homes
from<00:00:33.870> home<00:00:34.160> in<00:00:35.160> terms<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.850> how<00:00:36.059> they're<00:00:36.239> pitch

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
from home in terms of how they're pitch

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.990 
from home in terms of how they're pitch
this<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.500> particular<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.219> inflatable

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this one in particular is inflatable

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
this one in particular is inflatable
which<00:00:39.480> means<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.960> somebody<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.739> pitch<00:00:40.980> it

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
which means that somebody can pitch it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.069 
which means that somebody can pitch it
on<00:00:41.399> their<00:00:41.879> own<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.629> relatively

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
on their own really in a relatively

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.069 
on their own really in a relatively
short<00:00:43.200> period<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> time<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:45.450> other<00:00:45.600> ones<00:00:45.840> will

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
short period of time the other ones will

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.310 
short period of time the other ones will
be<00:00:46.260> using<00:00:47.059> fiberglass<00:00:48.059> poles<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> they

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
be using fiberglass poles and they

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
be using fiberglass poles and they
really<00:00:49.680> need<00:00:49.860> two<00:00:50.070> people<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.670> pitch<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
really need two people to pitch just to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.860 
really need two people to pitch just to
make<00:00:51.809> things<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.440> bit<00:00:52.620> easier<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> our

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
make things a little bit easier so our

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.479 
make things a little bit easier so our
selection<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.379> family<00:00:55.770> tournaments<00:00:56.309> have

selection of family tournaments have
some<00:00:56.699> shared<00:00:56.940> features<00:00:57.449> too<00:00:57.739> they've<00:00:58.739> all<00:00:58.890> got

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
some shared features too they've all got

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.819 
some shared features too they've all got
multiple<00:00:59.609> guidelines<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.780> make<00:01:00.960> sure

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
multiple guidelines so you can make sure

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.829 
multiple guidelines so you can make sure
and<00:01:01.920> move<00:01:02.129> around<00:01:02.399> too<00:01:02.699> much<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.089> night<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
and move around too much of night if it

and move around too much of night if it
gets<00:01:04.049> windy<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> pole<00:01:05.610> configuration

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
gets windy the pole configuration

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
gets windy the pole configuration
enables<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.979> good<00:01:08.130> Headroom

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369

on this one in particular once that's

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
on this one in particular once that's
moved<00:01:38.819> out<00:01:39.030> away<00:01:39.330> you<00:01:39.959> go<00:01:40.140> through<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
would you believe it took just ten

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.539 
would you believe it took just ten
minutes<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.450> pitch<00:01:57.720> you've<00:01:58.140> got<00:01:58.289> windows

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
minutes to pitch you've got windows
