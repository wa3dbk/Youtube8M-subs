00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
d-10 and what I have here is the shark

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.380 
d-10 and what I have here is the shark
free<00:01:41.909> shad<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:44.060> obviously<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:46.350> works<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.979> mean

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
free shad and obviously it works I mean

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.910 
free shad and obviously it works I mean
how<00:01:48.390> cool<00:01:48.600> was<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.140> pulled<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
how cool was that I just pulled up on a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.580 
how cool was that I just pulled up on a
point<00:01:50.220> leading<00:01:50.610> into<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> bay<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.590> typical

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
point leading into a bay a typical

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.700 
point leading into a bay a typical
staging<00:01:53.130> area<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:54.240> fish<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.020> kind<00:01:55.680> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
staging area and a fish bit it I kind of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.929 
staging area and a fish bit it I kind of
think<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.979> could<00:01:56.189> run<00:01:56.310> around<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> catch<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
think we could run around and catch a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.219 
think we could run around and catch a
bunch<00:01:57.090> room<00:01:57.299> right<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> might<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> catch

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
bunch room right now I might go to catch

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.590 
bunch room right now I might go to catch
another<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.619> right<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.210> I'm<00:02:00.210> gonna<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.450> my

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
another one right here I'm gonna get my

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.910 
another one right here I'm gonna get my
line<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.840> tangles<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:01.860> I

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
line on tangles here I can see if I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.950 
line on tangles here I can see if I
catch<00:02:02.159> another<00:02:02.399> one

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
catch another one

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.210 
catch another one
but<00:02:04.960> perfect<00:02:05.710> staging<00:02:06.070> spot<00:02:07.890> point<00:02:08.890> leading

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
but perfect staging spot point leading

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.290 
but perfect staging spot point leading
into<00:02:09.550> AB<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:11.520> 10-foot<00:02:12.520> running<00:02:12.850> crankbait

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
into AB a 10-foot running crankbait

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.690 
into AB a 10-foot running crankbait
which<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.780> kind<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.230> about<00:02:14.470> where<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:15.040> would

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
which is kind of about where I would

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.130 
which is kind of about where I would
think<00:02:15.880> those<00:02:16.030> staging<00:02:16.450> fish<00:02:16.600> would<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.810> you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
think those staging fish would be you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
think those staging fish would be you
know<00:02:17.230> they're<00:02:17.410> gonna<00:02:17.500> be<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:20.140> shallow<00:02:20.620> but

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
know they're gonna be not shallow but

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.840 
know they're gonna be not shallow but
you're<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.910> deep<00:02:22.209> either<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:24.190> bait<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.670> could

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
you're not deep either this bait I could

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.370 
you're not deep either this bait I could
