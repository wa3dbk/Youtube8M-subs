00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.369
 Hey, what are you talking about? 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.470
 one more tutorial for you 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.890
 today is teaching two meters to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.640
 solve the fall of ips and any game 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 for me I needed the classic couple 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 so come on, you come here at two 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.680
 energy options 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.719
 here comes here more power options you 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 only works with balanced beauty you 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.670
 choose remembered to change the settings 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 plan here to change settings 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.530
 click on it from there 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.340
 the dad is power management 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.949
 processor 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.820
 here you both leave as is and here 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.940
 of it is at peak performance in the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.439
 You plug the battery into the battery 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.860
 but in the outlet you leave 87 does not come 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.430
 probably what will give 100% because 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.000
 here is the problem of falling ips that 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.280
 the processor it gets very hot there 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.580
 force him to end up having that kind of 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.710
 to be able to return to the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 normal again in this chain ips you 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 have something like this on the exchange 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.000
 disrupt hell you decrease aksu 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.920
 AvaÃ­ goes testing you leave 90 and if 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.009
 you will continue downloading 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.479
 There you leave between 85 and 90 my 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.979
 good it was perfect 87 and now the other 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.070
 method is too much to pass the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.840
 He but it did not work for me, but also 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.579
 there were people who worked but who 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.750
 the user's game is running was the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.820
 beta version 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.790
 I'll leave it in the description already coming 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.240
 set is already only you start and eni 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.759
 so if you do not have it select the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.299
 crossfire or any other game and 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.299
 ready
