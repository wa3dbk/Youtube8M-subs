 Hi, hello everybody, my name is lucas queiroz. 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.880
 from the tennis world 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.429
 I would like to thank you all for 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.559
 watching our videos on youtube is 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.839
 today is the video is very short it's just 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.369
 show more racket model 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.170
 I would like to thank the staff of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.570
 mission of Brazil that lent us its 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.869
 racquet gently to record this 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.109
 video is new to catimba roger feder a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.830
 prostate and 97 this is not the version 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.579
 autographed this version 315 grams is a 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.040
 slightly lighter has 16 by 19 in color 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.649
 moment is there is more space between 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.950
 ropes then helps you to generate enough 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.620
 spine hit the big news of the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.760
 material is that it comes with large 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.820
 graphite that would be a graphite that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.579
 would be a twist that gives more 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.920
 resistance in the racket and also greater 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.329
 accuracy in the beat is we had to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 opportunity to hit some ball 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.330
 with that qat and really that on the beat 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.340
 It 's really accurate, can you? 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.990
 direct the balls cool 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 this model that would indicate to those who have 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.330
 a very heavy hit because she besides 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.790
 give you more confidence for having less 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.799
 rope and a head 97 which is not a 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.619
 head is not too big like the head 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.600
 without 105 110 and not a small head 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.070
 how was the roger feder used 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.680
 formerly head 90 or 95 is a head 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.200
 97 so she stayed in the middle 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.990
 Can you have a closer match? 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.270
 potent with less wood I think 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.119
 this was one of the things that helped 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.729
 offer is to choose this one 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.680
 his game is much improved and his 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.060
 he stopped war both from 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.759
 left that was happening 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 recently returned to number 2 of the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.670
 world and I think a lot owes you to kec 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.189
 which he has helped to develop and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.500
 performance in qat was all worked 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.630

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.099

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.819

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.150
