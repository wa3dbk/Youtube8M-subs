00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.260
 A sense of stability 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.350
 Actually, it's already a while ago January 2008 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.820
 I wonder why this time 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.760
 Overwintering 2007 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.929
 Mr. Takano 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.050
 But 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.979
 It is said that the 60th anniversary of such a form was reached 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:03.850
 In that 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.220
 That one year 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.760
 Please write a diary 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.579

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.480
 It was said that it was not eight 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.480
 Also in Myanmar only 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.380
 It was something like 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.080
 Though it is 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.500

 If you are watching them on TV, it's pretty decent 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 It is a feeling of giving birth for the second time 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.120
 Was 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.600
 It became s3 first day 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.799
 I told you that I can't hit a snowman 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.340
 It is beginning in 2008 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.140
 Let me go 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.400

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.299
 Very popular 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.819
 The main highlight of this book is not actually the content 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.949
 About 30 hectares of fire 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.609
 Ramirez I wonder if you say 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.039
 I know this is wide 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.369
 Good books 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:05.979
 There is a cover 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.869
 Unknown cover 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.519
 It is bad 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.559
 Nice Takada-san's 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.399
 Well seriously 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:18.729
 It is a photograph that is thinking about this book 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.709
 is not it 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.399
 Like this 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:24.739
 can you see it 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.739
 Let's see 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.269
 It is a problem such as straight 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.289
 Still 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:35.909
 It is said that I am indebted 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.429

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:39.099
 Imamura Kento 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.289
 Though it is wedding without using 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.689
 It is the present time and saw this 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:44.929
 Oh 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.929
 Afghan people said the sixth 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:50.839
 Until 11th 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.189
 If you are dismantling 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.189
 I think if you can 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.229
 I worked in the same way as last season 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.999
 Continue... 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.499
 I have been able to find a suitable job 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.689
 In that 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.260
 I did not want people to say I told myself I told myself 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.949
 but 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.160
 It is this time 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.519
 At the very beginning, the next high value atopsipat 32% spread and it's almost over 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.769
 Anyway 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.509
 This is that 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.159
 Chinese Foreign Ministry 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:25.170
 Excellent 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.120
 Well, editors and developers with excellent brothers are making 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.830
 It was 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.669
 Possible to have a son called pbga 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.960
 Though I do not go to this 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.189
 This is also the best ever 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.309
 Very long put 10,000 yen 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:41.930

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.900
 Date truth freely decided 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:01.469
 If you have &amp; ipod by all means 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.020
 Decline 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.689
 In that allocation 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.689
 I wanted to download this for free 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.919
 It is a universal country that seems to have been many 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.419
 Please see here 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.300
 As a part of Tohato ok and Takada's charge 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.620
 Equipped with British Central Bank 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.069
 The purpose of having made a book is this year's 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.839
 To the end of the year 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.129
 Notebook 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.990
 I have to go to Otemachi Miyanomae 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.120
 It becomes sports mediation 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.169
 Net regulation 10 straight wins 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.339
 Town found schedule book included 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.339
 I am working on tv now 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.000
 First of all, I hope the candidate did not feel on holidays 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.919
 I said I understood it on September 30 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.830
 Kitamura 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.900
 Then the goal 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.789
 Is it because you are traveling between cars in the form of after Mariana? 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.019
 That's right from the very beginning of the data 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.990
 In a four-ball flight three Goro 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.119
 My memories are 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:21.639
 At the second time in Setagaya's studio 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.300
 I was isolated 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.550
 I was a little nervous when it was the first time before 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.550
 Today was nervous though 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.629
 To formation 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.110
 I brought together the general value 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.039
 Take the instrument panel confectionery, and the manager is a manager 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.559
 Somehow I said something 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.869
 It is spread among them 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.120
 I did this and put out sweets for this term while I was 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.620
 We can not change with weekly high-class spud 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.610
 It is difficult to buy in the market 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.789
 Well then well then observe 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.330
 Even now, I think that even if you get along with the parent and child 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.880
 The three items in the central quark I mentioned 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.379
 The theory is completely different 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:10.589
 At Diamond Company 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:14.559
 Basically that is mainly a few books a day 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:21.550
 Some people want to deliver 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.310
 f I am an editor and I am working hard but parts 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.419
 A little before the route is the best 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.110
 Things that will delight those readers 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.069
 I want to make it 

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:32.949
 Now 

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:34.469
 By all means 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:35.770
 I agree 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.089
 It is a view of the homepage, and it is considered in the previous bookstore 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:42.889
 What a shit but wrecked 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.639
 I hope you will keep an eye on it 

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.409
 Thank you for today
