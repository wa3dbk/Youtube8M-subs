this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.340> jig<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:03.090> used<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.840> build<00:00:05.270> supers<00:00:06.270> I

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
this is the jig I used to build supers I

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.410 
this is the jig I used to build supers I
don't<00:00:07.200> build<00:00:07.350> deeps<00:00:07.649> but<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.160> set<00:00:08.730> up<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.090> build

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
don't build deeps but it set up to build

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:19.240 
don't build deeps but it set up to build
deeps<00:00:09.719> as<00:00:09.990> well<00:00:10.519> the

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.109 

here's<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> completed<00:00:22.430> super<00:00:23.690> sit<00:00:24.690> in<00:00:24.960> here

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
here's the completed super sit in here

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
here's the completed super sit in here
you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.330> how<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> fits<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.440> there<00:00:28.740> these

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you can see how it fits in there these

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.440 
you can see how it fits in there these
clamps<00:00:30.380> come<00:00:31.380> down<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.189> clamp<00:00:32.850> everything<00:00:33.330> in

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
clamps come down to clamp everything in

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.000 
clamps come down to clamp everything in
place<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.190> then<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.220> whole<00:00:35.809> unit<00:00:36.809> rotates<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
place and then the whole unit rotates so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.070 
place and then the whole unit rotates so
that<00:00:38.220> yeah<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.640> easy<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.059> staple<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:41.870> built<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
that yeah it's easy to staple I built it

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.490 
that yeah it's easy to staple I built it
I<00:00:45.050> built<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.470> by<00:00:46.739> building<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.970> box<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I built it by building a box that's the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.690 
I built it by building a box that's the
add<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> 3/4<00:00:50.370> inch<00:00:50.400> plywood<00:00:51.079> that<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
add a 3/4 inch plywood that was but you

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.360 
add a 3/4 inch plywood that was but you
can<00:00:56.850> see<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.960> least<00:00:58.260> an<00:00:58.559> inch<00:00:58.860> on

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
can see here it's at least an inch on

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.820 
can see here it's at least an inch on
each<00:00:59.520> side<00:00:59.930> larger<00:01:00.930> than<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:03.120> regular<00:01:06.560> super<00:01:07.560> or

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
each side larger than a regular super or

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.520 
each side larger than a regular super or
regular<00:01:08.430> high<00:01:08.910> body<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:11.660> I<00:01:12.660> was<00:01:13.020> very<00:01:13.259> careful

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
regular high body and I was very careful

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.910 
regular high body and I was very careful
to<00:01:13.740> build<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.190> exactly<00:01:14.820> square<00:01:15.350> both<00:01:16.350> 3/4

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
to build that exactly square both 3/4

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.350 
to build that exactly square both 3/4
inch<00:01:17.100> bottom<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.539> sides<00:01:19.610> but<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.670> didn't<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
inch bottom and sides but I didn't I

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.320 
inch bottom and sides but I didn't I
stapled<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> corners<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.850> sites

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
stapled the corners of the sites

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.740 
stapled the corners of the sites
together<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.240> I've<00:01:27.420> cut<00:01:27.720> back

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
together but you can see I've cut back

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.920 
together but you can see I've cut back
the<00:01:28.619> sides<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.869> it's<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.140> only<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:33.690> sides

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the sides and it's really only the sides

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.500 
the sides and it's really only the sides
are<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.350> only<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.939> end<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.330> two

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
are really only on in the end on two

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.940 
are really only on in the end on two
sides<00:01:36.750> left<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.680> anyway<00:01:39.080> don't<00:01:40.080> staple<00:01:40.799> in

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
sides left but anyway don't staple in

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
sides left but anyway don't staple in
the<00:01:41.189> sides<00:01:41.460> maybe<00:01:42.119> three<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:42.600> four<00:01:42.689> inches

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the sides maybe three or four inches

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
the sides maybe three or four inches
from<00:01:43.409> each<00:01:43.770> corner<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.909> you're<00:01:45.090> gonna<00:01:45.180> cut<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
from each corner so you're gonna cut it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.490 
from each corner so you're gonna cut it
out<00:01:45.659> later<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.229> once<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.010> a<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:48.500> five

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
out later so once we have a have a five

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
out later so once we have a have a five
sided<00:01:49.770> box<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> bottom<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.180> four

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
sided box at the bottom and all four

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.539 
sided box at the bottom and all four
sides<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.650> you're<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.220> careful

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
sides and it's you're really careful

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.510 
sides and it's you're really careful
that<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.000> square<00:01:54.330> then<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.470> laid<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that it's square then I laid up and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:10.520 
that it's square then I laid up and
screwed<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:02.299> steel<00:02:03.299> tubing<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:09.320> use<00:02:10.320> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
screwed in the steel tubing and use that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.410 
screwed in the steel tubing and use that
as<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.739> form<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> tubing<00:02:11.880> perfectly

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
as the form to get the tubing perfectly

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.280 
as the form to get the tubing perfectly
square<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.110> well<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.650> then<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.079> all

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
square as well and then just with it all

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.340 
square as well and then just with it all
screwed<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.739> Box<00:02:17.010> welded<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.299> frame<00:02:18.630> to

and I'm going to zoom in now to get to
see<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.690> pretty<00:02:31.900> simple<00:02:32.140> square<00:02:33.130> tubing

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
see it's a pretty simple square tubing

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.030 
see it's a pretty simple square tubing
joint<00:02:33.940> nothing<00:02:34.780> special<00:02:35.050> all<00:02:35.610> square<00:02:36.610> corners

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
joint nothing special all square corners

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.960 
joint nothing special all square corners
you<00:02:39.040> can<00:02:39.100> see<00:02:39.430> here<00:02:39.910> after<00:02:41.610> I'll<00:02:42.610> get<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:42.940> that

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
you can see here after I'll get to that

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.620 
you can see here after I'll get to that
in<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> minute<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:44.380> can<00:02:44.530> see<00:02:44.740> I<00:02:44.770> set<00:02:45.160> up<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
in a minute you can see I set up the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.780 
in a minute you can see I set up the
center<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:46.900> all<00:02:47.140> four<00:02:47.470> tubes<00:02:47.740> come<00:02:48.220> in<00:02:48.430> and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
center so all four tubes come in and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.970 
center so all four tubes come in and
butt<00:02:49.660> into<00:02:50.620> each<00:02:50.740> other<00:02:51.630> like<00:02:52.630> two<00:02:53.320> people<00:02:53.530> you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
butt into each other like two people you

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.680 
butt into each other like two people you
know<00:02:54.070> shaking<00:02:54.490> with<00:02:54.640> both<00:02:54.850> hands<00:02:55.150> MIT<00:02:55.540> to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
know shaking with both hands MIT to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.000 
know shaking with both hands MIT to
maker<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:57.300> then<00:02:58.300> I<00:02:58.450> welded<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.900> plate<00:02:59.170> over<00:02:59.470> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
maker and then I welded a plate over the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.850 
maker and then I welded a plate over the
where<00:03:00.880> they<00:03:01.000> joined<00:03:01.330> I<00:03:01.630> left<00:03:01.900> an<00:03:02.080> opening<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.830> I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
where they joined I left an opening so I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.780 
where they joined I left an opening so I
could<00:03:03.190> put<00:03:03.910> an<00:03:04.030> axle<00:03:04.420> through<00:03:04.570> there<00:03:04.840> and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
could put an axle through there and

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.460 
could put an axle through there and
that's<00:03:06.790> just<00:03:07.090> coming<00:03:07.900> around<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.320> front

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
that's just coming around to the front

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.080 
that's just coming around to the front
here<00:03:09.780> that's<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:11.020> a<00:03:11.140> just<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.860> bolt<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:13.030> I

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
here that's just a just a bolt that I

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.780 
here that's just a just a bolt that I
put<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> very<00:03:13.810> center<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:15.900> allow<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:17.410> lot<00:03:18.400> of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
put in the very center to allow a lot of

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:28.830 
put in the very center to allow a lot of
finger<00:03:19.210> okay<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:20.730> then<00:03:21.870> after<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:24.840> after<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:27.840> got

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
finger okay and then after I after I got

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.430 
finger okay and then after I after I got
it<00:03:28.990> all<00:03:29.080> welded<00:03:29.320> up<00:03:29.560> then<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.070> cut<00:03:30.340> out<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:31.440> two

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
it all welded up then I cut out the two

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.990 
it all welded up then I cut out the two
sides<00:03:32.740> so<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.490> could<00:03:33.760> put<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.150> its<00:03:34.920> two<00:03:35.920> sides<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
sides so I could put in its two sides so

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.300 
sides so I could put in its two sides so
I<00:03:37.030> could<00:03:37.300> put<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.630> these<00:03:37.840> steel<00:03:38.110> plates<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.800> I

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
I could put in these steel plates and I

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.070 
I could put in these steel plates and I
think<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.760> got<00:03:39.910> these<00:03:40.060> mcmaster-carr<00:03:40.750> or

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
think I got these mcmaster-carr or

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.320 
think I got these mcmaster-carr or
Granger<00:03:41.560> these<00:03:42.220> are<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.430> style<00:03:42.790> where<00:03:43.150> they're

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
Granger these are a style where they're

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.080 
Granger these are a style where they're
plunging<00:03:43.990> with<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.670> concealed<00:03:45.670> really<00:03:45.910> close

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
plunging with a concealed really close

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.060 
plunging with a concealed really close
here<00:03:46.120> there<00:03:46.480> was<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.600> nut<00:03:46.900> holds<00:03:47.800> it<00:03:47.890> in<00:03:47.950> place

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
here there was a nut holds it in place

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.150 
here there was a nut holds it in place
then<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.550> welded<00:03:48.790> on<00:03:49.140> this<00:03:50.220> plate<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.640> two<00:03:51.970> sides

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
then I welded on this plate on two sides

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.260 
then I welded on this plate on two sides
to<00:03:54.160> hold<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:55.780> hold<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:58.000> tool

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
to hold the to hold the this tool

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.220 
to hold the to hold the this tool
there's<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.750> good<00:03:58.959> angle<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.959> see<00:04:02.200> that

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
there's a good angle of it and see that

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.860 
there's a good angle of it and see that
it<00:04:02.560> just<00:04:02.800> plunges<00:04:03.640> up<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:03.940> down<00:04:04.090> as<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.510> clamp

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.979 

so<00:04:08.410> now<00:04:08.739> I'm<00:04:08.860> going<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.099> set<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.370> up<00:04:09.810> use<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:10.959> a

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
so now I'm going to set it up use it a

00:04:10.989 --> 00:06:09.710 
so now I'm going to set it up use it a
little<00:04:11.080> bit<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:12.250> can<00:04:12.430> see<00:04:12.700> how<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.090> works

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.300 

there<00:06:10.720> it<00:06:10.810> is

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
there it is

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.569 
there it is
elsewhere<00:06:12.310> ready<00:06:13.300> you<00:06:13.419> go
