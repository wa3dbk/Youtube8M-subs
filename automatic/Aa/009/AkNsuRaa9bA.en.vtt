00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
now we're going to start in that one so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.149 
now we're going to start in that one so
it's<00:01:39.709> a<00:01:40.039> 15th<00:01:40.610> fret<00:01:40.939> on<00:01:40.969> the<00:01:41.209> B<00:01:41.390> string<00:01:42.159> bending

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
it's a 15th fret on the B string bending

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.550 
it's a 15th fret on the B string bending
whole<00:01:43.850> step<00:01:44.329> twice<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.799> it<00:01:45.979> sounds<00:01:46.189> like<00:01:46.399> this

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.429 

to<00:01:51.560> reaching<00:01:51.859> that<00:01:52.039> much<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:53.659> then<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.380> third

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
to reaching that much and then the third

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.059 
to reaching that much and then the third
time<00:01:54.979> you're<00:01:55.189> bending<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.929> you<00:01:56.929> go<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.770> do<00:01:58.039> a

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
time you're bending it you go you do a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:04.419 
time you're bending it you go you do a
little<00:01:58.399> late<00:01:59.060> or<00:01:59.360> something<00:02:02.319> so<00:02:03.319> you<00:02:03.380> bend<00:02:03.799> and

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
little late or something so you bend and

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.210 
little late or something so you bend and
release

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.560 

and<00:02:07.940> then<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.560> take<00:02:09.560> this<00:02:09.800> note<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.399> 12<00:02:11.120> fret

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
and then you take this note the 12 fret

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.270 
and then you take this note the 12 fret
on<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.050> B<00:02:12.830> string<00:02:13.040> as<00:02:13.760> well<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:15.320> then<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.100> go

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
on the B string as well and then you go

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.960 
on the B string as well and then you go
to<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.580> g<00:02:16.850> string<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.870> fourteenth<00:02:18.380> fret

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
to the g string on the fourteenth fret

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.880 
to the g string on the fourteenth fret
so<00:02:19.970> it's<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.670> do<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.200> twice<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.710> it's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
so it's and you do that twice so it's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:38.170 
so it's and you do that twice so it's
like<00:02:28.070> this<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.180> twice<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.800> then<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.730> go<00:02:37.940> up<00:02:38.150> to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
like this is twice and then you go up to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.060 
like this is twice and then you go up to
the<00:02:38.600> 17th<00:02:39.380> red<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:39.920> band<00:02:40.400> as<00:02:40.730> well<00:02:44.470> twice<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
the 17th red and band as well twice the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.090 
the 17th red and band as well twice the
whole<00:02:46.340> step<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:47.240> like<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:48.140> last<00:02:48.350> clip<00:02:48.770> and

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
whole step just like the last clip and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.960 
whole step just like the last clip and
and<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.690> third<00:02:50.990> time<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.650> bend<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.250> you

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
and the third time you bend this you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.610 
and the third time you bend this you
catch<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.860> hit<00:02:55.520> both<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.330> beat<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.380> g

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
catch you hit both the beat and the g

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.810 
catch you hit both the beat and the g
string<00:02:57.920> like<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.190> same<00:03:01.520> ban

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
string like this so you do the same ban

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.340 
string like this so you do the same ban
but<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.270> can't<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.810> be<00:03:02.959> g<00:03:03.950> string<00:03:04.280> as<00:03:04.550> well<00:03:04.850> and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
but you can't to be g string as well and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.180 
but you can't to be g string as well and
that's<00:03:06.350> easier<00:03:06.920> if<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.480> preparation

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
that's easier if you in the preparation

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.310 
that's easier if you in the preparation
holding<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:10.670> don't<00:03:10.940> just<00:03:11.510> not<00:03:11.750> hitting<00:03:12.019> it

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
holding it but don't just not hitting it

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.580 
holding it but don't just not hitting it
the<00:03:13.010> first<00:03:13.310> two<00:03:13.550> times<00:03:13.730> like<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:17.590> usually

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
the first two times like this I usually

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.610 
the first two times like this I usually
do<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:19.390> makes<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.540> easier<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.140> then<00:03:21.440> the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
do that makes it easier and then the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.050 
do that makes it easier and then the
third<00:03:21.920> fourth<00:03:22.700> time<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:24.050> just<00:03:24.290> take<00:03:24.580> just<00:03:25.580> dis

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
third fourth time you just take just dis

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.040 
third fourth time you just take just dis
note<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.530> banding<00:03:28.160> again<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.760> hit<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:29.810> then

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
note and banding again and hit and then

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.390 
note and banding again and hit and then
you<00:03:30.080> go<00:03:30.470> like

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.170 

so<00:03:34.400> damn<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.989> hit<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.799> 15<00:03:37.610> threat<00:03:40.180> and

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
so damn it and hit the 15 threat and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.110 
so damn it and hit the 15 threat and
then<00:03:41.330> you<00:03:41.450> bet<00:03:41.659> again

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.080 

and<00:03:48.989> that's<00:03:49.739> what<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.129> lesson<00:03:50.610> is<00:03:50.700> going<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
and that's what this lesson is going to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:06.020 
and that's what this lesson is going to
end<00:03:51.739> I'm<00:03:52.739> just<00:03:52.920> going<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.190> play<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.459> once
