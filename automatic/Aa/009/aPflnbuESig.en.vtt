run 3d transformations I think this
transformation<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:23.910> better<00:04:24.120> than<00:04:24.330> super

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
transformation is better than super

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.840 
transformation is better than super
tranformation<00:04:25.130> because<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.250> target<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.639> get

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
tranformation because it target you get

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.969 
tranformation because it target you get

cards off in the hand and the deck and
it's<00:04:30.199> pretty<00:04:31.199> good<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.580> sense<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:33.030> it

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
it's pretty good in that sense and it

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.850 
it's pretty good in that sense and it
can<00:04:33.180> return<00:04:33.389> with<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.630> hand<00:04:33.810> by<00:04:34.440> mist<00:04:34.680> Valley

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
use the field card the field car work

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.309 
use the field card the field car work
that<00:06:47.129> works<00:06:47.639> as<00:06:47.819> basically<00:06:48.270> a<00:06:48.389> free<00:06:48.719> negation

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 
that works as basically a free negation

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.920 
that works as basically a free negation
and<00:06:49.499> also<00:06:49.979> another<00:06:50.460> engine<00:06:50.909> almost<00:06:51.059> so<00:06:51.839> we

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
and also another engine almost so we

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.719 
and also another engine almost so we
activate<00:06:52.289> the<00:06:52.770> trap<00:06:53.009> card<00:06:53.039> and<00:06:53.400> bring<00:06:53.550> back

activate the trap card and bring back

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.129 
activate the trap card and bring back
avian<00:06:54.589> you<00:06:55.589> can<00:06:55.740> either<00:06:55.889> pop<00:06:56.629> the<00:06:57.629> field<00:06:57.900> card

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
avian you can either pop the field card

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.019 
avian you can either pop the field card
to<00:06:58.229> negate<00:06:58.620> like<00:06:58.889> basically<00:06:59.550> almost<00:06:59.729> anything

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:00.029 
to negate like basically almost anything

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.739 
to negate like basically almost anything
or<00:07:00.419> you<00:07:01.349> could<00:07:01.469> pop<00:07:01.650> against<00:07:01.979> avian<00:07:02.639> let<00:07:03.599> your

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:03.749 
or you could pop against avian let your

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 
turn so you can keep activating as long

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.700 
turn so you can keep activating as long
as<00:07:14.879> you<00:07:14.939> have<00:07:15.029> targets<00:07:15.389> right<00:07:15.539> yes<00:07:15.899> that's
