to sound like a real amateur kid so I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.779 
to sound like a real amateur kid so I
took<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.520> guitar<00:00:50.910> down<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.789> played

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
took this guitar down and and played

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
took this guitar down and and played
what<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.360> looked<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.719> he<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:54.989> playing<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
what it looked like he was playing and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.939 
what it looked like he was playing and
then<00:00:56.719> kind<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> tune<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
then kind of a little out of tune and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.500 
then kind of a little out of tune and
everything<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> worked<00:00:59.760> really<00:00:59.879> great<00:01:00.239> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
everything and it worked really great it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.750 
everything and it worked really great it
sounded<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
sounded just like that but really what I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.420 
sounded just like that but really what I
mostly<00:01:03.120> use<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:05.040> slide

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
mostly use this for is is for slide

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.130 
mostly use this for is is for slide
stuff<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.150> has<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> certain<00:01:06.479> mojo

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
stuff because it just has a certain mojo

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.830 
stuff because it just has a certain mojo
so<00:01:07.860> right<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> tuned<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> open<00:01:08.700> G

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.350 

and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.490 
and
so<00:01:15.870> open<00:01:16.140> G<00:01:16.290> would<00:01:16.440> be<00:01:17.360> d<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.750> bottom<00:01:19.200> there

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so open G would be d on the bottom there

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.490 
so open G would be d on the bottom there
and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.740> from<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.760> like<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.150> G<00:01:21.450> chord

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
and then from there it's like a G chord

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
and then from there it's like a G chord
G<00:01:22.580> D<00:01:23.840> G<00:01:24.840> B<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.620> D<00:01:25.730> so<00:01:26.730> really<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.120> going<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
G D G B and D so really I'm going to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.670 
G D G B and D so really I'm going to
spend<00:01:27.540> more<00:01:27.660> time<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> fifth<00:01:28.320> string<00:01:28.410> than

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
spend more time on the fifth string than

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.650 
spend more time on the fifth string than
on<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:28.830> six<00:01:29.130> string<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.700> that's<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> fifth

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
on a six string because that's the fifth

00:01:30.660 --> 00:02:13.710 
on a six string because that's the fifth
I<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> root<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.620> I'm<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.860> to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.350 

string<00:02:14.720> or<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.110> D<00:02:15.770> string<00:02:15.980> net<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.880> I'm<00:02:20.180> using

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
string or the D string net and I'm using

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.559 
string or the D string net and I'm using
a<00:02:20.480> bottleneck<00:02:20.959> slide<00:02:21.560> glass<00:02:22.069> slide<00:02:22.480> from<00:02:23.480> a

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
a bottleneck slide glass slide from a

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.839 
a bottleneck slide glass slide from a
wine<00:02:23.780> bottle<00:02:23.989> actually<00:02:24.890> has<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> lip<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.790> it

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
wine bottle actually has a lip on it

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:45.460 
wine bottle actually has a lip on it
like<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.090> wine<00:02:26.330> bottle<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.489> yeah<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:44.470> an

like a wine bottle and yeah so just an
action<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.280> kind<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.519> naturally<00:02:47.120> high<00:02:47.330> enough

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
action is kind of naturally high enough

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.750 
action is kind of naturally high enough
to<00:02:48.230> make<00:02:48.380> slide<00:02:48.739> really<00:02:48.950> easy<00:02:49.160> I'm<00:02:49.340> not<00:02:49.370> even

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
to make slide really easy I'm not even

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.490 
to make slide really easy I'm not even
coming<00:02:50.150> close<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.450> Freddie<00:02:50.840> now<00:02:51.019> just<00:02:51.260> because

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
the guitar is so poorly made it's

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.590 
the guitar is so poorly made it's
perfect<00:02:55.280> for<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:56.030> just<00:02:56.239> kinda<00:02:56.450> has<00:02:56.569> a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
perfect for this it just kinda has a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.289 
perfect for this it just kinda has a
certain<00:02:56.959> certain<00:02:57.610> junky<00:02:58.610> quality<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.180> it

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299
