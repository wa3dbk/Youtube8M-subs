better<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.629> bit<00:00:54.719> slouch<00:00:55.019> II

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079

almost<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.129> mean<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.429> lot<00:00:56.609> of<00:00:56.640> us<00:00:56.820> work<00:00:57.199> but<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
almost I mean a lot of us work but I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.279 
almost I mean a lot of us work but I
thought<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> nice

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
thought it was kind of nice

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:13.280 
thought it was kind of nice
so<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.620> I'll<00:01:01.710> show<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.859> how<00:01:01.979> I<00:01:02.100> did<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.800 

I<00:01:13.380> already<00:01:13.980> have<00:01:14.220> way

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I already have way

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.520 
I already have way
okay<00:01:16.530> sealed<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.130> taped<00:01:17.580> together<00:01:18.530> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
okay sealed and taped together and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
okay sealed and taped together and
actually<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.070> some<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.730> other<00:01:20.880> ones<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.210> put

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
actually in some of the other ones I put

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.850 
actually in some of the other ones I put
the<00:01:21.840> tape<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> little<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:22.320> further<00:01:22.530> down<00:01:22.650> but

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the tape a little bit further down but

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.400 
the tape a little bit further down but
it'll<00:01:22.980> still<00:01:23.190> work<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.580> demonstration

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
it'll still work for this demonstration

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.040 
it'll still work for this demonstration
so<00:01:25.410> I<00:01:25.440> have<00:01:25.620> a<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.920> end<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.190> comes<00:01:26.340> up

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
so I have a little end that comes up

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.160 
so I have a little end that comes up
I'll<00:01:28.050> go<00:01:28.260> down<00:01:28.440> over<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> bottom

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.999 

flatten<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:31.980> out

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.859 

let<00:01:36.549> this<00:01:36.789> make<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.060> little<00:01:37.299> corner<00:01:37.600> kind<00:01:37.750> of

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
let this make a little corner kind of

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.330 
let this make a little corner kind of
like<00:01:37.960> Hospital<00:01:38.439> corner<00:01:38.740> if<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:38.920> ever<00:01:39.130> made

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340

and you're wrapping around

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.179 
and you're wrapping around
you<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.850> kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.060> keep<00:01:48.270> going

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
you just kind of keep going

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.789 
you just kind of keep going
and<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.820> loose<00:01:51.140> beginning

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
and that loose beginning

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.310 
and that loose beginning
kind<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.400> sets<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.760> stage<00:01:55.060> for<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:56.200> way

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
kind of sets the stage for the way

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.539 
kind of sets the stage for the way
you're<00:01:56.440> going<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.619> wrap<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.130> loosely<00:01:57.220> nice

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
you're going to wrap it loosely nice

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.520 
you're going to wrap it loosely nice
dill<00:01:57.880> it's<00:01:58.450> pretty<00:01:58.690> snug<00:01:58.780> when<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.170> get<00:01:59.380> this
