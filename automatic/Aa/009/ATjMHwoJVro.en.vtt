like hunter and I have too big a feat
that's<00:01:46.850> why<00:01:47.000> they<00:01:47.149> made<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.450> legacy<00:01:47.899> for<00:01:48.170> you

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
that's why they made the legacy for you

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.490 
that's why they made the legacy for you
it's<00:01:48.830> a<00:01:49.009> mid<00:01:49.759> wide<00:01:49.970> version<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.720> SL<00:01:51.140> so

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
it's a mid wide version of the SL so

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.210 
it's a mid wide version of the SL so
same<00:01:52.190> flex<00:01:52.570> same<00:01:53.650> geometries<00:01:54.650> only

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
same flex same geometries only

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.430 
same flex same geometries only
difference<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.670> it's<00:01:55.880> slightly<00:01:56.210> wider<00:01:56.600> it's

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
difference is it's slightly wider it's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.380 
difference is it's slightly wider it's
not<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.650> full<00:01:57.920> wide<00:01:58.130> it's<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.460> mid<00:01:58.670> wide<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.240> it's

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
not a full wide it's a mid wide so it's

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.180 
not a full wide it's a mid wide so it's
still<00:01:59.630> going<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.870> be<00:01:59.930> snappy<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.159> responsive

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
still going to be snappy and responsive

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.340 
still going to be snappy and responsive
it's<00:02:01.940> not<00:02:02.090> going<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.450> dead<00:02:02.900> edge<00:02:03.170> to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's not going to have that dead edge to

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.020 
it's not going to have that dead edge to
edge<00:02:03.470> feeling<00:02:03.979> like<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.190> lot<00:02:04.400> of<00:02:04.549> wider<00:02:04.729> boards

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
edge feeling like a lot of wider boards

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.570 
edge feeling like a lot of wider boards
do<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:06.049> it's<00:02:06.320> also<00:02:06.500> going<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.799> be<00:02:06.920> reinforced

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
do but it's also going to be reinforced

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.240 
do but it's also going to be reinforced
stiffened<00:02:08.450> up<00:02:08.540> a<00:02:08.660> little<00:02:08.869> bit<00:02:09.019> just<00:02:09.799> overall

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
stiffened up a little bit just overall

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.670 
stiffened up a little bit just overall
reinforce<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.450> bigger<00:02:11.660> guys<00:02:11.900> or<00:02:12.320> if<00:02:12.560> you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
reinforce for you bigger guys or if you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.610 
reinforce for you bigger guys or if you
just<00:02:12.709> got<00:02:12.980> bigger<00:02:13.190> feet<00:02:13.519> you<00:02:13.700> hate<00:02:13.970> toe<00:02:14.209> drag

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
just got bigger feet you hate toe drag

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.560 
just got bigger feet you hate toe drag
this<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.830> good<00:02:15.950> one<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.130> look<00:02:16.340> at<00:02:16.549> it's<00:02:17.209> the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
this is a good one to look at it's the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.690 
this is a good one to look at it's the
legacy<00:02:18.110> from<00:02:18.320> never<00:02:18.739> summer<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.310> got<00:02:19.459> into<00:02:19.580> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
legacy from never summer we got into the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.120 
legacy from never summer we got into the
tactics
