00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.149
 mirrors 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:14.419
 a good mood 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.799
 among the events 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.759
 at the same time there is no impact 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.759
 but also of the party 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 it is difficult to mount 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.569
 was worth time 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.800
 then we have differences 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 it's been 28 years since I'm here it's the position light 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.330
 two years for which with the hat is the dipped beam 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.900
 that of the outside is the fact of road 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.560
 below we have the most time 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.790
 however we have the fog lights 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.070
 they are your own 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.860
 only just now they are on track 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.360
 as to the registration obviously that the two hostages are clean the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 right way 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.780
 we have here 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 capelli relations with Iran 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.450
 at the level of the worst film that is missing 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.840
 it is in good condition there is no tear cutei 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.650
 he is here the inflation valve 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.950
 his success with girls 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.830
 where the passenger airbag is deactivated 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.830
 difficult to find the key 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.830
 then, we have 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.380
 child safety 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.770
 up she is accused thomas cook 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.770
 winnie is unusable 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.820
 in this triangle we have the red light and let it know 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.990
 on the other side it's the same and if we have the third stop light 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.140
 in France where there is the flashing 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.540
 backing up 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.110
 the fog lights 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.110
 the reflective device 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.820
 why is it here in the middle 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 there is of course the agenais club 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:10.139
 to change the bulbs 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.049
 we take off on a bicycle 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.659
 he had alerted the 32nd biscan especially the block and from the back to change 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.579
 the lightbulbs 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 in the box yesterday the triangle of pre-signaling 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.489
 if there is of course the spare wheel and all that goes with 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.089
 we will do all this 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.399
 difficult for fuel 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.619
 so we are not mistaken for fuel 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.279
 when refueling 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.800
 we do not smoke the phone by afp 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 the search engine was soon to become one of our partners 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.369
 then we will benefit I am very proud to be here 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.259
 so it remains to be verified 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.089
 the little beast of playoff 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.849
 it's for the air pressure of the tires 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.579
 now so let's check under the hood to see the part 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.699
 mechanical 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.699
 the perp or opens 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.179
 here we have the security without kidding 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.809
 belga group 11:20 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.229
 we found the nets from the square 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.229
 there we have the coolant levels is ok 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.919
 here it is him the engine menu langon engine 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.129
 we have to gauge so we check the engine oil level 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.689
 the maximum being in August the minimum down one must be close enough to the maximum 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.849
 the little plug in the cell for the fans the level is in the meantime 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.939
 transparency like that 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.790
 we have here the battery and a second point is the second box 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.509
 with fuses that is next 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.449
 then we have this little kitchen handle 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.609
 it is to adjust the height of the fires 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.449
 and then to change the bulbs 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.399
 we have indicated 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.889
 small blanquette one removes the lid made part of a large field 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.749
