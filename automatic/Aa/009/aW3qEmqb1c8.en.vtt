00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you know I don't bolt to John numbers

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.640 
you know I don't bolt to John numbers
and<00:01:03.629> all<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> wide<00:01:03.930> open<00:01:04.199> numbers<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.530> make

and all the wide open numbers to make

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.620 
and all the wide open numbers to make
the<00:01:04.739> bikes<00:01:04.949> work<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> best<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.420> come

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the bikes work the best they all come

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.840 
the bikes work the best they all come
with<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.500> they're<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:08.820> just

with with this they're just they're just

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.100 
with with this they're just they're just
dirt<00:01:09.119> bike<00:01:09.299> numbers<00:01:09.600> done<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> street

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
dirt bike numbers done on the street

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.859 
dirt bike numbers done on the street
bike<00:01:10.350> stuff<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> diagrams<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.689> where

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
bike stuff and the diagrams of where

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.960 
bike stuff and the diagrams of where
that<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.350> input<00:01:13.770> output<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.280> ground

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that the input output and ground

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.469 
that the input output and ground
terminals<00:01:15.330> go<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.909> if<00:01:17.909> anything<00:01:18.180> did<00:01:18.420> happen

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
terminals go so if anything did happen

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
terminals go so if anything did happen
and<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:21.780> know<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.049> take<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> take<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and you know you just take the take the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.300 
and you know you just take the take the
source<00:01:23.400> hook<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.530> leads<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.009> here

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
source hook it up in these leads in here

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:35.929 
source hook it up in these leads in here
and<00:01:30.350> when<00:01:31.350> these<00:01:31.500> things<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.829> loosened<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:34.939> as

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and when these things are loosened up as

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
and when these things are loosened up as
you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.600> turn<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> lock<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> down

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.320 

so<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.490> adjust<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:45.970> anything<00:01:46.210> you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
so you can adjust it to anything you

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.310 
so you can adjust it to anything you
want<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.450> don't<00:01:49.630> have<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.870> touch<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.080> to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
want you don't have to touch it to

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.900 
want you don't have to touch it to
change<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.680> very<00:01:50.860> much<00:01:51.010> there's<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.700> very

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
change it very much there's a very

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.030 
change it very much there's a very

right amount of fuel for idle the Honda
is<00:02:00.280> really<00:02:00.580> 0.45<00:02:02.010> 2.5<00:02:03.010> 1<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.630> go<00:02:04.750> below<00:02:05.020> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
is really 0.45 2.5 1 you go below that

is really 0.45 2.5 1 you go below that
it<00:02:07.840> doesn't<00:02:08.110> get<00:02:08.230> enough<00:02:08.410> fuel<00:02:08.650> you<00:02:08.830> go<00:02:08.920> above

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
it doesn't get enough fuel you go above

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.010 
it doesn't get enough fuel you go above
that<00:02:09.250> point<00:02:09.730> 5<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.060> gets<00:02:10.300> too<00:02:10.450> much<00:02:10.600> fuel<00:02:10.840> it's

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
that point 5 to gets too much fuel it's

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.730 
that point 5 to gets too much fuel it's
not<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.350> start

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
not going to start

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.100 
not going to start
I<00:02:11.970> found<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.120> point<00:02:13.300> five<00:02:13.510> zero<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.960> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
I found that point five zero is the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.030 
I found that point five zero is the
perfect<00:02:14.500> setting<00:02:14.920> for<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.850> Honda<00:02:16.570> it's<00:02:17.020> just<00:02:17.830> by

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
perfect setting for a Honda it's just by

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.890 
perfect setting for a Honda it's just by
the<00:02:18.070> tip<00:02:18.700> point<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.450> as<00:02:19.570> soon<00:02:19.720> as<00:02:19.810> you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the tip point so just as soon as you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.980 
the tip point so just as soon as you
open<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.290> starts<00:02:20.530> get<00:02:20.710> more<00:02:20.860> fuel<00:02:21.870> let's<00:02:22.870> say

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
open it starts get more fuel let's say

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.140 
open it starts get more fuel let's say
this<00:02:23.140> thing<00:02:23.290> was<00:02:23.410> set<00:02:23.560> at<00:02:23.680> 0.5<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.430> get<00:02:25.000> too

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
this thing was set at 0.5 to get too

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.820 
this thing was set at 0.5 to get too
much<00:02:25.330> fuel<00:02:25.540> wouldn't<00:02:25.960> even<00:02:26.050> start<00:02:26.440> you
