 showed ways of applying technology 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.360
 strengthen natural nail gel 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.180
 varnish and of course that many of you 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.420
 shoot this video i will show you how 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.920
 gel polish is removed for this to us 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.940
 I will need to have this 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 ready-made foil on glue 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.230
 Sponge today I will show you on this 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.190
 foil and show how using a simple 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.100
 food foil and sponge which I already 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.110
 pre- cut cut gel polish 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.620
 The first thing the wizard begins 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.800
 manicure 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:04.489
 it is always disinfecting the hands of customers and 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.770
 of my 2 I want to tell you 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.380
 some kind of a secret maybe 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.990
 to be for someone it will not be a secret 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.810
 the strongest that is gel system 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.090
 varnish is top that is its glossy 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.310
 surface in order for us to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.030
 high quality and fast enough to remove 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.130
 gel varnish 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 you need to take a file for 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.979
 natural nails in this case I have 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.009
 emerald in trouble which has 180 by 180 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.640
 grit 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:39.450
 I am very easy movement 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.330
 damages the surface of our top like me 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 already said he is the most 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.430
 strong precisely for its fortress 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.950
 he does not miss the gel and remuver 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.370
 thanks to which the removal takes place 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.690
 gel polish 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.280
 damage is by no means 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.870
 cut down or drank to your nails 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.710
 I want to warn you immediately that 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.680
 pushing at me especially, I do not have any 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.680
 just literally scratching the surface 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.240
 leaves i pick play 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.340
 farther 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.590
 There are several ways several 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.849
 liquids are a kind of liquid for 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.400
 gel polish remover 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.819
 it may be hurt henry moore either izi 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.629
 Flo 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.360
 gel yarim him and since our system 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.610
 gel varnishes 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.340
 consists of one hundred percent this week we 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.190
 calmly we can use dry gel 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.230
 wise 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.569
 can the parties begin as i say u 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.090
 me in advance chopped sponge i 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:03:00.110
 plenty of wetting it 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:02.530
 delrin liquids and then put on 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.530
 nail 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.739
 you must have tight 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.220
 to fit the sponge over the entire surface 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.220
 the nail 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.900
 and as I promised I will show you how it is 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.569
 make you ready stock 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.120
 in the same way, I wet a lot 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:43.420
 Sponge is convenient enough to attach it 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:43.420
 nail surface and wrap 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.690
 so we wrapped all the fingers I'm very 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.360
 often hear from their familiar masters 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.330
 either from the students that sometimes they 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.730
 hold wrapped fingers for 40 minutes 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.520
 and by the hour and why is that something does not come down and 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.260
 something is not working the biggest mistake 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.480
 which you can allow this 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.940
 overdo the time it needs 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.690
 Balak to ger more precisely for its 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.340
 withdrawing time 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.970
 we will need only 10 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.940
 minutes no more and no less no less 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.120
 because we cook damaging 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.970
 top surface yes we need 10 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.090
 minutes to our best to the best 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.990
 penetrated the trace all the layers of gel polish and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.390
 raised 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.790
 without damaging the nail if you 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.320
 keep this time with you 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.180
 the reverse process begins 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.120
 what happens is weathered fluid and 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.050
 your gel polish is a place to crush 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.440
 on the contrary hardens 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.360
 back a mistake that is made more often 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.580
 the whole manicurist is when 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.010
 simultaneously remove all the foil 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.080
 what happens when interacting with 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.700
 oxygenated your gel polish 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.700
 harden back that is going on 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.470
 backlash i advise you to work 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.380
 the conveyor method in the same order 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.870
 which 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.970
 worn and wrapped Olga finger you 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.910
 can light and teach with such a tool 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.320
 like a push 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.520
 be sure to move exclusively on 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.520
 nail growth 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:48.520
 then we take on the grinder and fine 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:55.120
 easy movement without much pressure 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:55.120
 remove the remnants of our gel polish 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.100
 in fact by this very method 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.770
 gel lacquer is removed and why 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.530
 warn you kind of probably 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.080
 on guard various gel polishes or get 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.760
 buy huskies are removed very differently 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.620
 some fast enough some 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.410
 slow enough it all depends on 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.510
 how strong top or how much 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.040
 good adhesion coupling between its 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.530
 mitral nail and mediocre themselves 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.500
 I hope this video video 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.780
 though it is short enough 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.310
 liked and will be useful to your 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.970
 daily life manicurist 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.530
 experiment don't be afraid 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.990
 experiments you must all 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.670
 work with you was as always yours 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.670
 chains for example but for now
