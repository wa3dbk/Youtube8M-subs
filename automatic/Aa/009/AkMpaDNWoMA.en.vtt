00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello guys welcome to all the first 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.930
 course of ideas workshop on 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.750
 processing of sugar paste today 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.570
 as the first Italian thing to cover one 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.040
 cake that was a little more brigo if yes 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.790
 makes you drink more it really becomes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.130
 simple 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.350
 what is needed is obviously pasta 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 of sugar then it takes sugar 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.240
 or to examine careers and pasta 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.340
 with the rolling pin and their land there 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.800
 pastry to trim the dough with the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 right open the door I pasta 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.610
 kneaded loggia to warm up a little 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.000
 tell her now I am lying on 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.010
 floured green chopping board with ours 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.320
 it will be veil to avoid yes 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 sticky to arouse the workshop of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.110
 ideas also find the table with the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.329
 proportions where you can see how much 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.670
 sugar paste serves according to 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.420
 cake size you owe yours 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.170
 first ever in a small cake 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.780
 by 15 centimeters and you will need about 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.990
 500 years to start over 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.869
 I suggest you use a little of that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.250
 pasta and make a little thicker 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 than it should be 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.729
 normal thickness so that it breaks 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.880
 with a little more difficulty you will succeed 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.620
 to spread it 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.260
 the thickness is normal to make 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:34.200
 covers of 3 or 4 mm the most important 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.050
 to avoid getting too many grillini 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.530
 and on the cake they will make you that absurd 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.310
 if at least ten or fifteen centimeters a 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.400
 a little larger than the diameter already in the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.270
 layer, however, just including too 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.270
 like it 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.849
 this our daily 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:26.260
 the height of the side is a little bit of 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:29.140
 more step we turn than ours 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.140
 story on the hank so we follow the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.440
 our cake and gently only 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.000
 let's go back over looking for the hundred more 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.269
 possible in the pasta because once 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.459
 after this operation lift them 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.560
 repositioning it becomes risky because 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.239
 one risks precisely this 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.030
 point there is a difficult thing to do 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.760
 that of making the sides stick well not 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.129
 you have to pull the dough down 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.629
 because the risk part is this 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.159
 part of the edge that is the one that is 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.599
 can prepare so must 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:04.030
 simply bring the pasta closer 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:07.440
 trying to move the curly 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.440
 towards the bottom 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.560
 then you see the extra pasta at the end 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:28.650
 he finds himself out of the cake and not above 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:31.440
 to our cake if in part 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.570
 bottom remain a little bit of folds not 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.150
 it does nothing because it is a part that anyway 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.450
 it is usually covered with ribbons 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.830
 that with these eyes therefore usually 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.170
 not ok we covered the whole 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.760
 our wrong would adhere to the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.760
 peeled pasta with the pastry wheel 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.650
 we turn around and cut off all of it 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.540
 the extra pasta can also be a 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.180
 far from the edge of the cake as much 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.180
 to then trim it later
