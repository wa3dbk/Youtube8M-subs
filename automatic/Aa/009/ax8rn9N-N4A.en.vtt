each<00:00:39.320> one<00:00:39.530> of<00:00:39.559> our<00:00:39.710> stories<00:00:40.129> at<00:00:40.280> Pixar

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
each one of our stories at Pixar

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.479 
each one of our stories at Pixar
requires<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.149> lot<00:00:41.480> of<00:00:41.510> research<00:00:41.960> because

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
requires a lot of research because

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.500 
requires a lot of research because
sometimes<00:00:43.489> we're<00:00:43.609> working<00:00:43.819> on<00:00:43.909> ants<00:00:44.179> or

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
sometimes we're working on ants or

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.279 
sometimes we're working on ants or
monsters<00:00:45.289> or<00:00:45.589> or<00:00:45.859> fish<00:00:46.730> or<00:00:47.120> in<00:00:47.690> this<00:00:47.749> case<00:00:47.809> rats

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
monsters or or fish or in this case rats

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.439 
monsters or or fish or in this case rats
and<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:49.550> always<00:00:49.729> different<00:00:50.030> in<00:00:50.239> that<00:00:50.269> you

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
and so it's always different in that you

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.169 
and so it's always different in that you
have<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.929> you<00:00:51.589> know<00:00:51.679> learn<00:00:51.859> a<00:00:51.920> lot<00:00:52.159> about<00:00:52.219> you

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
have to you know learn a lot about you

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.360 
have to you know learn a lot about you
know<00:00:53.269> a<00:00:53.300> fish<00:00:53.600> or<00:00:53.870> in<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.050> case<00:00:54.109> a<00:00:54.469> rap<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.309> so

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
know a fish or in this case a rap and so

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.919 
know a fish or in this case a rap and so
we<00:00:55.489> had<00:00:55.579> to<00:00:55.639> do<00:00:55.729> a<00:00:55.760> lot<00:00:55.819> of<00:00:55.940> study<00:00:56.239> on<00:00:56.449> how<00:00:56.479> rats

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
we had to do a lot of study on how rats

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.889 
we had to do a lot of study on how rats
really<00:00:57.319> move<00:00:57.819> what<00:00:58.819> their<00:00:58.999> psychology<00:00:59.719> is

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
really move what their psychology is

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.610 
really move what their psychology is
what<00:01:00.260> their<00:01:00.409> Anatomy<00:01:00.859> is<00:01:00.999> and<00:01:01.999> then<00:01:02.350> take<00:01:03.350> bits

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
what their Anatomy is and then take bits

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.100 
what their Anatomy is and then take bits
of<00:01:03.829> that<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.250> not<00:01:04.309> recreate<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:04.850> real<00:01:05.360> rat<00:01:05.690> but

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
of that and not recreate a real rat but

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.410 
of that and not recreate a real rat but
combine<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.040> with<00:01:07.100> human<00:01:07.730> characteristics

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
combine that with human characteristics

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.990 
combine that with human characteristics
so<00:01:08.510> that<00:01:08.660> we<00:01:08.750> have<00:01:08.780> sort<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.500> rat<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.700> has

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
so that we have sort of a rat that has

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.990 
so that we have sort of a rat that has
humanistic<00:01:11.540> behaviors<00:01:12.200> oh<00:01:12.520> I<00:01:13.520> brought<00:01:13.940> you

case<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.179> know<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.539> had<00:01:39.659> an<00:01:39.780> idea<00:01:39.929> that<00:01:40.409> was

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
case you know we had an idea that was

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.300 
case you know we had an idea that was
scripted<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.520> by<00:01:41.759> Brad<00:01:42.030> Bird<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:43.219> you<00:01:44.219> know

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
scripted out by Brad Bird and you know

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
scripted out by Brad Bird and you know
the<00:01:44.429> story<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.880> rat<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> wants<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the story of a rat that wants to be a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.779 
the story of a rat that wants to be a
chef<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> real<00:01:46.950> challenge<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.340> animate

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
chef was a real challenge to animate

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.789 
chef was a real challenge to animate
because<00:01:48.179> we<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> show<00:01:49.319> again<00:01:49.679> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
because we have to show again this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
because we have to show again this
realistic<00:01:50.159> rat<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.729> also<00:01:50.850> he<00:01:51.149> has<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> have

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
realistic rat but also he has to have

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.520 
realistic rat but also he has to have
humanistic<00:01:52.700> qualities<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.210> order<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.289> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
humanistic qualities in order to to be a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.109 
humanistic qualities in order to to be a
chef<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.069> so<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.549> show<00:01:56.700> him<00:01:56.729> grow

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
chef and so we have to show him grow

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.270 
chef and so we have to show him grow
more<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.600> human<00:01:58.020> throughout<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> film

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
more and more human throughout the film

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
more and more human throughout the film
and<00:01:59.789> I<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.569> was<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> challenge<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and I think that was a challenge you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.770 
and I think that was a challenge you
know<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:03.240> script<00:02:03.539> to<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
know going from the script to the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.529 
know going from the script to the
storyboard<00:02:04.580> where<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.729> camera<00:02:06.090> angles<00:02:06.390> are

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
storyboard where the camera angles are

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.410 
storyboard where the camera angles are
visualized<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.190> our<00:02:08.789> models<00:02:09.269> of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
visualized and then to our models of

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.969 
visualized and then to our models of
these<00:02:09.539> rats<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.319> making<00:02:10.590> sure<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
these rats and making sure that the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.250 
these rats and making sure that the
articulation<00:02:11.670> was<00:02:11.849> correct<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:13.079> their

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
articulation was correct so that their

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.690 
articulation was correct so that their
wrists<00:02:13.620> are<00:02:13.769> bending<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.190> right<00:02:14.400> place

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
wrists are bending in the right place

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.640 
wrists are bending in the right place
and<00:02:15.000> then<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.630> animating<00:02:16.200> them<00:02:16.319> thinking

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and then to animating them thinking

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.860 
and then to animating them thinking
about<00:02:16.769> their<00:02:16.950> thoughts<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.849> their<00:02:17.940> feelings

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
about their thoughts and their feelings

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.300 
about their thoughts and their feelings
and<00:02:19.019> showing<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> face<00:02:19.950> showing

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and showing that on the face showing

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.100 
and showing that on the face showing
that<00:02:20.549> in<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> body<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.690> appears<00:02:22.079> that

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
that in the body so it appears that

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.500 
that in the body so it appears that
these<00:02:22.260> guys<00:02:22.500> are<00:02:22.560> thinking<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.280> their<00:02:23.430> own<00:02:23.579> you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
these guys are thinking on their own you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.410 
these guys are thinking on their own you
know<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> huge<00:02:25.829> challenge<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:27.000> whole

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
know is a huge challenge the whole

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.900 
know is a huge challenge the whole
process<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:28.470> us<00:02:28.590> takes<00:02:28.980> about<00:02:29.099> four<00:02:29.610> years

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
process for us takes about four years

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.000 
process for us takes about four years
for<00:02:30.390> supervising<00:02:31.200> animators<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:31.769> get<00:02:31.920> on

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
for supervising animators we get on

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.580 
for supervising animators we get on
early<00:02:32.370> we're<00:02:33.000> involved<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
early we're involved with the the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.129 
early we're involved with the the
character<00:02:35.069> design<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.120> articulation<00:02:37.019> of

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
character design and the articulation of

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.129 
character design and the articulation of
those<00:02:37.319> characters<00:02:38.180> because<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.359> that's<00:02:39.930> our

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
those characters because it's that's our

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.599 
those characters because it's that's our
tool<00:02:41.100> our<00:02:41.280> puppet<00:02:41.670> in<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.880> sense<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.500> then<00:02:43.950> it

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
tool our puppet in a sense and then it

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.229 
tool our puppet in a sense and then it
goes<00:02:45.060> all<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.269> way<00:02:45.480> into<00:02:47.060> supporting<00:02:48.060> this

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
goes all the way into supporting this

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.240 
goes all the way into supporting this
this<00:02:48.510> whole<00:02:48.690> crew<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.019> folks<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.950> actual

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
this whole crew of folks and the actual

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.210 
this whole crew of folks and the actual
animation<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:52.019> from<00:02:52.440> particular<00:02:53.010> took

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
animation of this from particular took

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.699 
animation of this from particular took
about<00:02:53.430> ten<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.880> twelve<00:02:54.120> months<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:55.319> actually

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
about ten to twelve months to actually

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.460 
about ten to twelve months to actually
animate<00:02:56.420> but<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> lot<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.630> our<00:02:57.840> job<00:02:57.989> was<00:02:58.170> also

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
animate but a lot of our job was also

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.620 
animate but a lot of our job was also
keeping<00:02:58.799> consistency<00:02:59.130> because<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.510> know

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
keeping consistency because you know

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.699 
keeping consistency because you know
you'll<00:03:00.780> have<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.959> scene<00:03:01.200> where<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.410> looks<00:03:01.560> like

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
you'll have a scene where it looks like

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.460 
you'll have a scene where it looks like
it's<00:03:01.889> all<00:03:02.040> either<00:03:02.760> hopefully<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:04.049> just<00:03:04.170> an

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
it's all either hopefully it's just an

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.470 
it's all either hopefully it's just an
actor<00:03:04.859> portraying<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.370> character<00:03:05.400> or<00:03:05.910> that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
actor portraying the character or that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.479 
actor portraying the character or that
it's<00:03:06.870> one<00:03:07.170> animator<00:03:07.590> perhaps<00:03:07.950> animating<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
it's one animator perhaps animating the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.309 
it's one animator perhaps animating the
whole<00:03:08.609> scene<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.450> reality<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.989> get<00:03:10.109> one<00:03:10.230> of

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
whole scene in reality to get one of

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.020 
whole scene in reality to get one of
these<00:03:10.410> films<00:03:10.680> done<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.639> know<00:03:11.760> we<00:03:11.880> have<00:03:12.000> to

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
these films done you know we have to

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.580 
these films done you know we have to
have<00:03:12.239> multiple<00:03:12.450> animators<00:03:13.139> working<00:03:13.470> on

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
have multiple animators working on

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.819 
have multiple animators working on
different<00:03:13.769> scenes<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.230> part<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.349> our<00:03:16.500> job

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
different scenes and so part of our job

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.910 
different scenes and so part of our job
is<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.130> help<00:03:17.459> Brad<00:03:17.790> keep<00:03:18.450> consistency<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.739> that

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
is to help Brad keep consistency so that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.789 
is to help Brad keep consistency so that
each<00:03:20.340> scene<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:21.450> progressing<00:03:22.200> emotionally

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
each scene is progressing emotionally

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.470 
each scene is progressing emotionally
and<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.069> acting<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.549> fitting<00:03:23.849> from<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.209> scene

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
and the acting is fitting from one scene

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.500 
and the acting is fitting from one scene
to<00:03:24.510> another<00:03:24.630> as<00:03:25.019> if<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.440> was<00:03:25.560> done<00:03:25.709> by<00:03:25.920> one

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
to another as if it was done by one

sequence this this will change hands

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.119 
sequence this this will change hands
five<00:03:50.549> times<00:03:50.939> in<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.720> particular<00:03:51.959> case<00:03:52.500> five
