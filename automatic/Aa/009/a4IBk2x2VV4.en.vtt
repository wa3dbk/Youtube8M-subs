figure it feels again with the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760 
figure it feels again with the
flimsiness<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> figure<00:00:58.140> there's<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> lot

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
flimsiness of the figure there's a lot

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.950 
flimsiness of the figure there's a lot
of<00:00:58.980> cable<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.789> everywhere<00:01:00.300> there's<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960

lot<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.530> moving<00:01:01.770> pieces<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
lot of moving pieces here and there that

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.050 
lot of moving pieces here and there that
don't<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.140> snap<00:01:04.500> into<00:01:04.739> place<00:01:04.979> also<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
don't really snap into place also the

don't really snap into place also the
head<00:01:06.270> does<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.780> spin<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> found<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> hard

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
head does not spin I found out the hard

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
head does not spin I found out the hard
way<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.520> there's<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> little<00:01:09.210> bit

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
way as you can see there's a little bit

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.210 
way as you can see there's a little bit
of<00:01:09.810> hairline<00:01:10.260> crack<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.799> there<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.010> actually

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
of hairline crack right there I actually

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.789 
of hairline crack right there I actually
broke<00:01:11.640> off<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.510> piece<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.020> his<00:01:13.140> neck<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.710> his

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
broke off this piece of his neck of his

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.649 
broke off this piece of his neck of his
head's<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.369> these<00:01:14.549> external<00:01:15.150> fangs<00:01:15.479> or
