00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hi girls then the last time the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.429
 course we talked about the 50s trick 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.410
 and I loved it a trick 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.780
 which I never did since when 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.340
 I did the lesson very often 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.049
 I love it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.310
 then first of all when it comes to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.650
 trick 50 years refers only 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.369
 a person to marilyn monroe obviously 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.050
 and then red eyeliner black lips 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.590
 eyebrows well defined hair mgr 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.960
 since I did this lesson done 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.719
 case a bit to the newspapers etc. 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.190
 noticed that a trick used by dai 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.620
 star serves us black cream liner's 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.239
 mascara blush pink red lipstick 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.180
 laricio toll the thin plate e 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.960
 let's start with the eyes I use in this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 zoeva cream eyeliner tutorial 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.180
 slack lace I bought that too 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.579
 di chico teacher told me he was 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 very liquid and would have put us one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.630
 life to dry and then there 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.939
 neither advice to you in cream 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.860
 systems a bit of product on the back 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.810
 of the hand and start tracing one 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.159
 line in what will make the final point 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.740
 what we want 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.229
 the end of our of our line 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.439
 of eyeliner and then proceed making gods 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.790
 many strikers are many strikers 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.689
 indeed the rhyme of eyelashes 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 very easy it is easier than that 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.090
 it seems even before I had never used it 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.630
 cream eyeliner because I thought it was 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.329
 very complicated and instead the first time 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.299
 that I did well then 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.950
 really easy so we do it more 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.790
 pass if we want more color 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 intense 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.550
 and then to make the final queue you can 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.190
 do as you please anyway 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.020
 follow the natural shape of the eye e 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.860
 the brush will make it from the sex is a 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.750
 nice thin brush like this then 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.460
 if you like fake eyelashes 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.080
 I applied my own false eyelashes 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.450
 those of the Chinese and 2 euros the 90 oh well 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.150
 however I usually never use them therefore 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.240
 we apply mascara both above and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.240
 under 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.370
 then we're going to define the eyebrows 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.560
 because in the fifties the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.319
 eyebrows are just about right first 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.130
 together with the lips and then the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.130
 let's define 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.980
 ok let's move on to the lips red lips 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.590
 I use a Chanel red lipstick that they had 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.560
 given years ago that is still preserved 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.860
 very well in the lips must be 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.140
 short and cat's tongue and let's proceed 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.330
 doing the primary maybe the outline e 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.130
 then the inside but this is a bit 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.320
 how it is better you is not a rule 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:15.260
 generic pink blush I am a blush 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.250
 rose called beautiful benefit bamboo 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.690
 beyond the name is very nice anyway 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.300
 the blush must be pink but above all 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.710
 from the clicked on the cheekbone not to 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.950
 below as is usually done 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.700
 ok the trick is over lite a lot 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.510
 simple but still does its figure 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.530
 we make the side line and then with the 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.590
 iron we take a rare lock 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:46.100
 big of hair and to make a wave 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.459
 pretty massive, you can use either the 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.560
 iron than the thin plate obviously 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.160
 with iron they will come more biting with 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.250
 the plate will be more like a wave dry 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.520
 but as you prefer I really have little 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.710
 patience I do 23 then I let it go 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.570
 usually 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.460
 however here you see the take of the 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:15.060
 plate and pass the plate and turn 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.530
 towards the outside pass a bit of lacquer 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.019
 less if you have hair like mine 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.610
 smooth that after 5 seconds the skis return 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.610
 pass milk time 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.890
 ok tutorial finished but you enjoyed it 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.690
 that you come in handy will definitely come back 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.770

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:46.130

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:50.500
