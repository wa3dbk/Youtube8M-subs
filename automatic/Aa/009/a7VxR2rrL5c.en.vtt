a<00:00:20.880> new<00:00:21.060> motherboard<00:00:22.250> here's<00:00:23.250> your<00:00:23.609> here's<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
a new motherboard here's your here's the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.150 
a new motherboard here's your here's the
best<00:00:24.960> option<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.410> got<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.710> market<00:00:26.039> right

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

best option you got on the market right
now<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.369> think<00:00:26.869> it's<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.930> asrock<00:00:28.609> g41<00:00:29.609> CGS<00:00:31.219> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
now I think it's the asrock g41 CGS and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.840 
now I think it's the asrock g41 CGS and
it<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.790> good<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.440> core<00:00:34.440> 2<00:00:34.620> extreme<00:00:34.649> core<00:00:35.640> 2

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it is good with core 2 extreme core 2

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.770 
it is good with core 2 extreme core 2

up<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.579> interesting<00:00:47.579> note<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.390> one

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
up with interesting note on this one

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.200 
up with interesting note on this one
it's<00:00:49.890> four<00:00:50.550> dimm<00:00:50.969> slots<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.289> are<00:00:52.610> ddr2<00:00:53.610> -

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's four dimm slots but two are ddr2 -

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.799 
it's four dimm slots but two are ddr2 -
or<00:00:54.390> ddr3<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.640> limited<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.780> know

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
or ddr3 so you're not limited you know

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.840 
or ddr3 so you're not limited you know
you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.170> reuse<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.710> ddr2<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.760> your

get up to a 1333 on this and you got

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.109 
get up to a 1333 on this and you got
some<00:01:07.619> ddr3<00:01:08.130> laying<00:01:08.310> around<00:01:08.460> boom<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:09.000> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
some ddr3 laying around boom there you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
some ddr3 laying around boom there you
go<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> anyways<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.530> kind

far I mean I've I've already pulled this

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.870 
far I mean I've I've already pulled this
out<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.140> stuff<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.620> but

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
out like that and stuff like that but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.490 
out like that and stuff like that but
decided<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.910> put<00:02:27.480> everything<00:02:27.630> back<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.380> do

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
decided to put everything back in to do

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.420 
decided to put everything back in to do
my<00:02:28.620> unboxing<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.830> seems<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.310> good

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
my unboxing it seems like it's good

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
my unboxing it seems like it's good
enough<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.670> they're<00:02:33.000> uh<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.500> is

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
enough that they're uh this one is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.449 
enough that they're uh this one is
manufactured<00:02:35.250> by<00:02:35.280> Foxconn<00:02:35.989> who<00:02:37.040> do<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> lot<00:02:38.160> of

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
manufactured by Foxconn who do a lot of

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.830

work<00:02:38.700> actually<00:02:39.330> manufacturing<00:02:40.110> for<00:02:40.410> Apple<00:02:41.840> so

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
work actually manufacturing for Apple so

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.539 
work actually manufacturing for Apple so
the<00:02:43.830> quality<00:02:44.069> should<00:02:44.340> be<00:02:44.760> there<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.510> don't<00:02:46.549> want

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
the quality should be there I don't want

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.320 
the quality should be there I don't want
to<00:02:47.610> get<00:02:47.760> all<00:02:47.850> hooked<00:02:48.060> up<00:02:48.180> we'll<00:02:48.450> find<00:02:49.110> out<00:02:50.330> club

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
to get all hooked up we'll find out club

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.360 

everything's<00:03:34.260> pretty<00:03:34.500> well<00:03:34.769> laid<00:03:34.950> out<00:03:35.130> and

everything's pretty well laid out and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.509 
everything's pretty well laid out and
you<00:03:35.400> still<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:35.930> IDE<00:03:37.160> capabilities<00:03:38.160> which<00:03:38.370> is

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
you still have IDE capabilities which is

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.870 

pretty<00:03:50.459> pretty<00:03:51.209> simple<00:03:51.810> here<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:53.459> back<00:03:53.670> you

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
pretty pretty simple here the back you

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:02.319 
pretty pretty simple here the back you
have<00:03:54.000> your<00:03:54.859> your<00:03:55.859> VGA<00:03:56.280> out<00:03:56.569> land<00:03:57.569> for<00:03:58.109> for<00:03:59.100> USB

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.140 
s4 and 24 pin electrical connections
like<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.880> said<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.389> a<00:04:10.430> micro<00:04:11.430> ATX<00:04:11.549> board

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
like I said this is a micro ATX board

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.570 
like I said this is a micro ATX board
and

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.880 

so<00:04:15.580> far<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.630> shows<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:18.150> ddr3<00:04:19.150> 1333<00:04:19.510> ddr2<00:04:20.290> 800

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
so far this shows a ddr3 1333 ddr2 800

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.230 
so far this shows a ddr3 1333 ddr2 800
dual<00:04:21.010> Channel<00:04:22.800> it's<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:24.010> good<00:04:24.460> stopgap<00:04:25.000> measure

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
dual Channel it's a good stopgap measure

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.580 
dual Channel it's a good stopgap measure

stuff this old these days so you know
turn<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.330> old<00:04:43.510> computer<00:04:43.840> into<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.050> server<00:04:44.290> you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
turn that old computer into a server you

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.260 
turn that old computer into a server you
know<00:04:44.650> use<00:04:45.160> it<00:04:45.190> as<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:45.400> file<00:04:45.610> server<00:04:45.640> a<00:04:46.000> media

server you know these old processors

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.550 
server you know these old processors
it's<00:04:49.690> pretty<00:04:49.930> hard<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.260> kill<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.440> processor<00:04:51.070> and

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
it's pretty hard to kill a processor and

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.320 
it's pretty hard to kill a processor and
you<00:04:53.560> know<00:04:53.650> get<00:04:54.160> extra<00:04:54.520> use<00:04:54.700> out<00:04:54.910> of<00:04:55.030> one<00:04:55.150> you

at one point or somebody did it so good
she<00:05:00.730> used<00:05:00.880> out<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.090> them<00:05:01.380> anyways<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:02.650> is

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
she used out of them anyways this is

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.720 
she used out of them anyways this is
just<00:05:02.920> one<00:05:03.070> option<00:05:04.710> haven't<00:05:05.710> used<00:05:06.370> any<00:05:06.550> other

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
just one option haven't used any other

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.090 
just one option haven't used any other
ones<00:05:06.940> of<00:05:07.390> this<00:05:07.870> magnitude<00:05:08.380> yet<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.890> the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
ones of this magnitude yet of the the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.660 
ones of this magnitude yet of the the
775<00:05:09.820> socket<00:05:10.300> so<00:05:10.650> we'll<00:05:11.650> give<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.950> shot<00:05:11.980> all

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
775 socket so we'll give it a shot all

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.730 
775 socket so we'll give it a shot all
right
