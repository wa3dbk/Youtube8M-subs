00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
online with a mate and one of my

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.580 
online with a mate and one of my
subscribers<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.899> we<00:00:57.899> start<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.350> game

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
subscribers and we start out this game

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.160 
subscribers and we start out this game
and<00:00:59.329> straightaway<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.570> starting<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.960> put<00:01:01.079> us

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and straightaway it's starting to put us

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
and straightaway it's starting to put us
into<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> game<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.800> i'm<00:01:01.859> thinking<00:01:02.059> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
into a game so i'm thinking this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.820 
into a game so i'm thinking this
probably<00:01:03.539> isn't<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.619> good

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830

lobby<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.049> straight<00:01:37.680> away<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:38.100> thinking<00:01:38.130> back

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
lobby so straight away I'm thinking back

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.090 
lobby so straight away I'm thinking back
to<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.090> last<00:01:39.270> time<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> got<00:01:39.659> hacked

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
to the last time I got hacked

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.070 
to the last time I got hacked
the<00:01:40.159> per<00:01:40.310> capita<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.970> all<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.990> I'm

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
the per capita and all this and I'm

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.600 
the per capita and all this and I'm
thinking<00:01:42.290> might<00:01:42.560> need<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.860> find<00:01:43.100> out<00:01:43.280> who's

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
thinking might need to find out who's

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.520 
thinking might need to find out who's
who's<00:01:43.939> doing<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.240> hacking<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.080> I<00:01:45.110> start<00:01:45.470> to

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
who's doing the hacking so I start to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.870 
who's doing the hacking so I start to
run<00:01:45.680> around<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:46.040> bit<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:46.310> I'm<00:01:46.369> trying<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:46.670> chop

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
run around a bit so I'm trying to chop

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.210 
run around a bit so I'm trying to chop
my<00:01:46.909> guys<00:01:47.299> by<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.140> enemy<00:01:48.530> team<00:01:48.710> trying<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.100> work

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
my guys by the enemy team trying to work

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
ninety nine kills as well so it's all a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.149 
ninety nine kills as well so it's all a
bit<00:01:58.850> strange<00:01:59.710> basically<00:02:00.710> turned<00:02:00.950> out<00:02:01.130> that

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
bit strange basically turned out that

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.980 
bit strange basically turned out that
like<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.880> doesn't<00:02:02.090> seem<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.330> be<00:02:02.539> anybody<00:02:02.780> in

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
like it doesn't seem to be anybody in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.990 
like it doesn't seem to be anybody in
the<00:02:03.200> library<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.680> could<00:02:03.950> work<00:02:04.100> out<00:02:04.340> was

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
the library that I could work out was

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.630 
the library that I could work out was
the<00:02:05.240> hacker<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.930> was<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.470> hacked<00:02:06.860> or<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> modded
