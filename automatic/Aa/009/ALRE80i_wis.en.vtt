features<00:01:39.470> blood<00:01:39.980> on<00:01:40.220> off<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:40.760> should<00:01:40.940> have<00:01:41.030> had

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
features blood on off I should have had

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.190 
features blood on off I should have had
on<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.600> whole<00:01:41.720> time<00:01:42.370> and<00:01:43.370> pure<00:01:44.120> music<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:45.050> team

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
on the whole time and pure music I team

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.870 
on the whole time and pure music I team
have<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.500> music<00:01:45.830> on

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.569 

so<00:01:52.450> this<00:01:52.570> looks<00:01:52.689> completely<00:01:53.110> different<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.549> I

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
so this looks completely different so I

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:55.980 
so this looks completely different so I
was<00:01:54.729> playing<00:01:54.969> a<00:01:55.090> different<00:01:55.270> style<00:01:55.719> completely

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
was playing a different style completely

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.440 
was playing a different style completely
I<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:58.090> I<00:01:58.119> like<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.329> other<00:01:58.420> version<00:01:58.630> better

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I think I like the other version better

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.950 
I think I like the other version better
like<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.600> blood<00:02:01.840> though

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.919 

well<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.709> mines<00:02:08.950> look<00:02:09.190> weird<00:02:09.929> they

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
well the mines look weird they

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.120 
well the mines look weird they
definitely<00:02:11.170> look<00:02:11.470> better<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> other

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
definitely look better in the other

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.280 
definitely look better in the other
version

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.399 

so<00:02:17.920> let's<00:02:18.069> turn<00:02:18.459> these<00:02:18.640> options<00:02:19.180> around<00:02:19.409> go

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
so let's turn these options around go

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.979 
so let's turn these options around go
back<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.829> other<00:02:20.950> style<00:02:21.459> just<00:02:22.420> keep<00:02:22.629> blood

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
back to the other style just keep blood

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.520 
back to the other style just keep blood
on

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:45.590 

and<00:02:31.480> no<00:02:32.480> blood<00:02:32.720> there<00:02:33.080> but<00:02:33.410> an<00:02:33.620> explosion

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.850 

and<00:02:46.230> yeah<00:02:46.530> Global's<00:02:47.160> are<00:02:47.280> actually<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.730> hard

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
and yeah Global's are actually this hard

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.620 
and yeah Global's are actually this hard
and<00:02:49.860> my<00:02:50.130> walkthrough<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.090> didn't<00:02:51.420> show<00:02:51.570> that

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and my walkthrough I didn't show that
