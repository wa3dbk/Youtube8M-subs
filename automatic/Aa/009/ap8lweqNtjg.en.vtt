all<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.890> place<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.730> heater<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.779> thermostats

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
all the place the heater the thermostats

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.060 
all the place the heater the thermostats
and<00:00:07.710> also<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.820> NTC<00:00:09.540> sensors<00:00:10.170> we're<00:00:10.620> working

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
and also the NTC sensors we're working

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.650 
and also the NTC sensors we're working
on<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> whirlpool<00:00:11.849> tumble<00:00:12.330> dryer

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
on a whirlpool tumble dryer

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.079 
on a whirlpool tumble dryer
it's<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.320> condenser<00:00:13.889> tumble<00:00:14.070> dryer<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:14.940> this

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
it's a condenser tumble dryer but this

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.390 
it's a condenser tumble dryer but this
video<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.660> also<00:00:15.839> good<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.410> loopnet<00:00:16.859> gladen

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
video is also good for loopnet gladen

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.700 
video is also good for loopnet gladen
and<00:00:17.580> maytag<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> first<00:00:19.109> thing<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.500> need<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and maytag so the first thing we need to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.759 
and maytag so the first thing we need to
do<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.160> remove<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.760> lid<00:00:21.020> on<00:00:22.020> occasions<00:00:22.560> these

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
do is remove the lid on occasions these

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
do is remove the lid on occasions these
can<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.369> sticky<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.150> use<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.539> palm<00:00:24.779> of

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
can be sticky so just use the palm of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.210 
can be sticky so just use the palm of
the<00:00:25.080> hand<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.560> tap<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> backwards<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.890> next

for you to test the element Institute

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.390 
for you to test the element Institute
but<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:23.300> taking<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.959> off<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.069> can

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
but I'm taking it off so you can

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.000 
but I'm taking it off so you can
actually<00:02:25.640> see<00:02:26.150> all<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> thermostats<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
actually see all the thermostats and the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.000 
actually see all the thermostats and the
heater<00:02:28.250> itself<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.080> see<00:02:30.319> one<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.920> the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
I'm changing my meter 2 ohms now and I'm

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.630 
I'm changing my meter 2 ohms now and I'm
going<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.150> connect<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:25.299> thermistor<00:03:26.299> or<00:03:27.640> NTC

now<00:03:32.329> sometimes<00:03:32.930> machines<00:03:33.560> are<00:03:33.769> fitted<00:03:34.100> with

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
now sometimes machines are fitted with

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.069 
now sometimes machines are fitted with
thermostats<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.090> sometimes<00:03:35.780> they<00:03:36.049> are

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
thermostats and sometimes they are

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.670

fitted with NTC sensors NTC sensors are

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.099 
fitted with NTC sensors NTC sensors are
becoming<00:03:40.040> more<00:03:40.340> popular<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:41.060> modern<00:03:41.720> machines

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
becoming more popular on modern machines

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.800 
becoming more popular on modern machines
now<00:03:43.070> I've<00:03:43.280> made<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.519> couple<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.940> test<00:03:44.209> leads<00:03:44.510> up

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
now I've made a couple of test leads up

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.199 
now I've made a couple of test leads up
so<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.079> can<00:03:45.320> actually<00:03:45.680> have<00:03:45.859> my<00:03:46.130> meter<00:03:46.760> probes

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
so I can actually have my meter probes

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.640 
so I can actually have my meter probes
in<00:03:47.510> there<00:03:48.019> permanently<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.900> can<00:03:51.079> see<00:03:51.290> we

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
in there permanently and you can see we

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.970 
in there permanently and you can see we
have<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:52.160> resistance

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
have a resistance

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.509 
have a resistance
now<00:03:54.980> if<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:56.530> NTC<00:03:57.530> sensor<00:03:58.040> is<00:03:58.459> working

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
now if the NTC sensor is working

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.259 
now if the NTC sensor is working
correctly<00:03:59.359> as<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:01.190> gets<00:04:01.400> warmer<00:04:01.970> the

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
correctly as it gets warmer the

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.590 
correctly as it gets warmer the
resistance<00:04:02.930> will<00:04:03.230> drop<00:04:04.239> now<00:04:05.239> as<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:05.540> said

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
resistance will drop now as I said

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.440 
resistance will drop now as I said
earlier<00:04:06.079> at<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.739> website<00:04:07.160> I<00:04:07.430> do<00:04:07.549> show<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.060> in

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
earlier at the website I do show you in

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.500 
earlier at the website I do show you in
more<00:04:08.690> detail<00:04:09.489> but<00:04:10.489> as<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.940> can<00:04:11.030> see<00:04:11.090> as<00:04:11.329> I'm

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
more detail but as you can see as I'm

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.800 
more detail but as you can see as I'm
putting<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:11.959> little<00:04:12.109> bit<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.530> warmth<00:04:12.859> on<00:04:13.040> the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
putting a little bit of warmth on the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.569 
putting a little bit of warmth on the
sensor<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.739> resistance<00:04:16.340> is<00:04:16.549> dropping

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.379 

and<00:04:19.669> now<00:04:20.539> as<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:21.019> starts<00:04:21.379> to<00:04:21.470> cool<00:04:21.739> down<00:04:22.099> the

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
and now as it starts to cool down the

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.010 
and now as it starts to cool down the
resistance<00:04:23.389> is<00:04:23.659> rising<00:04:25.569> this<00:04:26.569> gives<00:04:26.840> me<00:04:26.990> a

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
resistance is rising this gives me a

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.439 
resistance is rising this gives me a
good<00:04:27.229> indication<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:28.069> the<00:04:28.460> sensor<00:04:29.270> is

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
good indication that the sensor is

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.469 
good indication that the sensor is
working<00:04:29.479> correctly<00:04:30.199> and<00:04:30.590> as<00:04:31.219> I<00:04:31.400> reheat<00:04:31.879> it<00:04:32.030> you

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
working correctly and as I reheat it you

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.459 
working correctly and as I reheat it you
can<00:04:32.659> see<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.110> drops<00:04:33.680> again<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.810> there<00:04:36.020> we<00:04:36.139> go

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
can see it drops again so there we go

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.559 
can see it drops again so there we go
if<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.770> need<00:04:36.949> more<00:04:37.189> detailed<00:04:37.699> information<00:04:38.090> or

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
if you need more detailed information or

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.330 
if you need more detailed information or
you<00:04:38.780> need<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.080> see<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.379> tolerance<00:04:39.830> levels<00:04:40.189> of

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
you need to see the tolerance levels of

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.760 
you need to see the tolerance levels of
this<00:04:40.669> specific<00:04:40.909> machine<00:04:41.360> they<00:04:42.229> are<00:04:42.439> on<00:04:42.650> the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
this specific machine they are on the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.189 
this specific machine they are on the
PDF<00:04:43.189> at<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.580> website<00:04:44.000> but<00:04:44.629> now<00:04:44.780> we're<00:04:45.020> going

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
PDF at the website but now we're going

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.469 
PDF at the website but now we're going
to<00:04:45.289> look<00:04:45.530> at<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.740> heating<00:04:46.039> element<00:04:46.400> there<00:04:47.300> are

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
to look at the heating element there are

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.330 
to look at the heating element there are
two<00:04:47.719> circuits<00:04:48.229> on<00:04:48.439> this<00:04:48.620> seating<00:04:48.949> element

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
two circuits on this seating element

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.480 
two circuits on this seating element
which<00:04:49.699> create<00:04:50.180> high<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:50.810> low<00:04:51.020> heat<00:04:51.289> so<00:04:52.159> we

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
which create high and low heat so we

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.520 
which create high and low heat so we
have<00:04:52.729> a<00:04:53.060> neutral<00:04:53.569> and<00:04:53.780> two<00:04:54.770> live<00:04:55.039> feeds<00:04:56.349> so<00:04:57.349> we

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
have a neutral and two live feeds so we

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.050 
have a neutral and two live feeds so we
just<00:04:57.770> need<00:04:57.949> to<00:04:58.159> check<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.669> we've<00:04:58.819> got

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
just need to check that we've got

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.600 
just need to check that we've got
continuity<00:04:59.780> across<00:05:00.199> both<00:05:00.590> sides<00:05:00.979> of<00:05:01.280> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
continuity across both sides of the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.969 
continuity across both sides of the
element<00:05:01.969> the<00:05:02.300> low<00:05:02.840> heat<00:05:03.080> as<00:05:03.259> I<00:05:03.409> call<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.680> and

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
element the low heat as I call it and

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.040 
element the low heat as I call it and
the<00:05:04.219> high<00:05:04.400> heat<00:05:04.729> and<00:05:06.849> there<00:05:07.849> we<00:05:08.000> go<00:05:08.180> I'll<00:05:08.840> just

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
the high heat and there we go I'll just

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.589 
the high heat and there we go I'll just
double<00:05:09.349> a<00:05:09.440> check<00:05:10.330> across<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.509> other

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
double a check across the other

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.659 
double a check across the other
terminals<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.259> heater<00:05:15.500> is<00:05:15.620> good<00:05:15.979> now<00:05:16.520> if

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
terminals but this heater is good now if

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.399 
terminals but this heater is good now if
you<00:05:16.789> do<00:05:16.969> need<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.210> replace<00:05:17.509> it<00:05:17.960> there<00:05:18.229> are

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
cover and the next thing we're going to

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.360 
cover and the next thing we're going to
look<00:05:42.889> at<00:05:43.099> is<00:05:43.339> the<00:05:44.289> NTC<00:05:45.289> sensor<00:05:45.529> on<00:05:45.949> the<00:05:46.190> air

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
look at is the NTC sensor on the air

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.230 
look at is the NTC sensor on the air
ducting<00:05:46.969> flow<00:05:47.240> system<00:05:47.750> and<00:05:47.930> this<00:05:48.889> is<00:05:49.039> a

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
ducting flow system and this is a

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.209 
ducting flow system and this is a
different<00:05:50.240> sensor<00:05:50.690> it's<00:05:51.680> a<00:05:51.860> little<00:05:52.099> bit

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
different sensor it's a little bit

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.450 
different sensor it's a little bit
larger<00:05:52.699> and<00:05:52.789> it's<00:05:53.690> on<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.500> left-hand<00:05:55.219> side<00:05:55.310> of

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
larger and it's on the left-hand side of

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.469 
larger and it's on the left-hand side of
