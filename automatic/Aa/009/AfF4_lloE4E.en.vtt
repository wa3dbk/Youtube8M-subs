00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.750
 elson 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:35.070
 by lapse 76% chance day to target 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.770
 reckless 50% chance of failure and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.090
 this is not an acceptable way to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 get to workout 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.160
 even the best players of the moment 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.860
 they make mistakes they risk a lot after all 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.309
 of accounts are only human but if not 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.489
 I would like to present to you the future of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.339
 football our krones taken from 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.549
 perfect decision guaranteed results 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.479
 this is what the people who is football 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:06.390
 the douglas always on participating boats 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.610
 of the match but now it will overthrow the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.380
 Record is like that and ready botachopp 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.979
 flowers came into the head now 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.100
 been replaced and the misconception 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.590
 field fields have changed eu football 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.119
 I do not know if it will be this last time 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.729
 we will see Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.020
 the question now is is will this be? 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.020
 phenomenal football 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.590
 The owner of basketball is not what counts. 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.450
 ready-old before realizing that the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.180
 football is an unpredictable business 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.040
 praised Sandro because I could do this 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.390
 happened to the originals and wants 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.760
 say what they are doing and where 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:02.010
 are now fills on my broad shoulders 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.010
 and look I'm nothing and wii 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.170
 the trash 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.930
 the manager knows this 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.209
 the cheese lets you guess the same in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.900
 last week realizing that you did not 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.900
 permanent 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:33.230
 're kidding mining zlatan because there the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.050
 happened because everyone who will 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.280
 prove that they are wrong to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.280
 save football 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.110
 I liked what you did in this place. 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.720
 The game we love is dying. 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.230
 clones are breaking up with him 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.880
 we must say that he is sorry for 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.230
 today is just cut this we want 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.030
 to end the clashes but they are 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.710
 invincible latam agrees 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.620
 no one believes that they can be 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.520
 defeated but you can do 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.430
 soap opera 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.410
 I meant all of you together. 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.500
 remember what makes you 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.380
 you better not be afraid to risk 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.600
 You play like it's a game. 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.000
 play like a nail you play 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:23.180
 risk everything to win everything 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.480
 there is no greater risk than playing without 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.060
 To risk is official and original are of 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.760
 back and challenges 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.900
 I'm optics from ufpb that will leave the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.660
 football forever 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.770
 the question is how it has united 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.780
 defects 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.970
 this is the stage of most of the planet 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.220
 the whole world is watching who 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.550
 score first we won on Monday 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.550
 chance 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.750
 I got it 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:16.230
 do not risk greater crying gas 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.230
 big cars went this 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.900
 to 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.129
 I'm passing 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.410
 the rate 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.879
 so it's very easy baby rock 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.949
 look at this
