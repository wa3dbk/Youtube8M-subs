00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.469
 hello everyone and welcome to yes and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.480
 gamma tired of everything and you want 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 rest relaxing for a little 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 nice game then you got to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 because today we will talk about very 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.810
 unusual project called tea he 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.519
 was developed by a small company 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.070
 specializing in the creation 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.619
 musical and interactive games in the castle 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 and is a kind of musical 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 I will call out for ps3 and xbox360 and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.370
 of course for pc in a bit more 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.860
 extended edition 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.030
 and even though her new 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.940
 to name a language is somehow not 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.450
 2010 turns 30 a lot of water 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.550
 flowed away 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.920
 analogues of this game are still not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.899
 there are reasons in principle are obvious 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.000
 However, this does not prevent tea from remaining 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.230
 very original and interesting project 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 noteworthy 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.300
 I have to say this is not even a game 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.820
 more so amusing, Mr. you ask 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.250
 like moby and marcus schultz songs 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 related to the price but here it is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.720
 incomprehensible modern world humble yourself and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.090
 I say that because empirically 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.920
 it was observed that the most effective 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.140
 results in the game can be achieved 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.930
 fully focused once and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.520
 immersed in a meditative state 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.479
 which in general contributes competently 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 selected music 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 although maybe it's just me 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 problems and other games and in tea we 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.790
 would make me with my eyes closed well 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.380
 not everyone to be champions 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.570
 after all, apparently this creation 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.909
 built on the well-known though controversial 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.740
 principle that victory is not at all 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 now let's take a closer look 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.130
 get acquainted with the game itself 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.930
 the more so as to describe or not so 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.909
 difficult will appear before you 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.369
 playing field on which you will need 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.100
 post details of tetris something 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.630
 make blocks of a certain size 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.049
 increase them as quickly as possible and 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.549
 the most to make a musical composition 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.740
 delve into the features of the game I will not 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.899
 so how to understand everything you can minutes 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.719
 for 5 however I will note that if you want 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.710
 achieve maximum results and 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.250
 one hundred percent speed you have to 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.469
 to sweat 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.550
 create your own strategy and show 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.320
 attentiveness and accuracy 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.150
 I'm just him absolutely everyone 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.160
 the qualities listed above so 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.260
 just listened to music and put cubes 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.060
 quite a relaxing after a long 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.050
 working day would still find work for 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.200
 complete set 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.520
 There are six audio tracks in the game and this 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.620
 one of the main claims to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.870
 developers, I understand that is not so 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.790
 just agree on the official 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.220
 using world hits but yes 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.860
 forgive me the fans are very cool on 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.260
 in fact Marcus Schultz them both over 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.570
 hits here I have not heard there is 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.090
 tea a couple of modes will limit some 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.920
 others will send you in time 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.500
 on an endless journey through music 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.840
 open spaces and now about the main thing 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.820
 Do you like tea directly depends 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.710
 on how you feel about the songs from 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.050
 This game I like one of them 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.730
 liked very much however for 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.110
 further passage I had to 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.480
 listen at 9 minutes 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.040
 would know put heavy regime which 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.320
 need to go in just 3 minutes 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.330
 but if the playlist claims no then 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.100
 the game will definitely take you to some 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.680
 time and maybe even become yours 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.900
 favorite antidepressant and by the way i 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.000
 I love when someone skillfully and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.480
 perfectly legitimate fame 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.680
 cool guys and I mean that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 the latest bonus track in tea 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.320
 performs a delightful still soundtrack 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.270
 alive 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.430
 from charming artificial 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.980
 intelligence from the legendary portal game 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.590
 I like these songs with great pleasure 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.600
 us 1 5 so if tea makers 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.000
 would just pick up the soundtracks from 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.209
 popular games about this game knew 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.220
 would be five times up to more people regards 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.350
 the interface then it is pleasant colors are matched 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.140
 correctly and everything that happens on the screen 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.700
 pleases the eye in general tea very worthy 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.860
 representative of his practically not 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.050
 existing genre especially if 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.090
 talk about the version so far on the console 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.340
 everything is much better with this business 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.170
 The game is extremely an amateur, but I 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.110
 totally sure that these lovers 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.030
 There are probably all at last 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.250
 I would like to wish you find your 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.560
 own prices and not be so 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.180
 Krivorukimi as I to pass at least 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.849
 one level with 100 percent 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.470
 by coincidence and also i would certainly want

 feature project
