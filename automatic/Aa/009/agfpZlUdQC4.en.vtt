00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
video this time a video about Mars

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.730 
video this time a video about Mars
because<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.480> got<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.839> lot<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.109> questions<00:00:07.529> from

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
because I got a lot of questions from

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.580 
because I got a lot of questions from
people<00:00:07.830> who<00:00:08.280> asked<00:00:08.490> me<00:00:08.639> if<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.120> only<00:00:09.690> work<00:00:10.170> on

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
people who asked me if I only work on

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.940 
people who asked me if I only work on
anomalies<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.790> bone<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.509> why<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.139> don't<00:00:13.860> do

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
anomalies on the bone and why I don't do

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.880 
anomalies on the bone and why I don't do
anything<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.490> Mars<00:00:14.759> well<00:00:15.710> this<00:00:16.710> is

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
anything with Mars well this is

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.269 
anything with Mars well this is
something<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.820> found<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.570> couple<00:00:18.859> months<00:00:19.859> ago

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
something I found a couple months ago

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.240 
something I found a couple months ago
and<00:00:20.369> I'd<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.510> show<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and I'd like to show it to you it's the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.080 
and I'd like to show it to you it's the
way<00:00:23.490> NASA<00:00:24.000> sees<00:00:24.539> Mars<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:26.220> will<00:00:26.910> show<00:00:27.060> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
way NASA sees Mars and I will show you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.880 
way NASA sees Mars and I will show you
much<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.720> spare<00:00:28.019> perspective<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.830> they

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
much from my spare perspective and they

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.349 
much from my spare perspective and they
will<00:00:29.070> receive<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.699> there<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> difference

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
will receive that there is a difference

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.650 
will receive that there is a difference
okay<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.140> go<00:00:31.369> first<00:00:32.369> we'll<00:00:33.120> take<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> look

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
okay here we go first we'll take a look

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.810 
okay here we go first we'll take a look
at<00:00:33.840> M<00:00:34.170> 1<00:00:34.620> 1<00:00:34.829> 0<00:00:35.130> 1<00:00:35.219> 7<00:00:35.610> 8<00:00:35.910> -<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> official<00:00:36.620> márcia

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
mass image and from their perspective

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.630 
mass image and from their perspective
from<00:00:42.239> NASA's<00:00:42.570> perspective<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.399> here<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
from NASA's perspective and here is the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.869 
from NASA's perspective and here is the
surface<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> looks<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.260> ice<00:00:49.760> with<00:00:50.760> all

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
surface so it looks like ice with all

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.369 
surface so it looks like ice with all
kinds<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.300> minerals<00:00:52.610> or<00:00:53.610> lava<00:00:53.940> fields<00:00:54.600> because

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
kinds of minerals or lava fields because

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920 
kinds of minerals or lava fields because
NASA<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.010> very<00:00:56.660> explicit<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.780> their

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
NASA is not very explicit in their

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.110 
NASA is not very explicit in their
explanations<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:02.219> course<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.910> be

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
explanations and of course so just be

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.719 
explanations and of course so just be
skipper<00:01:03.449> things<00:01:03.949> just<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.100> skipper<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.519> my

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
skipper things just be skipper from my

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.969 
skipper things just be skipper from my
motto<00:01:05.970> normally<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.450> Richards<00:01:06.840> comm<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
motto normally in Richards comm that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.760 
motto normally in Richards comm that
this<00:01:08.400> might<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.640> vegetation<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:10.650> know

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this might be vegetation and you know

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.170 
this might be vegetation and you know
what<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.460> he's<00:01:11.580> right<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> I'll<00:01:15.000> show

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
what I think he's right and I'll show

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
what I think he's right and I'll show
you<00:01:15.210> why<00:01:18.049> again<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.799> Mars

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you why again this is the Mars

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:32.940 
you why again this is the Mars
perspective<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.270> NASA<00:01:27.380> ok<00:01:30.770> all<00:01:31.770> kinds<00:01:32.280> of

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
perspective from NASA ok all kinds of

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.499 
perspective from NASA ok all kinds of
structures<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:36.759> we'll<00:01:36.939> slowly<00:01:37.149> come<00:01:37.479> to

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
structures and now we'll slowly come to

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:47.789 
structures and now we'll slowly come to
the<00:01:37.810> most<00:01:38.020> interesting<00:01:38.289> part<00:01:45.539> right<00:01:46.539> here<00:01:46.869> we

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
the most interesting part right here we

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:56.820 
the most interesting part right here we
see<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.100> ridge<00:01:48.340> here<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.170> we'll<00:01:56.530> go

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
see a ridge here and we'll go

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.970 
see a ridge here and we'll go
no<00:01:57.250> no<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.990> see<00:01:59.170> something<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.650> looks<00:01:59.680> like<00:01:59.920> a

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
no no we see something that looks like a

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:08.030 
no no we see something that looks like a
riverbed<00:02:00.580> dried-up<00:02:01.150> riverbed<00:02:03.990> trails<00:02:06.150> down

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
riverbed dried-up riverbed trails down

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.889 
riverbed dried-up riverbed trails down
so<00:02:09.040> now<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.369> gets<00:02:09.520> interesting<00:02:09.670> because<00:02:10.330> we

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
so now it gets interesting because we

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.050 
so now it gets interesting because we
see<00:02:11.110> something<00:02:11.410> here<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.830> looks<00:02:12.640> like<00:02:13.560> ice

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
see something here that looks like ice

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.380 
see something here that looks like ice
or<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.090> lake<00:02:16.690> or<00:02:17.790> melted<00:02:18.790> lava<00:02:19.060> or<00:02:19.920> minerals

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
or a lake or melted lava or minerals

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.620 
or a lake or melted lava or minerals
it's<00:02:22.390> reflecting<00:02:22.960> light<00:02:23.850> but<00:02:24.850> it's<00:02:25.120> not<00:02:25.330> quite

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
it's reflecting light but it's not quite

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:38.280 
it's reflecting light but it's not quite
clear<00:02:25.960> what<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:34.320> this<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:36.930> look<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.110> yeah

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
clear what it is this is a look so yeah

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:49.790 
clear what it is this is a look so yeah
this<00:02:38.470> also<00:02:38.800> looks<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.100> ice<00:02:39.610> or<00:02:39.940> lava

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.920 

unfortunately<00:02:50.800> we<00:02:50.950> only<00:02:50.980> get<00:02:51.400> these<00:02:51.930> black

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
unfortunately we only get these black

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.900 
unfortunately we only get these black
and<00:02:52.959> white<00:02:53.170> images<00:02:53.740> from<00:02:53.890> NASA<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.550> don't<00:02:54.760> get

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
and white images from NASA we don't get

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:08.670 
and white images from NASA we don't get
any<00:02:55.030> color<00:02:55.300> images<00:02:59.310> and<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.550> wonder<00:03:00.850> why<00:03:07.680> it's

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
any color images and I wonder why it's

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.150 
any color images and I wonder why it's
all<00:03:08.800> very<00:03:09.040> interesting<00:03:10.680> except<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.950> don't

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
all very interesting except you don't

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.640 
all very interesting except you don't
see<00:03:12.370> much<00:03:14.310> there<00:03:15.310> are<00:03:15.489> two<00:03:15.670> perfect<00:03:16.060> circles

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
see much there are two perfect circles

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.690 
see much there are two perfect circles
which<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.800> very<00:03:18.010> unusual<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.640> nature<00:03:23.700> this

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
which is very unusual in nature this

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:36.960 
which is very unusual in nature this
looks<00:03:24.940> like<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.150> river<00:03:27.570> with<00:03:28.570> ice<00:03:35.550> so<00:03:36.550> now<00:03:36.790> we'll

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
looks like a river with ice so now we'll

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:45.030 
looks like a river with ice so now we'll
come<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:39.239> another<00:03:40.239> would<00:03:41.790> another<00:03:42.790> first<00:03:44.040> and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
come to another would another first and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.720 
come to another would another first and
we<00:03:45.940> have<00:03:46.269> some<00:03:46.450> ice<00:03:46.660> again<00:03:47.220> or<00:03:48.220> whatever<00:03:48.610> it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
we have some ice again or whatever it

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.120 
we have some ice again or whatever it
may<00:03:48.850> be

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
may be

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.890 
may be
it's<00:03:51.130> a<00:03:51.220> bird<00:03:54.540> vegetation<00:03:55.540> again<00:03:56.049> or<00:03:56.380> minerals

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
it's a bird vegetation again or minerals

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.690 
it's a bird vegetation again or minerals
with<00:03:58.900> object<00:04:00.660> well<00:04:01.799> from<00:04:02.799> NASA<00:04:03.040> perspective

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
with object well from NASA perspective

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.380 
with object well from NASA perspective
there's<00:04:04.000> not<00:04:04.150> much<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.480> see<00:04:05.940> because<00:04:06.940> it's<00:04:07.209> not

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
there's not much to see because it's not

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.880 
there's not much to see because it's not
the<00:04:07.510> original<00:04:07.600> perspective<00:04:10.440> for<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.620> we

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
the original perspective for that we

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.860 
the original perspective for that we
have<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:13.860> pan<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.069> tilt<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.940> that's<00:04:16.690> what

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
have to pan and tilt and that's what

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.969 
have to pan and tilt and that's what
we're<00:04:16.989> gonna<00:04:17.109> do<00:04:17.320> now<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:19.620> now<00:04:20.620> we're<00:04:20.770> going<00:04:20.919> to

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
we're gonna do now so now we're going to

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.850 
we're gonna do now so now we're going to
take<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> look<00:04:21.430> at<00:04:21.549> my<00:04:21.700> perspective<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:26.620> now<00:04:26.800> we

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
take a look at my perspective and now we

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.969 
take a look at my perspective and now we
see<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.280> it's<00:04:27.460> already<00:04:27.940> different<00:04:28.979> because

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
see that it's already different because

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.270 
see that it's already different because
what<00:04:30.460> we<00:04:30.610> saw<00:04:30.820> from<00:04:31.450> above<00:04:31.660> we<00:04:32.289> now<00:04:32.470> look<00:04:32.890> from

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
what we saw from above we now look from

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.770 
what we saw from above we now look from
a<00:04:33.400> side<00:04:33.640> and<00:04:33.990> we<00:04:34.990> see<00:04:35.229> that<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:36.550> picture<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.180> a

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
a side and we see that the picture is a

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:48.990 
a side and we see that the picture is a
hill<00:04:39.750> with<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.780> slope<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:44.590> river<00:04:47.789> why<00:04:48.789> our

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
hill with a slope and a river why our

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.350 
hill with a slope and a river why our
River

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
River

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.060 
River
well<00:04:50.550> let's<00:04:51.550> increase<00:04:52.500> zoom<00:04:53.500> in<00:04:55.770> here<00:04:56.770> we<00:04:56.860> have

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
well let's increase zoom in here we have

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.440 
well let's increase zoom in here we have
what

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
what

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.580 
what
this<00:04:59.450> is<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.750> edge<00:05:00.100> River<00:05:01.100> edge<00:05:02.260> here<00:05:03.260> we<00:05:03.410> have

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
this is the edge River edge here we have

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.430 
this is the edge River edge here we have
water<00:05:04.430> around<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:04.880> curve<00:05:05.120> we<00:05:05.960> are<00:05:05.990> we<00:05:06.230> have<00:05:06.410> a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
water around the curve we are we have a

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.160 
water around the curve we are we have a
what<00:05:07.130> looks<00:05:07.310> like<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.490> waterfall<00:05:10.930> goes<00:05:11.930> down

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
what looks like a waterfall goes down

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.610 
what looks like a waterfall goes down
further<00:05:13.120> see<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.750> water<00:05:14.960> runs<00:05:15.200> down<00:05:15.320> the

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
further see the water runs down the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.100 
further see the water runs down the
slope<00:05:15.890> here<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:17.890> comes<00:05:18.890> into<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.190> pond<00:05:19.550> right

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
slope here and comes into a pond right

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.380 
slope here and comes into a pond right
here<00:05:21.190> you<00:05:22.190> will<00:05:22.310> see<00:05:22.460> water<00:05:22.700> running<00:05:22.970> over<00:05:23.180> the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
here you will see water running over the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.340 
here you will see water running over the
over<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.780> rocks<00:05:24.020> into<00:05:24.650> a<00:05:24.680> lake

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
over the rocks into a lake

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.260 
over the rocks into a lake
we<00:05:27.350> see<00:05:27.500> reflections

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
we see reflections

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.550 
we see reflections
light<00:05:29.270> reflections<00:05:29.930> will<00:05:30.500> see<00:05:30.680> depth<00:05:30.950> and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
light reflections will see depth and

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.110 
light reflections will see depth and
this<00:05:33.560> is<00:05:33.710> an<00:05:33.830> isle<00:05:34.040> a<00:05:34.690> little<00:05:35.690> island<00:05:36.020> and<00:05:37.120> here

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
this is an isle a little island and here

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.800 
this is an isle a little island and here
the<00:05:38.510> water<00:05:38.780> runs<00:05:39.080> further<00:05:41.890> and<00:05:43.600> comes<00:05:44.600> back

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
the water runs further and comes back

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:51.070 
the water runs further and comes back
again<00:05:44.960> here<00:05:46.360> it's<00:05:47.360> floating<00:05:47.600> here<00:05:49.960> around<00:05:50.960> the

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
again here it's floating here around the

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.710 
again here it's floating here around the
curve<00:05:52.870> running<00:05:53.870> over<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.169> rocks<00:05:54.410> here<00:05:54.770> down

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
curve running over the rocks here down

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:04.300 
curve running over the rocks here down
downstream<00:05:56.720> here<00:05:58.840> into<00:05:59.840> a<00:05:59.870> large<00:06:00.350> lake<00:06:03.310> so

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
downstream here into a large lake so

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.300 
downstream here into a large lake so
this<00:06:04.490> is<00:06:04.640> the<00:06:04.790> bottom<00:06:05.030> of<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.270> lake<00:06:06.310> with

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
this is the bottom of the lake with

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.469 
this is the bottom of the lake with
vegetation<00:06:12.190> it's<00:06:13.190> getting<00:06:13.490> deeper<00:06:13.850> here<00:06:14.120> more

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
vegetation it's getting deeper here more

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.460 
vegetation it's getting deeper here more
vegetation<00:06:16.419> and<00:06:17.419> now<00:06:17.690> we<00:06:17.750> see<00:06:18.050> also<00:06:18.290> the

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
vegetation and now we see also the

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.850 
vegetation and now we see also the
reflections<00:06:19.130> here<00:06:20.530> which<00:06:21.530> gives<00:06:21.740> the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
reflections here which gives the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.280 
reflections here which gives the
indication<00:06:22.460> that<00:06:22.610> what's<00:06:23.360> lying<00:06:23.660> here<00:06:24.110> is

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
indication that what's lying here is

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.230 
indication that what's lying here is
lying<00:06:24.620> on<00:06:24.740> the<00:06:24.890> bottom<00:06:25.690> then<00:06:26.690> we<00:06:26.840> see<00:06:26.990> currents

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
lying on the bottom then we see currents

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.550 
lying on the bottom then we see currents
right<00:06:29.240> here<00:06:31.750> see<00:06:33.490> from<00:06:34.490> top<00:06:34.760> left

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
right here see from top left

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.920 
right here see from top left
I'm<00:06:35.680> right<00:06:38.250> we<00:06:39.250> now<00:06:39.400> we<00:06:39.460> even<00:06:40.000> can<00:06:40.419> distinct

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
I'm right we now we even can distinct

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.659 
I'm right we now we even can distinct
streaming<00:06:46.380> so<00:06:47.380> in<00:06:47.500> my<00:06:47.650> view<00:06:47.710> we're<00:06:48.100> looking<00:06:48.430> at

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
streaming so in my view we're looking at

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.250 
streaming so in my view we're looking at
a<00:06:48.880> river<00:06:49.389> and<00:06:49.690> a<00:06:49.930> lake<00:06:49.960> and<00:06:51.270> possibly<00:06:52.270> life

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
a river and a lake and possibly life

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:01.460 
a river and a lake and possibly life
forms<00:06:54.270> vegetation<00:06:55.270> or<00:06:55.480> even<00:06:57.030> real<00:06:58.030> life<00:06:58.270> forms

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.930 

so<00:07:02.470> when<00:07:02.830> you<00:07:02.919> look<00:07:03.070> at<00:07:03.220> from<00:07:03.430> my<00:07:03.580> perspective

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
so when you look at from my perspective

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.790 
so when you look at from my perspective
it's<00:07:04.480> different<00:07:06.330> and<00:07:07.350> that's<00:07:08.350> what<00:07:08.500> I<00:07:08.530> wanted

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
it's different and that's what I wanted

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.050 
it's different and that's what I wanted
to<00:07:08.919> show<00:07:09.100> you<00:07:09.190> and<00:07:09.370> I<00:07:09.430> hope<00:07:09.520> you<00:07:09.669> enjoyed<00:07:09.940> it

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
to show you and I hope you enjoyed it

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.440 
to show you and I hope you enjoyed it
and<00:07:10.210> hope<00:07:10.450> to<00:07:10.510> see<00:07:10.630> you<00:07:10.810> next<00:07:10.990> time<00:07:11.110> bye<00:07:11.410> bye
