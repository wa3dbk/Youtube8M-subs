00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
looser make sure this looks okay okay

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.729 
looser make sure this looks okay okay
nothing<00:02:09.910> fancy<00:02:10.119> I'm<00:02:10.479> going<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.989> like<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.379> do<00:02:11.500> my

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
nothing fancy I'm going I like to do my

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.009 
nothing fancy I'm going I like to do my
I<00:02:12.040> make<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.670> bun<00:02:12.849> really<00:02:13.209> perfect<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.900> then

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
I make the bun really perfect and then

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.530 
I make the bun really perfect and then
the<00:02:14.140> rest<00:02:14.349> of<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.920> don't<00:02:15.610> have<00:02:15.730> super

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the rest of it I don't have super

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.890 
the rest of it I don't have super
perfect<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.319> kind<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.790> balances<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.360> out<00:02:19.480> so

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
perfect so it kind of balances it out so

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
perfect so it kind of balances it out so
I<00:02:19.930> don't<00:02:20.230> walk<00:02:20.410> around<00:02:20.470> looking<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:22.799> just<00:02:23.799> think

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
I don't walk around looking I just think

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.059 
I don't walk around looking I just think
it<00:02:24.010> looks<00:02:24.040> different<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:26.170> teaches<00:02:26.739> own<00:02:26.890> I

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
it looks different but teaches own I

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.720 
it looks different but teaches own I
guess

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
guess

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.319 
guess
okay<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.560> now<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.799> take<00:02:30.160> your<00:02:30.220> sock<00:02:30.610> little

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329
