00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.720
 round and yet we want the super 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.790
 i enjoy the weather outside i go to 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.080
 Dearest in the park very much like 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.880
 my friend and with my best 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.219
 But girlfriend alone makes it fun 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.840
 somehow today, first of all 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.420
 I give myself a sleeping water 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.730
 to us was only 60 seconds long, the 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.500
 massage with ethereal oil 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.660
 this year has lavender and chamomile 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.340
 in it and is pretty much calmed down 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.539
 all the senses of the smell of me 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.250
 really good and the sky amazed 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.849
 you ask yourself something in the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.079
 bag 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.210
 But first I'll tell you how I do that 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.999
 bag did you have me I got it 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.799
 the rest myself home made me 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.629
 I took on an old t-shirt and 

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:43.489
 A fabric would be if not a stuffed animal 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.829
 decreases as a very sharp scissors 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.389
 then I knew the sleeves 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.389
 cut off and both sides of course 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:52.699
 and the collar well known 

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:53.959
 Now you have a kind of tanktop or 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.030
 actually in quite a tanktop 

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:57.530
 you can also walk like that has one 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.379
 new pop for the summer 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.539
 but my bag is dashing because of that 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.810
 below such francs purely that is 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.380
 every centimeter approximately such peaks 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.259
 cut and connect these slots 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.270
 you all now above and below the 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.250
 just dangling here you can 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.229
 knot them as I do outward then 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.659
 do you have such nails hanging or you 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.130
 Turn the fabric on left and right 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.829
 knotted thanks then they are namely 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.990
 hidden inside the bags for the uni 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.740
 sees the teat but not the bag 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.840
 locked 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.249

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.140
 see out splash out that they have it 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:35.810

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.999

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.619
