into<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> pan<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.400> want<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> reduce<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
into the pan and we want to reduce that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060 
into the pan and we want to reduce that
by<00:01:06.240> half<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.810> gonna<00:01:06.930> add<00:01:07.140> an<00:01:07.290> amazing<00:01:07.799> flavor

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
by half it's gonna add an amazing flavor

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
by half it's gonna add an amazing flavor
to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> gravy<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.229> stir<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> through

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to the gravy so just stir that through

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
to the gravy so just stir that through
and<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> gravy<00:01:12.330> will<00:01:12.630> start<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> thicken

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
and see the gravy will start to thicken

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.280 
and see the gravy will start to thicken
immediately<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> flour<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:15.170> get<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
immediately with the flour just get that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.190 
immediately with the flour just get that
in<00:01:16.670> smells<00:01:17.670> fantastic<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.900> taken

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
in smells fantastic so that's taken

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.010 
in smells fantastic so that's taken
about<00:01:22.850> 10-15<00:01:23.850> seconds<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> reduce<00:01:24.810> by

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
about 10-15 seconds just to reduce by

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.350 
about 10-15 seconds just to reduce by
half<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:25.979> go<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.580> our<00:01:26.610> stock<00:01:26.939> now

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
half then we go in with our stock now

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.999 
half then we go in with our stock now
this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.630> chicken<00:01:27.810> stock<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> same

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this is chicken stock but the same

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.770 
this is chicken stock but the same
principle<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.549> work<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.210> any<00:01:30.360> other<00:01:30.450> gravy

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
principle will work for any other gravy

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.480 
principle will work for any other gravy
if<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> cooking<00:01:31.470> beef<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.250> beef<00:01:32.460> stock

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
if you cooking beef then use beef stock

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.410 
if you cooking beef then use beef stock
so<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.420> goes<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.930> pan<00:01:35.180> let's<00:01:36.180> raise

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so that goes into the pan let's raise

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.010 
so that goes into the pan let's raise
the<00:01:36.570> heat<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:38.030> just<00:01:39.030> start<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> cook<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> bang

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.090 

the<00:01:44.020> gravy's<00:01:44.350> has<00:01:44.439> been<00:01:44.530> cooking<00:01:44.799> fine<00:01:44.979> now
