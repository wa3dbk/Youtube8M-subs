00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.210 
was closest to it and after trying all
the<00:04:26.140> different<00:04:26.170> brands<00:04:26.740> from<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.040> drugstore

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
the different brands from the drugstore

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.670 
the different brands from the drugstore
I<00:04:27.670> landed<00:04:28.360> on<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.600> simple<00:04:28.930> ones<00:04:29.020> which<00:04:29.230> seemed

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
I landed on the simple ones which seemed

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.920 
I landed on the simple ones which seemed
to<00:04:29.710> be<00:04:30.220> nicest<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:30.850> my<00:04:30.940> skin<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.630> use<00:04:31.840> these

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
to be nicest to my skin so I use these

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.900 
to be nicest to my skin so I use these
at<00:04:32.080> least<00:04:32.350> twice<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.650> day<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.070> then<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.460> just

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
at least twice a day and then I just

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.790 
at least twice a day and then I just
washed<00:04:34.060> my<00:04:34.180> face<00:04:34.450> probably<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:35.230> few<00:04:35.530> times<00:04:35.680> a

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
washed my face probably a few times a

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.320 
washed my face probably a few times a
week<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:35.980> not<00:04:36.280> every<00:04:36.550> day<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.700> use<00:04:37.120> like<00:04:37.270> a

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
week but not every day I use like a

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.300 
week but not every day I use like a
cleanser<00:04:37.840> this<00:04:38.260> is<00:04:38.380> my<00:04:38.500> main<00:04:38.650> regimen<00:04:39.070> for<00:04:39.100> my

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
cleanser this is my main regimen for my

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.800 
cleanser this is my main regimen for my
skin<00:04:39.550> now<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:39.790> have<00:04:39.970> really<00:04:40.150> dry<00:04:40.270> skin<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.690> it's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
skin now I have really dry skin so it's

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.330 
skin now I have really dry skin so it's
really<00:04:40.900> different<00:04:41.140> but<00:04:41.470> for<00:04:41.860> me<00:04:41.980> this<00:04:42.220> has

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
really different but for me this has

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.250 
really different but for me this has
kept<00:04:42.610> my<00:04:42.700> skin<00:04:42.970> really<00:04:43.180> really<00:04:43.810> clear<00:04:44.050> and

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
kept my skin really really clear and

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.160 
kept my skin really really clear and
pretty<00:04:44.710> healthy<00:04:45.160> throughout<00:04:45.610> my<00:04:46.030> entire<00:04:46.480> life

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
pretty healthy throughout my entire life

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.200 
pretty healthy throughout my entire life
since<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.890> mattered<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.430> know<00:04:48.550> preteen<00:04:49.180> years

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
since it mattered you know preteen years

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.750 
since it mattered you know preteen years
so<00:04:49.840> i<00:04:50.080> highly<00:04:50.530> recommend<00:04:50.980> this<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.250> could<00:04:51.670> not

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
so i highly recommend this I could not

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.909 
so i highly recommend this I could not
live<00:04:51.880> without<00:04:51.970> face<00:04:52.270> wives<00:04:52.480> and<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:53.470> repurchase

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
live without face wives and I repurchase

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.800 
live without face wives and I repurchase
them<00:04:54.040> all<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.340> time<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.669> have<00:04:54.700> probably<00:04:55.540> about

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
them all the time I have probably about

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.020 
them all the time I have probably about
seven<00:04:56.290> empty<00:04:56.560> ones<00:04:56.740> like<00:04:57.250> hanging<00:04:57.760> around<00:04:57.970> the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
seven empty ones like hanging around the

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.030 
seven empty ones like hanging around the
house<00:04:58.150> waiting<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.630> be<00:04:58.720> thrown<00:04:58.960> away<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.710> I

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
house waiting to be thrown away so I

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.250
