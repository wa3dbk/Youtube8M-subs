00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Good day friends in this 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.730
 video we talk about auto downloads 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.099
 programs this windows service which 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.280
 runs the program at system startup 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.950
 windows and it happens so when too 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.320
 many software from autorun launch 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.800
 windows gets longer and it can 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.900
 call 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.359
 unpleasant feeling of waiting when 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 windows loads too long another 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.710
 The moment is that not all programs are 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.900
 get us in autoload we need 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.670
 for use so very good 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 it would remove them so they didn't occupy 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.399
 extra memory space and not 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.129
 prevented us from working and so how to remove or 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.680
 remove program from startup 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.460
 windows for this we will use 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.930
 system utility 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 go to the start list of programs or 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.470
 applications and in the search we write m. config 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.560
 this command starts the system 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.250
 application for various settings 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.090
 systems 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 it works in all windows versions 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.310
 version of windows 8 which i have this 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.810
 the program also is like windows xp and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.170
 windows 7 and vista 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.610
 and probably in the top ten it also has 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.690
 system application press a button 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.860
 enter this application starts 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.750
 system configuration is called and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.130
 notice here there is a tab 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.280
 autoload if you use windows 7 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.430
 and earlier versions of windows so in 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.150
 this tab you will be 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.979
 programs that load together 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.300
 running we nose and you can turn it off 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.950
 their launch but windows 8 is already this feature 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.460
 autoload transferred to dispatcher 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.680
 tasks 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.710
 so just press the open button 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.149
 task manager and are shown 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.810
 application which is in 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.149
 autoload 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.740
 I already cleaned my startup list 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.690
 so change quite a bit 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.909
 applications only need 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.499
 and torus 2 applications disabled 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.069
 my webmoney is disabled so that it does not 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:09.549
 worked in the background and center 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.290
 devices for windows mobile 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.110
 to disable autoloading for example 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.900
 sticz program just press the button 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.730
 disable or enable to back 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 return and this program will either 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.560
 run at windows startup or already 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.799
 no one more way as one could 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.250
 to change 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.590
 delete system autoload or 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.360
 add programs to autoload it 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.239
 use of additional applications 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.579
 This program troops 365 in this program 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.739
 about the program troops l355 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.690
 we even had a separate video like 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.420
 enjoy and how it helps speed up 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.940
 computer work by the way it was the most 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.709
 first release on our channel and in 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.910
 section 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.310
 optimization is such a point 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.329
 autoload and here you can also 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.329
 turn on and off 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.190
 programs by adding or removing them from 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.170
 autoload 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.450
 if you want to see a review of this 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.060
 program troops just click a reference 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.650

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.840
 Now we will deal with the question of how 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.410
 still add the program we 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.630
 want to autoload windows windows 8 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.430
 it's not as easy to do as windows 7 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.520
 windows xp 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.530
 there used to be a separate daddy in the start menu 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.680
 autoload and you could just 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.830
 move there windows 8 shortcut for this 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.930
