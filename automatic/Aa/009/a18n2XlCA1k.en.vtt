00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
okay today I installed cruise control in

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.800 
okay today I installed cruise control in
my<00:00:03.330> 1999<00:00:04.230> chevrolet<00:00:04.830> 2500<00:00:05.819> with<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> diesel

engine I don't know if the procedure
works<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.080> gas<00:00:10.440> engines<00:00:10.950> but<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.460> definitely

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
works for gas engines but it definitely

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.039 
works for gas engines but it definitely
works<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.500> GM's<00:00:13.500> with<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> diesel<00:00:14.780> so<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:15.960> you

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
works for GM's with a diesel so what you

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.550 
works for GM's with a diesel so what you
need<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.650> replace<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:18.720> little<00:00:18.900> turn

it's a it's a ten millimeter all right

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.750 
it's a it's a ten millimeter all right
so<00:02:41.490> like<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.880> said<00:02:41.940> right<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.260> block

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
so like I said right here on this block

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.680 
so like I said right here on this block
is<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.030> gray<00:02:45.870> connector<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:48.210> black

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
is this gray connector and this black

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.060 
is this gray connector and this black
connector<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.760> little<00:02:51.180> connector<00:02:52.070> is

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
connector and this little connector is

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.040 
connector and this little connector is
right<00:02:53.370> there

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
right there

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:04.070 
right there
that's<00:02:55.050> it<00:03:00.560> that's<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.980> takes<00:03:02.900> that's<00:03:03.900> all

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
that's it that's all it takes that's all

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.490 
that's it that's all it takes that's all
it<00:03:04.200> takes<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.710> put<00:03:05.610> cruise<00:03:05.820> control<00:03:06.500> very

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
it takes to put cruise control very

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.100 
it takes to put cruise control very
simple<00:03:08.150> let's<00:03:09.150> take<00:03:09.330> your<00:03:09.450> time<00:03:09.690> like<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.960> said

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
simple let's take your time like I said

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.530 
simple let's take your time like I said
the<00:03:10.200> hard<00:03:10.410> part<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:11.670> getting<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:12.180> there<00:03:12.360> there

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
the hard part is getting on there there

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.660 
the hard part is getting on there there
and<00:03:12.840> make<00:03:13.140> sure<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.470> cut<00:03:13.920> off<00:03:14.070> all<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.459> zip

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
and make sure you cut off all the zip

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.810 
and make sure you cut off all the zip
ties<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.440> electrical<00:03:16.440> tape<00:03:16.650> because<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
ties and electrical tape because the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.460 
ties and electrical tape because the
wires<00:03:18.060> are<00:03:19.100> hip<00:03:20.100> tied<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.580> other<00:03:21.110> wires<00:03:22.110> under

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
wires are hip tied to other wires under

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.520 
wires are hip tied to other wires under
the<00:03:22.500> under<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.490> dash<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.209> once<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.350> that

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
the under the dash so once you get that

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.890 
the under the dash so once you get that
loosened<00:03:26.040> up<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.459> follow<00:03:27.209> those<00:03:27.450> wires<00:03:27.660> it's

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
loosened up and follow those wires it's

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.650 
loosened up and follow those wires it's
pretty<00:03:28.410> simple<00:03:28.970> like<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.090> said<00:03:30.300> if<00:03:30.480> you're

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
pretty simple like I said if you're

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.980 
pretty simple like I said if you're
older<00:03:31.530> gentlemen<00:03:32.300> might<00:03:33.300> not<00:03:33.510> want<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.720> try<00:03:33.870> it

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
older gentlemen might not want to try it

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.780 
older gentlemen might not want to try it
you'll<00:03:34.230> probably<00:03:34.380> pull<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.010> muscle<00:03:35.459> sprain

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
you'll probably pull it muscle sprain

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.690 
you'll probably pull it muscle sprain
something<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:38.480> that's<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
something so that's it

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.509 
something so that's it
cruise<00:03:41.700> control

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
cruise control

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.640 
cruise control
