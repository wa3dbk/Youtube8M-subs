00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.540
I'm a car photographer because it is what
I love to do. And life is too short to do

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.610
anything but what you want to do. I love cars
for so many reasons: The aesthetic beauty,

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.790
there is the mechanical dimension, it is a form of art.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.000
It is a highly complicated, mechanical kind of sculpture. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.649
My name is Richard. I'm a car 
photographer. It is 2.30 AM here

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.649
in L.A. and we are about to head 
out in the desert for sunrise.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.670
Today is going to be really special. 
I have been planning this for a long time.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.670
We are going to photograph a really unique car. 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.690
In the past I have worked with some pretty
amazing cars but this one is a really special

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.620
car. It is an iconic, legendary car. There
are very few of them. I think 10. To be given

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.330
the opportunity to work with this car, it
is hard for me to keep my feet on the ground

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.830
when we are doing this kind of work.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.330
So we just got this beautiful 
Ford GT40 Mark IV of the truck 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.500
and we are wheeling it into position.
Getting ready for a beautiful sunrise

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.050
you can see in the background. 
Things are looking pretty good. 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.150
Can we cut the wheel 
hard down to the right 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.280
and just push it back a little so we 
get like a quarter angle of the car?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.259
That is good right there guys! It is 5.20
AM and we are pretty close to ready here.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.059
The car is in position and 
looking as good as it ever has.

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:40.659
This is going to be a 
very natural type of a scene. 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.780
The beauty of a situation like this, 
the hard work of this kind of production,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.060
coming to this place at this time of day and
bringing this vehicle and creating a really

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.630
magic moment. This is all just about 
watching the sun come up and when it does,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.109
I don't think it gets more pure than this. 
This raw environment and this really raw car.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.109
It is very simple but it doesn't 
take much beyond that. 

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:08.109
There it is. And we are off! 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.509
I can safely say we got that. 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.920
What I would like to try and put one 
of these zoom lenses on. 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920
Got it?

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.200
This is the newest edition to Phase One's
lineup. It is a 40-80mm zoom lens.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.530
I've been told it matches or 
exceeds the quality of some 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.530
of the prime lenses that I work 
with on these cameras normally,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.330
so I'm really excited to try it out. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.230
This is a very impressive piece of glass. 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.430
The feel of the zoom, the rings, 
the weight, is just really heavy and fluid.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.659
Coming from a bit of a film background where
you work with really nice Panavision and Cooke

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.319
lenses and things like that, they don't breathe
when you zoom, the focus doesn't shift and

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.319
you don't have that movement at the side of
the lens, because they are designed for motion.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.069
And when I zoomed the whole way out with this
lens and I fixed the focus, and then zoomed

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.480
the whole way in, it would usually lose the
focus, but this lens is holding focus the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.080
whole way across, which means that 
the innards of this glass are cut above. 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.480
This is really nice! 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:58.959
We are going to move from the 40-80,
to the 150mm zoom, 75-150mm I believe,

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.169
and go for the full zoom effect 
and see how much linear compression 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:03.969
we can get out of this car.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.569
Wow! This is incredibly sharp! 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.760
Look at this. There is a 
little light bulb on the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.239
side of the car which casts light on the 
number so that when they are racing at night,

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.239
they could see what number the car was. 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.030
This histogram looks great!

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.430
I have got the entire dynamic range of this of this entire scene

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.250
and I still got a stop and a half on both
ends of the histogram just waiting for

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.279
something else. That looks great. 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.979
I'm shooting with the 75-150 and 
I'm using it the whole way in 150

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.920
to kind of maximize focal compression and get 
the lines of the car to really straighten out. 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.550
It usually has the effect on cars of
making them look a lot more serious.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.930
Because it is very round as you get closer 
and more wide angle deforms a lot of the car

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.820
and a lot of the design elements 
sort of look out of context. 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.120
But right now, this thing is just looking fantastic. 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.120
We haven't got a ton of great light left. 
You see the shadow is falling into the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.030
car pretty quickly now. So I'm switching to
the 40-80 and I'll do the rest of my shoot with

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.190
this, and I can move a lot faster when we
are switching back and forth with lenses.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.180
This is phenomenal. 
This is a phenomenal lens. 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.830
It is 7.15 AM. The shadow that I love

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.720
that is drawing away from the car is almost
gone. We probably has less than 15 minutes

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.220
to get our last bit in 
so that is gonna be it. 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.039
Can you close the door, Johnny? 
I'm going to shoot the 9 straight on.

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.239
We just got the last main shot 
and we are just making some pick-ups

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:12.139
and then I think they might actually
boot it up, so we get to hear this thing.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.340
To be given the opportunity to shoot that
car is enough in itself but to see it run

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:41.330
and hear it, and not only that, but for them
to have modified it for our shoot to return

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.730
the exhaust to the original 60's Le Mans 
spec exhaust which is just brutally loud.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:00.470
Very impressive to see this thing 
do what it was meant to do in 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.670
the mechanical condition it was raised in. 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.800
I think the shoot has gone very well. 
My crew really delivered the consistency

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.379
I needed to make sure there weren't any concerns.
This camera, this new 40-80mm lens did exactly

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:21.160
the same thing. The images, I know even before
I look at them on the computer, I already

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.990
know that they are incredible. This is an
amazing, very sharp lens. And it is pretty

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:30.180
hard to deny that this isn't one of the most
beautiful, iconic racing machines of all time.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.370
What a pleasure to work with this thing today.
