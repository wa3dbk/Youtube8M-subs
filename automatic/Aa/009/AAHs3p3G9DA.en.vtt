00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.720
 what a trance where are the greetings 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.240
 of new friends daily in rambo and in 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.160
 this occasion is a video a bit of 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.039
 answer to one of the subscribers that 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.509
 he asked me how to get so much 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.890
 hero metal since I had enough 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.640
 in inventory that I no longer have so much 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.060
 because they change it but well let's go 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 First 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.480
 to the earth and I think good before 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.940
 go to earth 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 we will go 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.879
 to the tower crane and in what we're going to the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.039
 tower I talk to you in general of all 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.059
 the sconces of all the materials that 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.699
 I have found 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.159
 ok so we go to my inventory 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.270
 sorry and we have all these types of 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.610
 name materials 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.800
 we have here what is here both in 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.720
 strange currency I already practice that they are 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.720
 what they are for and how they are obtained 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.460
 like specks of light will opt for 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.870
 basic materials on earth in the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.000
 earth we will find mental turn 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.180
 which is the metal turn are more like 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.710
 small plants that are sold with 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.820
 certain brightness on earth are very 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.100
 easy to see really in the part of 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.110
 the moon we are going to find with these 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.700
 they are filaments of Lyon they look like 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.729
 cylinders on the ground also very 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.710
 bright very easy to see in venus 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.630
 we will meet with the flower 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.890
 spiritual are also easy to see 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.800
 they are some balls are floating 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.570
 generally close to some plant are 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.970
 a lot of material are very very simple 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.000
 berkeley 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.840
 what other material do we have the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.180
 upward energy this is a little more 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.750
 complicated to get you get 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.320
 only completing public events 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.300
 or missions of the day ok in the row that 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.980
 they have to be major difficulties to 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.590
 windy but for exceeding the level 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.970
 20 not hard to find a 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.660
 of these unless they play with someone 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.520
 of this level not after we have is the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.580
 creek left that is called fragment 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.340
 ascending the ascending fragment what 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.270
 we can locate at public events 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.470
 they can give it to us as a reward 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.450
 legendary engrams are the purple ones or 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.150
 dismantling them equipment or weapons 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.270
 legendary no more equipment 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.319
 legendary that armor helmet boots or 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.970
 name glasses gloves 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.470
 you can also discover get 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.080
 in the stories in the missions 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.210
 daily historical and if you're lucky 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.710
 also in the chests not now what 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.350
 we can do with this material where 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.240
 here on the right I obviously say these 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.040
 materials should be saved not 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.520
 I recommend that you use them for another 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.920
 thing since they are used to aggravate 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.210
 the weapons to aggravate the armor 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.700
 so I recommend it for that because 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.230
 true are the past tell you these 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.720
 are the pieces of weapons are obtained at 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.690
 disassembling weapons not every one that disassembles is 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.270
 a weapon for example here with the option x 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.430
 Hypnosis is dismantling I will give pieces 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.080
 gun I do not think they are from 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.250
 the green ones up I'm not very 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.800
 safe 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.960
 and the hadron essence and here is is not 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.170
 I know if it's the same in all classes but 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.850
 This is obtained by dismantling armor 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400
 no longer helmets gloves lenses what 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.530
 be every time the disassemble goes 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.210
 get that for example this helmet that 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.800
 it really does not work 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.180
 let's go I have to save it but 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.160
 well every time you disassemble is a piece 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.510
 just like the weapon here disassemble is going to 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.540
 give essence drone and here and it will give you 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.490
 certain percentage of lumen now for 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.880
 that serve us those equipments like 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.370
 the metal kilo and all that apart from this one 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.260
 good is apart from 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.620
 to take care of the weapons that is what I 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 I recommend you can use it with others 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.420
 guys this is also not to see if this 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.980
 work there are some guys that you 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.470
 they exchange that for certain things 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.050
 we can not merchandise it either 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.930
 go 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.100
 to see even riva live on youtube 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.500
 let me go fast over there 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.160
 as I've never done it was not linked to 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.900
 who sees it 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.900
 I 'm not very good either 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.450
 no, I do not know who sees it, the joke is 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.570
 there are certain merchants who 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.640
 you exchange those items they ask you 50 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.080
 it really is pretty I say already after 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.450
 you're playing a lot of time you're going to 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.550
 have no problems but not in a 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.310
 principle is enough to walk 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.470
 giving them to the merchants for items that 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.410
 not really worth you get are 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.510
 lumens give you one thing I've never 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.890
 changed ones but it's not worth it 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.890
 they really do not give anything 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.670
 I think he takes it down if they give we're going to 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.160
 see fast 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.620
 we are close 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.400
 here we are the story are going to continue 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.810
 sorcerer is not nothing I do not know if I do not 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.240
 come because I do not have solutions for 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.700
 change what happens here is scared by 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.460
 example this guy here tells me to give him 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.410
 50 filaments of helium and it's going to give me 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.110
 change materials not really not 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.460
 it suits me I used the hero metal ones to 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.530
 make a change and it gave me pure crap 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.689
 I do not recommend them better, they see their 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.909
 materials are not spent here 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.739
 so this can be done with them 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.959
 now where to get them because I 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:34.409
 they said that how I did it to have so much 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:38.349
 how to tell you subscriber really is not 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:40.659
 a formula there is no no other than 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.399
 explore again and again each time 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.099
 enter a map or just 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:47.360
 they showed my deformed video or they are 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.680
 forming in that area 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.320
 and they see some 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.120
 some flower of a heaven on earth 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.060
 fast homeland 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.680
 If you go to a spiritual flower, take the 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.190
 cndh and you put to form that 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.900
 in his 15 to that in his contracts and every 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.790
 determined time will continue 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.410
 generating the flowers appearing 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.320
 spirituals even in the same place 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.460
 where they got that spiritual flower 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.740
 then the only way to get them 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.389
 is that in each mission in each patrol 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.720
 that they do in the different planets of the 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.640
 game 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.760
 Well, look closely, do not walk 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.400
 looking everywhere looking for these 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.860
 pieces including the chests too 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.810
 appear randomly you can enter 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.280
 a cave to leave and after five minutes 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.920
 and you go back internal there may be facts 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.639
 with some copper in these boxes too 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.650
 they give you 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.210
 and they give you this kind of material look 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.639
 for example here I'm going out 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.409
 we found is a metal turn this is 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.819
 the metal turn 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.070
 you have to get mental turn sheets 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.350
 see you 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.580
 we already get it then then such 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.620
 again if I return after a while 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.700
 new to do again is with that sheet of 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.790
 mental turn 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.710
 is the only way there is no other 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.580
 science more than walking past one and another 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.040
 time 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.540
 missions and getting the systems not 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.870
 there they could see how quickly 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:11.110
 get the metal spin are easy to 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.710
 see excel shape and size of the 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.840
 rest of the others is over here I can see 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.390
 if I can see someone else if not 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.330
 there is nothing flat for a moment I do not see 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.550
 none 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.449
 but good to wanda there is more or less 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.949
 how to get look here is another 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.800
 even they can hear us 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:33.020
 listen to a solicitous that sound wants 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.660
 say it's the mental turn there we go 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.090
 how it shines a little we are going to take it out 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.230
 and then good band that would be all the 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.270
 only way to get the materials 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.220
 is to play again and again what is 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.820
 call far half what will end 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.710
 know and this one and put a band will be 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.900
 I hope everything has been useful to you 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.400
 video if you find some more way 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.680
 quick to do it by creating and being 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.650
 I will let you know but for as long as it is the only 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.630
 band way so 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.190
 I hope you liked the video forget 

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.900
 Give away a like sign up for more and 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.190
 share it with your friends bands already 

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.389
 know that I send you a great greeting that 

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.680
 I am wanted a rambo and see you 

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:08.680
 until the next pitch
