00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.620
 at the bottom of the American continent in a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.540
 lost corner of the world straddling 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.080
 a desert and a boundless glacier 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.719
 They rise majestically spiers of granita 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.860
 useless sentinels of uninhabited places 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.020
 forget to watch from the night of gods 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.589
 times and turned into stone by 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.710
 the mass of the long wait is very long 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.419
 charter renamed then fitzroy situated 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.210
 in the heart of the Slavic national park 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.349
 ares in argentina 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.410
 often this place comes too 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.550
 restrictively called patagonia 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.129
 forgetting that the latter includes 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.449
 a much larger area practically 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.969
 the whole southern part of the 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.100
 South American continent for over a thousand 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.770
 kilometers long north of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.660
 Magellan Strait 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.010
 even if by now discovered by tourists 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 these lands manage to preserve a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 particular charm the park would seem 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.910
 an oasis rich in forest waters 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.519
 margins of the Argentine pampas area 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.929
 if it weren't for the wind at that 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.940
 terrible event that space 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.790
 incessantly and that can blow up 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.800
 at 200 kilometers per hour 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.860
 they say that time is the worst 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.470
 of the world for microclimatic causes on 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.020
 these mountains is always ugly while 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.650
 whim of nature a few kilometers away 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.710
 of distance 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 the earth is dried up because it does not receive 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.640
 never a drop of water 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.549
 the tower has been called the mountain 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.020
 most difficult in the world 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.689
 even if today maybe he doesn't deserve it 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.720
 plus this title counts many 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.509
 attempts but very few successful masters 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.700
 and the year for the north face in 59 then 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.090
 the same masters with klaus iva limonta 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.710
 for the east wall in 1970 casimiro 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.070
 ferrari and lecco spiders for the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.939
 west wall in 74 there is repeated two 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.530
 years later from a US expedition 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.119
 this way of masters much discussed and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.429
 also criticized the way of the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.580
 compressor will be unnecessarily retried 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.130
 many times until in 79 to nine years of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.679
 distance will be repeated by jing wii 2 e 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.690
 Steve Blake in just three days a 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.000
 still today the peak has been reached only 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.660
 from 12 rope the number 13 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.660
 it will bring me luck 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.660
 over my head how wonderful 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.390
 ephemeral glacial constructions similar to 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.940
 crenellated ports of medieval castles 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.349
 they silently satisfy my passage 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.220
 I have no war, though 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.340
 declare 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.019
 let alone a damsel to kidnap me 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.220
 I realize then that I am a stranger 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.709
 but on an indiscreet he tried to get in 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.239
 hurry doing as little noise as possible 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.970
 as not to disturb the tranquility 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.650
 of these ignoble creatures 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.120
 I seem to want to violate the secrets of 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.510
 a place normally forbidden a 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.250
 immortal perhaps he is not yet 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.590
 wary of this unusual included 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.750
 so he's climbing on his back or 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.230
 more simply decided not to 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.230
 deal 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.890
 all
