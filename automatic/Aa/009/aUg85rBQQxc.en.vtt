here five times in the large pile and we

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000 
here five times in the large pile and we
screen<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.480> military<00:02:31.019> we<00:02:31.140> also<00:02:31.319> screen<00:02:31.739> some

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
path mulch out of so that's in our mulch

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.870 
path mulch out of so that's in our mulch
area<00:02:41.510> then<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:42.989> have<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.650> compost<00:02:44.310> pad<00:02:44.519> itself

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
you can see in the field that are some

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.150 
you can see in the field that are some
lighter<00:03:13.900> material<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.560> darker<00:03:14.920> material

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
actually some ferrous added to it for

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.090 
actually some ferrous added to it for
increased<00:03:19.570> nitrogen<00:03:19.750> content<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.680> way

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
increased nitrogen content so that way

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.300 
increased nitrogen content so that way
we<00:03:21.220> get<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.780> compost<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.110> low<00:03:24.100> energy

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
we get a compost that is low energy

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.570 
we get a compost that is low energy

when we kept material and we look at
what<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.110> highest<00:03:53.290> use<00:03:53.830> for<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.160> material

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
what is the highest use for the material

comes<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.770> we<00:03:57.520> have<00:03:57.760> stumps<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.840> wood<00:03:59.050> in

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
comes in and we have stumps of wood in

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.580 
comes in and we have stumps of wood in
there<00:03:59.410> we<00:03:59.950> take<00:04:00.100> those<00:04:00.630> logs<00:04:01.630> or<00:04:01.900> wood<00:04:02.080> out<00:04:02.260> and

there we take those logs or wood out and
make<00:04:03.160> firewood<00:04:03.610> out<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.510> we<00:04:04.810> sell

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
make firewood out of that and we sell

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.650 
make firewood out of that and we sell
firewood<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.470> our<00:04:05.590> customers<00:04:06.180> when<00:04:07.180> we<00:04:07.420> waste

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
firewood to our customers when we waste

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.750 
firewood to our customers when we waste
comes<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:08.140> we<00:04:08.980> look<00:04:09.160> at<00:04:09.310> is<00:04:09.460> there<00:04:09.610> any

comes in we look at is there any
reusable<00:04:10.390> lumber<00:04:10.960> that's<00:04:11.200> in<00:04:11.380> there<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:11.590> we

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
reusable lumber that's in there so we

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.380 
reusable lumber that's in there so we
take<00:04:11.890> out<00:04:12.010> apply<00:04:12.340> with<00:04:12.610> two<00:04:12.730> two<00:04:12.880> by<00:04:13.030> fours

a<00:04:19.799> composting<00:04:20.720> program<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:21.870> really<00:04:22.079> important

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
a composting program is really important

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.719 
a composting program is really important
for<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.009> community<00:04:24.110> first<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.229> all<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:26.340> takes

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
for the community first of all it takes

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.249 
for the community first of all it takes
material<00:04:26.940> out<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.600> landfill<00:04:27.960> where<00:04:28.169> it

material out of the landfill where it

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.200 
material out of the landfill where it
doesn't<00:04:28.440> belong<00:04:28.740> it's<00:04:29.400> really<00:04:29.699> a<00:04:29.729> resource

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
doesn't belong it's really a resource

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
landscape industry in that it provides a

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.189 
landscape industry in that it provides a
soil<00:04:37.770> amendment<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:39.330> has<00:04:39.570> some<00:04:39.810> nutrient

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
soil amendment that has some nutrient

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.200 
soil amendment that has some nutrient
value<00:04:40.669> it<00:04:42.229> conserves<00:04:43.229> water<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:44.340> prevents

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
value it conserves water it prevents

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.390 
value it conserves water it prevents
soil<00:04:45.539> erosion<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.410> so<00:04:46.949> we<00:04:47.070> have<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.220> lot<00:04:47.370> of

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
soil erosion and so we have a lot of

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.580 
soil erosion and so we have a lot of
properties<00:04:48.300> where<00:04:48.479> it<00:04:48.600> enhances<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.289> soil

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
properties where it enhances the soil

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.760 
properties where it enhances the soil
that<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:51.240> garden<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.080> farmer<00:04:52.349> benefits

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
that the garden and the farmer benefits

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.589 
that the garden and the farmer benefits
from<00:04:52.949> it<00:04:53.340> also<00:04:53.520> allows<00:04:54.030> us<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.270> use<00:04:54.479> less

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
from it also allows us to use less

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.839 
from it also allows us to use less
fertilizers<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.800> conserves<00:04:56.370> water<00:04:56.639> which

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
fertilizers it conserves water which

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.029 
fertilizers it conserves water which
means<00:04:57.180> that<00:04:57.419> we<00:04:57.509> use<00:04:57.539> less<00:04:57.900> energy<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:58.860> all

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
means that we use less energy so all

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.529 
means that we use less energy so all
around<00:04:59.190> composting<00:04:59.940> is<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> good<00:05:00.270> thing<00:05:00.389> for

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
around composting is a good thing for

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.840 
around composting is a good thing for
our<00:05:00.690> community
