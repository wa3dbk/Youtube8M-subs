00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.089
 and well I'm a red bus and I'm already 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.740
 investigating my expansion by 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:08.820
 bonus 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.129
 jc j 5 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.299
 I've won my four battles I'm missing 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.279
 one for me I live not many changes of the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.510
 pp but this time I'm going to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.240
 teach 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.300
 the 5 best weapons when I can not 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.130
 5 because I only have 4 which are the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.260
 I'm using right now the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.960
 fifth weapon is the war ax are the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.780
 best weapons of the whole game 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.940
 is any good any good 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.629
 strategy requires at least one of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.550
 these five weapons at least and not 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.680
 they will let those who have won the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 pepe lathes that have had one of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.410
 these five or if not two or three 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410
 all 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.460
 in their strategy that made them win 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.160
 I 'm going to put them together does not mean that 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.510
 be the best strategy but together 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.510
 they will do something not 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.920
 is 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.920
 turrÃ³ for everyone I love the shepherd 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.509
 poor team has not lost any single 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.920
 battle with these four weapons and apart 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:24.740
 almost always new new blood was left 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.450
 the poor do not know what to do with me 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.520
 in part I put neuro spinning 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.520
 counterattack the cube 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.920
 and it is east of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.310
 cyclopean do what you want you can not 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.310
 against me 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.880
 and if you take that, it's part of the neuro 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.400
 tropo sends you to salute to boludo merit 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.160
 and because that was part of the cube 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.360
 is the neurotropic and the cube greet you 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:02.640
 the truncheon greets you cyclops was power 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.680
 but what do you think 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.400

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.030
 exact 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.050
 will hire that I have I have a lot of 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.660
 things 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.780
 the three is more and again of the month and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.160

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.160
 everyone is paid this life 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.150

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.849
 you endured what you want 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.580
 if the fight is over this is another one if 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.460
 Do you want to keep looking 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.580

 pray if I had more 20 for me 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.380
 team I like young people tooth and 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.440
 is that I as well as 52 blows follows 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.860
 being bad and everything so Paraguayan flame 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.200
 death 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.260
 it's okay to ask for it to be fine but nothing 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.810
 can you do against me witch there goes the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.630
 fence that something good 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.760
 you also have the cube 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.330
 to see if I have time to use my 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.330
 cube why 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.939
 layers of frost burning of those made before 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.939
 and I hope not 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.510
 so he killed the quiet extra 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.270
 reassure your power I keep new almost 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.810
 is almost more there is good well 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:02.950
 fields of probabilities is lost in 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.650
 the space exposed poison I have hit 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.580
 of luck I am a very interesting guy and 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.580
 12-12 I know 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:17.060
 no recovery not for you 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.930
 it's a good thing at least sad 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.970
 realities sin 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.970
 that means you can dodge me 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.280
 so 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.350
 let's see what it's up to me is ma jin yo 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.020
 I also have a clear area itself 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.529
 so that it looks like new maybe you 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.479
 good almost like new 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:39.109
 apart I will use more fields of 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.109
 probability 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.650
 Exactly now it is already prettier no longer 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.530
 I can do nothing 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.470
 this nation of 3 without I want to finish 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.650
 new 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.110
 poor of you I feel sorry for more 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.050
 I'm even going to touch you with all the 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.710
 cubes that are already the power of the coyote 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.710
 matra lonely 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.169
 so 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.599
 That's how it was, well, that's what's new. 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.420
 so as not to gain the experience, I'm going 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.460
 to let it load of stamina 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.169
 use the other but let him die alone 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.249
 this 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.590
 and it also happened my turn to see how 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:26.249
 waste shifts and the other one more 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.110
 he says and I 'm running away from fear as well 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.990
 I am a network bus, there are the best 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.979
 weapons at the moment is ventilated 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.979
 he keeps changing the 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.870
 and see you in a next video 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.410
 what mother did they give me 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.030
 well good well defense bad defense well 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.390
 that until next time I'm going to first 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.390
 small boxes 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.100
 they are obviously my first 10 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.210
 well as if I'm going to suffer with 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.690
 but to see what happens until the 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.690
 next
