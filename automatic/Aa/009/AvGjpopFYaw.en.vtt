through the operation remember this

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299

before Rawal in this clip we had already

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
before Rawal in this clip we had already
discussed<00:01:14.909> our<00:01:15.090> assignments<00:01:15.630> stick<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
discussed our assignments stick to this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
discussed our assignments stick to this
plan<00:01:16.580> just<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> fire<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.360> the

plan just because the fire is on the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
other side of the truck doesn't mean you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
other side of the truck doesn't mean you
have<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> change<00:01:20.340> positions<00:01:20.909> especially<00:01:21.750> for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the nozzle them for us it's easier to
