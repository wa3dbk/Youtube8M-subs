00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
would suggest paying around anywhere

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.940 
would suggest paying around anywhere
under<00:01:02.000> fifty<00:01:02.540> thousand<00:01:03.020> once<00:01:03.230> you<00:01:03.380> pay<00:01:03.590> over

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
under fifty thousand once you pay over

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.410

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
fifty thousand you're going to start

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.510 
fifty thousand you're going to start
making<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.899> little<00:01:06.259> to<00:01:06.469> no<00:01:06.590> profit<00:01:06.889> and<00:01:07.280> it's

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
making a little to no profit and it's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.309 
making a little to no profit and it's
really<00:01:07.880> not<00:01:08.149> going<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:08.420> be<00:01:08.509> worth<00:01:08.719> it<00:01:08.869> at<00:01:09.079> all

00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:09.319 
really not going to be worth it at all

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.770 
really not going to be worth it at all
so<00:01:10.159> if<00:01:10.429> you<00:01:10.639> are<00:01:10.850> actually<00:01:11.119> getting<00:01:11.450> logs

so if you are actually getting logs
you're<00:01:12.049> going<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.319> want<00:01:12.469> to<00:01:12.530> click<00:01:12.799> on

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
you're going to want to click on

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.889 
you're going to want to click on
skilling<00:01:13.609> and<00:01:13.789> then<00:01:13.999> the<00:01:14.090> wood<00:01:14.270> cutting<00:01:14.689> and

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
skilling and then the wood cutting and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.770 
skilling and then the wood cutting and
then<00:01:15.409> go<00:01:15.649> up<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.100> these<00:01:16.249> mahogany<00:01:17.030> trees<00:01:17.329> over

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
then go up to these mahogany trees over

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.559 
then go up to these mahogany trees over
here<00:01:18.100> now<00:01:19.100> remember<00:01:19.399> don't<00:01:19.850> use<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.179> infernal

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
here now remember don't use the infernal

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.209 
here now remember don't use the infernal
ad<00:01:20.719> c--<00:01:20.929> because<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.289> will<00:01:21.380> actually<00:01:21.590> burn<00:01:22.009> the

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
ad c-- because it will actually burn the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.779 
ad c-- because it will actually burn the
logs<00:01:22.459> I<00:01:22.819> suggest<00:01:23.329> using<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.810> dragon<00:01:24.409> axe<00:01:25.249> or

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
logs I suggest using the dragon axe or

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.260 
logs I suggest using the dragon axe or
hatchet<00:01:26.060> or<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.810> rune<00:01:27.079> hatchet<00:01:27.590> obviously<00:01:28.270> it

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
hatchet or the rune hatchet obviously it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.239 
hatchet or the rune hatchet obviously it
takes<00:01:29.450> around<00:01:29.689> two<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.439> three<00:01:30.469> trees<00:01:31.039> to

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
takes around two to three trees to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.399 
takes around two to three trees to
actually<00:01:31.670> get<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> full<00:01:32.209> inventory<00:01:32.569> so<00:01:33.109> this<00:01:33.259> is

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
actually get a full inventory so this is

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.260 
actually get a full inventory so this is
a<00:01:33.439> pretty<00:01:33.679> slow<00:01:34.130> method<00:01:34.369> but<00:01:35.149> you're

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
a pretty slow method but you're

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.840 
a pretty slow method but you're
definitely<00:01:35.479> going<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.990> be<00:01:36.259> making<00:01:36.649> a<00:01:36.979> ton<00:01:37.399> more

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
definitely going to be making a ton more

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.629 
definitely going to be making a ton more
profit<00:01:38.420> if<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:38.719> do<00:01:38.959> this<00:01:39.319> method<00:01:39.590> it's<00:01:40.490> just

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:40.639 
profit if you do this method it's just

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:42.340 
profit if you do this method it's just
going<00:01:40.819> to<00:01:40.969> take<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.149> lot<00:01:41.509> longer<00:01:41.779> so<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.170> might

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
going to take a lot longer so it might

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.129 
going to take a lot longer so it might
be<00:01:42.499> better<00:01:42.679> just<00:01:42.799> to<00:01:43.189> buy<00:01:43.310> your<00:01:43.520> own<00:01:43.639> logs<00:01:44.139> now

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:45.139 
be better just to buy your own logs now

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:47.050 
be better just to buy your own logs now

them for 60 K each however this is
pretty<00:02:23.810> bad<00:02:23.989> because<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.709> run<00:02:24.890> back

each<00:02:28.489> which<00:02:28.879> really<00:02:29.269> adds<00:02:29.540> up<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:30.079> highly

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
each which really adds up so I highly

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.929 
each which really adds up so I highly
suggest<00:02:30.709> getting<00:02:31.159> a<00:02:31.280> work<00:02:31.459> bench<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.909> some

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
suggest getting a work bench of some

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.300 
suggest getting a work bench of some
sort<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.720> Butler<00:02:33.109> because<00:02:33.769> it's<00:02:33.980> going<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
sort and a Butler because it's going to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.420 
sort and a Butler because it's going to
make<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.640> incredibly<00:02:35.450> fast<00:02:35.989> now<00:02:36.890> let's<00:02:37.250> talk

to be making a profit of around 400 mil

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.460 
to be making a profit of around 400 mil
so<00:04:16.159> really<00:04:16.699> it's<00:04:16.849> up<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.389> if<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.930> want<00:04:18.289> to

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
so really it's up to you if you want to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.899 
so really it's up to you if you want to
do<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.739> wood<00:04:18.889> cutting<00:04:19.220> or<00:04:19.400> if<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.669> don't

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:19.909 
do the wood cutting or if you don't

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.550 
do the wood cutting or if you don't
because<00:04:20.329> obviously<00:04:20.570> if<00:04:21.019> you<00:04:21.139> do<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.409> wood

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
because obviously if you do the wood

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.810 
because obviously if you do the wood
cutting<00:04:21.889> it's<00:04:22.039> going<00:04:22.219> to<00:04:22.279> take<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.460> lot<00:04:22.610> longer

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
cutting it's going to take a lot longer

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.760 
cutting it's going to take a lot longer
but<00:04:23.630> you're<00:04:23.810> going<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.110> be<00:04:24.229> making<00:04:24.469> more

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
but you're going to be making more

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.129 
but you're going to be making more
profit<00:04:25.250> margin<00:04:25.639> however<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.570> could

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
profit margin however you could

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.950 
profit margin however you could
argue<00:04:27.499> that<00:04:27.740> just<00:04:27.979> buying<00:04:28.219> them<00:04:28.460> outright<00:04:28.960> is

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
argue that just buying them outright is

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.779 
argue that just buying them outright is
going<00:04:30.259> to<00:04:30.379> allow<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.830> make<00:04:31.099> more<00:04:31.310> planks

going to allow you to make more planks

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.909 
going to allow you to make more planks
and<00:04:31.909> thus<00:04:32.210> make<00:04:32.479> more<00:04:32.749> money<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.349> really<00:04:33.740> it's

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
and thus make more money so really it's

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.879 
and thus make more money so really it's
