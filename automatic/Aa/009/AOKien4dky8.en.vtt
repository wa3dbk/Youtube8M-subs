00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.350
 I'm a roger and I wanted to go 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.660
 a tip to you that maybe a lot 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.250
 People already know that maybe a lot of people 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.160
 do not know yet, it 's about how to roll 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.240
 a cable right properly so he has 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.689
 a better shelf life then it is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 basically the following as what I do 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.800
 I'll take one of the tips of the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.710
 cable with my left hand and the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 right hand here you go for a certain 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.440
 amount of it here and double it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.110
 so so sure you can do the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.190
 The size you prefer is a little 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.680
 bigger and so is less is it so much 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.199
 here I pick it up again with the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.600
 left hand one end 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.760
 I come with my right hand and I step 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.729
 Okay here, I'll make the next turn. 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.400
 the same way I did the first one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.680
 I 'll do it, I'll take it instead of myself. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.630
 pass him so I'll pass him to the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 Otherwise I'll go and do it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.150
 inside so understood so that it stays 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.700
 one way back and the other back 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.380
 stay opposite 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.150
 then again here I do the same 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.430
 first again equal to second is e 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.979
 so on 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.650
 then O's there that's the right way to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.320
 to uncoil a cable so that it has 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.850
 a better shelf life and has a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.400
 advantage also when you go 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.500
 uncoiling it and it is rolled up 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.409
 The way I went here 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.970
 he simply unfolds and does not 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.920
 gets no name right there and right 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.460
 practically rolled 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.330
 perfect then again here 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.750
 I got here by here the other to 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.860
 otherwise so again 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.940
 over and ready O's there will roll 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.980
 he looks perfect there 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.980
 Beauty, this is it, thanks.
