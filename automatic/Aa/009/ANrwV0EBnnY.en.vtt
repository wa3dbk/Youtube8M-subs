so I've got two in here right now and it

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.059 
so I've got two in here right now and it
stays<00:03:09.000> pretty<00:03:09.239> snug<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.680> see<00:03:10.889> right

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
stays pretty snug as you can see right

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.770 
stays pretty snug as you can see right
here<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.519> then<00:03:11.639> you<00:03:11.819> can<00:03:11.939> just<00:03:12.239> remove<00:03:12.540> them

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
here and then you can just remove them

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.409 
here and then you can just remove them
as<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.409> need<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.909> a<00:03:15.030> pretty<00:03:15.239> nice
