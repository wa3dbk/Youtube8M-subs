00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.650
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.020
 tutorial in which I will explain 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.880
 how to make hard drives ready 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.640
 before proceeding with the installation of 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.950
 linux 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.350
 well I'm going from the base that 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.190
 you have a windows installed in this case 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.410
 windows 7 as I have it and that for 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.070
 defect you are using our disk 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.600
 hard all the space for windows 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.570
 so what you have to do is if 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.210
 want to install linux is to use the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.610
 appropriate tools for each task 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:45.060
 in this case for example we need 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.900
 leave free space for for linux like 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.640
 and linux for the ico to deal with 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.560
 with windows partitions and 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.330
 resize the modify them and so on 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.210
 but I think the most advisable 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.610
 would use the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.989
 the program that of windows for 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.489
 partition to windows partitions and 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.199
 then the linux tools for 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.030
 install linux and organize the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.770
 chemical partitions 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.600
 so what are we going to do 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.060
 what is the objective the objective is to catch 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 the hard drive with which we have windows 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.040
 in the case windows 7 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.960
 and take a piece of space from the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.200
 windows partition that occupies all the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.120
 hard drive and leave it empty to install 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.400
 in that hole 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.530
 linux let's see how it's done 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.320
 here in windows we have to come to the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.960
 start and on equipment click with the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.450
 right button and click on administer 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.299
 this appears to us here and to the right to 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.920
 the left click on administration 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.050
 Of discs 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.090
 then this scheme of the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.440
 hard drives I have the zero disk that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.290
 have 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.760
 the partition of 100 megs in etc 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.180
 selected for the system and another the 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.460
 partition ce of almost 50 gb ntfs 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.800
 So what do we have to do? 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.240
 to resize the partition so I 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.500
 I recommend you first of all what 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.509
 do you be 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.900
 defragment the hard drive this is 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.310
 relocate all the occupied spaces of the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.380
 hard drive reach and instead of there 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.820
 free holes in between all the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.620
 holes you can put all the holes together 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.990
 occupied in a part of the disk at 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.570
 principle and that the rest stay 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.860
 ordered at the end once you have 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.080
 fact that this I think windows by 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.300
 defect does it automatically in 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.310
 the case of windows vista and windows 7 in 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.470
 windows xp no 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.770
 then we come here and we take the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.099
 partition ce that is the unit that I have 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.580
 click with the right button and click on 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.580
 reduce volume 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.310
 now here in this menu appears 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.819
 introduce total size is said before 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.430
 the reduction in 57 sizes available 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.530
 words for the production all this 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.150
 this size of space you want 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.829
 reduce 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.799
 here we have to bear in mind that 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.019
 we have to enter in megabytes 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.390
 how much space do we want to take away from this 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.340
 installation of windows 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.520
 That space is where we will stay 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.200
 available for our linux then 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.170
 you have to remove as much space as 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.780
 space you want to encourage me 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.730
 case then I'm going to give you 30 gigas 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.730
 and I'm going to put 30,000 points here 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.550
 Once this is done, we will update 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.620
 I insist on the size that we will have 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.960
 our partition after the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.210
 reduction 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.750
 and if we are satisfied we click on 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.750
 reduce 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.880
 and it is already 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.680
 we have finished now we see that 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.630
 we have here the reserved partition of the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.370
 system the ce partition with the new 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.590
 smaller size and now we have here 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.310
 a partition that according to the color black 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.440
 it's unassigned size that are almost 30 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.360
 gigas 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.160
 and you do not have to do anything with that 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.440
 simply leave it as is 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.000
 size not assigned because then that 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.430
 size that we now see in a space without 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.990
 petition , we are going to partition it with 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.180
 the linux tools to install 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.290
 and remember for each tool to 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.420
 each task you have to use the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.709
 appropriate tool the way that I've 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.870
 said this since we have prepared the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.070
 hard disk and such is already that 's what 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.780
 that I wanted to tell you in this video and 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.750
 you can proceed with the installation of 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.820
 linux without any problem of 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.980
 So I'm going to cut here, this is 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.170
 everything I want to teach you and I hope 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.170
 see you in our video chao
