00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.840 
we're hoping that it comes in a theory
we<00:00:55.300> need<00:00:55.570> consistency<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:57.130> it<00:00:57.220> escaped<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.700> lot

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
we need consistency and it escaped a lot

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.180 
we need consistency and it escaped a lot
that<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.150> is<00:00:58.899> also<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.200> ticketed<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.980> fact

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
that that is also a ticketed of the fact

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.460 
that that is also a ticketed of the fact
that<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.460> don't<00:01:00.550> need<00:01:00.699> a<00:01:00.760> lot<00:01:01.000> of<00:01:01.470> mysterious

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
that you don't need a lot of mysterious

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.170 
that you don't need a lot of mysterious

attained<00:01:12.280> over<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.850> years<00:01:13.090> just<00:01:13.300> because<00:01:13.479> of

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
attained over the years just because of

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.980

health of my under eyes and so I

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.420
