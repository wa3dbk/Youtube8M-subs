and tissues and organs and organ systems

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.830 
and tissues and organs and organ systems
and<00:00:29.980> all<00:00:30.550> of<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.029> different<00:00:31.149> parts<00:00:31.630> of

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
and all of the different parts of

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.990 
and all of the different parts of
organisms<00:00:32.649> and<00:00:32.770> then<00:00:33.250> how<00:00:33.430> these<00:00:33.610> organisms

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
organisms and then how these organisms

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.389 
organisms and then how these organisms
interact<00:00:34.630> with<00:00:34.809> one<00:00:34.989> another<00:00:35.100> another<00:00:36.100> and

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
interact with one another another and

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.430 
interact with one another another and
with<00:00:36.820> their<00:00:37.059> environments<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:38.079> create<00:00:38.110> the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
with their environments to create the

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.340 
with their environments to create the
biosphere<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.969> is<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.300> breath<00:00:40.540> of<00:00:40.750> biology

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
biosphere this is the breath of biology

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.500 
biosphere this is the breath of biology
it<00:00:41.829> is<00:00:42.010> huge<00:00:42.340> and<00:00:42.610> so<00:00:42.730> during<00:00:43.000> this<00:00:43.150> course

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
it is huge and so during this course

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.450 
it is huge and so during this course
we'll<00:00:44.140> be<00:00:44.170> diving<00:00:44.500> into<00:00:44.830> each<00:00:45.130> of<00:00:45.340> these

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
we'll be diving into each of these

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.670 
we'll be diving into each of these
different<00:00:45.700> levels<00:00:46.080> learning<00:00:47.080> about<00:00:47.350> how

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
different levels learning about how

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.780 
different levels learning about how
biology<00:00:48.400> works<00:00:48.700> at<00:00:49.090> that<00:00:49.450> level<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:49.990> how<00:00:50.260> that

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
biology works at that level and how that

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.470 
biology works at that level and how that
relates<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.940> each<00:00:52.210> of<00:00:52.390> its<00:00:52.510> adjacent<00:00:53.079> levels

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
relates to each of its adjacent levels

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.940 
relates to each of its adjacent levels
right<00:00:55.480> now<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.810> an<00:00:55.900> amazing<00:00:56.290> time<00:00:56.470> actually<00:00:56.860> to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
right now is an amazing time actually to

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.340 
right now is an amazing time actually to
be<00:00:57.070> studying<00:00:57.400> biology<00:00:57.840> some<00:00:58.840> people<00:00:59.079> call<00:00:59.260> it

medicine biology really is an important

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.319 
medicine biology really is an important
part<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.759> who<00:01:10.390> we<00:01:10.600> are<00:01:10.630> on<00:01:11.110> this<00:01:11.290> planet<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:12.329> so

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
part of who we are on this planet and so

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.580 
part of who we are on this planet and so
we'll<00:01:13.479> be<00:01:13.570> learning<00:01:13.720> some<00:01:14.020> major<00:01:14.200> themes

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
we'll be learning some major themes

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.590 
we'll be learning some major themes
throughout<00:01:14.889> the<00:01:15.009> semester<00:01:15.460> one<00:01:16.060> major<00:01:16.240> theme

throughout the semester one major theme

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.770 
throughout the semester one major theme
is<00:01:17.109> cells<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:17.799> their<00:01:17.950> DNA<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:19.270> are<00:01:19.389> two<00:01:19.569> main

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
types of cells on this planet eukaryotic

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.190 
types of cells on this planet eukaryotic
cells<00:01:23.049> and<00:01:23.289> prokaryotic<00:01:24.130> cells<00:01:25.200> eukaryotic

cells and prokaryotic cells eukaryotic

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.319 
cells and prokaryotic cells eukaryotic
cells<00:01:26.439> are<00:01:26.590> generally<00:01:27.009> much<00:01:27.189> larger<00:01:27.459> they

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
cells are generally much larger they

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.660 
cells are generally much larger they
have<00:01:28.569> a<00:01:28.600> nucleus<00:01:29.139> that<00:01:29.170> houses<00:01:29.709> the<00:01:29.859> DNA<00:01:30.219> and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
have a nucleus that houses the DNA and

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.399 
have a nucleus that houses the DNA and
they<00:01:30.819> also<00:01:30.939> have<00:01:31.270> lots<00:01:31.539> of<00:01:31.780> organelles<00:01:32.200> that

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
they also have lots of organelles that

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.919 
they also have lots of organelles that
perform<00:01:32.799> different<00:01:33.159> functions<00:01:33.929> prokaryotic

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
perform different functions prokaryotic

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.510 
perform different functions prokaryotic
cells<00:01:35.200> on<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.469> other<00:01:35.499> hand<00:01:35.889> are<00:01:36.009> but<00:01:36.159> usually

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
cells on the other hand are but usually

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.910 
cells on the other hand are but usually
much<00:01:36.700> smaller<00:01:37.119> they<00:01:37.810> do<00:01:37.869> not<00:01:38.200> have<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.649> nucleus

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
much smaller they do not have a nucleus

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.239 
much smaller they do not have a nucleus
but<00:01:39.909> they<00:01:40.060> do<00:01:40.119> have<00:01:40.450> DNA<00:01:41.789> so<00:01:42.789> this<00:01:42.969> DNA<00:01:43.389> then<00:01:43.659> is

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
but they do have DNA so this DNA then is

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.399 
but they do have DNA so this DNA then is
common<00:01:45.249> to<00:01:45.429> all<00:01:46.109> organisms<00:01:47.109> on<00:01:47.259> this<00:01:47.350> planet

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
common to all organisms on this planet

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.169 
common to all organisms on this planet
all<00:01:48.009> of<00:01:48.310> life<00:01:48.609> has<00:01:49.420> DNA<00:01:50.079> and<00:01:50.350> uses<00:01:50.709> DNA<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.399> DNA

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
all of life has DNA and uses DNA and DNA

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.019 
all of life has DNA and uses DNA and DNA
is<00:01:52.779> the<00:01:53.170> molecule<00:01:53.319> that<00:01:53.829> houses<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.670> genes

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029 
is the molecule that houses the genes

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:57.209 
is the molecule that houses the genes
and<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.479> genes<00:01:55.929> are<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.529> units<00:01:56.979> of

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
and the genes are the units of

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.910 
and the genes are the units of
inheritance<00:01:57.599> so<00:01:58.599> these<00:01:58.779> are<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.109> information

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
inheritance so these are the information

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.919 
inheritance so these are the information
pieces<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.429> are<00:02:00.520> passed<00:02:00.759> on<00:02:00.999> from<00:02:01.299> parent<00:02:01.869> to

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
pieces that are passed on from parent to

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.239 
pieces that are passed on from parent to
offspring<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:04.119> tell<00:02:04.810> an<00:02:05.079> organism<00:02:05.889> how

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
offspring and that tell an organism how

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.190 
offspring and that tell an organism how
to<00:02:06.310> build<00:02:06.669> an<00:02:06.849> arm<00:02:07.029> and<00:02:07.329> how<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.569> build<00:02:07.840> an<00:02:07.990> eye

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
to build an arm and how to build an eye

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.790 
to build an arm and how to build an eye
and<00:02:08.560> how<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.770> build<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.520> particular<00:02:10.240> protein

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and how to build a particular protein

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.190 
and how to build a particular protein
DNA<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:12.010> made<00:02:12.190> up<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.520> only<00:02:12.970> four<00:02:13.510> different

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
DNA is made up of only four different

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.130 
DNA is made up of only four different
nucleotides<00:02:15.069> later<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.270> we'll<00:02:16.569> discuss<00:02:16.959> these

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
nucleotides later on we'll discuss these

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.589 
nucleotides later on we'll discuss these
in<00:02:17.319> more<00:02:17.470> detail<00:02:17.500> for<00:02:18.370> right<00:02:18.579> now<00:02:18.610> just

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
in more detail for right now just

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.910 
in more detail for right now just
realize<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.019> it<00:02:20.349> is<00:02:20.470> made<00:02:20.680> up<00:02:20.799> of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
realize that it is made up of

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.970 
realize that it is made up of
essentially<00:02:21.700> four<00:02:22.150> letters

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
essentially four letters

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.210 
essentially four letters
AC<00:02:23.129> T's<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.330> G's<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.680> those<00:02:25.920> four

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
AC T's and G's and it's those four

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.820 
AC T's and G's and it's those four
letters<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:27.180> creates<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.080> diversity<00:02:28.739> of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
letters that creates the diversity of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.750 
letters that creates the diversity of
life<00:02:29.010> on<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.340> planet<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.849> we<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:31.760> we've

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
life on this planet that we have we've

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.490 
life on this planet that we have we've
taken<00:02:33.060> advantage<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.659> our<00:02:33.750> knowledge<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.319> DNA

taken advantage of our knowledge of DNA

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.860 
taken advantage of our knowledge of DNA
and<00:02:35.010> one<00:02:35.670> subject<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.239> we'll<00:02:36.420> learn<00:02:36.569> later

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
and one subject that we'll learn later

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.830 
and one subject that we'll learn later
on<00:02:37.019> is<00:02:37.409> DNA<00:02:38.099> technology<00:02:38.760> where<00:02:39.540> we've<00:02:39.690> been

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
on is DNA technology where we've been

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.860 
on is DNA technology where we've been
able<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.230> take<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.220> DNA<00:02:41.610> from<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.970> bacteria<00:02:42.599> and

the DNA from a human mix them together
for<00:02:45.420> example<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> bacterial

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
for example and then have a bacterial

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.960 
for example and then have a bacterial
organism<00:02:48.780> produce<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.010> products<00:02:50.579> from<00:02:50.819> a

you<00:03:26.519> just<00:03:27.090> for<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.329> moment<00:03:27.480> right<00:03:27.810> now<00:03:27.959> just

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
you just for a moment right now just

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.830 
you just for a moment right now just
think<00:03:28.470> off<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.680> top<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:29.130> your<00:03:29.250> head<00:03:29.599> how<00:03:30.599> many

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
species are alive on this planet how

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.809 
species are alive on this planet how
would<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.329> respond<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:35.010> give<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.579> just<00:03:35.730> a

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
would you respond so give you just a

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.979 
would you respond so give you just a
moment<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:37.200> look<00:03:37.319> at<00:03:37.470> these<00:03:37.590> options

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
moment to and to look at these options

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.559 
moment to and to look at these options
well<00:03:40.280> if<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.519> responded<00:03:42.060> anywhere<00:03:42.419> from

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
well if you responded anywhere from

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.860 
well if you responded anywhere from
maybe<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.169> two<00:03:43.200> million<00:03:43.590> then<00:03:44.519> perhaps

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
maybe one to two million then perhaps

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.530 
maybe one to two million then perhaps
you<00:03:45.870> were<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.889> were<00:03:47.010> pretty<00:03:47.340> close<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
you were you were pretty close to the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.509 
you were you were pretty close to the
number<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.019> known<00:03:49.290> species<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.340> have

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
number of known species that we have

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.240 
number of known species that we have
described<00:03:51.000> on<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.329> planet<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.250> that's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
described on this planet and that's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.069 
described on this planet and that's
right<00:03:53.639> now<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.910> number<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.329> about<00:03:54.510> 1.8

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
right now the number is about 1.8

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.949 
right now the number is about 1.8
million<00:03:55.709> species<00:03:56.310> however<00:03:57.090> that's<00:03:57.419> only<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
million species however that's only the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.390 
million species however that's only the
species<00:03:58.169> that<00:03:58.410> we've<00:03:58.530> described<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.280> we've

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
species that we've described so we've

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.879 
species that we've described so we've
actually<00:03:59.549> given<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.060> name<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.540> right<00:04:00.840> but<00:04:01.709> if

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
actually given a name to right but if

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.409 
actually given a name to right but if
you<00:04:01.980> look<00:04:02.190> at<00:04:02.310> all<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.669> the<00:04:02.790> species<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.329> are

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
you look at all of the species that are

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.180 
you look at all of the species that are
alive<00:04:03.660> right<00:04:04.049> now<00:04:04.109> on<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.560> planet<00:04:04.620> we<00:04:05.010> don't

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
alive right now on this planet we don't

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.589 
alive right now on this planet we don't
know<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:05.579> sure<00:04:05.639> but<00:04:05.970> we<00:04:06.090> asked<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.480> mean

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
know for sure but we asked I mean

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.180 
know for sure but we asked I mean
there's<00:04:06.810> probably<00:04:07.200> somewhere<00:04:07.590> between<00:04:07.650> five

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
there's probably somewhere between five

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.280 
there's probably somewhere between five
and<00:04:08.220> thirty<00:04:08.730> million<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:09.750> if<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:09.959> answered

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
and thirty million so if you answered

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.960 
and thirty million so if you answered
maybe<00:04:10.500> in<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.709> ten<00:04:10.889> million<00:04:11.069> range<00:04:11.370> maybe

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
maybe in the ten million range maybe

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.690 
maybe in the ten million range maybe
that's<00:04:12.239> what<00:04:12.419> you<00:04:12.510> were<00:04:12.660> thinking<00:04:13.430> however<00:04:14.430> if

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
that's what you were thinking however if

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.520 
that's what you were thinking however if
you<00:04:15.180> were<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.540> say<00:04:15.750> okay<00:04:16.019> well<00:04:16.349> how<00:04:16.470> many

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
you were to say okay well how many

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.520 
you were to say okay well how many
species<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.340> lived<00:04:18.000> on<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.299> planet<00:04:18.690> at<00:04:19.260> any

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
species have lived on this planet at any

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.529 
species have lived on this planet at any
time<00:04:19.829> then<00:04:20.699> you<00:04:20.820> need<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.060> actually<00:04:21.329> increase

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
time then you need to actually increase

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.860 
time then you need to actually increase
that<00:04:21.660> number<00:04:21.810> about<00:04:22.199> a<00:04:22.229> hundred<00:04:22.650> times

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
that number about a hundred times

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.180 
that number about a hundred times
basically<00:04:24.870> what<00:04:25.229> is<00:04:25.349> alive<00:04:25.620> on<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.889> planet

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
basically what is alive on the planet

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.980 
basically what is alive on the planet
right<00:04:26.310> now<00:04:26.370> represents<00:04:27.270> less<00:04:27.479> than<00:04:27.720> one

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
right now represents less than one

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.700 
right now represents less than one
percent<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.770> what<00:04:29.250> has<00:04:29.490> lived<00:04:29.910> on<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:30.240> planet

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
percent of what has lived on this planet

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.529 
percent of what has lived on this planet
99<00:04:31.710> percent<00:04:32.130> of<00:04:32.190> all<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.700> life<00:04:32.909> has<00:04:33.150> already

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
99 percent of all of life has already

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.219 
99 percent of all of life has already
gone<00:04:33.659> extinct

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
gone extinct

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.779 
gone extinct
so<00:04:36.229> as<00:04:36.439> scientists<00:04:36.949> one<00:04:37.249> of<00:04:37.369> the<00:04:37.459> things<00:04:37.669> we

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
so as scientists one of the things we

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.519 
so as scientists one of the things we
try<00:04:37.969> to<00:04:37.999> do<00:04:38.179> is<00:04:38.299> catalog<00:04:38.749> this<00:04:38.869> now<00:04:39.019> I'm<00:04:39.379> an

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529 
try to do is catalog this now I'm an

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.859 
try to do is catalog this now I'm an
entomologist<00:04:40.159> and<00:04:40.369> so<00:04:40.519> we<00:04:40.999> go<00:04:41.509> and<00:04:41.719> collect

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:41.869 
entomologist and so we go and collect

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:44.829 
entomologist and so we go and collect
insects<00:04:42.619> curate<00:04:43.489> them<00:04:43.699> and<00:04:43.939> then<00:04:44.089> put<00:04:44.299> them<00:04:44.419> in

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:44.839 
insects curate them and then put them in

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.659 
insects curate them and then put them in
these<00:04:44.989> vast<00:04:45.349> collections<00:04:46.009> in<00:04:46.159> order<00:04:46.399> to<00:04:46.519> try

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
these vast collections in order to try

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.639 
these vast collections in order to try
to<00:04:46.699> understand<00:04:47.389> and<00:04:47.569> comprehend<00:04:48.109> the

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:48.649 
to understand and comprehend the

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:52.389 
to understand and comprehend the
diversity<00:04:49.189> of<00:04:49.219> life<00:04:50.529> and<00:04:51.529> what<00:04:52.219> we've<00:04:52.369> been

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:52.399 
diversity of life and what we've been

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:55.089 
diversity of life and what we've been
able<00:04:52.579> to<00:04:52.939> summarize<00:04:53.929> is<00:04:54.529> that<00:04:54.799> life<00:04:55.069> is

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
able to summarize is that life is

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.059 
able to summarize is that life is
organized<00:04:55.699> into<00:04:55.939> three<00:04:56.029> main<00:04:56.869> parts<00:04:57.199> what<00:04:57.949> we

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
organized into three main parts what we

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.779 
organized into three main parts what we
call<00:04:58.279> domains<00:04:59.319> the<00:05:00.319> domain<00:05:00.829> bacteria<00:05:01.069> and<00:05:01.699> the

a female human being and these hair like

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.889 
a female human being and these hair like
structures<00:06:07.129> move<00:06:07.489> in<00:06:07.669> a<00:06:07.729> wave-like<00:06:07.999> fashion

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:08.899 
structures move in a wave-like fashion

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:10.869 
structures move in a wave-like fashion
and<00:06:09.289> that's<00:06:09.409> what<00:06:09.769> brings<00:06:09.919> the<00:06:10.159> egg<00:06:10.429> from<00:06:10.789> the

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:10.879 
and that's what brings the egg from the

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.909 
and that's what brings the egg from the
end<00:06:11.239> of<00:06:11.419> the<00:06:11.509> fallopian<00:06:11.689> tube<00:06:12.110> down<00:06:12.349> into<00:06:12.649> the

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
end of the fallopian tube down into the

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.939 
end of the fallopian tube down into the
uterus<00:06:13.569> what's<00:06:14.569> amazing<00:06:14.989> though<00:06:15.469> is<00:06:15.499> if<00:06:15.829> you

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
uterus what's amazing though is if you

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.879 
uterus what's amazing though is if you
look<00:06:16.129> at<00:06:16.249> the<00:06:16.369> micro<00:06:16.789> structure<00:06:17.479> of<00:06:17.889> the

psyllium on the inside of the fallopian
tube<00:06:24.379> you<00:06:25.069> see<00:06:25.309> that<00:06:25.489> the<00:06:25.639> structure<00:06:26.179> is

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
tube you see that the structure is

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.899 
tube you see that the structure is
exactly<00:06:26.659> the<00:06:27.199> same<00:06:27.409> so<00:06:28.039> there's<00:06:28.219> this<00:06:28.369> unity

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
exactly the same so there's this unity

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.719 
exactly the same so there's this unity
within<00:06:29.449> this<00:06:29.689> structure<00:06:30.069> so<00:06:31.069> one<00:06:31.309> might<00:06:31.489> ask

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
within this structure so one might ask

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.909 
within this structure so one might ask
well<00:06:32.089> how<00:06:32.569> does<00:06:32.629> how<00:06:33.229> can<00:06:33.409> you<00:06:33.469> account<00:06:33.739> for

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
well how does how can you account for

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.889 
well how does how can you account for
this<00:06:34.129> combination<00:06:34.759> of<00:06:34.879> both<00:06:34.999> unity<00:06:35.629> and

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:35.899 
this combination of both unity and

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:40.329 
this combination of both unity and
diversity<00:06:36.619> and<00:06:37.189> mega<00:06:37.939> diversity<00:06:38.649> well<00:06:39.649> there

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:40.339 
diversity and mega diversity well there

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.369 
diversity and mega diversity well there
is<00:06:40.519> one<00:06:40.549> answer<00:06:40.969> and<00:06:41.449> one<00:06:41.719> answer<00:06:41.989> that<00:06:42.139> is<00:06:42.259> the

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:42.379 
is one answer and one answer that is the

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.060 
is one answer and one answer that is the
best<00:06:42.589> and<00:06:42.860> that<00:06:42.949> answer<00:06:43.279> is<00:06:43.309> evolution

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
best and that answer is evolution

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.480 
best and that answer is evolution
and<00:06:44.340> I<00:06:44.610> love<00:06:44.910> this<00:06:45.180> the<00:06:45.450> quote<00:06:46.230> from<00:06:46.500> Theo<00:06:47.190> Diaz

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
and I love this the quote from Theo Diaz

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.250 
and I love this the quote from Theo Diaz
jib<00:06:47.700> chance<00:06:48.360> key<00:06:48.600> where<00:06:48.750> he<00:06:48.900> said<00:06:49.110> that

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
jib chance key where he said that

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.320 
jib chance key where he said that
nothing<00:06:49.470> in<00:06:49.800> biology<00:06:49.950> makes<00:06:50.370> sense<00:06:50.670> except<00:06:51.240> in

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
nothing in biology makes sense except in

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.140 
nothing in biology makes sense except in
the<00:06:51.390> light<00:06:51.480> of<00:06:51.630> evolution<00:06:51.840> so<00:06:52.610> if<00:06:53.610> we<00:06:53.880> want<00:06:54.090> to

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
the light of evolution so if we want to

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.360 
the light of evolution so if we want to
understand<00:06:54.600> biology<00:06:54.780> we<00:06:55.680> need<00:06:55.860> to<00:06:55.980> understand

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
understand biology we need to understand

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.920 
understand biology we need to understand
evolution<00:06:56.820> and<00:06:56.940> that's<00:06:57.000> why<00:06:57.210> evolution<00:06:57.810> is

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
evolution and that's why evolution is

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.350 
evolution and that's why evolution is
really<00:06:58.110> going<00:06:58.320> to<00:06:58.380> be<00:06:58.530> the<00:06:58.710> theme<00:06:59.120> that<00:07:00.120> is

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
really going to be the theme that is

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.420 
really going to be the theme that is
woven<00:07:00.660> into<00:07:00.990> each<00:07:01.020> of<00:07:01.530> the<00:07:01.650> major<00:07:01.860> units

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430

evolution<00:07:05.040> will<00:07:05.160> be<00:07:05.280> what<00:07:05.520> we<00:07:05.640> learn<00:07:05.880> a<00:07:06.150> lot

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
evolution will be what we learn a lot

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.050 
evolution will be what we learn a lot
about<00:07:07.100> now<00:07:08.100> of<00:07:08.220> course<00:07:08.370> when<00:07:08.610> someone<00:07:08.880> says

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
about now of course when someone says

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.550 
about now of course when someone says
evolution<00:07:09.630> many<00:07:09.810> people<00:07:10.140> think<00:07:10.320> immediately

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
evolution many people think immediately

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.410 
evolution many people think immediately

maybe<00:07:12.960> some<00:07:13.290> people<00:07:13.560> think<00:07:13.770> of<00:07:13.920> other<00:07:14.100> things

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
maybe some people think of other things

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.740 
maybe some people think of other things
but<00:07:16.500> evolution<00:07:17.160> in<00:07:17.400> biology<00:07:17.640> is<00:07:18.180> really<00:07:18.210> the

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
but evolution in biology is really the

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.900 
but evolution in biology is really the

evolution is the unifying theme of
