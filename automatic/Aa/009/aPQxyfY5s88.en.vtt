00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
eclipses so over so it'll just be users

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.680 
eclipses so over so it'll just be users
desktop<00:06:30.260> users<00:06:31.260> your<00:06:31.710> username<00:06:32.190> desktop<00:06:33.150> well

Eclipse press ok and wait for this thing
to<00:06:44.940> load<00:06:50.450> and<00:06:53.660> so<00:06:54.660> much<00:06:54.840> there

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:04.939 

oh<00:07:01.460> here<00:07:02.460> it<00:07:02.490> is<00:07:02.610> and<00:07:03.389> it'll<00:07:03.870> say<00:07:04.110> client<00:07:04.800> with

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:04.949 
oh here it is and it'll say client with

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.790 
oh here it is and it'll say client with
an<00:07:05.479> now<00:07:06.479> don't<00:07:06.870> ignore<00:07:07.050> server<00:07:07.470> because<00:07:07.710> we

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
an now don't ignore server because we

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.960 
an now don't ignore server because we
don't<00:07:07.949> need<00:07:08.039> Avenue<00:07:08.370> that<00:07:08.580> we<00:07:08.699> can<00:07:08.820> even

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
don't need Avenue that we can even

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.939 
don't need Avenue that we can even
delete<00:07:09.210> it<00:07:09.330> if<00:07:09.419> you<00:07:09.539> want<00:07:09.720> we<00:07:09.960> should<00:07:10.139> just

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
delete it if you want we should just

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.909 
delete it if you want we should just
keep<00:07:11.130> server<00:07:11.490> and<00:07:12.030> client<00:07:13.020> that<00:07:13.320> should<00:07:13.710> work

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 
keep server and client that should work

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.760 
keep server and client that should work
so<00:07:13.949> it<00:07:14.190> should<00:07:14.370> say<00:07:14.520> client<00:07:14.970> server<00:07:15.270> and

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
so it should say client server and

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.260 
so it should say client server and

for my next tutorial so that's how you

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.999 
for my next tutorial so that's how you
set<00:07:27.810> up<00:07:27.840> eclipse<00:07:28.199> make<00:07:28.620> sure<00:07:28.770> you<00:07:28.860> don't

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:29.009 
set up eclipse make sure you don't

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:31.370 
set up eclipse make sure you don't
believe<00:07:29.250> mCP<00:07:29.669> so<00:07:29.820> you<00:07:30.599> do<00:07:30.750> and<00:07:30.990> you<00:07:31.080> can<00:07:31.229> also

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 
believe mCP so you do and you can also

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.040 
believe mCP so you do and you can also
rename<00:07:31.680> it<00:07:32.130> to<00:07:32.160> the<00:07:32.400> client<00:07:32.759> name<00:07:32.910> so<00:07:33.120> like<00:07:33.270> my
