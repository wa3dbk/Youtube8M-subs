using a dehydrator or a microwave but I
wouldn't<00:01:37.509> recommend<00:01:37.600> thing<00:01:37.960> for<00:01:38.140> air<00:01:38.259> drying

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
wouldn't recommend thing for air drying

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.160 
wouldn't recommend thing for air drying
or<00:01:39.159> hanging<00:01:39.609> because<00:01:40.030> they<00:01:40.509> tend<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.929> mold

easily<00:01:41.649> you<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.520> try<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.759> leaf<00:01:42.969> separately

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
easily you can try the leaf separately

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.510 
easily you can try the leaf separately
or<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.929> can<00:01:44.140> chop<00:01:44.590> them<00:01:44.770> up<00:01:44.829> or<00:01:45.039> crush<00:01:45.249> them

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520

thing<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.049> want<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.320> point<00:01:56.499> out<00:01:56.710> when<00:01:57.039> you're

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
thing I want to point out when you're

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.999 
thing I want to point out when you're
freezing<00:01:57.609> your<00:01:57.819> basil<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.649> tends<00:01:59.890> to

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
freezing your basil is that it tends to

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.730 
freezing your basil is that it tends to
change<00:02:00.640> color<00:02:00.969> because<00:02:01.749> of<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.929> enzyme<00:02:02.409> that

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
change color because of the enzyme that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.620 
change color because of the enzyme that
still<00:02:02.979> works<00:02:03.249> even<00:02:04.030> during<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.420> freezing

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
still works even during the freezing

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.889 
still works even during the freezing
process<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.310> breaks<00:02:06.579> down<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.270> leaves<00:02:07.509> and

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
process it breaks down the leaves and

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.440 
process it breaks down the leaves and
decomposes<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.770> causing<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.490> turn<00:02:09.700> dark

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
decomposes it causing it to turn dark

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.350 
decomposes it causing it to turn dark
green<00:02:10.810> or<00:02:11.050> brown<00:02:11.230> as<00:02:11.710> well<00:02:12.400> as<00:02:12.580> texture<00:02:13.210> it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
green or brown as well as texture it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.980 
green or brown as well as texture it
gets<00:02:13.540> pretty

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
gets pretty

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.410 
gets pretty
mocchi<00:02:14.320> if<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.370> decide<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.910> just<00:02:16.060> freeze<00:02:16.270> them

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
mocchi if you decide to just freeze them

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.510 
mocchi if you decide to just freeze them
directly<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.350> will<00:02:17.530> not<00:02:17.710> alter<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.070> flavor<00:02:18.400> of

the experiment I froze them individually

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.650 
the experiment I froze them individually
I<00:02:35.830> just<00:02:36.070> made<00:02:36.220> sure<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.490> they<00:02:36.640> were<00:02:36.700> dry<00:02:37.300> and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
I just made sure that they were dry and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.170 
I just made sure that they were dry and
I<00:02:38.140> place<00:02:38.320> them<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.650> ziplock<00:02:39.010> bag<00:02:39.280> flash

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I place them in the ziplock bag flash

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.050 
I place them in the ziplock bag flash
froze<00:02:40.510> them<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:41.710> about<00:02:41.830> 15<00:02:42.400> minutes

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
froze them for about 15 minutes

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.600 
froze them for about 15 minutes
our<00:02:43.450> little<00:02:43.750> stiff<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.190> presume<00:02:45.580> that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
our little stiff so you can presume that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.670 
our little stiff so you can presume that
that<00:02:46.030> way<00:02:46.150> as<00:02:46.270> well<00:02:46.540> instead<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.320> ice<00:02:47.440> cube
