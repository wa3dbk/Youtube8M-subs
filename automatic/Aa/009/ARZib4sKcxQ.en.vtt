00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
of work to achieve something like ice

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.000 
of work to achieve something like ice
cream<00:03:55.850> by<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.780> same<00:03:57.079> token<00:03:57.109> it<00:03:57.560> makes<00:03:57.769> ice

cream by the same token it makes ice

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.680 
cream by the same token it makes ice
cream<00:03:58.040> seem<00:03:58.609> overly<00:03:59.000> attractive<00:03:59.299> when

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
cream seem overly attractive when

cream seem overly attractive when
otherwise<00:03:59.930> it<00:04:00.230> would<00:04:00.350> be<00:04:00.380> just<00:04:00.739> ice<00:04:00.950> cream<00:04:01.280> so

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
otherwise it would be just ice cream so

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.640 
otherwise it would be just ice cream so
this<00:04:02.359> may<00:04:02.540> sound<00:04:02.810> like<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:03.079> strange<00:04:03.260> concept

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
this may sound like a strange concept

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.130 
this may sound like a strange concept
but<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.609> get<00:04:04.819> some<00:04:05.060> kids<00:04:05.299> together<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.989> you
