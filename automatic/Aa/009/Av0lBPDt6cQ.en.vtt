when he starts to pull out and kind of

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.640 
when he starts to pull out and kind of
automatically<00:03:12.450> turns<00:03:12.840> because<00:03:13.290> he<00:03:13.470> hears

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
automatically turns because he hears

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.890

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
that pressure in the front so I'm not

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.890 
that pressure in the front so I'm not
having<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.409> with<00:03:16.560> it

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.690 

he<00:03:23.900> turned<00:03:24.110> he<00:03:24.260> pulled<00:03:24.500> out<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.010> then<00:03:25.430> it

he turned he pulled out and then it

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.750 
he turned he pulled out and then it
turns<00:03:25.970> himself<00:03:26.180> now<00:03:26.660> obviously<00:03:27.370> this<00:03:28.370> isn't<00:03:28.580> a

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
turns himself now obviously this isn't a

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.420 
turns himself now obviously this isn't a
magic<00:03:28.910> tool<00:03:29.320> but<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.350> think<00:03:30.620> was<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:30.800> really

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
magic tool but I think was a really

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.240 
magic tool but I think was a really
heavy<00:03:31.640> puller<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.270> with<00:03:33.050> training<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.920> this

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
heavy puller and with training that this

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.160 
heavy puller and with training that this
would<00:03:34.490> really<00:03:34.760> benefit<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:35.570> and<00:03:35.810> help<00:03:36.110> you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
would really benefit you and help you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.790 
would really benefit you and help you
guide<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.280> dog<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:37.960> you<00:03:38.960> feel<00:03:39.170> better<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.650> in

guide the dog and you feel better and in
