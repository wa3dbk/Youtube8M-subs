I'm going to show you how to do
Kitchener<00:00:06.770> stitch<00:00:06.800> or<00:00:07.370> grafting<00:00:08.029> on<00:00:09.190> garter

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
Kitchener stitch or grafting on garter

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.850 
Kitchener stitch or grafting on garter
stitch<00:00:10.370> fabric<00:00:11.080> so<00:00:12.080> for<00:00:12.289> the<00:00:12.379> sequence<00:00:12.709> I'll

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
stitch fabric so for the sequence I'll

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.779 
stitch fabric so for the sequence I'll
be<00:00:12.949> showing<00:00:13.129> you<00:00:13.309> you<00:00:13.699> need<00:00:13.879> to<00:00:14.000> have<00:00:15.100> a<00:00:16.100> row<00:00:16.670> of

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
be showing you you need to have a row of

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.420 
be showing you you need to have a row of
purl<00:00:17.470> stitches<00:00:18.470> on<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.040> front<00:00:19.130> needle

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
purl stitches on the front needle

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.880 
purl stitches on the front needle
directly<00:00:20.210> below<00:00:20.630> these<00:00:20.840> needle<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.860> needle

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
directly below these needle the needle

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.910 
directly below these needle the needle
and<00:00:22.510> a<00:00:23.510> row<00:00:23.660> of<00:00:23.780> knit<00:00:23.990> stitches<00:00:24.290> on<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:24.770> back

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
and a row of knit stitches on the back

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.640 
and a row of knit stitches on the back
needle<00:00:25.220> if<00:00:25.940> you're<00:00:26.150> holding<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:26.570> them<00:00:27.440> up

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
needle if you're holding it them up

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.120 
needle if you're holding it them up
together<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:30.050> dropping<00:00:30.320> that<00:00:30.560> down<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.830> guess

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
together and dropping that down I guess

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.340 
together and dropping that down I guess
it'll<00:00:31.369> look<00:00:31.490> like<00:00:31.670> purl<00:00:32.090> ridges<00:00:32.449> on<00:00:32.719> that<00:00:33.140> back

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
it'll look like purl ridges on that back

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.850 
it'll look like purl ridges on that back
needle<00:00:37.390> okay<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:38.690> preliminary<00:00:38.989> step<00:00:39.590> for

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
needle okay so the preliminary step for

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.800 
needle okay so the preliminary step for
this<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:42.110> go<00:00:42.380> on<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.180> near<00:00:44.180> needle<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.690> go

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
this is to go on the near needle to go

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.190 
this is to go on the near needle to go
in<00:00:44.989> purl<00:00:45.230> wise<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.890> first<00:00:46.100> stitch<00:00:47.200> pull

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
in purl wise to the first stitch pull

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.740 
in purl wise to the first stitch pull
through<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:49.420> purl<00:00:50.420> wise<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:52.750> just

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
through and purl wise on to the just

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.380 
through and purl wise on to the just
twist<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:54.820> make<00:00:55.820> sure<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.030> get<00:00:56.120> all<00:00:56.270> these

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
twist it make sure you get all these

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:07.440 
twist it make sure you get all these
right<00:01:00.460> okay<00:01:01.489> purl<00:01:02.239> wise<00:01:02.420> onto<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:05.320> back

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
right okay purl wise onto the back

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.920 
right okay purl wise onto the back
needle

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.250 

get<00:01:11.680> down<00:01:11.920> there<00:01:12.160> okay

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.070 

so<00:01:19.260> now<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.940> repeated<00:01:20.940> sequence<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.570> actually

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
so now the repeated sequence is actually

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.930 
so now the repeated sequence is actually
the<00:01:22.200> same<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.620> both<00:01:22.860> needles<00:01:23.370> so<00:01:23.580> there's<00:01:23.790> only

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
the same on both needles so there's only

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.510 
the same on both needles so there's only
one<00:01:24.120> to<00:01:24.270> remember<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:25.500> front<00:01:26.010> needle

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
one to remember the front needle

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.930 
one to remember the front needle
we<00:01:26.640> begin<00:01:26.910> with<00:01:27.380> knit<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:29.220> knitwise<00:01:29.640> with

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
we begin with knit going knitwise with

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.840 
we begin with knit going knitwise with
your<00:01:30.150> tapestry<00:01:30.630> needle<00:01:31.190> slip<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.310> off<00:01:32.430> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
then purl wise just like for grafting

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.280 
then purl wise just like for grafting
stockinette<00:01:37.650> fabric<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:39.300> now<00:01:39.780> you'll<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290

when you're grafting stockinette fabric

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.720 
when you're grafting stockinette fabric
is<00:02:26.810> you're<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.050> doing<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.590> what<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.519> do<00:02:29.640> to

the second stitch on both in both cases

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.940 
the second stitch on both in both cases
which<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.400> purl<00:02:35.420> that's<00:02:36.420> how<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.570> begin<00:02:36.950> your

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
which is purl that's how you begin your

which is purl that's how you begin your
grafting<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.970> by<00:02:39.090> going<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.390> purl<00:02:39.600> wise
