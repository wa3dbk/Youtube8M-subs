00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.560
 another video of me and today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.050
 is something else next to the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.000
 animals r keychains precisely because so 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.820
 What's in China Wanted was pretty 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.840
 Well sold, there are some pictures of it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.480
 and at the same time short what is the living 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 animals in here 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.760
 those in a nutrient solution are so 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.439
 the whole stuff of his seduction then 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.390
 So they come in many 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.340
 nutrient solution to snack 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.730
 material development well packed then well 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:42.290
 So there is a lot about it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.140
 quite a lot of turtles salamander everything 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.719
 more becomes where the walls airtight 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.550
 should pack some model 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.020
 theoretically or even a few days 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.940
 survive in there 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 That's what they gave you then 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.870
 probably again in march 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.859
 The animals will field plastic bags 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:09.780
 welded in torture painfully 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.090
