in<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.710> brutal<00:01:06.920> end<00:01:07.250> up<00:01:07.430> but<00:01:07.549> whatever<00:01:07.930> all<00:01:08.930> of

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
in a brutal end up but whatever all of

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.110 
in a brutal end up but whatever all of
his<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.650> all<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.159> his<00:01:10.280> pokemon<00:01:10.670> are<00:01:10.790> flying

his to all of his pokemon are flying

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.350 
his to all of his pokemon are flying
types<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.290> that<00:01:12.650> was<00:01:12.830> absolutely<00:01:13.760> perfect<00:01:14.090> for

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
types so that was absolutely perfect for

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.719 
types so that was absolutely perfect for
this<00:01:14.540> match<00:01:14.810> because<00:01:15.159> both<00:01:16.159> sides<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.610> this

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
this match because both sides of this

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.180 
this match because both sides of this
pass<00:01:17.000> can<00:01:17.360> deal<00:01:17.600> good<00:01:18.229> damage<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.920> flying

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
pass can deal good damage to flying

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.260 
pass can deal good damage to flying
types<00:01:19.430> either<00:01:19.729> ice<00:01:20.240> or<00:01:20.600> rock<00:01:20.840> type<00:01:21.110> damage<00:01:22.270> so

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
types either ice or rock type damage so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.030 
types either ice or rock type damage so
we're<00:01:23.390> going<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.690> neon<00:01:23.990> Coliseum<00:01:24.590> again<00:01:24.860> I

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
we're going to the neon Coliseum again I

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.850 
we're going to the neon Coliseum again I
think<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.520> had<00:01:25.700> been<00:01:25.880> selecting<00:01:26.510> it<00:01:26.680> but<00:01:27.680> I

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
think I had been selecting it but I

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.770 
think I had been selecting it but I
don't<00:01:27.979> know<00:01:28.190> they<00:01:29.030> start<00:01:29.330> off<00:01:29.390> with<00:01:29.600> their

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
don't know they start off with their

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
don't know they start off with their
Moltres<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.979> there

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
Moltres and there

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.359 
Moltres and there
Zapdos<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.960> really<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.710> think<00:01:35.740> they<00:01:36.250> had

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
Zapdos and I really I think they had

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.940 
Zapdos and I really I think they had
been<00:01:36.549> predicting<00:01:37.030> my<00:01:37.179> i<00:01:37.210> steam<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:38.049> I<00:01:38.439> side<00:01:38.829> of

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
been predicting my i steam the I side of

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.410 
been predicting my i steam the I side of
the<00:01:39.009> past<00:01:39.219> because<00:01:39.429> with<00:01:39.729> zapdos<00:01:40.119> they<00:01:40.299> can

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
the past because with zapdos they can

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.770 
the past because with zapdos they can
use<00:01:40.539> Thunderbolt<00:01:40.990> on<00:01:42.060> cloister<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:43.090> then<00:01:43.479> a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
use Thunderbolt on cloister and then a

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.050 
use Thunderbolt on cloister and then a
mult<00:01:44.619> res<00:01:44.860> would<00:01:45.009> use<00:01:45.159> like<00:01:45.310> fire<00:01:45.579> blaster

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
mult res would use like fire blaster

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.889 
mult res would use like fire blaster
flamethrower<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:47.159> Abomasnow<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.270> yeah<00:01:49.569> they

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
goes for Thunderbolt I was kind of

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.569 
goes for Thunderbolt I was kind of
hoping<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.319> would<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.560> less<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.250> it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
hoping that it would do less but it

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.210 
hoping that it would do less but it
actually<00:02:19.120> does<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.569> good<00:02:19.900> bit<00:02:20.140> even<00:02:20.950> with<00:02:21.099> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
actually does a good bit even with the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.009 
actually does a good bit even with the
sandstorm<00:02:21.819> boosting<00:02:22.329> my<00:02:22.420> special<00:02:22.780> defense

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
sandstorm boosting my special defense

whatever go for rock side with tyranitar
and<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.510> was<00:02:59.660> really<00:02:59.840> hoping<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.380> I'd<00:03:00.470> be

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
and I was really hoping that I'd be

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.000 
and I was really hoping that I'd be
faster<00:03:01.250> because<00:03:01.760> then<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.450> could<00:03:02.510> save<00:03:03.050> Agron<00:03:03.800> I

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
faster because then I could save Agron I

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.680 
faster because then I could save Agron I
know<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.460> AG<00:03:04.640> wants<00:03:04.970> gonna<00:03:05.120> go<00:03:05.240> first<00:03:05.420> because

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
know the AG wants gonna go first because

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.330 
know the AG wants gonna go first because
he<00:03:05.960> usually<00:03:06.230> goes<00:03:06.560> first<00:03:06.860> when<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.040> do<00:03:07.130> rock

rock slide do pretty good damage

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.040 
rock slide do pretty good damage
considering<00:03:22.070> Lugia's<00:03:22.910> wall<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.840> don't

earthquake knocks out Agron and it does

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.940 
earthquake knocks out Agron and it does
like<00:03:31.580> nothing<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.510> tyranitar<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.530> wind

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
like nothing that tyranitar in wind

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.370 
like nothing that tyranitar in wind
which<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.460> nice<00:03:34.700> because<00:03:35.000> it's<00:03:35.900> good<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.290> have

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
which is nice because it's good to have

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.820 
which is nice because it's good to have
a<00:03:36.440> bulky<00:03:36.890> tyranitar<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.870> gallant<00:03:39.320> goes<00:03:39.530> down

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
a bulky tyranitar so a gallant goes down

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.210 
a bulky tyranitar so a gallant goes down
to<00:03:40.010> earth<00:03:40.190> quake<00:03:41.410> doesn't<00:03:42.410> affect<00:03:42.710> Zapdos<00:03:43.190> and

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
to earth quake doesn't affect Zapdos and

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.949 
to earth quake doesn't affect Zapdos and
then<00:03:43.700> I'm<00:03:43.790> faster<00:03:44.240> than<00:03:44.270> zapdos<00:03:44.690> with<00:03:44.840> that

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
then I'm faster than zapdos with that

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.559 
then I'm faster than zapdos with that
dragon<00:03:45.110> dance<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.740> I<00:03:45.830> go<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:46.130> rock<00:03:46.280> slide

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
dragon dance and I go for rock slide

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.160 
dragon dance and I go for rock slide
and<00:03:47.659> then<00:03:47.900> knock<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.290> both<00:03:48.709> out<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:50.780> lugia

the sandstorm rages I send out Mamoswine

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.809 
the sandstorm rages I send out Mamoswine

weather effects don't decrease blizzards
accuracy<00:04:58.849> it<00:04:58.939> just<00:04:59.089> makes<00:04:59.239> it<00:04:59.330> normal<00:05:00.039> price

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
accuracy it just makes it normal price

chart<00:05:01.339> does<00:05:01.969> over<00:05:02.449> half<00:05:02.779> which<00:05:03.499> was<00:05:03.709> awesome

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
chart does over half which was awesome

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.119 
chart does over half which was awesome
because<00:05:04.789> Mamoswine<00:05:05.569> is<00:05:05.809> crazily<00:05:06.499> powerful
