00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.510
 currently on the mobile market 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.779
 phones already appeared big 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.620
 selection of low-cost devices center

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.030
 value for money 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.440
 one of the first places in this segment let's 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.880
 consider in detail the strong and weak 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 hand this is the apparatus 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.070
 the phone is completely made of matte 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.699
 plastic in the hand is comfortable and does not slip 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.839
 build quality is very high after that 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.039
 getting no only 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.940
 Wishes to plastic housing 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.290
 especially the back cover was a little later 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.739
 shields 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.149
 on the front panel are three 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.070
 mechanical keys set of timber 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.989
 number and call the main menu 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.149
 right on the reset buttons there is a small 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.260
 service indicator 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.719
 interface connectors on the left 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.609
 headphone and charging as well 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.570
 volume rocker a little bit 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.129
 it is unusual that the latter are 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.930
 wrong as it would be more convenient 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.660
 on the right side is a slot for 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.290
 micro sd memory cards and two pay keys 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.050
 hands of the apparatus and call the camera in 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.000
 the bottom right is a folding 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.050
 the stylus holds it tight enough and 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.850
 located consumption of the body so 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.540
 accidentally losing it practically 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.090
 Impossible battery compartment 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.110
 is in the back and takes up half 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.420
 back side set speeds and 500 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.760

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.600
 900 billion hours capacity stated 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.070
 work time is three s 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.610
 a half hour talk time and up 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.280
 three hundred and fifty hours in mode 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.030
 expectations we estimate 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.409
 with not too intense model 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.110
 using the machine will live 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.609
 about four five days 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.669
 development 500 there are five 

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:32.659
 color solutions golden brown 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.169
 red black barnaul 

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:36.510
 Violet 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.750
 in decree 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.670
 3 inch is installed in the device 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.460

 stylus especially when working with 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.910
 small interface elements 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.350
 The image on the screen is clearly titanium 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.950
 saturated 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.100
 viewing angles are very good at the parade 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.350
 it will be convenient to watch movies 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990
 especially in native permissions 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.110
 the sun display of course after that 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.140
 text, in principle, it remains to be considered 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.850
 3,500 units and built-in 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.590
 accelerometer which is used in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.889
 some position

 decree 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.779
 interface of the phone and is intuitive and 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:18.370
 not difficult 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.050
 there are two desktops on 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.040
 first you can add up to nine favorites 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.040
 numbers for speed dialing on the second 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.150
 several budgets such as a calendar 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.180

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.090
 this radio and mp3 player 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.670
 change or add to this panel 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.490
 can't 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.010
 the device is installed quite good 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.490
 own browser easy to 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.920
 use and it works 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.870
 fast enough well implemented 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.080
 java applications can work simultaneously 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.760
 run Tobolsk programs which 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.120
 will function

 3 megapixel resolution without 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.340
 autofocus and flash but despite this 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.040
 if you aim well with 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.620
 daylight turns out quite 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.010
 decent shots are also available.

 video with a resolution of 320x240 pixels format 3 4 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.360
 the third 550 radio with rds support and 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.990
 not a bad advantage seeing 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.280
 increased memory for radio stations against 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.830
 standard will visit the device 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.569
 remembers up to fifty waves 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.560
 The sound quality in the headphones is quite good. 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.230
 here listen to music through the speaker to me 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.040
 very comfortable the fact is that the sound 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.819
 the phone is displayed through the spoken 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.170
 speaker such a picture these goals are not 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.039
 provided for 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.719
 as for communication, someone 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.209
 no particular excesses 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.819
 Bluetooth is implemented in the device if 2 1 s 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.559
 support and others 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.819
 in decree 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.459
 in the end, we can say that ji pi pi 500 sp 500 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.129
 quite balanced and 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.929
 quality product when its 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.409
 price category but to lower 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.809
 cost to manufacturer 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.719
 of course I had to carry on some 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.739
 compromises this manifested itself as 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.439
 body materials in the chamber 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.499
 and the absence of at least one separate 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.659
 speaker for music but phones can 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.869
 boast successful digital screens with 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:53.850
 high resolution 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.850
 a good set of multimedia
