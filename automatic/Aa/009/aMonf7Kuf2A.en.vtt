usually<00:00:10.110> when<00:00:10.290> doing<00:00:10.500> advanced<00:00:11.010> sure<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.429> be

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
usually when doing advanced sure to be

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.089 
usually when doing advanced sure to be
insulting<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.870> start<00:00:13.170> by<00:00:13.320> making<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.799> side

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
insulting you start by making a side

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.380 
insulting you start by making a side
when<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.059> soft<00:00:15.360> side<00:00:15.719> like<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:17.090> you<00:00:18.090> just

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
when it's a soft side like this you just

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.500 
when it's a soft side like this you just
do<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> regular<00:00:19.050> CLL<00:00:19.619> algorithms<00:00:20.420> when<00:00:21.420> you

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
do the regular CLL algorithms when you

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.040 
do the regular CLL algorithms when you
get<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> side<00:00:22.050> commuted<00:00:23.420> adjacently<00:00:24.420> there's<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
get a side commuted adjacently there's a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.029 
get a side commuted adjacently there's a
separate<00:00:25.590> set<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.420> eg1<00:00:27.420> algorithms<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.830> solve

separate set of eg1 algorithms to solve

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.609 
separate set of eg1 algorithms to solve
the<00:00:29.880> cube<00:00:30.060> from<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.840> when<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.199> get<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the cube from there and when you get a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.430 
the cube from there and when you get a
diagonally<00:00:32.399> from<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.700> decide<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
diagonally from you decide like this you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.930 
diagonally from you decide like this you
can<00:00:34.770> learn<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> separate<00:00:35.460> set<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.640> algorithms

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
can learn a separate set of algorithms

can learn a separate set of algorithms
however<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:37.290> doesn't<00:00:37.680> happen<00:00:37.920> nearly<00:00:38.550> as

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
however this doesn't happen nearly as

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.560 
however this doesn't happen nearly as
often<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:40.440> getting<00:00:41.070> um<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.940> adjacent<00:00:42.450> lead

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
often as you getting um an adjacent lead

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
often as you getting um an adjacent lead
from<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> decide<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> soft<00:00:43.800> side<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.760> since

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
from you decide or a soft side so since

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330 
from you decide or a soft side so since
it's<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.329> uncommon<00:00:45.980> people<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.190> really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
it's so uncommon people don't really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
it's so uncommon people don't really
like<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.969> learn<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> whole<00:00:48.300> new<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:49.200> tea<00:00:49.320> tree

algorithms<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.510> something<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.660> only

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
algorithms just something there only

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
happens every one in ten Souls so that's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.160 
happens every one in ten Souls so that's
why<00:00:54.770> anti-sea<00:00:55.770> rolls<00:00:56.070> made<00:00:56.449> Andy<00:00:57.449> CLO<00:00:57.870> this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
why anti-sea rolls made Andy CLO this

why anti-sea rolls made Andy CLO this
way<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.059> CLL<00:01:00.719> algorithm<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:02.190> just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
way you do a CLL algorithm which just

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
way you do a CLL algorithm which just
effects<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:02.969> layer<00:01:03.239> um<00:01:04.010> instead<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.220> doing

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
effects this layer um instead of doing

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.920 
effects this layer um instead of doing
the<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.760> you'd<00:01:05.939> normally<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> case

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the one you'd normally do for the case

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.770 
the one you'd normally do for the case
you<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.070> different<00:01:08.670> algorithm<00:01:09.180> like

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you do a different algorithm like

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
you do a different algorithm like
instead<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.200> doing<00:01:10.560> y'all<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.670> solve

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
instead of doing y'all going to solve

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.770 
instead of doing y'all going to solve
this<00:01:12.090> I'll<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> different<00:01:13.380> algorithm<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
this I'll do a different algorithm and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
this I'll do a different algorithm and
this<00:01:15.780> different<00:01:16.200> algorithm<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:17.009> leave<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this different algorithm will leave the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
this different algorithm will leave the
last<00:01:18.780> layout<00:01:20.000> commuted<00:01:21.229> diagonally<00:01:22.229> then

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
last layout commuted diagonally then

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.030 
last layout commuted diagonally then
what<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.200> now<00:01:25.200> you've<00:01:25.560> got<00:01:25.710> true

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
what you can do is now you've got true

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.399 
what you can do is now you've got true
diagonally<00:01:27.000> community<00:01:27.659> layers<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.320> do

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
diagonally community layers you just do

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.310 
diagonally community layers you just do
after<00:01:28.890> after<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:29.520> author<00:01:29.900> which<00:01:30.900> doesn't

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
after after your author which doesn't

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.319 
after after your author which doesn't
take<00:01:31.439> long<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.799> here's<00:01:32.310> an<00:01:32.460> example<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.970> eg

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
take long at all here's an example of eg

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.620 
take long at all here's an example of eg
-<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.829> can<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.310> three<00:01:35.729> move<00:01:35.939> slide<00:01:36.270> easily

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
- I can see a three move slide easily

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.190 
- I can see a three move slide easily
but<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.200> can't<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.890> any<00:01:38.189> fast<00:01:39.000> layers<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
but I can't really see any fast layers I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.440 
but I can't really see any fast layers I
can<00:01:40.229> make<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> fastest<00:01:41.790> way<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.939> make<00:01:42.119> side

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
can make so the fastest way to make side

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.749 
can make so the fastest way to make side
is<00:01:42.689> Archer<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.380> prymaat<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.070> today<00:01:44.490> but

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
is Archer you prymaat here today but

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.200 
is Archer you prymaat here today but
diagonally<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.130> algorithm<00:01:47.490> usually

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
diagonally so for this algorithm usually

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.510 
diagonally so for this algorithm usually
I<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:49.250> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
I do that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.429 
I do that
CL<00:01:51.299> however<00:01:53.060> with<00:01:54.060> an<00:01:54.270> TCL<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
CL however with an TCL you do the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.230 
CL however with an TCL you do the
algorithm<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:56.610> result<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
algorithm there will result in the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.020 
algorithm there will result in the
opposite<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> sir<00:01:58.729> diagonally<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
opposite of that sir diagonally can you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
opposite of that sir diagonally can you
delay<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.540> instead<00:02:00.810> I'll<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.530> algorithm

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
delay so instead I'll do this algorithm

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
delay so instead I'll do this algorithm
and<00:02:03.079> then<00:02:04.079> you'd<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.159> diagonally<00:02:05.909> from

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and then you'd have this diagonally from

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059 
and then you'd have this diagonally from
your<00:02:06.329> layout<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.259> just<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.619> after<00:02:07.979> you

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
your layout and you just do after you

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.880 
your layout and you just do after you
after<00:02:08.250> your<00:02:08.520> officer<00:02:09.379> so<00:02:10.379> when<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:10.800> doing

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
after your officer so when you're doing

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.940 
after your officer so when you're doing
CLL<00:02:11.430> when<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.330> get<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.930> case<00:02:13.230> here

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
CLL when you get this case here

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.110 
CLL when you get this case here
you<00:02:14.280> normally<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.900> algorithm<00:02:17.120> when

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you normally do this algorithm when

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.509 
you normally do this algorithm when
you're<00:02:18.239> doing<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.660> ECL<00:02:19.050> instead<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.220> do<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
you're doing and ECL instead you do the

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.970 
you're doing and ECL instead you do the
offset<00:02:21.030> algorithm<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.690> which<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.140> this

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
offset algorithm for that which is this

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.220 
offset algorithm for that which is this
that<00:02:25.980> algorithm<00:02:26.610> would<00:02:27.300> solve<00:02:27.569> this<00:02:27.989> case

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that algorithm would solve this case

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:38.120 
that algorithm would solve this case
here<00:02:32.870> sir<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.500> anti<00:02:35.040> Clell<00:02:36.050> algorithm<00:02:37.130> for

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
here sir the anti Clell algorithm for

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.610 
here sir the anti Clell algorithm for
this<00:02:38.310> one<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.970> offset<00:02:39.330> algorithm<00:02:39.810> would<00:02:40.470> be

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
this one the offset algorithm would be

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.729 
this one the offset algorithm would be
the<00:02:40.739> first<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> showed<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.450> view

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.680 

so<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.890> mystery<00:02:47.130> algorithms<00:02:47.640> corresponds<00:02:48.420> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
so the mystery algorithms corresponds to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.360 
so the mystery algorithms corresponds to
each<00:02:48.900> other<00:02:49.110> when<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.739> do<00:02:49.950> one<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.220> those

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
each other when you do one of those

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.640 
each other when you do one of those
algorithms<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.299> right<00:02:51.480> case<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.440> will

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
algorithms on the right case it will

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.100 
algorithms on the right case it will
solve<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.160> when<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.090> do<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.329> other<00:02:54.360> algorithm

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
solve it when you do the other algorithm

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.680 
solve it when you do the other algorithm
on<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.380> case<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:56.340> will<00:02:56.430> leave<00:02:56.579> it<00:02:56.790> opposite

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
on that case it will leave it opposite

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.449 
on that case it will leave it opposite
like<00:02:57.989> this

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
like this

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.220 
like this
so<00:02:59.459> those<00:02:59.640> three<00:02:59.880> algorithms<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:01.019> a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
so those three algorithms are like a

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.979 
so those three algorithms are like a
pair<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.010> all<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.730> really<00:03:02.849> need<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.299> know<00:03:03.569> now<00:03:03.750> is

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
pair so all I really need to know now is

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.780 
pair so all I really need to know now is
which<00:03:04.290> algorithms<00:03:04.860> are<00:03:05.069> pairs<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.610> each

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
which algorithms are pairs with each

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.550 
which algorithms are pairs with each
other<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.780> that's<00:03:06.930> really<00:03:07.079> what<00:03:07.260> I'm<00:03:07.349> going<00:03:07.500> to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
other so that's really what I'm going to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.339 
other so that's really what I'm going to
be<00:03:07.620> showing<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.250> historical<00:03:13.640> this

this this case here is a bit different

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.469 

instead<00:05:20.550> of<00:05:20.669> doing<00:05:20.789> it<00:05:20.940> from<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.150> normal

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
instead of doing it from the normal

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.620 
instead of doing it from the normal
angle<00:05:21.599> you<00:05:21.870> would<00:05:22.050> here<00:05:22.320> with<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:24.030> same<00:05:24.300> and

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
angle you would here with the same and

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.630 
angle you would here with the same and
opposite<00:05:24.990> you<00:05:25.440> just<00:05:25.650> do<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.800> YouTube<00:05:26.219> so<00:05:26.490> it's

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
opposite you just do a YouTube so it's

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.969 
opposite you just do a YouTube so it's
opposite<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.479> same<00:05:27.719> that's<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.590> same<00:05:28.830> with

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
opposite and same that's the same with

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.459 
opposite and same that's the same with
this<00:05:29.460> algorithm<00:05:30.000> is<00:05:30.750> there<00:05:30.930> doing<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.320> way

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
this algorithm is there doing the way

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.070 
this algorithm is there doing the way
you'd<00:05:31.680> normally<00:05:31.890> do<00:05:32.219> it<00:05:32.280> from<00:05:32.550> which<00:05:33.539> is<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
you'd normally do it from which is the

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.219 
you'd normally do it from which is the
same<00:05:34.469> and<00:05:34.740> offset<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.550> just<00:05:35.820> do<00:05:35.940> a<00:05:35.969> YouTube<00:05:36.419> do

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
same and offset you just do a YouTube do

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.159 
same and offset you just do a YouTube do
it<00:05:37.320> officer<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:38.070> same<00:05:38.539> ok<00:05:39.539> so<00:05:39.630> that's<00:05:39.930> all<00:05:40.050> the
