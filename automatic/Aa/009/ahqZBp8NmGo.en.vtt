00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
I'm really liking the spice on this a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.370 
I'm really liking the spice on this a
lot<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:14.120> than<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> chili<00:02:14.750> lime

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
lot more than the chili lime

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.130 
lot more than the chili lime
however<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.490> chili<00:02:16.760> lime<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.330> feel<00:02:17.600> has<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
however the chili lime I feel has the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.550 
however the chili lime I feel has the
better<00:02:18.560> flavor<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:20.180> still<00:02:20.930> can't<00:02:21.230> forget

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
better flavor and I still can't forget

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.220 
better flavor and I still can't forget
that<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.790> tickling<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.510> tongue<00:02:23.750> that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
that that tickling of the tongue that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.280 
that that tickling of the tongue that
the<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.460> lime<00:02:25.700> really<00:02:25.970> produced<00:02:26.450> on

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
the that the lime really produced on

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.580 
the that the lime really produced on
that<00:02:27.650> ship<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.660> flavor-wise<00:02:29.660> I'd<00:02:30.260> go<00:02:30.440> with<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
that ship so flavor-wise I'd go with the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.150 
that ship so flavor-wise I'd go with the
chili<00:02:30.920> lime<00:02:31.330> heat<00:02:32.330> wise<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:33.110> certainly<00:02:33.920> goes

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
chili lime heat wise it certainly goes

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.260 
chili lime heat wise it certainly goes
to<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.580> fiery<00:02:35.540> habanero<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:37.550> being<00:02:37.880> said<00:02:38.209> I

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
to the fiery habanero that being said I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.360 
to the fiery habanero that being said I
probably<00:02:39.220> when<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.250> give<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.320> 4<00:02:42.320> out<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:43.070> 5

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
probably when I give this a 4 out of 5

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.690 
probably when I give this a 4 out of 5
instead<00:02:44.500> mainly<00:02:45.500> because<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:46.160> am<00:02:46.250> really<00:02:46.400> high

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
instead mainly because I am really high

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.140 
instead mainly because I am really high
up<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.090> flavor<00:02:47.390> aspect<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.970> feel

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
up on the flavor aspect and I just feel

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.140 
up on the flavor aspect and I just feel
the<00:02:50.270> chili<00:02:50.480> lime<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.900> more<00:02:51.140> memorable<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.650> me

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the chili lime is more memorable to me

the chili lime is more memorable to me
this<00:02:53.150> one<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.870> brings<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.620> back<00:02:54.830> end<00:02:55.100> heat<00:02:55.370> but

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
this one it brings the back end heat but

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.080 
this one it brings the back end heat but
it<00:02:56.180> really<00:02:56.330> doesn't<00:02:56.570> do<00:02:56.810> anything<00:02:57.230> more<00:02:58.090> but

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
it really doesn't do anything more but

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.410 
it really doesn't do anything more but
