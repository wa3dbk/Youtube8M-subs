00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.769
 Hello, guys, I'm coming back with this new one today. 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.800
 video and this new video is a hydration 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.690
 with sugar and what sugar is for 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.330
 hair sugar it is a very product 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.490
 emollient and it will serve every shine 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.619
 to the right hair this case you have 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.699
 that very thick hair that hair well 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.439
 hard 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.259
 Even though I do it, it's very cool. 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.239
 because the sugar itself will tune 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.320
 The right hair I recommend this 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.659
 gradation for people who have 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.579
 progression for people who made the 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.580
 discoloration for people who have 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.400
 dry virgin dry hair right 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.500
 finally actually yes i can not 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.450
 has no intention whatsoever for any type 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.610
 of hair you can use normal sugar 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.530
 or brown sugar, let's now 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.570
 ingredients is a way of preparing the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.520
 our education with sugar 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.180
 Good guys, let's make our hydration 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:02.100
 with sugar right I 'm here with the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.100
 white sugar hydration cream 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.430
 bepantol and a ball 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:21.280
 first let's get the sugar I 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.760
 I'll put about 15 grams of 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.760
 sugar 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:42.570
 now we will see with the hydration put 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:02:00.020
 a spoonful of soup and hydration now 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.180
 you choose or you used lipstick or 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.200
 light bulb reminding you to put 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.050
 very little because otherwise it will be very 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:17.350
 liquid to the right mix very little 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.350
 even if little 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.140
 now we just apply it on our hair 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.940
 Some people already applied hydration 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.950
 in all hair and now I'll wait 30 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.990
 minutes and then I'll come back to you for 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.230
 show the result of my hair 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.270
 it was okay just to wait 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.250
 So, guys, I'm coming back here with the 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.800
 result of our sugar hydration 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.200
 and sugar hydration is very good 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.770
 because she gives a kiss so instant in the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.700
 hair 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.700
 that's what I realized 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.950
 A tip I give when you go 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.370
 make this sugar hydration is that 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.480
 you are not right all of squid sugar 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.510
 when you are doing 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.480
 mixture of one from 30 to 40 percent 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.550
 sugar is a water-soluble substance 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.950
 that is in contact with water, it 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.140
 dissolves completely when the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.790
 We'll make a coffee is a groove to 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.590
 You have to reduce all the sugar in the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.600
 drink gets a taste of my gifts if the 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.470
 same thing you will do in hair 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.900
 from 30 to 40% squid there you will feel 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.480
 that the crystals have not yet been diluted 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.459
 no problem, pass it on the right hair 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.400
 completely and is much more interesting 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.530
 that this sugar reaction be included 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.300
 Happens in your hair, it's going to happen. 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.280
 much brighter to download much more 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.110
