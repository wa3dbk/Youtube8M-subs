00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.850
 hi to all this today 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:12.570
 bass fishing equipment e 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.240
 then let's start by talking about the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.150
 cane the boss for the boss always the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.890
 spinning canada by putting the spinning 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.130
 because there are nine pounds or so 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.800
 institutions there is a very good brand in my opinion 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.999
 non- Chinese muniamoci nesat has a lot though 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.979
 good 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:36.769
 so always spinning for the bass 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:39.359
 low pike then we move to the stairs that 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.179
 as it began with the imitation of 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:45.719
 a lobster this very useful in the 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:49.739
 environments condono yes because death 2 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.329
 vibrations then we start with we send 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.109
 I agree that I use this a lot first 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 very 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:03.980
 this because it seemed to me that it takes 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.980
 because this also produces vibrations e 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.880
 let's say the kisses are activated by 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.030
 evidence from very large priests then 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.200
 this is another of al quorum forma 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.120
 remember the one we say certainly not the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.210
 this serves not for fishing but for 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.680
 attract fish because it creates many 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.790
 vibrations look here is burgundy 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.560
 that makes the vibrations in short this is a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.180
 another of the quorum 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 these serve to add to the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.010
 correct that they talk about it later because later 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.530
 who take these faces are 92 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.010
 basic equipment this is the rubber 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.380
 which is used most of all because I talk to her 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.619
 very well but in my opinion 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.799
 he worked because it never happened to me 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.409
 to take with this ska this goes 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.560
 added as an accessory to correct as 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:12.599
 Nobody lives to 3 or 2 because because 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 the bass is good because it takes a lot 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.840
 great because hopeful peak not certain ed 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.819
 they had the tires then three or two 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.140
 let's go with the correct one and I still have it 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:31.140
 bed is usually the size or two 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.030
 look at 2 or 3 at 6 in the six of these 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.370
 they are very useful for discounting because they are 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.349
 pulled from the larger prey very 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.970
 so great has happened to me 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.510
 times to take does not reveal advice 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.540
 much seen also that sometimes vibrations 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:55.440
 because with two mirrors and reflecting 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.970
 draws you look is a measure is an is 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.420
 13 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:04.609
 so much as I need not I use 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:09.810
 that's when there is enough sun 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:13.250
 because you make reflections then I use this 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.069
 same reason because inside you feel 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.859
 inside there are the largest and therefore 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.810
 let's say it sinks more then I don't know these 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.989
 finally for fishing because afloat 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.019
 this always stays afloat for 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.150
 down a little small because the steps 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.430
 smaller ones are pulled by things from 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:38.329
 fish afloat 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:42.689
 you can see it from the headstock is very small 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.609
 now we are for the container the 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.260
 container in the kitchen will be completed 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.769
 exaggerated things 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.889
 I bought this that we did 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.989
 asks a lot of things I bought 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:04:00.719
 also that the spinner byte it 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.819
 always spinner bytes a lot because it's a lot 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:06.000
 big and low as I told you before 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.799
 they are attracted to larger hares 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.459
 this creates a lot of vibrations and moves 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.950
 so then imagine that fish that 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.049
 are in this case we have to sling the one 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:23.840
 hidden so perfect without giving in 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:27.419
 here it is very sharp, here it is 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.669
 entrusted lardi ion is perfect 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.810
 it cost me as a fishing shop in the 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 city where the 5 euros we say that how 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.770
 price we are 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:43.530
 another store is even 20 euros 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.360
 so I saved a lot then for 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.539
 as for the pike I usually do 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.099
 there is not always this that is very useful 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.470
 and always use this I love because it is light 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:59.130
 attracted by very large things with 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:03.240
 this with the quorum gel as lucio ai 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:07.880
 teeth I recommend you use the 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:12.780
 terminal that you think 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:17.550
 in this respect the terminal serves 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:21.300
 as lights to the teeth when biting the 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.770
 prey there is the possibility that the line does 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.169
 break 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.789
 in my case, however, why 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.680
 bat very often very often from mine 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.199
 but I bought it as a precaution 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.819
 because they could always happen with 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:42.090
 lucia mouth and off we say when 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:45.599
 boccolucci need to wait a few 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.029
 second and give the railway that after a while 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:55.189
 you have to make him tired and in the end I pulled 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:58.529
 on this I like my carp rod 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:00.629
 this floor president is very nice me 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:05.219
 it was given to me as a child 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:09.479
 it was my first rod and nothing 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:12.680
 amazed it's over the priest i like it 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.680
 write to the channel bye
