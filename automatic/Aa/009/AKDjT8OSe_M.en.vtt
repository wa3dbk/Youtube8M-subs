00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.230

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.640
 original I hope you have good and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.019
 that you will not blame me because 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.949
 I have a small problem two microphones 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.779
 ties 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.580
 but there are no worries we have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.260
 worries as we are going to settle all this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.420
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.170
 recipe of the venture mc so that's the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.910
 favorite sandwich of the dir trinity of 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.309
 three new sandwiches from these packs 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.960
 of water so here's the people vote Zion 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.370
 do you for people who do not follow 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.870
 not on my facebook 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.489
 go for a walk there is plenty of info 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.370
 nice and that's it and now we are 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.010
 found directly in the kitchen for the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.860
 recipe from mak renchen will take bread to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.559
 sesame burger an ined toast of 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.170
 barbecue sauce cheddar with steaks 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.579
 chopped bacon and onions I took 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 red onions because I find it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.750
 best 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.090
 the first step is to train 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.130
 well rounded steaks a little bigger than 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.670
 the size of your bread and make them 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 Grill 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.630
 and during that time you go 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.540
 to be able to test the pins and put 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.120
 Bacon also think of salt and pepper 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.460
 the meat 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.320
 so we see that the steaks have 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.780
 cooked then what's important is 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.910
 to pose the tontine is well in the middle 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.710
 steak on one of the steaks and 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.360
 let the cheese melt so you 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.690
 see that the loaves are being 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.150
 tested and that gray bacon 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.590
 quietly in his corner we 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.600
 found now for dressage 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.160
 so what you have to do is put some 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.860
 the sauce you see I put on the 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.990
 bread from below and on organic bread at mcdo 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.730
 he only puts on the bread from the top 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.720
 but we are generous so we 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.420
 pleasure, we spread the sauce well and 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.110
 we will place the steak with the cup 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.730
 thiney 2 cheddar on the bottom bread then 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.950
 simply we will hand over the 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.890
 second steaks by 2.6 story to have 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.710
 a good floor of meat there it's me 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.740
 was really good then 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.570
 you will sprinkle the onions on the 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.130
 duo bread with sauce so my agent 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.390
 in good quantity since the last 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.880
 once I went to eat 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.650
 mike rencheck at mcdo there were some 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.020
 not too much so I was a little disappointed 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.209
 and to finish a slice of bacon 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.130
 I took a round that I found that 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.400
 much simpler for dressage 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.440
 so here you close your burger and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.350
 there I can tell you you have a mac 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.100
 to meet who is just huge who weighs 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.980
 his weight 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.959
 so here we go for the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.940
 tasting 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.390
 so it smelled really very very 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.980
 good and then I took a fang 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.920
 frankly we have a good flavor of 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.890
 bacon onions was well present 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.200
 so here I make you small I hope 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.700
 that you have really enjoyed art 7-6 7/4 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.440
 can do it and then you can too 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.480
 share this video on the networks 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.730
 social for your expense 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.099
 within two to three days it will be over the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.599
 link is in the description then vote 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.220
 and then we find ourselves very 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.409
 soon for many others this 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.970
 alley cha cha or in small pieces 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.970
 so that's a good question 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.420
 os x
