00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
treating I think he's been cheated but
badly<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.790> meant<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.180> my<00:00:39.540> guess

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
badly this meant just my guess

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.310 
badly this meant just my guess
educational<00:00:40.559> guess<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> um<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:42.960> he's

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
educational guess so um I think he's

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
educational guess so um I think he's
been<00:00:43.500> treated<00:00:43.920> badly<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.579> why<00:00:44.789> he's<00:00:44.969> doing

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
been treated badly that's why he's doing

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
been treated badly that's why he's doing
it<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.079> doesn't<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:46.500> matter<00:00:46.770> right

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it but that doesn't really matter right

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.650 
it but that doesn't really matter right
now

sure<00:02:42.580> let's<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:43.240> say<00:02:43.330> eighty<00:02:43.540> nine<00:02:43.780> percent

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
sure let's just say eighty nine percent

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.190 
sure let's just say eighty nine percent
but<00:02:44.640> why<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.700> says<00:02:46.030> eighty<00:02:46.270> nine<00:02:46.510> percent<00:02:46.690> is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.830 
but why it says eighty nine percent is
that<00:02:47.260> because<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.890> version<00:02:50.890> these<00:02:51.730> days<00:02:52.060> are

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
that because this version these days are

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.410 
that because this version these days are
usually<00:02:53.410> very<00:02:53.890> neat<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.580> everything<00:02:55.030> but

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
usually very neat and everything but

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.490 
usually very neat and everything but
this<00:02:55.959> version<00:02:56.290> got<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> little<00:02:57.400> mixed<00:02:57.610> up<00:02:58.500> they

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
this version got a little mixed up they

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.030 
this version got a little mixed up they

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
got the version 64 accidentally this

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.550 
got the version 64 accidentally this
dated<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.610> by<00:03:03.820> accident<00:03:04.060> version<00:03:04.930> 64

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.720 
dated this by accident version 64
version<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.239> new<00:03:07.420> version<00:03:07.770> 83<00:03:08.770> now<00:03:09.520> they

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
version on the new version 83 now they

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.199 
version on the new version 83 now they
kind<00:03:10.330> of<00:03:10.390> mix<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.840> folder<00:03:11.320> together<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.520> so

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
kind of mix the folder together so so

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.160 
kind of mix the folder together so so
hacking<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:15.070> system<00:03:15.549> for<00:03:15.820> version<00:03:16.239> 64<00:03:17.080> is

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
hacking the the system for version 64 is

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.420 
hacking the the system for version 64 is
weaker<00:03:17.620> than<00:03:17.650> version<00:03:18.519> 83<00:03:19.360> so<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:21.220> really

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
weaker than version 83 so it's really

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.539 
weaker than version 83 so it's really
easy<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.820> get<00:03:22.170> since<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.680> more<00:03:24.070> hacks

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
easy to get since we have more hacks

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.160 
easy to get since we have more hacks
inside

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
inside

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.009 
inside
maplestory<00:03:26.769> it's<00:03:27.280> really<00:03:27.580> easy<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.910> hack<00:03:28.840> into

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
maplestory it's really easy to hack into

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.670 
maplestory it's really easy to hack into
system<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.739> it's<00:03:29.980> just<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:31.140> really<00:03:32.140> hard<00:03:32.470> to

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
system and it's just so really hard to

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.090 
system and it's just so really hard to
like<00:03:33.040> play<00:03:33.820> without<00:03:34.030> getting<00:03:34.450> banned<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:35.100> if

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
like play without getting banned so if

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.970 
like play without getting banned so if
he<00:03:36.310> seen<00:03:36.549> GM<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:37.840> like<00:03:38.019> walk<00:03:38.320> away<00:03:38.560> do<00:03:38.799> not

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
he seen GM just like walk away do not

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.160 
he seen GM just like walk away do not
talk<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.430> him<00:03:39.489> do<00:03:39.700> not<00:03:39.850> do<00:03:40.000> anything<00:03:40.269> just<00:03:40.630> walk

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
talk to him do not do anything just walk

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.850 
talk to him do not do anything just walk
away<00:03:41.320> because<00:03:41.739> he<00:03:42.220> might<00:03:42.400> be<00:03:42.610> up<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:43.420> fraud<00:03:44.140> and

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
away because he might be up a fraud and

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.520
