00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.080
 a beautiful good morning my 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.240
 I love to come with a good one 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.470
 message and indeed some have me 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.210
 written that the old apply 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.760
 method stops working for you 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.700
 Playstation 3 and since today there are 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.450
 a new version or one 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:33.670
 apply fix again and although there 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:37.040
 it in for version 3.5 and 4.2 143 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.750
 4.30 clock custom firmware is clear 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.120
 original firmware can be bad 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.830
 to get voted 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.310
 and there is a black screen fix for 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:50.150
 the people had the extreme however 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.040
 the pkg file for the black screen fix 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.620
 Only use if you really 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.090
 yes I knew the black screen 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.740

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.130

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.960
 files below the password is the 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.200
 Neo contrary 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.229

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.479
 just formatted with fat32 usb 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.380
 stick make the euro playstation 3 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.479
 supports insert pkg installer 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.590
 for the file he needs it can 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.569
 However, that in some people 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.719
 if you start the picture so pure 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.119
 so look for a little explanation away 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:32.869

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.459
 custom firmware 4.2 1 since start 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.719
 if you press on 3.55 since and 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.200
 square if you are on custom firmware 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.810
 Be 4.30 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.490
 so much I write but also 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.380
 the video so that you can do it again 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.170
 can read on it no loses 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.569

 3 I have to say it is one 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.770
 temporary solution but where this 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.300
 playstation 3 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.580
 he comes with the europe ace 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.320
 then patched between three is there 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.970
 there are still a lot of others here 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.710
 you should not worry if 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.470
 you will start to wait a bit 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.360
 that comes new patch and then you can 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.880
 go online again so do not panic 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.680
 push my dear people otherwise 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.200
