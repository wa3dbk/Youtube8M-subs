00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.180
 of the family this is a very video 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.970
 short and in fact not listed 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.820
 why 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.280
 it's a reflection that came to mind 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.720
 and I realized it was a failure 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.869
 huge, I did not mention it before 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.539
 most turners almost 100% 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.880
 of the turners we know this from a 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.220
 consciously or unconsciously but it is 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.450
 very important 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.829
 especially for those who start 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.530
 precisely in my channel I have given it for 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.360
 course without realizing it and it's one of 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.760
 the most important things that I can 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.570
 explain 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.489
 or advise a turner who starts 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.210
 our tools have a series 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.680
 of profiles not any of them 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.130
 Any tool that we catch see 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.990
 It has a good profile 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.460
 I know that in most of you, you know 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.410
 but the trick or like a powder I repeat the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.320
 The best advice I can give is not that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.570
 keep in mind that the tool 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.690
 have to have the profile supported in the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.240
 wood if the profile is not well supported 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.990
 complete what we will do will bite the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.990
 wood, you 'll see if I can do 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 imagine it 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.580
 that we have our piece of wood and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.910
 we have our 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.580
 I do not force it formed itself even though 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.370
 we use it in the bottom third such 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.659
 and as I've always said all that if 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.359
 we 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.840
 there you see the profile if we do not support the 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.490
 profile 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.909
 and we put it that way it will bite 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.850
 and it will nail the only way that no 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.080
 is embedded in the wood is that we support 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.680
 first the profile and this serves to 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.060
 all the tools that we use 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.420
 you will see for example the scraper is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.849
 when a scraper the bigger and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.640
 is used for a larger piece the 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.920
 profile is more in less pronounced is 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.970
 tell 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.970
 a fast 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.810
 with an angle like the ones I use from 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.330
 approximately 20 degrees 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.480
 is going to give you all the problems of 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.260
 world on a plate because the plate is 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.989
 practically flat and when we play 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.540
 our scraper we are going to get like this and 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.300
 There will be a gap between the profile and the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.510
 dish and we can not tilt up 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.900
 the shaving because the edge is going to nail 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.019
 so that's why 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.709
 the smaller the bowl that means 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.180
 have more angles we need to change the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.819
 scraper angle that's why we have 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.340
 different this works for the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.129
 Scrapers for chisels for 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.950
 gouges absolutely for all 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.709
 tools that we use and as I say 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.079
 it's something that we take for granted all but 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.420
 that companies usually 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.439
 despair because a gouge does not 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.989
 works 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.450
 I have continuous bite in the wood 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.129
 how do I solve it? I do not know how to work with 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.060
 an oblique gouge because I always 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:26.209
 bite the trick is basically there 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.319
 first always always always to support 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:34.220
 the profile and then rotate the tool 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.810
 until the edge touches but touches the edge 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.409
 while the profile is supported by the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.530
 wood that way does not bite is worth it 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.760
 I know that as I say obviously the 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.880
 calves that have experience this what 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.550
 you know 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.040
 same as me but look I have several 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.480
 months downloading the videos and there was no 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.690
 he realized that he had not 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.580
 explained and that is precisely speaking 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.680
 with a friend tells me miguel is that the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.300
 canyon rain desperate I can not 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.420
 with her I do nothing but bite 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.270
 continuously and when I stop to think about it 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.920
 explain to God line that I do not know 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.500
 explained nobody good because there you have the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.930
 application this is a one tip that you 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.140
 I give in the moment I understand this 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.750
 You will see how to reduce the hooks in 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.850
 90% of course always go all 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.370
 we hook from time to time but by 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.430
 other reasons sometimes the wood has 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.610
 a very open goal refines in a thousand 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.950
 reasons but go to reduce 90 by 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.860
 cent of those on the court simply 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.230
 following that rule especially those that 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.910
 you start do not hurry always with 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.890
 the whole tool first support the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.449
 profile and turns it and the tool up 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.490
 that the edge touches 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.289
 on the edge and the profile is supported 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.300
 wood that way you will not have more 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.729
 bites I hope this advice 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.979
 really be useful to you and I think so 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.089
 heart that is very necessary that what 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.610
 keep in mind 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:58.889
 come family anyway I do not interrupt 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.599
 in the weekly video that is I'm 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.089
 pending to upload the video of the 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.819
 homemade tool that is made and os 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:09.499
 I 'm going to upload it probably on Monday or 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.499
 on Tuesday come family see you later
