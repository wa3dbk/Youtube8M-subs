00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
I England came out with the right

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.840 
I England came out with the right
intensity<00:02:51.630> France<00:02:52.170> didn't<00:02:52.709> match<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:53.100> but

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
intensity France didn't match that but

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.460 
intensity France didn't match that but
unfortunately<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:55.049> know<00:02:55.139> we<00:02:55.260> couldn't

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
unfortunately you know we couldn't

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.800 
unfortunately you know we couldn't
finish<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:55.859> some<00:02:56.069> chances<00:02:56.519> we<00:02:56.639> creating<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
finish up some chances we creating the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.170 
finish up some chances we creating the
pressure<00:02:58.079> our<00:02:59.069> pressure<00:02:59.340> defense<00:02:59.730> turned

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
pressure our pressure defense turned

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
pressure our pressure defense turned
over<00:03:00.359> quite<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> bit<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.900> ball<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.530> think<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
over quite a bit of ball and I think the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.379 
over quite a bit of ball and I think the
balance<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.459> whether<00:03:02.639> they<00:03:02.760> kicked<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.120> back

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
balance of whether they kicked that back

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.000 
balance of whether they kicked that back
you<00:03:03.780> know

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
you know

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.800 
you know
they're<00:03:04.519> guys<00:03:04.700> up<00:03:05.000> after<00:03:05.330> turning<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.659> ball

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
they're guys up after turning a ball

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.960 
they're guys up after turning a ball
over<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.439> when<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.830> actually<00:03:06.980> counter

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
over and when it to actually counter

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.160 
over and when it to actually counter
pressure<00:03:08.120> with<00:03:08.390> pressure<00:03:08.629> and<00:03:08.840> run<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.019> back

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
pressure with pressure and run it back

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.289 
pressure with pressure and run it back
of<00:03:09.319> them<00:03:09.439> I<00:03:09.620> think<00:03:10.129> probably<00:03:10.459> earned<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.180> little

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
of them I think probably earned a little

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.940 
of them I think probably earned a little
bit<00:03:11.480> too<00:03:11.689> much<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.200> kick<00:03:12.349> inside<00:03:12.530> and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
bit too much on the kick inside and

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.619 
bit too much on the kick inside and
that's<00:03:13.010> why<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.790> know<00:03:13.819> we<00:03:14.000> couldn't<00:03:14.239> tied<00:03:14.420> his

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
that's why you know we couldn't tied his

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.140 
that's why you know we couldn't tied his
french<00:03:14.870> seidel<00:03:15.290> who<00:03:16.099> for<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.459> stood<00:03:16.760> outs<00:03:16.939> and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
french seidel who for you stood outs and
