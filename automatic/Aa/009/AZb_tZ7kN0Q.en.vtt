you to the core against corrosion what

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.110 
you to the core against corrosion what
you<00:00:32.379> see<00:00:32.619> here<00:00:32.859> is<00:00:32.920> we've<00:00:33.190> removed<00:00:33.609> the<00:00:33.789> paint

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
you see here is we've removed the paint

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.180 
you see here is we've removed the paint
and<00:00:34.329> opened<00:00:34.780> up<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.929> drive<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:35.679> you<00:00:35.710> can<00:00:35.949> see

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
and opened up the drive so you can see

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.430
