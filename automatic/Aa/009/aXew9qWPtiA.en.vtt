00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
how you feeling hearts still going yeah

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.960 
how you feeling hearts still going yeah
have<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.260> sit<00:00:33.440> back<00:00:33.470> down<00:00:33.800> on<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.070> leg<00:00:34.940> press

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
have to sit back down on the leg press

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.770 
have to sit back down on the leg press
for<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.480> second<00:00:35.810> ago<00:00:36.140> good<00:00:36.410> nauseous<00:00:37.780> coming

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
for a second ago good nauseous coming

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.460 
for a second ago good nauseous coming
around<00:00:40.360> amazing<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.900> aerobic<00:00:43.690> effect<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:44.840> has

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
around amazing the aerobic effect it has

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.910 
around amazing the aerobic effect it has
just<00:00:47.010> six<00:00:47.250> minutes<00:00:47.490> of<00:00:47.790> blood<00:00:48.300> yeah<00:00:49.610> it's<00:00:50.610> good

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
just six minutes of blood yeah it's good

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.569 
just six minutes of blood yeah it's good
well<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.760> idea<00:00:52.850> was<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.289> that<00:00:54.289> case<00:00:55.280> people

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
well the idea was to that case people

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.099 
well the idea was to that case people
watching<00:00:56.420> or<00:00:56.510> wondering<00:00:56.750> what<00:00:56.839> it<00:00:56.899> was<00:00:56.989> about

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
watching or wondering what it was about

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.009 
watching or wondering what it was about
we<00:00:57.469> wanted<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.890> just<00:00:58.640> try<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.059> sort<00:00:59.659> of<00:00:59.750> do<00:00:59.870> an

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
we wanted to just try and sort of do an

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.290 
we wanted to just try and sort of do an
extended<00:01:00.500> time<00:01:00.649> under<00:01:00.920> load<00:01:01.129> to<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.059> point

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
extended time under load to the point

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.479 
extended time under load to the point
where<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.600> was<00:01:02.719> one<00:01:02.930> rep<00:01:03.170> weights<00:01:04.100> had<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.369> be

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
where it was one rep weights had to be

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.889 
where it was one rep weights had to be
light<00:01:04.670> enough<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:04.970> he<00:01:05.570> could<00:01:05.689> isolate

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
light enough that he could isolate

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.270 
light enough that he could isolate
without<00:01:06.470> trying<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.740> bring<00:01:06.920> in<00:01:07.040> too<00:01:07.189> many

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
without trying to bring in too many

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.999 
without trying to bring in too many
ancillary<00:01:07.850> muscle<00:01:08.180> groups<00:01:08.500> but<00:01:09.500> heavy<00:01:09.770> enough

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
ancillary muscle groups but heavy enough

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.760 
ancillary muscle groups but heavy enough
to<00:01:10.190> be<00:01:10.310> meaningful<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.539> he<00:01:11.930> would<00:01:12.140> cycle

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
to be meaningful so that he would cycle

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.950 
to be meaningful so that he would cycle
through<00:01:13.220> do<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.759> sequential<00:01:14.180> recruitment<00:01:14.780> of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
through do a sequential recruitment of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.580 
through do a sequential recruitment of
fibers<00:01:15.409> motor<00:01:15.740> units<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:17.289> approximately<00:01:18.289> 60

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
fibers motor units in approximately 60

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.010 
fibers motor units in approximately 60
to<00:01:18.680> 90<00:01:18.920> seconds<00:01:19.399> and<00:01:19.549> therefore<00:01:20.450> tap<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.840> mode

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
to 90 seconds and therefore tap the mode

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.609 
to 90 seconds and therefore tap the mode
and<00:01:22.240> that's<00:01:23.240> what<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:23.570> did<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:25.810> we've<00:01:26.810> done<00:01:27.500> all

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
and that's what we did so we've done all

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.290 
and that's what we did so we've done all
sorts<00:01:27.800> of<00:01:27.950> protocols<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:28.850> Blair<00:01:29.060> here

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
sorts of protocols and so is Blair here

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.550 
sorts of protocols and so is Blair here
but<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:29.509> just<00:01:29.569> wanted<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.840> try<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:30.080> one<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.470> a

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
but we just wanted to try this one it a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.590 
but we just wanted to try this one it a
just<00:01:30.710> do<00:01:30.799> a<00:01:30.830> one<00:01:31.069> rep<00:01:31.280> workout<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:32.179> one<00:01:32.390> rep

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
just do a one rep workout or one rep

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.309 
just do a one rep workout or one rep
exercise<00:01:33.110> three<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.799> them<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:35.049> just<00:01:36.049> keep<00:01:36.229> the

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
exercise three of them and just keep the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.779 
exercise three of them and just keep the
muscles<00:01:36.530> under<00:01:36.890> load<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.220> whole<00:01:37.369> time<00:01:37.580> an

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
muscles under load the whole time an

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.690 
muscles under load the whole time an
inroad<00:01:38.119> is<00:01:38.270> deeply<00:01:39.009> as<00:01:40.009> we<00:01:40.250> could<00:01:40.429> in<00:01:40.459> that

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
inroad is deeply as we could in that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.580 
inroad is deeply as we could in that
time<00:01:40.940> frame<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.600> what<00:01:42.200> ended<00:01:42.409> up<00:01:42.530> happening

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
time frame so what ended up happening

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.550 
time frame so what ended up happening
was<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.069> weight<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:43.549> would<00:01:44.060> be<00:01:44.409> normally<00:01:45.409> way

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
was a weight that would be normally way

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.059 
was a weight that would be normally way
too<00:01:45.619> late<00:01:45.970> for<00:01:46.970> Blair<00:01:47.179> who<00:01:47.479> has<00:01:47.740> pretty<00:01:48.740> strong

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
too late for Blair who has pretty strong

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.370 
too late for Blair who has pretty strong
legs<00:01:50.530> which<00:01:51.530> today<00:01:51.860> was<00:01:52.069> 120<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.380> going

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
legs which today was 120 and going

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.779 
legs which today was 120 and going
through<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.619> cam<00:01:54.920> depending<00:01:55.459> on<00:01:55.580> which

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789

sequential recruitment till you tap at

the fibers and have the global metabolic
conditioning<00:02:14.239> effect<00:02:14.570> which<00:02:15.220> we're<00:02:16.220> now

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
conditioning effect which we're now

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.039

several<00:02:16.670> minutes<00:02:16.970> after<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:17.390> workout<00:02:17.690> blares

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
several minutes after the workout blares

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.620 
several minutes after the workout blares
still<00:02:18.320> feeling<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:20.030> starting<00:02:20.359> to<00:02:20.420> slow

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
still feeling it just starting to slow

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.270 
still feeling it just starting to slow
down<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:21.140> it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
down is it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.850 
down is it
just<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:23.900> what<00:02:24.080> later<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:27.230> we<00:02:27.620> know<00:02:27.740> what

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
just know what later so we know what

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.230 
just know what later so we know what
this<00:02:27.950> means<00:02:28.130> I'll<00:02:28.760> hate<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.000> know<00:02:29.450> oh<00:02:34.240> he's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
this means I'll hate you know oh he's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.510 
this means I'll hate you know oh he's
walking<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.840> front<00:02:36.020> down<00:02:36.340> no<00:02:37.340> you

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
walking up to the front down no you

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.600 
walking up to the front down no you
right<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.230> like<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.350> pica<00:02:39.709> pica<00:02:40.250> health

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610
