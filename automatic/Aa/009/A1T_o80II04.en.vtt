 From the hand of tecmo koei comes to us tubs 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.629
 sings the same rigor where 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.330
 we control super robots through 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.680
 classic scenes from the grand-am series in 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.599
 our analysis we tell you 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.990
 in detail all the news 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.990
 included 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.750
 his story is set in the era 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.910
 called the universal century where 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.250
 giant robots known as mobile 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.769
 surfing are used to wage wars for 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.019
 earth sea air and space here 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.909
 we will relive the exciting battles and 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.979
 the animation sequences with the greatest 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.570
 number of missions never provided in the 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.519
 grand-am series among which 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.549
 find in mobile suit gundam or 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.979

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:02.769
 contract as public uganda valls 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.729
 fashions furrow dancing or for the south they win 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.729
 it is destroyed 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.740
 playable we are before a title of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.540
 museum style or like in the rest 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.700
 of the saga dynasty warriors where 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.680
 we have massive fights over the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 series and the movies of the walk with the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 largest cast of southern mobile phone ever seen in 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.090
 the franchise is now sometimes the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.710
 number of enemies displayed on the screen 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.240
 It is so big that we will lose sight 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.240
 even our character 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.820
 the controls are very simple taking 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.010
 a button for body attacks to 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.690
 body with different weapons another for 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.940
 the long distance that can be 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.950
 recharge to cause greater damage and the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.140
 of the known definitive attacks 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.570
 as sb tags that cause big 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.400
 destruction in the enemy ranks and vary 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.640
 according to the mobile suit that we have 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.740
 chosen we can also move to 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.450
 higher speed and even lift a little 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.340
 the flight to kill the enemies 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.350
 that are found through the air spending 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.930
 a bar that has to recover a little 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.670
 to little the handling is very simple 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.830
 dynamic and agile making us 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.830
 quickly get used to its mechanics 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.560
 one of the novelties is the so-called bar 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.300
 system that increases the characteristics 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.380
 from our mob south by time 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.569
 limited 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.700
 using this mode we can launch a 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.830
 esp a is combined if we have some 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.270
 available companion in what gives you a 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.270
 greater strategic burden 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.930
 also for the first time in the series it 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.269
 allows us to control the giants 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.040
 mobile armor units that stand out 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.140
 over opponents and offer a 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.959
 absolute destruction of the enemy whose 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.030
 weapons only if we face 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.920
 they have to destroy little by little 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.840
 the parts that make it up making 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.190
 the battles against them are the most 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.190
 complicated and durable 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.590
 Our main goal is to go 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.300
 ensuring eliminating all areas 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.610
 minimums that are in it 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.470
 having a certain strategic touch if not 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.150
 we want to lose them or comply with 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.150
 orders given to us by radios 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.340
 in the official mode is where 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.620
 develops the main story 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.780
 being able to improve our wick to measure 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.150
 we move forward updating your armament 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.010
 and the mobile itself just increasing like this 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.020
 The scope of our attacks are 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.630
 improving its defense among many others 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.489
 characteristics for this we have to 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.050
 combine different planes that we will go 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.290
 getting in the course of the 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.290
 history 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.660
 and the pilots will also increase their 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.370
 level which allows us to earn points of 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.280
 skill that we can exchange for 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.470
 improve different aspects here we can 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.470
 equalize up to a total of 6 improvements 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.060
 we will also unlock new pilots and 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.430
 mobile surfing of which there are more than 120 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.110
 available for the mode and ultimate that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.030
 We can manage to use as 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.830
 companions to help us with a 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.720
 series of missions and stories created 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.650
 exclusively for the game with 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.650
 different objectives 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.490
 includes a cooperative multiplayer mode 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.440
 both local the split screen as 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.210
 online for up to 2 users 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.490
 choose between favorite mobile shows 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.810
 to complete the different missions 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.810
 of the ultimate mode 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.650
 the dialogues are represented with 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.480
 little animated illustrations of the 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.040
 characters adding some sequences 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.920
 of gene that give you something of 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.390
 spectacularity to the scenes by 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.430
 misfortune and as usual 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.380
 in this type of titles not being 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.120
 completely in English what makes 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.540
 many miss much of the 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.540
 history 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.510
 how can you not 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.220
 classically it moves away from the style of 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.500
 site and seen the last deliveries of the 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.750
 room offering something more realistic and with 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.629
 a less saturated color palette without 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.370
 get to convince us these changes the 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.500
 designs of the mobile shoes of their 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.569
 animations are very accomplished while 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.970
 that the scenarios, although broad, continue 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.949
 being empty and not very detailed as in 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.159
 other installments of the saga besides 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:32.080
 have an opinion in the distance this allows 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:34.240
 In turn, be fairly fluid with 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.379
 some small point slowdown that 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.379
 does not hinder the gameplay 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.409
 its sound section comes with the 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.449
 original voices in Japanese of the 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.399
 protagonists what seems to us a great 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.649
 point in favor although their melodies are 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:57.429
 they become quite repetitive with the step 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.429
 of the lessons 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.470
 in conclusion dynasty warriors great dan 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.509
 rhythm you have a very funny title and 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.190
 with a very simple game mechanic that 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.229
 adapts to all types of players 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.110
 leaving the artificial intelligence of 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:19.090
 the enemies much to be desired the great 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.860
 amount of mobile suit and pilots to 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.600
 unlock make the duration of the 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.009
 game gets longer as well as trying 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.319
 improve each one of these 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:29.270
 its cooperative mode both locally and 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:31.490
 online makes it very fun to the 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.219
 time to fight the challenging tests 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.349
 of the way and ultimate its graphic section 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:38.539
 it is quite improvable in many aspects 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:40.369
 although at least it shows a lot of fluidity 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.409
 so that its gameplay does not look 

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:45.199
 finished and a huge amount of 

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:46.849
 enemies on screen in the sound 

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:48.740
 we found simple melodies but that 

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.899
 they fulfill their purpose and the voices 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.180
 originals in Japanese that enjoy a 

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:54.710
 great quality a title that we recommend 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.050
 to all the followers of the saga 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.909
 dynasty warriors and fans of 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.099
 Candame offering a lot of action and 

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:03.610
 customization without the need to eat 

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.610
 the head
