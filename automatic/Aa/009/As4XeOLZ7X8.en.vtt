program of the control box this is the

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.419 
program of the control box this is the
main<00:00:06.390> dial<00:00:06.629> which<00:00:07.049> adjusts<00:00:07.589> what<00:00:07.770> function<00:00:08.280> we

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
main dial which adjusts what function we

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.910 
main dial which adjusts what function we
want<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.700> change<00:00:08.970> then<00:00:09.599> over<00:00:09.840> here<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.679> up

want to change then over here this is up
down<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.910> advanced<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:14.030> first<00:00:15.030> thing<00:00:15.150> we're

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
down and advanced so first thing we're

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.250 
down and advanced so first thing we're
going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.660> we're<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> set<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
going to do is we're going to set the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.950 
going to do is we're going to set the

current date and whatever is flashing we

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.349 
current date and whatever is flashing we
can<00:00:19.170> change<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.100> right<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.699> February

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
then we're now gonna go to the different

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.069 
then we're now gonna go to the different
runtimes<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.579> box<00:01:35.850> goes<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.360> 13<00:01:36.750> stations

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
runtimes this box goes up to 13 stations

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.890 
runtimes this box goes up to 13 stations
so<00:01:37.950> we're<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> turn<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.119> undo

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so we're going to turn it to one or undo

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
so we're going to turn it to one or undo
10<00:01:40.229> minutes<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> front<00:01:41.310> beds

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
10 minutes because it's the front beds

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.389 
10 minutes because it's the front beds
now<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.479> gonna<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> zone<00:01:43.020> 2<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:44.250> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
now we're gonna go to zone 2 and this is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.670 
now we're gonna go to zone 2 and this is
the<00:01:44.549> grass<00:01:44.820> we're<00:01:45.630> gonna<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.869> 20<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> then

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the grass we're gonna do 20 and then

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
the grass we're gonna do 20 and then
when<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.890> hit<00:01:46.979> summer<00:01:47.250> we'll<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.880> 30

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
when we hit summer we'll do like 30

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.990 
when we hit summer we'll do like 30
sometimes<00:01:48.689> 40<00:01:48.930> minutes<00:01:49.729> we're<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> go

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
sometimes 40 minutes we're going to go

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.789 
sometimes 40 minutes we're going to go
all<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.540> different<00:01:51.840> zones<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.470> program

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
all the different zones and program

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.399 
all the different zones and program
those<00:01:53.149> there's<00:01:54.149> no<00:01:54.390> Save<00:01:54.720> button<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.290> when

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
those there's no Save button so when

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.539 
those there's no Save button so when
you're<00:01:55.530> finished<00:01:55.649> programming<00:01:56.280> something

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
you're finished programming something

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.289 
you're finished programming something
you<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.850> move<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> next<00:01:57.600> zone<00:01:59.180> and<00:02:00.180> we're

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you just move to the next zone and we're

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.959 
you just move to the next zone and we're
done<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.259> important<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.799> back<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.280> auto

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
done it's important to go back to auto

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.590 
done it's important to go back to auto
and<00:02:03.950> also<00:02:04.950> another<00:02:05.670> important<00:02:06.149> feature<00:02:06.240> is

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and also another important feature is

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.160 
and also another important feature is
let's<00:02:07.049> say<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:08.039> had<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.910> red<00:02:09.750> alarm

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
let's say that you had a red alarm

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.050 
let's say that you had a red alarm
button<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.619> there<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.039> means<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.670> your<00:02:11.790> rain

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
button on there it means that your rain
