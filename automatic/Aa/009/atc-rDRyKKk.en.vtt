00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.950
 Marketplace 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.499
 but it is the football fields of 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.909
 college and university and cynthia 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:23.619
 previously most have a footprint 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.509
 very strong for sports 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.420
 So there's always something kind of 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.520
 well developed sports so I go 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.090
 show which takes place for the practice of 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 sam 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.069
 swimming swimming pool cademia and this can 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.229
 take these other sports as well 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.119
 There are still blocks to walk to 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.599
 This is the sports center here. 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.489
 college and am showing to people 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.250
 you come in there just that we should not 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:53.920
 there at simba but there is a bus stop 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.770
 here near the college of buildings 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.399
 So main and I have I had a 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.099
 luck of the hell the department that 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.520
 I need to go right here at the entrance then 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:08.679
 not using needle sharp preguicite verse 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.560
 thousand and here is the sports center of 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.900
 college show a little bit for you 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.060
 for you to use some areas the gym 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.069
 I think the gym you have to pay 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.300
 a box but pays a very little fee 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:30.010
 the whole plan and that does not bring 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:34.269
 pool only 220 fake but I think to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:40.830
 people - why are we international? 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:43.269
 arriving only during the first year 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.980
 you can join this site too 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.980
 which is sports 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:57.370
 She has a hair straightening cane and skin 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:03:04.750
 is out there here running track with 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:06.489
 barriers have things in the middle and 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.269
 then there also has to Fairy with 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:15.519
 frames and then went there and there but for 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.000
 that in this direction that I am and is 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.220
 correct or touch here is a point are the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.720
 bus stops and then each company has 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220
 a bus stop and if that I think 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.280
 is the school's sex 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.560
 there that is the one of connect and this 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.230
 here on this side is to give strength and is strong 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.260
 the company I use because it has more 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.290
 not only just faculty routes too 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.620
 Send it to home 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.829
 and that is where the legal faculty of 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.730
 Subaru college is that it is all in the 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.209
 second floor 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.069
 like you do not have many buildings 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.280
 lots of things downstairs you already 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.319
 comes already rises over each and most 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.629
 The main thing is on the second floor 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.439
 begins to be turned up the stairs 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:06.040
 We have the china had here you have 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:13.950
 some restaurant to eat and then you 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.950
 You may have some support for some 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.110
 some thing I think the poor man is 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.530
 closed 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.660
 the college library and they are 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.300
 five stories already and down there is only one 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.360
 area that is meant to be all of a group if you 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.130
 a newspaper want something that goes beyond the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.020
 organization of college buildings does not 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.190
 depending on the library as if it were 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.440
 zero point 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.270
 If you take it and you have this side of 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.460
 here when we arrived at the point of the glasses 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.610
 People arrived at the bus stop called 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.320
 east and then this side of here is west 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.110
 buildings that are on the side of the 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.539
 library are the odd and 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.260
 side of the other side would be the 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.560
 parts 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.229
 But it's all very beautiful, very easy on 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.539
 theory is that there are some buildings that are 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:15.159
 I do not know what's going on there. 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.669
 look in the map yet we have to 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:22.030
 ask someone brought it as it arrives 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.680
 here is college lake and half of the 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.010
 colleges here in england where 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.990
 has one side or natural or artificial 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:34.650
 and artificial are more common 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.539
 then that lake and an artificial lake 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.530
 and although the university of guelph has 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:44.080
 It has been built recently to 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.539
 5,60 and a few thousand nine hundred and 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.860
 Sixty-five she still has a lake 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.189
 artificial 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.009
 and there are the buildings around the lake 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:56.289
 they are also called the south and the 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.900
 side of the library has the buildings 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.599
 also called the north and there only 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.030
 Even though it gets confused, it's not so easy. 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:08.530
 around the lake there are some 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.629
 paths and musk lead you to shortcuts that 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.659
 people have been struggling harder 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:19.259
 close about strolling around and 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:19.259
 There are paths for you, narchi. 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.349
 so that's what you liked 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:38.169
 of you have enjoyed levels such 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:41.500
 You liked it because I liked helping me. 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:43.779
 much in the disclosure then who has a 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.759
 video link if you are not yet 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.419
 written here on the channel sign up here 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.759
 down 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.020
 and how did you find it if you had 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.870
 any doubt that I'm going to record that 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.830
 video then this is a kiss until the 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.830
 next video tea
