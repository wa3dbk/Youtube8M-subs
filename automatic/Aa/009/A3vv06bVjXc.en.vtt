00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is of course the wind mobile basement so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
is of course the wind mobile basement so
don't<00:00:54.329> worry<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.839> have<00:00:55.019> a<00:00:55.050> different<00:00:55.530> one

don't worry if you have a different one
right<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:57.569> of<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:58.050> wind

right there it's just because of my wind
mobile<00:00:58.559> basement<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:58.979> different<00:00:59.280> from

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
mobile basement is different from

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
mobile basement is different from
t-mobile<00:00:59.729> it<00:01:00.390> also<00:01:00.539> comes<00:01:00.839> with<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> normal

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469

which helps them get the air logs etc so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
which helps them get the air logs etc so
it<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.260> help<00:01:07.440> them<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.950> improve<00:01:08.310> upon<00:01:09.090> their

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you do get the performance options where

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
you do get the performance options where

control by sliding across the status bar
I<00:02:38.180> don't<00:02:38.360> really<00:02:38.510> use<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.020> much<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.350> just

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
I don't really use it that much I just

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.470 
I don't really use it that much I just
have<00:02:39.740> 100<00:02:40.370> percent<00:02:40.430> brightness<00:02:40.760> at<00:02:41.000> all<00:02:41.210> times

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
have 100 percent brightness at all times

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270 
have 100 percent brightness at all times
so<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.170> just<00:02:42.350> don't<00:02:42.590> bother<00:02:42.740> with<00:02:43.070> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
so I just don't bother with the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.150 
so I just don't bother with the
brightness<00:02:43.580> control<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.870> also<00:02:45.050> have<00:02:45.410> options

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
brightness control we also have options

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.760 
brightness control we also have options
to<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.760> course<00:02:47.060> change<00:02:47.690> wallpapers<00:02:48.230> which<00:02:48.470> is

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
to of course change wallpapers which is

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.190 
to of course change wallpapers which is
the<00:02:49.010> normal<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.790> every<00:02:50.060> single<00:02:50.420> roam<00:02:50.990> out

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
the normal for every single roam out

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.800 
the normal for every single roam out
there<00:02:51.440> next<00:02:52.370> we<00:02:52.580> have<00:02:52.760> notification<00:02:53.450> widgets

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
there next we have notification widgets

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.480 
there next we have notification widgets
so<00:02:54.350> right<00:02:54.590> there<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.010> slightly<00:02:55.310> different

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
so right there it's a slightly different

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.080 
so right there it's a slightly different
look<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.510> feel<00:02:57.460> instead<00:02:58.460> of<00:02:58.580> having<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.880> small

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090
