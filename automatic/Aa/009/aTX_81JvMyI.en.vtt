00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
for this reason not just the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.710 
for this reason not just the
championships<00:03:30.000> because<00:03:30.270> other<00:03:30.480> teams

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
championships because other teams

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
for three or four year period he was the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.949 
for three or four year period he was the
best<00:03:35.580> offensive<00:03:36.000> player<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.480> world<00:03:36.660> and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.010 
the best defensive player in the world
and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.120> don't<00:03:39.270> think<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.510> could<00:03:39.660> ever<00:03:39.720> say

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
and I don't think you could ever say

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.559 
and I don't think you could ever say
that<00:03:40.050> about<00:03:40.319> another<00:03:40.650> player<00:03:41.250> yet<00:03:41.640> well<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
that about another player yet well the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.990 
that about another player yet well the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
Kings could use that type of presence

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.309 
Kings could use that type of presence
here<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.330> next<00:03:45.450> twenty-four<00:03:45.930> minutes<00:03:46.140> to
