earnest<00:02:42.069> joy<00:02:42.280> or<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.579> bounce

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
earnest joy or the bounce

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.000 
earnest joy or the bounce
that's<00:02:43.389> so<00:02:43.720> stable<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.420> we<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.660> see<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.920> as

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
that's so stable so we can see so as

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.830 
that's so stable so we can see so as
we've<00:02:48.130> been<00:02:48.250> here<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> beyblade<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:49.180> spinning

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
we've been here the beyblade is spinning

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.370 
we've been here the beyblade is spinning
but<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.109> rotation<00:02:50.319> Pal<00:02:51.160> speed<00:02:51.959> not<00:02:52.959> that<00:02:53.169> good

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
but the rotation Pal speed not that good

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.590 
but the rotation Pal speed not that good
so<00:02:54.150> just

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
so just

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.690 
so just
second<00:02:56.100> okay<00:02:57.100> there<00:02:57.610> we<00:02:57.700> go<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.280> now<00:03:00.310> we'll<00:03:00.610> get

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
second okay there we go so now we'll get

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.180 
second okay there we go so now we'll get
the<00:03:00.760> original<00:03:01.060> grabbing<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.990> Perseus<00:03:02.860> in

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
the original grabbing a Perseus in

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.160 
the original grabbing a Perseus in
counter<00:03:04.120> mode<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.390> can<00:03:04.660> see<00:03:04.810> right<00:03:04.960> here

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
counter mode as you can see right here

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:15.810 
counter mode as you can see right here
so<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:08.380> watch<00:03:08.590> number<00:03:08.860> five<00:03:13.080> yep<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.610> we<00:03:15.700> can

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
so just watch number five yep so we can

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.430 
so just watch number five yep so we can
see<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.000> for<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.180> beyblade<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.810> balance<00:03:17.230> in

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
see it for the beyblade of balance in

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.740 
see it for the beyblade of balance in
the<00:03:17.560> stadium<00:03:18.040> still<00:03:18.790> I'm<00:03:19.240> gonna<00:03:19.390> stop<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
the stadium still I'm gonna stop the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.340 
the stadium still I'm gonna stop the
beyblade

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
beyblade

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.670 
beyblade
and<00:03:20.830> now<00:03:21.430> finally<00:03:21.850> number<00:03:22.510> six<00:03:22.930> which<00:03:23.230> will<00:03:23.440> be

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
and now finally number six which will be

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.820 
and now finally number six which will be
then<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.730> counter<00:03:25.270> mode<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.290> tack<00:03:26.560> type

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
then the counter mode for the tack type

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.330 
then the counter mode for the tack type
grounded<00:03:27.310> Perseus<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.940> L<00:03:28.810> rotation<00:03:29.650> left

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
grounded Perseus and L rotation left

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.410 
grounded Perseus and L rotation left
rotation<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:35.430> now<00:03:36.430> there's<00:03:36.790> more<00:03:37.060> than<00:03:37.270> one

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
rotation so now there's more than one

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.870 
rotation so now there's more than one
barely<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.840> can<00:03:38.170> rotate<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.680> left<00:03:38.880> actually

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
barely I can rotate to the left actually

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.230 
barely I can rotate to the left actually
