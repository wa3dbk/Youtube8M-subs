00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.640
 British scientists prove so on 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.960
 the earth has not had any radio and television 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.930
 what people lived there 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.559
 we were very bored 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.820
 there were no questions for overloading 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.410
 and then came priests 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.639
 but also carrots 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:54.980
 you can't figure out the sisters 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.980
 and took the radio 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.699
 and then everyone began to walk 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.140
 and listen to music year talk 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.600

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.150
 e 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 at 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.160
 and then came 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.770
 this country will figure out who it was 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.640
 Well, in general, that now was and talked 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.970
 let's combine our inventions 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.390
 otherwise they will connect 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 and eventually got go 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.200
 m 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.580
 she is 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.240
 and started on TV all 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.490
 narrate 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.110
 still show 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.110
 and then but also the Czech Republic well ns 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.930
 so that people get bored watching 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.270
 favorite movies and TV shows 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.100
 they became advertising rights 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.249
 in our time 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.720
 that's what money then started getting bored 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.140
 He began to do 3d 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.030
 and now responsibility 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.350
 vologda 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.429
 process over 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.969
 but progress does not stand still 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.699
 so for sure soon more produced 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.689
 products 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.409
 the action is even more fun 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.579
 so to make it more spectacular 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.989
 concern to add 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.040
 one more feature
