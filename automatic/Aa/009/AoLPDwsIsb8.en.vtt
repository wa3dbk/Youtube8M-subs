00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:08.909
 well the idea of the book arises because 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.480
 Well, he was just recently operated 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:14.219
 vino carmen guaita to see me that is a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.009
 my friend forever is a great 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:22.080
 admiring a lot and good, remembering 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.470
 Well, the first fall I had being 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.470
 dancer 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.180
 I got excited I cried I cry and we put on 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.290
 both then very sentimental and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.980
 so 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.690
 and I told him that if someone had to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.650
 write my memories have to be 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:49.070
 them and I was a very dreamer boy a 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.070
 child who wanted to get to get 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.070
 reach 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:02.699
 my ideal that was dancing dance enjoy 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:06.150
 enjoy and always lived in a dream lived 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.720
 Well, like in a movie 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.720
 and later 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.770
 later as my stage as a professional 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.240
 when the fact of leaving my 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.200
 home 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.460
 the problems that are supposed 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.250
 but also the trips that I made with the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.520
 ballet de antonio what for me was supposed 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.909
 be next to a monster like 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.909
 antonio ruiz soler 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.760
 let's say that made me dig deep inside 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.460
 of Spanish dance 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.490
 to see him was an event 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.229
 which then later brings me 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.060
 very much in my life as a choreographer 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.579
 let say 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.420
 very profession as a choreographer 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.370
 then those brushstrokes of flamenco 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.190
 that I give to my choreographies 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.190
 later good with Maurice BÃ©jart 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.400
 my dancer stage that people 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.799
 I did not know because that's what I had done 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.810
 as a dancer my trips for the 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.560
 whole world what they have said about me 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.400
 Critical encounters with characters 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.879
 important of my life in order 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.900
 then a remember later then 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:53.989
 when I started with my school with the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:55.840
 company as a teacher because I made myself 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.239
 also as a teacher because at the beginning 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.209
 when you are younger you do not have the 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.190
 ability nor have the experience 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.569
 then over the years everything is easier 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.480
 how to say things how to transmit 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.849
 they were very beautiful years because 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.090
 and very nice years and also with a lot 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.209
 a lot of responsibility because it depends 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.510
 how I was going to teach them like that they're going to 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.840
 dancing I wanted everyone to be 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.260
 first figures and in fact they have been and 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.260
 they are 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.940
 it is very important not to teach the technique 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.940
 by technique but also that technique 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.280
 attached to the sentiment to the power of 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.180
 transmission 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.210
 to be able to say things to be able to say 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.440
 things with with 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:56.319
 with that feeling that you have to have it 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.769
 anyway 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.139
 I feel very proud of them from 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.290
 all of them the truth is that they were not 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:07.709
 easy because they were kids with a lot 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.709
 personality 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.370
 but the truth is that everyone has 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.760
 responded very well and I feel very 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.630
 happy that I was able to realize the dream 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.630
 of all of them
