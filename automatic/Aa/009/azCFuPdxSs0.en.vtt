first thing you want to do is analyze
your<00:00:32.489> disk<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.450> from

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
drive fragmentation let me open up a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420 
drive fragmentation let me open up a
spreadsheet<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.379> demonstrate<00:00:46.950> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
spreadsheet here so I can demonstrate it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
spreadsheet here so I can demonstrate it
so<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> hard<00:00:48.840> drive<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.440> going

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so you have a hard drive and it's going

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.080 
so you have a hard drive and it's going
to<00:00:49.680> store<00:00:49.860> data<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.550> gonna<00:00:50.640> break<00:00:50.879> those

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
to store data and it's gonna break those

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.319 
to store data and it's gonna break those
data's<00:00:51.449> into<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:52.379> blocks<00:00:52.910> well<00:00:53.910> let's<00:00:54.180> say

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
data's into little blocks well let's say

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.459 
data's into little blocks well let's say
first<00:00:54.660> off<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.110> stores<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.949> operating<00:00:56.850> system

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.380 

there's<00:01:01.469> your<00:01:01.649> operating<00:01:02.039> system<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.180> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and then on and on and on of where you

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.580 
and then on and on and on of where you
get<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:37.860> files<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:39.470> where<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
get these files that are where the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.170 
get these files that are where the
computer<00:01:40.920> has<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.070> jump<00:01:41.400> around<00:01:41.759> quite<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> bit

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
computer has to jump around quite a bit

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.639 
computer has to jump around quite a bit
to<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:44.340> access<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:44.939> individual<00:01:45.390> files<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
to to access your individual files it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
to to access your individual files it
puts<00:01:46.920> unnecessary<00:01:47.130> wear<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.030> tear<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.509> your

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
puts unnecessary wear and tear on your

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.639 
puts unnecessary wear and tear on your
hard<00:01:48.899> drive<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.869> wind<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.170> with<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> hot

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
hard drive and you wind up with a hot

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.260 
hard drive and you wind up with a hot
mess

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
mess

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.770 
mess
much<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.659> these

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
much like this so that's what these

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
much like this so that's what these
individual<00:01:58.320> colored<00:01:58.590> blocks<00:01:58.860> represent

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
individual colored blocks represent

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.999 
individual colored blocks represent
usually<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.479> worse<00:02:00.920> especially<00:02:01.920> if

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
usually it's much worse especially if

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.840 
usually it's much worse especially if
you're<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> torrenting<00:02:04.009> all<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.399> time<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you're a torrenting all the time you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
you're a torrenting all the time you
wind<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.810> does<00:02:06.990> kill<00:02:07.259> hard

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
wind up with this and it does kill hard

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.339 
wind up with this and it does kill hard
drives<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.920> see<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.250> quite<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.520> bit

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
drives I see that quite a bit

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.780 
drives I see that quite a bit
so<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.560> I've<00:02:10.739> analyzed<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> hard<00:02:11.550> drive

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
so now that I've analyzed the hard drive

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.670 
so now that I've analyzed the hard drive
the<00:02:11.910> next<00:02:12.150> step<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.810> defrag

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the next step is to defrag

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280 
the next step is to defrag
hardrive<00:02:14.189> I<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.489> do<00:02:14.579> that<00:02:14.700> here<00:02:15.120> or<00:02:15.900> down<00:02:16.230> here

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
hardrive I can do that here or down here

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.429 
hardrive I can do that here or down here
do<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> defrag<00:02:17.549> or<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> quick<00:02:17.969> defrag<00:02:18.480> that's

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
do a defrag or a quick defrag that's

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
view or a custom view which I like this

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.819 
view or a custom view which I like this
default<00:03:15.750> custom<00:03:16.169> view<00:03:16.319> it's<00:03:16.439> kind<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.650> cool

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
default custom view it's kind of cool

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.589 
default custom view it's kind of cool
looking<00:03:17.180> let's<00:03:18.180> go<00:03:18.269> back<00:03:18.419> to<00:03:18.540> modern<00:03:18.750> view<00:03:19.079> I

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
looking let's go back to modern view I

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.849 
looking let's go back to modern view I
can<00:03:21.599> click<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.109> these<00:03:22.229> individual

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
can click on one of these individual

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.039 
can click on one of these individual
blocks<00:03:23.190> I'll<00:03:23.699> have<00:03:23.909> to<00:03:24.030> stop<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.510> fragment

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
blocks I'll have to stop the fragment

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.740 
blocks I'll have to stop the fragment
let's<00:03:25.470> stop<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.889> now<00:03:26.359> let's<00:03:27.359> look<00:03:27.449> at<00:03:27.599> one<00:03:27.720> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
let's stop it now let's look at one of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.030 
let's stop it now let's look at one of
these<00:03:27.870> individual<00:03:28.349> blocks<00:03:28.620> it'll<00:03:28.859> show<00:03:29.010> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
these individual blocks it'll show the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.679 
these individual blocks it'll show the
files<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.609> are<00:03:29.729> in<00:03:29.790> here<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.209> are

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:30.689 
files that are in here that are

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.649 
files that are in here that are
fragmented<00:03:32.000> if<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.120> click<00:03:33.299> one<00:03:33.479> of<00:03:33.569> these

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
fragmented if I click one of these

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.750 
fragmented if I click one of these
individual<00:03:34.199> blocks<00:03:37.010> basically<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.609> run

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
individual blocks basically you just run

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.750 
individual blocks basically you just run
this<00:03:38.909> it<00:03:39.120> takes<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.359> little<00:03:39.479> while<00:03:39.689> to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
this it takes a little while to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.990 
this it takes a little while to
defragment<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.819> hard<00:03:42.060> drive<00:03:43.699> there's<00:03:44.699> also

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
defragment the hard drive there's also

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.420 
defragment the hard drive there's also
advanced<00:03:45.599> options<00:03:46.019> which<00:03:46.169> are<00:03:46.349> check<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
advanced options which are check the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.979 
advanced options which are check the
drive<00:03:47.669> for<00:03:47.849> errors<00:03:48.150> which<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.479> nice<00:03:48.720> feature

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
drive for errors which is a nice feature

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.110 
drive for errors which is a nice feature
it'll<00:03:49.319> check<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.799> bad<00:03:50.099> sections<00:03:50.699> on<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:50.939> hard

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
it'll check for bad sections on the hard

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.469 
it'll check for bad sections on the hard
drive<00:03:51.359> and<00:03:52.189> to<00:03:53.189> defragment<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.819> hard<00:03:54.030> drive

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
drive and to defragment the hard drive

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.990 
drive and to defragment the hard drive
free<00:03:54.959> space<00:03:55.229> that<00:03:55.530> means<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.519> puts<00:03:56.699> all<00:03:56.879> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
free space that means it puts all the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.050 
free space that means it puts all the
files<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:57.569> one<00:03:57.780> location<00:03:58.229> and<00:03:58.650> then<00:03:59.609> all<00:03:59.759> the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
files in one location and then all the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.030 
files in one location and then all the
free<00:04:00.629> space<00:04:00.840> at<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.229> end<00:04:01.379> of<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.590> hard<00:04:01.769> drive

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
free space at the end of the hard drive

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.849 
free space at the end of the hard drive
so<00:04:02.639> that<00:04:02.669> when<00:04:02.879> new<00:04:03.060> files<00:04:03.299> are<00:04:03.479> downloaded

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
so that when new files are downloaded

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.300 
so that when new files are downloaded
they<00:04:04.859> don't<00:04:05.540> get<00:04:06.540> plugged<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:07.079> ferry<00:04:07.979> spots

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
they don't get plugged in ferry spots

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.699 
they don't get plugged in ferry spots
much<00:04:08.579> like<00:04:08.819> this<00:04:09.150> where<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:09.629> have<00:04:09.870> three<00:04:10.169> open

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
much like this where I have three open

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.559 
much like this where I have three open
spaces<00:04:10.949> and<00:04:11.370> then<00:04:11.489> all<00:04:11.669> of<00:04:11.699> these<00:04:11.939> open<00:04:12.299> spaces

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
spaces and then all of these open spaces

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.469 
spaces and then all of these open spaces
that<00:04:13.500> could<00:04:13.650> lead<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:13.889> further<00:04:14.479> fragmentation

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
that could lead to further fragmentation

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.020 
that could lead to further fragmentation
these<00:04:15.900> are<00:04:16.049> open<00:04:16.620> spaces<00:04:16.889> here<00:04:17.340> there's

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
these are open spaces here there's

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.029 
these are open spaces here there's
another<00:04:18.299> open<00:04:18.659> space<00:04:18.949> basically<00:04:19.949> it<00:04:20.009> just

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
another open space basically it just

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.879 
another open space basically it just
shoves<00:04:20.459> all<00:04:20.699> of<00:04:20.849> these<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.019> front<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.860> that

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
shoves all of these to the front so that

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.850 
shoves all of these to the front so that
they're<00:04:23.279> not<00:04:24.270> fragmenting<00:04:24.990> used<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.590> free

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
they're not fragmenting used in free

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.410 
they're not fragmenting used in free
space<00:04:26.099> much<00:04:26.490> like<00:04:26.729> that's<00:04:26.909> at<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.150> very

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
space much like that's at the very

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.230 
space much like that's at the very

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
end of the DRI all right so next is a

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.450

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
the same options box well the Advanced

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.190 
the same options box well the Advanced
Options<00:04:35.580> which<00:04:36.510> I'm<00:04:36.660> not<00:04:36.750> going<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.930> go<00:04:37.020> into

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
Options which I'm not going to go into

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.710 
Options which I'm not going to go into
that's<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.680> little<00:04:37.830> much<00:04:37.950> for<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.220> video<00:04:38.720> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
that's a little much for the video the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.890 
that's a little much for the video the
drive<00:04:40.410> map<00:04:40.740> which<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.850> color<00:04:42.240> thing<00:04:42.540> again

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
drive map which is the color thing again

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.010 
drive map which is the color thing again
changes<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.560> colors<00:04:43.890> of<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:45.690> can<00:04:45.810> change

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
changes the colors of and you can change

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.510 
changes the colors of and you can change
the<00:04:46.170> colors<00:04:46.500> when<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.830> do<00:04:46.920> custom<00:04:47.310> for<00:04:47.490> you

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the colors when you do custom for you

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.540 
the colors when you do custom for you
say<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.180> want<00:04:48.600> empty<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.960> be<00:04:49.080> this<00:04:49.290> color<00:04:49.550> not

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
say I want empty to be this color not

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.390 
say I want empty to be this color not
fragmented<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.360> be<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.690> color<00:04:51.950> so<00:04:52.950> on<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.280> so

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
fragmented to be that color so on and so

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.380 
fragmented to be that color so on and so
forth<00:04:54.440> there's<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.650> schedule<00:04:56.490> which<00:04:56.970> is<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.150> nice

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
forth there's a schedule which is a nice

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.820 
forth there's a schedule which is a nice
feature<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:57.960> can<00:04:58.110> schedule<00:04:58.410> your

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
feature you can schedule your

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.340 
feature you can schedule your
fragmentation<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.760> occur<00:05:00.060> once<00:05:02.150> daily<00:05:03.350> weekly

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
fragmentation to occur once daily weekly

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.080 
fragmentation to occur once daily weekly
and<00:05:04.680> choose<00:05:04.920> which<00:05:05.160> days<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:05.850> want<00:05:06.030> it

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
and choose which days that you want it

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.670 
and choose which days that you want it
to<00:05:06.210> occur<00:05:06.510> on<00:05:06.660> so<00:05:06.840> if<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.050> want<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.290> happen<00:05:07.440> on

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
to occur on so if you want to happen on

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.920 
to occur on so if you want to happen on
Monday<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:08.730> Wednesday<00:05:08.820> you<00:05:09.090> choose<00:05:09.420> weekly

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
Monday and Wednesday you choose weekly

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.080 
Monday and Wednesday you choose weekly
and<00:05:10.110> then<00:05:10.200> check<00:05:10.470> Monday<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.890> Wednesday<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
and then check Monday and Wednesday a

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.170 
and then check Monday and Wednesday a
certain<00:05:12.780> day<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.140> month<00:05:13.400> at<00:05:14.400> startup<00:05:14.970> or

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
certain day of the month at startup or

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.550 
certain day of the month at startup or
at<00:05:15.810> log<00:05:16.080> on<00:05:17.750> when<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:18.840> schedule<00:05:19.080> it<00:05:19.320> you<00:05:19.410> can

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
at log on when you schedule it you can

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.740 
at log on when you schedule it you can
choose<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:19.980> shutdown<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.610> computer<00:05:20.820> after

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
choose to shutdown the computer after

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.400 
choose to shutdown the computer after
the<00:05:22.170> fragmentation<00:05:22.800> is<00:05:23.130> done<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:24.410> additional

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
the fragmentation is done and additional

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.270 
the fragmentation is done and additional
conditions<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.930> basically<00:05:28.530> if<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:28.830> runs<00:05:29.040> for

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
conditions so basically if it runs for

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.030 
conditions so basically if it runs for
72<00:05:29.700> hours<00:05:29.730> it'll<00:05:30.480> shut<00:05:30.780> down<00:05:31.020> which<00:05:31.710> is<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:31.860> good

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
72 hours it'll shut down which is a good

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.010 
72 hours it'll shut down which is a good
idea<00:05:32.070> because<00:05:32.490> if<00:05:32.610> your<00:05:32.730> fragment<00:05:33.020> your

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
idea because if your fragment your

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.090 
idea because if your fragment your
defraggler<00:05:34.500> is<00:05:34.920> running<00:05:35.310> for<00:05:35.520> 72<00:05:36.150> hours<00:05:37.100> it's

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
defraggler is running for 72 hours it's

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.320 
defraggler is running for 72 hours it's
probably<00:05:38.460> something's<00:05:38.820> going<00:05:39.060> wrong<00:05:39.270> you

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
probably something's going wrong you

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.060 
probably something's going wrong you
probably<00:05:40.020> should<00:05:40.260> shut<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.650> down<00:05:40.770> these<00:05:40.980> are

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
probably should shut it down these are

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.480 
probably should shut it down these are
pretty<00:05:41.280> standard<00:05:41.520> options<00:05:42.060> for<00:05:42.270> services

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.540 

there's<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.610> boot<00:05:48.390> time<00:05:48.660> defrag<00:05:49.380> run<00:05:49.950> once<00:05:50.220> or

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
there's a boot time defrag run once or

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.880 
there's a boot time defrag run once or
run<00:05:50.790> every<00:05:51.090> time<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.390> computer<00:05:51.480> boots<00:05:51.900> up<00:05:52.110> the

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
run every time the computer boots up the

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.350 
run every time the computer boots up the
priority<00:05:53.490> so<00:05:53.760> does<00:05:54.570> this<00:05:54.750> run<00:05:55.020> with<00:05:55.290> normal

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
priority so does this run with normal

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.490 
priority so does this run with normal
processor<00:05:57.360> speed<00:05:57.690> or<00:05:57.990> is<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.200> only<00:05:58.260> going<00:05:58.350> to

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
processor speed or is it only going to

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.810 
processor speed or is it only going to
run<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.710> background<00:05:58.890> so<00:05:59.250> it<00:05:59.340> doesn't<00:05:59.610> slow

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
run the background so it doesn't slow

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.980 
run the background so it doesn't slow
your<00:06:00.000> computer<00:06:00.030> down<00:06:00.360> while<00:06:00.720> it's<00:06:00.840> running

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
your computer down while it's running

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.500 
your computer down while it's running
and<00:06:01.260> the<00:06:02.040> option<00:06:02.340> to<00:06:02.460> shut<00:06:02.730> down<00:06:02.760> after<00:06:03.210> the

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
and the option to shut down after the

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.350 
and the option to shut down after the
defragmentation<00:06:04.760> so<00:06:05.760> that's<00:06:05.880> pretty<00:06:06.060> much<00:06:06.150> it

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
defragmentation so that's pretty much it

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.350 
defragmentation so that's pretty much it
like<00:06:06.510> I<00:06:06.570> say<00:06:06.780> it's<00:06:06.960> free<00:06:07.320> software<00:06:08.360> available

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
like I say it's free software available

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:17.770 
like I say it's free software available
from<00:06:10.490> piriform<00:06:11.490> comm<00:06:12.360> slash<00:06:12.840> defraggler<00:06:14.600> and

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.830 

what<00:06:18.780> you<00:06:18.870> need<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.050> do<00:06:19.170> is<00:06:19.320> select<00:06:19.470> each<00:06:19.860> drive

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
what you need to do is select each drive

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.700 
what you need to do is select each drive
analyze<00:06:23.180> analyze

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.580 

and<00:06:29.710> then<00:06:30.130> defrag<00:06:30.940> and<00:06:31.780> it<00:06:32.170> would<00:06:32.260> probably<00:06:32.380> be

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
and then defrag and it would probably be

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.010 
and then defrag and it would probably be
a<00:06:32.620> good<00:06:32.710> idea<00:06:32.830> for<00:06:33.220> you<00:06:33.400> to<00:06:33.510> schedule<00:06:34.510> the

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
a good idea for you to schedule the

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.150 
a good idea for you to schedule the
defrag<00:06:35.500> let's<00:06:36.370> stop<00:06:37.410> schedule<00:06:38.410> the<00:06:38.680> defrag

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
defrag let's stop schedule the defrag

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.440 
defrag let's stop schedule the defrag
for<00:06:39.850> a<00:06:39.880> certain<00:06:40.780> time<00:06:41.070> probably<00:06:42.070> daily<00:06:42.850> at<00:06:43.150> a

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
for a certain time probably daily at a

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.250 
for a certain time probably daily at a
time<00:06:43.780> that<00:06:43.960> you're<00:06:44.110> on<00:06:44.290> your<00:06:44.500> computer<00:06:46.260> and

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
time that you're on your computer and

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.250 
time that you're on your computer and
then<00:06:47.740> it'll<00:06:48.640> run<00:06:48.850> whenever<00:06:49.540> you<00:06:49.840> tell<00:06:50.020> it<00:06:50.140> to
