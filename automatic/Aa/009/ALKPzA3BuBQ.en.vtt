00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
and will be listed below it took me a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.490 
and will be listed below it took me a
little<00:00:11.820> while<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.300> get<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.690> hang<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:13.110> applying

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
little while to get the hang of applying

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.890 
little while to get the hang of applying
glitter<00:00:13.710> polish<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.759> thought<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.269> would<00:00:15.330> save

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
glitter polish so I thought I would save

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.450 
glitter polish so I thought I would save
you<00:00:16.049> all<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> pain<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.680> went<00:00:16.890> through<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.430> just

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
you all the pain I went through and just

you all the pain I went through and just
show<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.880> how<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.420> apply<00:00:18.720> my<00:00:18.810> glitter<00:00:19.230> polish

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.769 
show you how I apply my glitter polish
so<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.430> you'll<00:00:20.609> see<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.090> first<00:00:21.330> coat<00:00:21.570> it's

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
so as you'll see with my first coat it's

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.990 
so as you'll see with my first coat it's
really<00:00:22.140> thin<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.619> don't<00:00:23.340> try<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> get<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
really thin I don't try to get all the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.849 
really thin I don't try to get all the
glitter<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.350> coat<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.830> I

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
glitter on in that first coat like I

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.339 
glitter on in that first coat like I
used<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.150> realized<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
used to because I realized this is the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.510 
used to because I realized this is the
trick<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.099> allow<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:30.150> coat<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.570> dry

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
trick so allow that first coat to dry

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.069 
trick so allow that first coat to dry
now<00:00:32.520> moving<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.969> we're<00:00:33.149> ready<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.540> our<00:00:33.600> second

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
now moving on we're ready for our second

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.630 
now moving on we're ready for our second
coat<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.829> where<00:00:35.040> you'll<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
coat and this is where you'll get the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.569 
coat and this is where you'll get the
majority<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.480> glitter<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.579> basically

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
majority of your glitter so basically

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.950 
majority of your glitter so basically
I'm<00:00:38.820> doing<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.270> bit<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.570> thicker<00:00:39.809> coat

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
I'm doing a little bit of a thicker coat

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260 
I'm doing a little bit of a thicker coat
than<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> first<00:00:40.710> time<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.790> didn't<00:00:42.090> want

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
than the first time and I didn't want

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
than the first time and I didn't want
all<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.809> big<00:00:42.989> glitter<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.440> my<00:00:43.590> nail<00:00:43.770> I'm

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
all of the big glitter on my nail I'm

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.029 
all of the big glitter on my nail I'm
picky<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.450> brushed<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.649> couple<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
picky so I just brushed a couple of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.090 
picky so I just brushed a couple of
those<00:00:47.190> off<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.450> was<00:00:48.570> ok<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:49.020> two<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> max

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
those off it was ok with two as a max

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.180 
those off it was ok with two as a max
but<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> didn't<00:00:50.789> want<00:00:50.969> any<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:51.420> than<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
but I didn't want any more than that and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
but I didn't want any more than that and
you'll<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.340> there's<00:00:53.550> some<00:00:53.579> areas<00:00:54.059> where

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
you'll see there's some areas where

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.720 
you'll see there's some areas where
there's<00:00:54.360> no<00:00:54.510> glitter<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.260> tap<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
there's no glitter so I just tap the

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.310 
there's no glitter so I just tap the
brush<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.660> glitters<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.230> on

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
brush there and the glitters that are on

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.020 
brush there and the glitters that are on
the<00:00:58.440> brush<00:00:58.649> come<00:00:58.890> off<00:00:59.039> plus<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.879> move

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the brush come off plus I can move

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
the brush come off plus I can move
around<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:00.629> glitters<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.530> fit<00:01:01.559> now

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
around some glitters as I see fit now

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.100 
around some glitters as I see fit now
depending<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> polish<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> may<00:01:03.840> want<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
depending on the polish you may want to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
depending on the polish you may want to
add<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> third<00:01:04.589> coat<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.549> again<00:01:06.299> this

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
add a third coat if you do again this

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.240 
add a third coat if you do again this
time<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.900> would<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.110> back<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:08.010> thin

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
time it would go back to the really thin

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.929 
time it would go back to the really thin
coat<00:01:08.520> similar<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:09.720> time<00:01:10.939> once

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939

thinner brush and white polish I'm going
to<00:01:19.049> start<00:01:19.380> by<00:01:19.590> creating<00:01:19.920> an<00:01:20.280> arch<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
to start by creating an arch at the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.929 
to start by creating an arch at the
center<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> my<00:01:22.080> nail<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.040> cuticle<00:01:23.520> end<00:01:23.670> I

center of my nail at the cuticle end I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.760 
center of my nail at the cuticle end I
then<00:01:24.150> repeat<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.720> same<00:01:24.960> arch<00:01:25.229> shape<00:01:25.530> on

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
then repeat that same arch shape on

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
then repeat that same arch shape on
either<00:01:26.130> side<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:28.500> continue<00:01:29.070> adding<00:01:29.340> more

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
either side so then continue adding more

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
either side so then continue adding more
arches<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.540> name<00:01:30.750> you'll<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.290> i'm<00:01:31.619> just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
doing mine kind of like a pyramid shape

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.179 
doing mine kind of like a pyramid shape
stacking<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.570> arches<00:01:36.570> until<00:01:37.500> i<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.650> down<00:01:37.950> to

stacking the arches until i get down to
just<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.670> arch<00:01:39.000> which<00:01:39.329> nicely<00:01:39.630> lands<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
just one arch which nicely lands at the
