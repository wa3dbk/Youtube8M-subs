that<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> use<00:00:56.399> annual<00:00:57.239> mint<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that I like to use annual mint and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
that I like to use annual mint and
you'll<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.109> all<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.410> montages<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you'll see in all my montages is the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.470 
you'll see in all my montages is the
crowd<00:01:00.030> shot<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.289> simply<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.800> be

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
crowd shot and now it's simply just be

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.899 
crowd shot and now it's simply just be
crouching<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.890> shooting<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> hopefully

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
crouching and shooting and hopefully

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.789 
crouching and shooting and hopefully
I'll<00:01:06.030> hit<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> these<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.740> show<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:10.909> maybe

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
I'll hit one of these and show you maybe

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
I'll hit one of these and show you maybe
sometime<00:01:13.799> soon<00:01:14.869> simply<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.640> now<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> do

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
sometime soon simply is that now I do

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
sometime soon simply is that now I do
use<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.509> method<00:01:18.840> quite<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> bit<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
use this method quite a bit because I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.380 
use this method quite a bit because I
find<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.310> most<00:01:20.670> sufficient<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
find it to be the most sufficient and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.149 
find it to be the most sufficient and
it's<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:21.990> accurate<00:01:22.259> when<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.740> comes<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.040> no

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it's very accurate when it comes to no

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.450 
it's very accurate when it comes to no
scoping<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:25.680> next<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.189> very

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
scoping now the next one that's very

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
scoping now the next one that's very
similar<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.500> prone

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
similar to this one would be the prone

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
similar to this one would be the prone
shot<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> that's<00:01:29.460> where<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> simply<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
shot and that's where you simply just

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
shot and that's where you simply just
prone<00:01:31.820> like<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.220> pretty

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
prone like as for that one was pretty

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:35.990 
prone like as for that one was pretty
good<00:01:35.490> too

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
good too

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
good too
now<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.439> may<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.490> effective<00:01:38.759> as

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
now this one may not be as effective as

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
now this one may not be as effective as
the<00:01:39.270> crowd<00:01:39.479> shot<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.070> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the crowd shot because you have to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.960 
the crowd shot because you have to
you're<00:01:42.000> wasting<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> lot<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.630> time<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.970> proning

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you're wasting a lot of time a proning

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.429 
you're wasting a lot of time a proning
and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.210> getting<00:01:45.420> back<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.229> makes

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and then getting back up if that makes

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.649 
and then getting back up if that makes
sense<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.549> before<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.390> next

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
sense so before you can get that next

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.940 
sense so before you can get that next
shot<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:49.079> now

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
shot off now

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.060 
shot off now
this<00:01:50.520> next<00:01:50.850> trick<00:01:51.000> has<00:01:51.299> been<00:01:51.540> through<00:01:52.070> many

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
this next trick has been through many

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
this next trick has been through many
cards<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> everybody<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.600> knows<00:01:54.720> about

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
cards and everybody really knows about

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.910 
cards and everybody really knows about
it<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.820> find<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.750> bit<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it but I find this one to be a bit and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.380 
it but I find this one to be a bit and
it's<00:01:59.340> okay<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.950> would<00:02:02.909> use<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
it's okay but you know I would use this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's okay but you know I would use this
with<00:02:03.689> some<00:02:03.899> transitions<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.399> way

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
with some transitions not just the way

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.660 
with some transitions not just the way
it<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.190> would<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
it really is so for this it would be the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.660 
it really is so for this it would be the
why<00:02:08.789> why<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.270> course<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.129> course<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.489> just

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
why why of course but of course you just

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
next trick that I would use would be the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.540 
next trick that I would use would be the
swing<00:03:29.300> shot<00:03:29.540> if<00:03:29.920> there's<00:03:30.920> another<00:03:31.130> name<00:03:31.370> for

swing shot if there's another name for

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.400 
swing shot if there's another name for
it<00:03:31.730> comment<00:03:32.120> below<00:03:32.300> tell<00:03:32.810> me<00:03:32.840> what<00:03:32.959> else<00:03:33.230> it

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
it comment below tell me what else it

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.750 
it comment below tell me what else it
could<00:03:33.530> be<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.070> that's<00:03:34.250> simply<00:03:34.400> where<00:03:34.670> you

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
could be but that's simply where you

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.690 
could be but that's simply where you
just<00:03:34.970> swing<00:03:35.330> your<00:03:35.360> gun<00:03:35.660> from<00:03:36.380> left<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.430> right

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
just swing your gun from left to right

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.270 
just swing your gun from left to right
and<00:03:38.770> chances<00:03:39.770> are<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.220> may<00:03:40.490> hit<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.730> shot<00:03:41.170> and

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
and chances are you may hit a shot and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.470 
and chances are you may hit a shot and
you<00:03:43.280> could<00:03:43.430> also<00:03:43.550> use<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.030> one<00:03:44.270> with<00:03:44.450> some

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
you could also use this one with some

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:56.970 
you could also use this one with some
variations<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.920> see

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.120 

such<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.600> I'll<00:03:59.600> do<00:03:59.780> one<00:04:00.260> more<00:04:00.440> time<00:04:00.680> this

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
such that I'll do one more time this

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.309 
such that I'll do one more time this
one's<00:04:01.430> pretty<00:04:01.730> accurate<00:04:02.330> I<00:04:02.420> do<00:04:02.480> use<00:04:02.870> this<00:04:03.050> one

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
one's pretty accurate I do use this one

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.580 
one's pretty accurate I do use this one
quite<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.920> bit<00:04:04.220> in<00:04:04.430> some<00:04:04.819> montages<00:04:07.720> but<00:04:08.720> that

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
quite a bit in some montages but that

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.670 
quite a bit in some montages but that
basically<00:04:10.120> these<00:04:11.120> are<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:12.140> believe<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:12.620> it

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
basically these are the I believe I it

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.650 
basically these are the I believe I it
was<00:04:12.860> for<00:04:13.130> tricks<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:13.640> showed<00:04:13.850> you<00:04:14.030> these<00:04:14.480> are

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
was for tricks I showed you these are

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.300 
was for tricks I showed you these are
the<00:04:14.750> basically<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.260> four<00:04:15.680> tricks<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.280> I

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
the basically the four tricks that I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.490 
the basically the four tricks that I
think<00:04:16.700> are<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.910> best<00:04:19.810> as<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.019> says<00:04:21.200> these<00:04:21.440> are

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
think are the best as I says these are

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.470 
think are the best as I says these are
the<00:04:21.650> best<00:04:22.040> tricks<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:22.730> could<00:04:22.880> use<00:04:23.120> that

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
the best tricks that you could use that

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.659 
the best tricks that you could use that
I<00:04:23.780> find<00:04:24.380> personally<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.980> best<00:04:25.160> when<00:04:25.520> I'm

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
I find personally the best when I'm

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.290 
I find personally the best when I'm
going<00:04:26.090> out<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.480> do<00:04:27.320> no<00:04:27.590> scopes<00:04:27.950> or<00:04:28.220> no<00:04:28.910> scoping

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
going out to do no scopes or no scoping

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.150 
going out to do no scopes or no scoping
montages<00:04:29.900> these<00:04:30.380> are<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.740> tricks<00:04:30.890> that<00:04:31.100> I

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
montages these are the tricks that I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.240 
montages these are the tricks that I
basically<00:04:31.580> use<00:04:31.850> so<00:04:32.390> you<00:04:33.140> can<00:04:33.320> pretty<00:04:33.680> much<00:04:33.770> try

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
basically use so you can pretty much try

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.890 
basically use so you can pretty much try
these<00:04:34.310> out<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.760> see<00:04:34.820> which<00:04:35.150> ones<00:04:35.450> are<00:04:35.630> best

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
these out and see which ones are best

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.890 
these out and see which ones are best
for<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.820> oh<00:04:37.820> there<00:04:38.210> we<00:04:38.300> go<00:04:38.419> see<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.810> was

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
for you and oh there we go see that was

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.280 
for you and oh there we go see that was
the<00:04:39.520> yy-you<00:04:40.520> could<00:04:40.669> basically<00:04:41.020> see<00:04:42.020> what<00:04:42.200> you

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
the yy-you could basically see what you

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.680 
the yy-you could basically see what you
want<00:04:42.440> suits<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.160> pick<00:04:44.090> which<00:04:44.270> one<00:04:44.480> you

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
want suits you and pick which one you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.620 
want suits you and pick which one you
want<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.620> know<00:04:46.220> it'll<00:04:47.000> stick<00:04:47.330> with<00:04:47.480> you

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
want and you know it'll stick with you

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.270 
want and you know it'll stick with you
the<00:04:48.320> one<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.560> stuck<00:04:48.680> with<00:04:48.740> me<00:04:48.860> would<00:04:49.130> be<00:04:49.250> the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
the one that stuck with me would be the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.330 
the one that stuck with me would be the
Crouch<00:04:49.580> shot<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:50.090> course<00:04:50.830> it's<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.890> best<00:04:52.130> one

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
Crouch shot of course it's the best one
