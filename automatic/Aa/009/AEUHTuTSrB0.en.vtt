bowling ball so all I can do is give you
some<00:00:26.369> gentle<00:00:26.850> ideas<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.480> common<00:00:27.930> splits<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
some gentle ideas on common splits and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.960 
some gentle ideas on common splits and
hopefully<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.490> pick<00:00:29.699> them<00:00:29.850> up

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
hopefully you can pick them up

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.450 
hopefully you can pick them up
periodically<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.260> course<00:00:31.500> make<00:00:32.160> sure<00:00:32.220> you

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
periodically and of course make sure you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.100 
periodically and of course make sure you
hit<00:00:32.580> something<00:00:32.879> you<00:00:33.120> roll<00:00:33.330> the<00:00:33.449> ball<00:00:33.629> get<00:00:33.989> at

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
hit something you roll the ball get at

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.920 
hit something you roll the ball get at
least<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.470> pin<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.550> more<00:00:35.930> depending<00:00:36.930> on

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
least one pin if not more depending on

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.590 
least one pin if not more depending on
the<00:00:37.079> split<00:00:37.470> if<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.640> object<00:00:38.970> is<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> never<00:00:39.390> roll

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the split if the object is to never roll

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.100 
the split if the object is to never roll
the<00:00:39.690> ball<00:00:39.840> down<00:00:39.870> lane<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.890> zero<00:00:41.750> ok<00:00:42.750> first

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the ball down lane and get zero ok first

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
the ball down lane and get zero ok first
if<00:00:43.380> you're<00:00:44.250> right-handed<00:00:44.460> bowler<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.239> use

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
if you're right-handed bowler will use

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
if you're right-handed bowler will use
right-handers<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> reference<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> 310<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
right-handers as a reference the 310 is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.920 
right-handers as a reference the 310 is
probably<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> most<00:00:47.820> common<00:00:48.120> split<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
probably the most common split that you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.520 
probably the most common split that you
leave<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.829> same<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> 36<00:00:50.940> 10<00:00:51.329> spare<00:00:52.290> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
leave the same as the 36 10 spare that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.040 
leave the same as the 36 10 spare that
you<00:00:52.680> leave<00:00:53.030> it's<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> same<00:00:54.420> procedure<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you leave it's the same procedure to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
you leave it's the same procedure to
pick<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> try<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.760> clip<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
pick it up you want to try to clip the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
pick it up you want to try to clip the
three<00:00:57.660> pin<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.260> hand<00:00:58.469> side<00:00:58.590> will

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
three pin on the right hand side will

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
three pin on the right hand side will
deflect<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.550> bowling<00:00:59.850> ball<00:00:59.879> into<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> tent

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
deflect the bowling ball into the tent

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.990 
deflect the bowling ball into the tent
if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> throw<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> modest<00:01:02.160> hook<00:01:02.399> normally<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
if you throw a modest hook normally you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
if you throw a modest hook normally you
will<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.360> you<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.690> hit<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.440> 3<00:01:04.649> pin<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
will if you just hit the 3 pin on the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.040 
will if you just hit the 3 pin on the
right<00:01:05.160> hand<00:01:05.369> side<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.910> ball<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.630> best<00:01:06.869> way

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
right hand side of the ball the best way

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.050 
right hand side of the ball the best way
is<00:01:07.110> use<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.410> strike<00:01:07.830> alignment<00:01:08.369> target<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
is use your strike alignment target the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.219 
is use your strike alignment target the
striped<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.569> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.929> you<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
striped are going to get you to the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.440 
striped are going to get you to the
pocket<00:01:10.530> consistently<00:01:11.340> with<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.789> certain<00:01:12.240> ball

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
pocket consistently with a certain ball

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
pocket consistently with a certain ball
motion<00:01:12.899> you're<00:01:13.050> familiar<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.500> why<00:01:14.160> not<00:01:14.369> use

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
motion you're familiar with why not use

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190 
motion you're familiar with why not use
that<00:01:14.610> same<00:01:15.060> ball<00:01:15.270> motion<00:01:15.690> toward<00:01:15.899> all<00:01:16.050> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that same ball motion toward all the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.430 
that same ball motion toward all the
splits<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.709> the<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:17.490> hand<00:01:18.110> into<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> right

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
splits on the right hand into the right

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.260 
splits on the right hand into the right
part<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.009> lane<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.399> right<00:01:20.520> center<00:01:20.910> part<00:01:21.149> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
part of the lane or right center part of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.059 
part of the lane or right center part of
the<00:01:21.330> lane<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.140> way<00:01:22.259> across<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.890> left

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
the lane all the way across to the left

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.270 
the lane all the way across to the left
hand<00:01:23.280> side<00:01:23.899> so<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.110> 310<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.890> probably

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
hand side so the 310 you would probably

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.800 
hand side so the 310 you would probably
use<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.550> stripe<00:01:26.819> target<00:01:27.270> move<00:01:27.450> anywhere

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
use your stripe target move anywhere

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.070 
use your stripe target move anywhere
from<00:01:28.099> four<00:01:29.099> to<00:01:29.130> six<00:01:29.459> boards<00:01:29.819> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.569> left<00:01:30.840> on

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
from four to six boards to the left on

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.620 
from four to six boards to the left on
the<00:01:31.110> approach<00:01:31.470> use<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:31.890> same<00:01:32.099> target

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
the approach use your same target

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.880 
the approach use your same target
depending<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> amount<00:01:33.899> of<00:01:34.110> oil<00:01:34.259> will

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
depending on the amount of oil will

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.109 
depending on the amount of oil will
depending<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.429> how<00:01:35.580> many<00:01:35.640> boards

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
depending on how many boards

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.760 
depending on how many boards
specifically<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.200> move<00:01:37.349> i<00:01:37.500> wish<00:01:37.649> i

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
specifically you have to move i wish i

you<00:02:56.440> almost<00:02:56.620> have<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.860> pick<00:02:57.100> up<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.250> 7<00:02:57.730> pin
