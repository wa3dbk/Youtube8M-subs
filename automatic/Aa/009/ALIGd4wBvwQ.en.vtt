00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.960
 all right 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.150
 for this coffee are very basic as 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 be sure is that at home we 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.750
 to a cup of ice three quarters cup 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.750
 of coffee 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.880
 a cup of milk these ingredients are 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.500
 very comfortable obviously if you 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.160
 they want a little more coffee expose 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.700
 plus a spoonful of sugar and a 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.800
 spoonful of cocoa powder and finally 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.690
 to give that effect the smothers let's go 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.220
 to put three tablespoons March madoff 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.380
 tapping that this can be achieved in 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.150
 any supermarket and good if you do not 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.250
 have they can simply skip this 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.750
 step and good then with our blender 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.390
 we are going to liquefy all the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.940
 ingredients as I told you all the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.410
 ingredients are very obviously to taste 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.809
 if you want me to be a little 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.580
 stronger they put more coffee if they want to 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.530
 be sweeter then put a little 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.449
 more sugar and you are testing and 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.490
 they see how they are doing and if they 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.620
 like good now we go for the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.320
 glass decoration we are going to use a 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.510
 tablespoon of cv web and a spoonful of 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.670
 marshmallow tapping and this we are going to 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.040
 do so that the marshmallow then 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.690
 be a little bit softer then 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.030
 this is going to be our first base that 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.190
 let's put in the glass to give it a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.659
 more effect of smolts that here I am 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.740
 showing the cookie in case the 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.420
 know 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.759
 and good after then we will 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.490
 put chocolate syrup above the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.229
 twin sea and around the glass and this 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.020

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.289
 well then so there is a little 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 crunchier we are going to put cookies 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.130
 crushed you can use the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.810
 cookies that you have at home 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.610

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.130
 and good after that then we're going to 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.049
 put our coffee obviously if you 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.820
 they want it to be a little thicker 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.610
 you can put a little more ice 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.300
 and finally we're going to finish everything with 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.400

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.710

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.390

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.430
 crushed over our weeping 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.020
 cream and then we just close 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.030
 our glass obviously if they do not have 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.520
 these glasses can use any 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.890

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.110
