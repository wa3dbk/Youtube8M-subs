actually a league that was very popular
in<00:01:54.329> group<00:01:54.570> where<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.780> still<00:01:54.990> believe<00:01:55.200> it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
in group where I still believe it's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260 
in group where I still believe it's
around<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.740> starcraft<00:01:56.130> 2<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:57.119> pretty

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
around for starcraft 2 and it's pretty

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.260 
around for starcraft 2 and it's pretty
much<00:01:57.450> an<00:01:57.659> online<00:01:58.409> league<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.920> starcraft<00:01:59.399> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
much an online league for starcraft that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.749 
much an online league for starcraft that
that<00:02:00.750> has<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> different<00:02:01.409> maps<00:02:01.759> maps

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that has a lot of different maps maps

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.999 
that has a lot of different maps maps
such<00:02:02.969> as<00:02:03.210> longitude<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.680> believe

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
such as longitude and I believe

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.109 
such as longitude and I believe
longitudes<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.700> maps<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.000> they

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
longitudes one of the maps that they

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.059 
longitudes one of the maps that they
have<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> lot<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.649> interesting

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
have and they have a lot of interesting

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.440 
have and they have a lot of interesting

guys just type in icy cup maps on google
for<00:02:15.709> starcraft<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:16.829> i<00:02:16.859> do<00:02:16.920> believe<00:02:17.189> that<00:02:17.400> these

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
for starcraft so i do believe that these

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.699 
for starcraft so i do believe that these
players<00:02:17.760> will<00:02:18.030> play<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:19.049> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> icy<00:02:19.500> cups

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
players will play on one of the icy cups

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.280 
players will play on one of the icy cups
maps<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.760> tournament<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.900> i<00:02:21.930> am<00:02:22.109> looking

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
maps in this tournament so i am looking

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770 
maps in this tournament so i am looking
forward<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.620> seeing<00:02:22.859> that<00:02:23.569> meanwhile<00:02:24.569> back<00:02:24.750> at

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
forward to seeing that meanwhile back at

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.209 
forward to seeing that meanwhile back at
the<00:02:24.930> game<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.170> looks<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> probe<00:02:25.980> was

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
the game it looks like the probe was

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.679 
the game it looks like the probe was
able<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.489> make<00:02:26.640> its<00:02:26.790> way<00:02:26.909> into<00:02:26.939> the<00:02:27.359> Terran

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
able to make its way into the Terran

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.360 
able to make its way into the Terran
main<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.989> goody<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.530> doing<00:02:28.739> his<00:02:28.859> guten

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
main and goody is just doing his guten

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.429 
main and goody is just doing his guten
shoot<00:02:29.519> micro<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.480> try<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.689> kill<00:02:30.900> off<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.049> probe

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
shoot micro to try to kill off the probe

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.589 
shoot micro to try to kill off the probe
guti<00:02:31.980> will<00:02:32.159> also<00:02:32.519> wall<00:02:32.819> off<00:02:33.030> his<00:02:33.209> front<00:02:33.420> ramp

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
guti will also wall off his front ramp

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.750 
guti will also wall off his front ramp
so<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> probe<00:02:34.019> has<00:02:34.170> nowhere<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.829> escape<00:02:34.859> but

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
so the probe has nowhere to escape but

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.250 
so the probe has nowhere to escape but
it<00:02:35.879> does<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.239> tech<00:02:36.540> lab<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.930> finished

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
it does see the tech lab that finished

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.110 
it does see the tech lab that finished
off<00:02:37.409> on<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.769> barracks<00:02:38.129> which<00:02:38.700> doesn't<00:02:39.000> really

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
off on the barracks which doesn't really

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.399 
off on the barracks which doesn't really
give<00:02:39.269> away<00:02:39.420> too<00:02:39.480> much<00:02:39.629> if<00:02:39.959> you're<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.139> Terran

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
give away too much if you're a Terran

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.129 
give away too much if you're a Terran
player<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.790> get<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.030> tech<00:02:42.180> lab<00:02:42.389> early<00:02:43.019> on

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
player and you get the tech lab early on

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.110 
player and you get the tech lab early on
on<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.349> barracks<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.889> very<00:02:44.370> very<00:02:44.669> standard
