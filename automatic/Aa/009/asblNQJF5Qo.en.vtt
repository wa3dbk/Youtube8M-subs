00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.020
 discuss playing plastic 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.300

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.970
 today with a prefix called game 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.720
 king dedede king 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.360
 games are something wor hand that has 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.550
 funny number with s600 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.130
 the next model will have 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.470
 three sixes in the title look 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.520
 especially on its design here you mix 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.890
 Chinese-loved psp and and I don't know what 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.140
 because the screen sticking out of this shnyagi 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.360
 looks a little weird 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.429
 even for the Chinese console yes not 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.830
 a little weird your mother is just 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.270
 tube game squared with permission 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.280
 tell the prefix to work on 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.229
 battery dream rare for such 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.660
 second-grade plastic buckets of 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.729
 heaven here only one minus 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.190
 Dead battery for more than 2 hours 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.770
 refuses to work and starts 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.450
 require boiled rice kidding kidding 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.410
 of course thanks at least for 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.800
 battery so well now games oh yeah 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.800
 yes good old Serbian games how am I 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.190
 I love this console Chinese stuffed in 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.830
 game in cages tu original 16 bit 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.260
 games, the rest will be already classic 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.680
 repeat the games can safely say 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.160
 here bti fifty50 on 50 eat great 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 Grubs and suck I don't know who 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.599
 there is such a bad taste on games in china but 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.060
 method of selection of games in the console me 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.090
 completely incomprehensible there is no logic 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.280
 although take a look at this white fuck 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.250
 the designer also had no logic and 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.409
 several chromosomes at least also me 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.810
 remained incomprehensible maneuver shove game 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.569
 king games like mortal kombat quit 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.150
 we like to play with 4 buttons 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.790
 running one chin 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.340
 it is understandable and there are such little asshole 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.319
 very much but seriously if you do 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.170
 portable sebu try at least 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.420
 make 6 buttons and in general we are again 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.430
 back to the simple thought yet 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.469
 Chinese consoles price below 20 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.510
 dollars will not be available entry 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.299
 custom roms and silence yes not 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.610
 just useless I have already seen such 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.099
 Prefixes probably a dozen and in each 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.620
 I saw the truth make access 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.750
 users to games is the simplest 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.900
 the most important thought for this kind 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.640
 consoles good good if krivorukoe 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.129
 dice eaters they can do this 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.739
 just increase the internal memory 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.109
 consoles and fill there in general all the games 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.579
 who went out with us how much their 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.280
 there were about a thousand 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.379
 is it so hard to make an answer to 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.870
 This question I fear no one knows and they 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.180
 continue their worthless mission 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.930
 poisoning the world with its plastic 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.340
 feces okay then as always everything is worse and 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.090
 worse and so 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.549
 digital gamma i shine them gomez house and 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.260
 gamma i fuck only for ebanistic 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.299
 the name is just pour this 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.090
 digital fecal into concrete and create 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.099
 monument gomez we are going chinese 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.319
 feel free to show their world 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.530
 perverted gaze through life and in 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:13.280
 portable console a and stuffed that 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.319
 nothing but a flashlight and the funny thing is 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.200
 this is probably the only useful feature 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.480
 in such goddesses have kai console Well we 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.980
 solemnly opening the godless member 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.949
 gods and 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.389
 built-in battery from nokia who could 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.760
 expect this 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.770
 This is just like China's signature signature. 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.900
 it can be decrypted otherwise 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.479
 how we do what we want for the whole term 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.820
 we are inadequate 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.960
 Incidentally, the question of adequacy 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.449
 creators of such consoles are quite 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.270
 logical instead of developing 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.910
 the idea of ​​a normal quality console with 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.310
 built-in 8 bits of our games and 20 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.080
 Dollars China continues to invent 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.419
 all new and new stupid 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.460
 plastic monster honest 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.639
 it feels like they have no end 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.330
 it is clear but the main question is why why for 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.700
 who are you creating them ah yes and forgot 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.040
 to mention that this is when damn it 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.990
 not comfortable in the hands and of course 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.660
 the Chinese decided to experiment 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.900
 over control of its classic narrowly 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.850
 ass-like button to reduce and 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.820
 increase sound rendered button 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.350
 turbo b and it just does not convey as 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.880
 stupidly 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.380
 except for the awesome 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.289
 many batteries 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.800
 cameo also has built-in games 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.740
 but yes yes it’s probably the built-in games 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.770
 the main headache of this console 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.150
 168 of them are promised but original 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.810
 there will be only 52 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.120
 the rest will be repeated 52 games with 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.950
 an old dandy for 20 dollars yes it is 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.650
 just the most disrespect to 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.349
 all games would be okay for consumers 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.639
 normal so no 45 and slender games 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.830
 full stool 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.650
 but at least the rest is the present 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.020
 8-bit food thanks at least for this 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.510
 if it weren't for the mario icons about this console 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.389
 would be just a reference ruthless 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.190
 shit and if we talk about games then how 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.110
 always not without embedded dan 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.270
 Tyrc versions of Engri Birds and plants 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.580
 vs zombies play solid 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.729
 disappointment is not a prefix just 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.680
 wildest poverty in general on this on 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.330
 today everybody must throw in 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.830
 comments links to all sorts of crap
