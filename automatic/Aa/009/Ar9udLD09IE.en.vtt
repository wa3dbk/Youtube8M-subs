00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.880 
everybody should hike this rough day you
know<00:02:12.930> they<00:02:13.080> always<00:02:13.110> want<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.470> use<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> little

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
know they always want to use the little

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740 
know they always want to use the little
stuff<00:02:14.100> i<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.520> use<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.880> lot<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.150> stuff<00:02:15.330> sometimes

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
stuff i do use a lot of stuff sometimes

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.960 
stuff i do use a lot of stuff sometimes
but<00:02:16.020> i<00:02:16.290> think<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.250> better<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.640> use<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
but i think it's better if you use the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.020 
but i think it's better if you use the
high-heeled<00:02:18.510> shoes<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.870> get<00:02:18.989> more<00:02:19.140> kills<00:02:20.030> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
high-heeled shoes you get more kills and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.190 
high-heeled shoes you get more kills and
you<00:02:21.120> feel<00:02:21.360> better<00:02:21.540> at<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.810> end<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> game

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
you feel better at the end of the game

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.310 
you feel better at the end of the game
when<00:02:22.680> he<00:02:23.220> killed<00:02:23.489> everybody<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.989> later

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
when he killed everybody and I later

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.660 
when he killed everybody and I later

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
them vote on as easy to get the reset

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.430 
them vote on as easy to get the reset
because<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.150> only<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.750> Ivy<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.320> you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
because it's only like you Ivy all you

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.840 
because it's only like you Ivy all you
really<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.830> do<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.250> run<00:02:32.400> around<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
really have to do is we run around the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.540 
really have to do is we run around the
map<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.300> pick<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:33.540> 12<00:02:33.810> tags<00:02:34.280> because<00:02:35.280> there's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
map and pick up 12 tags because there's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.479 
map and pick up 12 tags because there's
only<00:02:35.640> 1200<00:02:36.150> points<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:37.769> then<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.040> V<00:02:38.220> set

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
only 1200 points and then the V set

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.030 
only 1200 points and then the V set
basically<00:02:39.300> if<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.230> get<00:02:40.350> like<00:02:40.500> one<00:02:40.620> more<00:02:40.739> kill

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
basically if you get like one more kill

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.680 
basically if you get like one more kill
or<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.550> pick<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> little<00:02:41.940> more<00:02:42.030> tear<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.480> get

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
or just pick a little more tear you get

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.000 
or just pick a little more tear you get
the<00:02:42.870> EMP<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:46.140> basically<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.590> your<00:02:46.800> dogs

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the EMP and that basically is your dogs

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.500 
the EMP and that basically is your dogs
because<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.340> assist<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.910> all<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.180> stuff

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
because they assist on all that stuff

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.140 
because they assist on all that stuff
you<00:02:48.750> get<00:02:49.500> 20<00:02:49.830> points<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.220> each<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.550> each<00:02:50.760> kill

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
you get 20 points for each of each kill

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.240 
you get 20 points for each of each kill
just<00:02:51.510> for<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.780> V<00:02:51.959> set<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.440> 20<00:02:52.830> points<00:02:53.130> for

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
just for the V set and 20 points for

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.120 
just for the V set and 20 points for
each<00:02:53.340> kill<00:02:53.610> with<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.380> call<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:56.989> EMP

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
each kill with the it's a call but EMP

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.819 
each kill with the it's a call but EMP
so<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.340> gives<00:02:59.579> you<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.880> a<00:03:00.120> tea<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.709> you

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
so that gives you like a tea and you

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.920 
so that gives you like a tea and you
only<00:03:01.980> need<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.400> 200<00:03:02.730> more<00:03:03.150> for<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.480> dogs<00:03:03.720> or

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
only need like 200 more for the dogs or

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.270 
only need like 200 more for the dogs or
something<00:03:03.959> like<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.320> or<00:03:04.560> four<00:03:04.860> or<00:03:05.040> three

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
something like that or four or three

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.640 
something like that or four or three
hundred<00:03:05.370> more<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.660> get<00:03:06.900> dogs<00:03:07.170> right<00:03:07.380> there

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
hundred more so you get dogs right there

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.920 
hundred more so you get dogs right there
and<00:03:07.799> then<00:03:07.910> if<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.060> get<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.299> dog's<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.750> dog's

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and then if you get the dog's the dog's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.479 
and then if you get the dog's the dog's
give<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.320> more<00:03:10.500> kills<00:03:10.799> we<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.130> pick<00:03:11.250> up<00:03:11.370> more

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
give you more kills we just pick up more

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.819 
give you more kills we just pick up more
tags<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.060> then<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.239> just<00:03:12.390> keep<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.829> just

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
tags and then you just keep going just

tags and then you just keep going just
keep<00:03:13.950> getting<00:03:14.310> more<00:03:14.340> dogs<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.030> EMPs<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.780> v

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
keep getting more dogs and EMPs and v

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.710 
keep getting more dogs and EMPs and v
sets<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.829> lot<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.160> stuff<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.790> don't

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
sets and a lot of this stuff I don't

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.180 
sets and a lot of this stuff I don't
know<00:03:18.870> why<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.049> wasn't<00:03:19.410> using<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:19.980> game

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
know why I wasn't using it in this game

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.180 
know why I wasn't using it in this game
though<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.640> should<00:03:21.600> have<00:03:21.930> been<00:03:22.079> probably<00:03:23.010> would

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
though I should have been probably would

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.460 
though I should have been probably would
it<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> lot<00:03:23.609> better<00:03:23.760> honestly<00:03:24.630> um<00:03:27.170> yeah<00:03:28.170> so

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
it a lot better honestly um yeah so

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.180 
it a lot better honestly um yeah so
that's<00:03:29.220> that's<00:03:29.459> what<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.079> killstreaks<00:03:31.190> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that's that's what the killstreaks the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.940 
that's that's what the killstreaks the
guns<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.880> think<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.390> game<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.810> some<00:03:34.650> machine

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
guns I think this game is some machine

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.430 
guns I think this game is some machine
gun<00:03:35.130> based<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:35.880> would<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.570> do<00:03:36.989> use<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.320> lot

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
gun based so I would be I do use a lot

gun based so I would be I do use a lot
of<00:03:37.590> some<00:03:37.829> machine<00:03:38.190> guns<00:03:38.430> i<00:03:38.640> actually<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269

the other gun that I I've recently been
using<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.720> lot<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.470> fao<00:03:49.860> I<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:51.390> grown

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
using a lot as the fao I have grown

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.699 
using a lot as the fao I have grown
grown<00:03:52.439> a<00:03:52.500> strong<00:03:52.950> affection<00:03:53.459> for<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.700> FAL

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
grown a strong affection for the FAL

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.410 
grown a strong affection for the FAL
because<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.010> select<00:03:56.579> fire<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.269> a

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
because of the select fire and a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.440 
because of the select fire and a
suppressor<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:59.010> put<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.640> FAO<00:04:00.000> that

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
suppressor you put that in the FAO that

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.569 
suppressor you put that in the FAO that
that<00:04:01.319> gun<00:04:01.470> feels<00:04:01.680> like<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.890> most<00:04:02.040> overpowered

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
that gun feels like the most overpowered
