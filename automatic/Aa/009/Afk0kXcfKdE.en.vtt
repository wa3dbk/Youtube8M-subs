can<00:04:02.590> bend<00:04:02.890> he<00:04:03.370> can<00:04:03.549> bend<00:04:03.760> at<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:03.910> knee<00:04:04.350> just

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
can bend he can bend at the knee just

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.520 
can bend he can bend at the knee just
like<00:04:05.500> that<00:04:05.739> but<00:04:06.310> his<00:04:06.489> feet<00:04:06.820> are<00:04:07.530> incredibly

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
like that but his feet are incredibly

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.940 
like that but his feet are incredibly
articulated<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:10.140> think<00:04:11.140> that<00:04:11.380> each<00:04:11.590> one<00:04:11.650> of

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
articulated I think that each one of

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.190 
articulated I think that each one of
these<00:04:12.130> each<00:04:12.970> one<00:04:13.209> of<00:04:13.360> these<00:04:13.420> pieces<00:04:13.720> here<00:04:14.140> oh

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
these each one of these pieces here oh

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.039 
these each one of these pieces here oh
and<00:04:14.410> his<00:04:14.470> feet<00:04:14.799> can<00:04:15.160> move<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.880> in<00:04:16.540> some<00:04:16.810> way<00:04:16.989> to

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
and his feet can move and in some way to

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.150 
and his feet can move and in some way to
make<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:18.220> his<00:04:18.430> feet<00:04:18.640> are<00:04:18.820> like<00:04:20.160> so

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
make it so his feet are like so

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.070 
make it so his feet are like so
articulated<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:22.030> all<00:04:22.300> these<00:04:22.510> pieces<00:04:22.720> can

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
articulated that all these pieces can

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.010 
articulated that all these pieces can
move<00:04:23.290> you<00:04:23.500> can<00:04:23.530> see<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.100> like<00:04:24.370> that<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.060> I

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
move you can see that like that and so I

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.320 
move you can see that like that and so I
think<00:04:26.560> there's<00:04:26.890> about<00:04:27.040> at<00:04:27.460> least<00:04:27.700> 10

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
think there's about at least 10

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.620 
think there's about at least 10
different

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.570 

pieces<00:04:31.630> of<00:04:31.660> arming<00:04:32.140> different<00:04:32.590> joints<00:04:33.490> of

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
pieces of arming different joints of

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.720 
pieces of arming different joints of
articulation<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.450> his<00:04:34.630> feet<00:04:34.930> alone<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:36.520> each

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
articulation and his feet alone and each

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.480 
articulation and his feet alone and each
foot<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:38.140> definitely<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.860> very<00:04:39.220> well

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
foot so definitely a very well

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.730 
foot so definitely a very well
articulated<00:04:39.700> figure<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:43.260> as<00:04:44.260> you<00:04:44.560> can<00:04:44.680> see

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
articulated figure but as you can see

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.990 
articulated figure but as you can see
also<00:04:45.300> he<00:04:46.300> has<00:04:46.540> blades<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:47.830> these<00:04:48.760> are<00:04:48.910> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
also he has blades and these are the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.430 
also he has blades and these are the
blades<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.300> chose<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.780> display<00:04:49.990> them<00:04:50.260> with

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
blades I chose to display them with

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.350 
blades I chose to display them with
because<00:04:50.830> they<00:04:51.070> also<00:04:51.220> have<00:04:51.550> blades<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:52.090> can

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
because they also have blades that can

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.080 
because they also have blades that can
we<00:04:52.990> place<00:04:53.260> his<00:04:53.440> hands<00:04:53.890> if<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.580> just<00:04:54.730> take<00:04:54.940> his

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
we place his hands if you just take his

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.150 
we place his hands if you just take his
hands<00:04:55.330> out<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.660> can<00:04:55.810> plug<00:04:56.140> them<00:04:56.320> in<00:04:56.530> actually

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
hands out you can plug them in actually

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.760 
hands out you can plug them in actually
to<00:04:57.280> give<00:04:57.430> him<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.700> look<00:04:57.910> of<00:04:58.440> blade<00:04:59.440> coming

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
to give him that look of blade coming

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.000 
to give him that look of blade coming
out<00:04:59.920> like<00:05:00.520> his<00:05:00.700> hand<00:05:00.940> changing<00:05:01.300> into<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.510> blade

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
out like his hand changing into a blade

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.030 
out like his hand changing into a blade
I<00:05:03.010> don't<00:05:03.310> use<00:05:03.460> that<00:05:03.610> one<00:05:03.760> mostly<00:05:04.210> just<00:05:04.450> because

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
I don't use that one mostly just because

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.590 
I don't use that one mostly just because
I've<00:05:06.040> seen<00:05:06.310> videos<00:05:06.610> where<00:05:06.640> they<00:05:07.180> just<00:05:07.390> break

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
I've seen videos where they just break

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.030 
I've seen videos where they just break
off<00:05:07.810> when<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.110> try<00:05:08.230> to<00:05:08.260> take<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.470> off<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.010> I

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
off when you try to take it off and so I

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.610 
off when you try to take it off and so I
don't<00:05:09.340> want<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.640> break<00:05:10.240> my<00:05:10.300> figure<00:05:10.780> so<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.410> just

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
don't want to break my figure so I just

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.980 
don't want to break my figure so I just
use<00:05:11.830> these<00:05:12.040> blades<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.580> they're<00:05:13.570> very<00:05:13.840> good

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
use these blades and they're very good

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.310 
use these blades and they're very good
very<00:05:14.440> nice<00:05:14.710> blades<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.310> you<00:05:15.760> can<00:05:15.910> tell<00:05:16.320> just

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
very nice blades and you can tell just

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.400 
very nice blades and you can tell just
by<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.470> detail<00:05:17.920> on<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.190> that<00:05:18.880> they<00:05:19.270> they<00:05:20.200> look

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410

CGI accuracy this guy is top top notch
in<00:05:46.090> my<00:05:46.120> in<00:05:46.540> my<00:05:46.840> opinion<00:05:47.320> in<00:05:47.470> terms<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.890> how<00:05:48.730> nice

if<00:05:58.000> you<00:05:58.210> can<00:05:58.240> get<00:05:58.540> him<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:59.110> get<00:05:59.830> past<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.220> fact

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
if you can get him and get past the fact

if you can get him and get past the fact
that<00:06:00.490> you<00:06:00.640> know<00:06:01.000> he's<00:06:01.120> not<00:06:01.180> really<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.450> toy<00:06:01.630> he's

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
that you know he's not really a toy he's

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.550 
that you know he's not really a toy he's
just<00:06:02.050> a<00:06:02.110> model

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
just a model

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.470 
just a model
he's<00:06:03.040> something<00:06:03.250> really<00:06:03.700> cool<00:06:03.850> to<00:06:03.970> look<00:06:04.090> at

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
you don't really play with him then then

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.570 
you don't really play with him then then

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
pessimistic I guess but there's been no

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.490 
pessimistic I guess but there's been no
