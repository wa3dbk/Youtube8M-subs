another Halfmoon play cat female or male
and<00:02:23.710> it<00:02:24.710> was<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> very<00:02:25.130> successful<00:02:25.340> spawn<00:02:25.970> we

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
and it was a very successful spawn we

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.440 
and it was a very successful spawn we
got<00:02:27.020> over<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.160> hundred<00:02:28.250> fry<00:02:28.790> from<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.210> one

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
got over a hundred fry from that one

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.040 
got over a hundred fry from that one
spawn<00:02:29.870> but<00:02:30.760> when<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.790> took<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.180> male<00:02:32.360> out<00:02:32.660> after

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
spawn but when I took the male out after

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.630 
spawn but when I took the male out after
the<00:02:33.170> fry<00:02:33.380> became<00:02:33.740> free-swimming<00:02:34.070> which

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
the fry became free-swimming which

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.130 
the fry became free-swimming which
happens<00:02:35.060> at<00:02:35.210> about<00:02:35.420> three<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.840> four<00:02:35.990> days

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
happens at about three to four days

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.100 
happens at about three to four days
after<00:02:36.320> they<00:02:36.500> hatch<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:37.780> made<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.930> big<00:02:39.080> mistake

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
after they hatch I made the big mistake

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.650 
after they hatch I made the big mistake
of<00:02:39.440> not<00:02:39.740> cleaning<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.340> water<00:02:40.580> out<00:02:40.820> very<00:02:41.240> often

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
of not cleaning the water out very often

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.720 
of not cleaning the water out very often
because<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.350> thought<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.650> would<00:02:43.100> suck<00:02:43.459> up<00:02:43.580> too

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
because I thought I would suck up too

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.970 
because I thought I would suck up too
many<00:02:43.910> babies<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:45.080> fungal<00:02:45.440> infection<00:02:45.500> broke

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
many babies and a fungal infection broke

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.210 
many babies and a fungal infection broke
out<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.340> killed<00:02:46.700> my<00:02:46.850> entire<00:02:47.020> spawn<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:49.040> this

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
out and killed my entire spawn so this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.140 
out and killed my entire spawn so this
time<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:50.660> going<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.959> find<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.530> way<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:52.150> clean

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
time I'm going to find a way to clean

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.979 
time I'm going to find a way to clean
out<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.390> water<00:02:53.600> on<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.560> daily<00:02:55.400> basis<00:02:55.840> even<00:02:56.840> when

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
out the water on a daily basis even when

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.240 
out the water on a daily basis even when
I<00:02:57.020> have<00:02:57.290> very<00:02:57.620> very<00:02:57.890> tiny<00:02:58.930> fry<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.770> try<00:03:00.980> and

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
I have very very tiny fry to try and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.070 
I have very very tiny fry to try and
prevent<00:03:01.580> any<00:03:01.820> kind<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.150> fungal<00:03:02.540> outbreak<00:03:02.630> and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
prevent any kind of fungal outbreak and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.620 
prevent any kind of fungal outbreak and
I<00:03:03.140> also<00:03:03.350> have<00:03:03.770> some<00:03:03.970> antifungal<00:03:04.970> medications

I also have some antifungal medications

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.430 
I also have some antifungal medications
on<00:03:05.810> hand<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.790> am<00:03:08.270> definitely<00:03:08.780> going<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.260> try

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
on hand so I am definitely going to try

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.620 
on hand so I am definitely going to try
and<00:03:09.530> prevent<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:10.280> as<00:03:10.580> being<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.150> loss<00:03:11.330> for<00:03:11.510> my

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
and prevent that as being a loss for my

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.100 
and prevent that as being a loss for my
fry

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
fry

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.920 
fry
I<00:03:12.430> have<00:03:13.430> tried<00:03:13.730> breeding<00:03:14.180> my<00:03:14.390> female<00:03:14.750> with

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
I have tried breeding my female with

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.050 
I have tried breeding my female with
that<00:03:15.080> same<00:03:15.350> play<00:03:15.980> cup<00:03:16.160> male<00:03:16.340> again

that same play cup male again

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.750 
that same play cup male again
but<00:03:17.209> he<00:03:17.570> was<00:03:17.810> not<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.410> very<00:03:18.950> gentle<00:03:19.310> guy<00:03:19.459> as<00:03:19.519> you

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
but he was not a very gentle guy as you

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.360 
but he was not a very gentle guy as you
can<00:03:19.940> see<00:03:20.350> she's<00:03:21.350> got<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> significant<00:03:22.160> amount

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
can see she's got a significant amount

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.170 
can see she's got a significant amount
of<00:03:22.459> her<00:03:22.580> tail<00:03:22.850> missing<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.540> part<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.500> her<00:03:25.180> anal

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
of her tail missing and part of her anal

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.449 
of her tail missing and part of her anal
fin<00:03:26.360> missing<00:03:26.860> but<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.070> starting<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.340> grow

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
fin missing but it is starting to grow

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.800 
fin missing but it is starting to grow
back<00:03:28.519> nicely<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.209> it's<00:03:29.299> been<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.480> couple<00:03:29.660> weeks

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
back nicely and it's been a couple weeks

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.800 
back nicely and it's been a couple weeks
since<00:03:30.049> that<00:03:30.260> last<00:03:30.650> attempt<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:32.480> can<00:03:32.630> see

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
since that last attempt and you can see

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.259 
since that last attempt and you can see
there<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.140> some<00:03:33.580> serious<00:03:34.580> flirtation<00:03:35.239> going

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
there is some serious flirtation going

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.130 
there is some serious flirtation going
on<00:03:35.630> here<00:03:35.900> between<00:03:36.049> her<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.799> my<00:03:37.930> crown<00:03:38.930> tail

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
on here between her and my crown tail

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.440 
on here between her and my crown tail
male<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:39.890> I'm<00:03:40.070> hoping<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:40.850> will<00:03:41.060> be<00:03:41.209> a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
male so I'm hoping that this will be a

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.920 
male so I'm hoping that this will be a
successful<00:03:42.410> experience<00:03:43.010> for<00:03:43.190> both<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.340> them

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
successful experience for both of them

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.720 
successful experience for both of them
he<00:03:44.930> does<00:03:45.110> seem<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.320> be<00:03:45.440> a<00:03:45.680> lot<00:03:45.980> less<00:03:46.160> aggressive

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
he does seem to be a lot less aggressive

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.729 
he does seem to be a lot less aggressive
than<00:03:46.940> my<00:03:48.190> play<00:03:49.190> cat<00:03:49.370> male<00:03:49.519> was<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:51.170> I'm<00:03:51.440> hoping

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
than my play cat male was so I'm hoping

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.110 
than my play cat male was so I'm hoping
that<00:03:51.799> his<00:03:52.190> more<00:03:52.670> gentle<00:03:52.970> nature<00:03:53.230> won't<00:03:54.230> be<00:03:54.530> a

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
that his more gentle nature won't be a

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.100 
that his more gentle nature won't be a
negative<00:03:56.120> when<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.360> comes<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.810> trying<00:03:56.989> to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
negative when it comes to trying to

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.949 
negative when it comes to trying to
spawn<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:59.030> it<00:03:59.120> will<00:03:59.209> encourage<00:03:59.390> my<00:03:59.750> girl

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
spawn and that it will encourage my girl

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.300 
spawn and that it will encourage my girl
to<00:04:01.000> try<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.060> spawn<00:04:02.450> with<00:04:02.630> him<00:04:03.040> because<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.070> know

to try to spawn with him because I know
