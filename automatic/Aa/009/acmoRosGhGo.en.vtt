00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to bring add those trace minerals that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
to bring add those trace minerals that
are<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.010> lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> oils<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:54.449> missing<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.110> have

got<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.150> trace<00:01:12.360> minerals<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:12.990> well<00:01:13.280> but

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
got out some trace minerals as well but

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
got out some trace minerals as well but
I<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.970> those<00:01:15.180> left<00:01:15.450> over<00:01:15.750> from<00:01:15.960> when<00:01:16.770> I

inside this water so what I like to do
is

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
is

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.999

once<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.310> was<00:02:11.599> shaking<00:02:12.599> them<00:02:12.720> around<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
once I was shaking them around in the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.780 
once I was shaking them around in the
water<00:02:13.380> instead<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.950> throwing<00:02:14.099> out<00:02:14.250> water<00:02:14.489> down

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
