match<00:00:10.500> because<00:00:11.370> yeah<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.210> think<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.780> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840

open<00:00:12.960> up<00:00:13.170> some<00:00:13.320> interesting<00:00:13.710> possibilities

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
open up some interesting possibilities

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.430 
open up some interesting possibilities
12<00:00:14.580> hatch<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.360> lot<00:00:15.630> more<00:00:15.750> viable<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
12 hatch is a lot more viable on this

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.630 
12 hatch is a lot more viable on this
map<00:00:16.590> than<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.830> think<00:00:17.070> other<00:00:17.190> maps<00:00:17.460> because

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
map than I think other maps because

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.010 
map than I think other maps because
first<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.060> all<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.210> got<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> four<00:00:18.600> positions

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
first of all you got the four positions

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.990 
first of all you got the four positions
but<00:00:19.470> second<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.770> all<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.100> very<00:00:20.310> large<00:00:20.609> map

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
but second of all it's a very large map

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.910 
but second of all it's a very large map
and<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.779> looks<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.260> could<00:00:22.410> i<00:00:22.470> father

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and it looks like this could i father

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.679 
and it looks like this could i father
these<00:00:23.189> players<00:00:23.490> decided<00:00:23.939> 12<00:00:24.210> adds<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.510> think

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
these players decided 12 adds I think

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.269 
these players decided 12 adds I think
this<00:00:24.810> would<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.289> nice<00:00:25.439> opportunity<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.130> do

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this would be a nice opportunity to do

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.029 
this would be a nice opportunity to do
so<00:00:26.630> because<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.289> mean<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.590> takes<00:00:28.769> such<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
so because just I mean it takes such a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.279 
so because just I mean it takes such a
long<00:00:29.220> time<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> cross<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> map<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.539> think<00:00:31.140> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
long time to cross the map I think you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.049 
long time to cross the map I think you
if<00:00:31.500> you're<00:00:31.980> careful<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.850> leave

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
if you're careful about it if you leave

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.479 
if you're careful about it if you leave
your<00:00:33.239> larva<00:00:33.649> out<00:00:34.649> there<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.160> soon<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.399> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
your larva out there as soon as that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889 
your larva out there as soon as that
spawning<00:00:35.760> pools<00:00:36.030> finished<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.690> can

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
spawning pools finished I think you can

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
spawning pools finished I think you can
defend<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.350> second<00:00:37.620> hatchery<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.850> time

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
defend your second hatchery in time

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
defend your second hatchery in time
basically<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:39.960> we'll<00:00:40.950> see<00:00:41.100> though

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
basically and so we'll see though

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.420 
basically and so we'll see though
obviously<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.239> not<00:00:42.390> pro<00:00:43.020> gamer<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:44.010> again<00:00:44.309> i

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
obviously I'm not pro gamer but again i

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
obviously I'm not pro gamer but again i
do<00:00:44.489> think<00:00:44.760> 12<00:00:44.969> hatchery<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.390> possible<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.930> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
do think 12 hatchery is possible in this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.840 
do think 12 hatchery is possible in this
map<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.379> i<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.680> interesting<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.309> in

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
map and i would be interesting to see in

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.160 
map and i would be interesting to see in
my<00:00:48.000> opinion<00:00:48.270> bottom<00:00:48.690> left<00:00:48.840> hand<00:00:48.870> corner<00:00:48.989> we

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
see having to cancel that and he's

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.479 
see having to cancel that and he's
actually<00:02:49.860> going<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.310> get<00:02:50.370> his

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
actually going to have to get his

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.920 
actually going to have to get his
something<00:02:50.730> colony<00:02:51.000> down<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.269> line<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.660> well

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
something colony down this line is well

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.630 
something colony down this line is well
to<00:02:52.739> defend<00:02:53.010> against<00:02:53.220> these<00:02:53.340> incoming

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
to defend against these incoming

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.100 
to defend against these incoming
zerglings<00:02:54.209> because<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.599> just<00:02:54.750> wouldn't<00:02:55.080> be

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
zerglings because it just wouldn't be

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.240 
zerglings because it just wouldn't be
able<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.349> hold<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.620> back<00:02:55.650> actually<00:02:55.890> looks<00:02:56.190> like

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
able to hold it back actually looks like

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.830 
able to hold it back actually looks like
he's<00:02:56.400> going<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.580> send<00:02:56.819> up<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.940> drone<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.330> create

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
he's going to send up a drone to create

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.119 
he's going to send up a drone to create
a<00:02:57.870> little<00:02:58.080> bit<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.290> delay<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.769> ramp<00:02:58.950> as

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
a little bit of delay on the ramp as

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.460 
a little bit of delay on the ramp as
well<00:02:59.450> to<00:03:00.450> try<00:03:00.629> to<00:03:00.690> defend<00:03:00.989> for<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.260> son

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
well to try to defend for that son

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.050 
well to try to defend for that son
colony<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:01.980> layer<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:02.879> in<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
colony and layer going up in the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.160 
colony and layer going up in the
meantime<00:03:03.209> actually<00:03:03.599> no<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.780> looks<00:03:03.930> like<00:03:04.019> he's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
meantime actually no it looks like he's

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.330 
meantime actually no it looks like he's
feeling<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.830> be<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.040> time<00:03:05.190> so

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
feeling like it's going to be in time so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.070 
feeling like it's going to be in time so
bring<00:03:05.519> them<00:03:05.640> at<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.940> drone<00:03:06.480> right<00:03:06.720> back<00:03:06.900> in

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
bring them at that drone right back in

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.720 
bring them at that drone right back in
so<00:03:07.530> now<00:03:07.680> Hyun<00:03:07.980> actually<00:03:08.250> in<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> fairly<00:03:08.550> strong

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
so now Hyun actually in a fairly strong

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.149 
so now Hyun actually in a fairly strong
position<00:03:09.209> he's<00:03:09.959> got<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.260> layer<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.650> looks

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
position he's got that layer it looks

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.860 
position he's got that layer it looks
like<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.430> layer<00:03:11.580> will<00:03:11.760> finish<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.120> little<00:03:12.750> bit

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
like that layer will finish a little bit

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.140 
like that layer will finish a little bit
earlier<00:03:13.650> he's<00:03:13.860> that's<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.489> really<00:03:14.760> well<00:03:14.909> placed

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
earlier he's that's a really well placed

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.880 
earlier he's that's a really well placed
on<00:03:15.300> Connie<00:03:15.569> though<00:03:15.780> question<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.680> once

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
on Connie though question is is once

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.110 
on Connie though question is is once
these<00:03:17.040> Earthlings<00:03:17.430> kind<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.640> gather<00:03:17.790> up<00:03:17.970> will

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
these Earthlings kind of gather up will

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.490 
these Earthlings kind of gather up will
we<00:03:18.150> be<00:03:18.269> able<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.480> push<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.840> maybe<00:03:19.170> take<00:03:19.379> that

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
we be able to push in maybe take that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.780 
we be able to push in maybe take that
down<00:03:19.650> do<00:03:19.830> some<00:03:19.980> economic<00:03:20.340> damage<00:03:20.580> with<00:03:20.670> these

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
down do some economic damage with these

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.670 
down do some economic damage with these
Earthlings<00:03:21.180> really<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.019> make<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:22.290> this

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
Earthlings really to make this this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.229 
Earthlings really to make this this
attack<00:03:23.280> worthwhile<00:03:23.670> he<00:03:23.849> does<00:03:24.030> need<00:03:24.209> to

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
attack worthwhile he does need to

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.630 
attack worthwhile he does need to
inflict<00:03:24.629> some<00:03:24.780> economic<00:03:25.200> damage<00:03:25.489> rumbled<00:03:26.489> any

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
inflict some economic damage rumbled any

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.710 
inflict some economic damage rumbled any
time<00:03:26.760> getting<00:03:26.849> that<00:03:27.090> second<00:03:27.299> hatchery<00:03:27.569> down

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
time getting that second hatchery down

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.970 
time getting that second hatchery down
so<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:27.930> we<00:03:28.019> can<00:03:28.170> weather<00:03:28.349> a<00:03:28.440> couple<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.799> tax

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
so if we can weather a couple of tax

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.080 
so if we can weather a couple of tax
will<00:03:29.129> be<00:03:29.159> in<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.370> strong<00:03:29.549> position<00:03:29.580> now<00:03:29.909> those

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
will be in a strong position now those

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.059 
will be in a strong position now those
organs<00:03:30.390> pushing<00:03:30.659> in<00:03:30.780> going<00:03:31.680> right<00:03:31.860> for<00:03:32.010> that

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
organs pushing in going right for that

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.649 
organs pushing in going right for that
some<00:03:32.670> colonies<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.120> seize<00:03:33.269> drones<00:03:33.510> being

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
some colonies you can seize drones being

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.240 
some colonies you can seize drones being
pulled<00:03:33.870> off<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.080> line<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.470> now<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.860> question

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
pulled off the line and now the question

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.860 
pulled off the line and now the question
is<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.549> how<00:03:35.670> much<00:03:35.790> damage<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.569> he<00:03:36.659> do<00:03:36.750> with

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
is is how much damage can he do with

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.660 
is is how much damage can he do with
this<00:03:36.989> looks<00:03:37.200> like<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.409> got<00:03:37.500> one<00:03:37.709> drone<00:03:37.950> at

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
this looks like it got one drone at

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.160 
this looks like it got one drone at
least<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.299> looks<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.599> couple<00:03:39.810> drones<00:03:40.019> for

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
least and looks like a couple drones for

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.259 
least and looks like a couple drones for
the<00:03:40.230> south<00:03:40.440> as<00:03:40.650> well<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.400> think<00:03:41.549> wow<00:03:42.060> that

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
the south as well so I think wow that

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.610 
the south as well so I think wow that
really<00:03:42.420> wasn't<00:03:42.659> a<00:03:42.810> very<00:03:42.900> successful<00:03:43.170> attack

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
really wasn't a very successful attack

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.809 
really wasn't a very successful attack
didn't<00:03:43.860> even<00:03:44.010> manage<00:03:44.129> to<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.340> Sun<00:03:44.549> calling

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
didn't even manage to get Sun calling

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.520 
didn't even manage to get Sun calling
down<00:03:44.940> looks<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.569> he<00:03:45.659> got<00:03:45.780> about<00:03:45.930> two<00:03:46.260> kills

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
down looks like he got about two kills

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.199 
down looks like he got about two kills
with<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.099> zergling<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.610> looks<00:03:48.090> like

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
with that on that zergling it looks like

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.420 
with that on that zergling it looks like
it's<00:03:48.360> registering<00:03:48.720> at<00:03:48.900> two<00:03:49.080> kills<00:03:49.319> there<00:03:49.530> so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
it's registering at two kills there so

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.130 
it's registering at two kills there so
only<00:03:50.459> got<00:03:50.879> two<00:03:51.060> drones<00:03:51.299> down<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.780> actually<00:03:51.930> no

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
only got two drones down and actually no

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.000 
only got two drones down and actually no
I<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.349> might<00:03:52.500> have<00:03:52.590> just<00:03:52.769> been<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
I that might have just been the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.789 
I that might have just been the
zerglings<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.849> not<00:03:54.060> really<00:03:54.209> able<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.510> do<00:03:54.799> any

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
zerglings so not really able to do any

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.080 
zerglings so not really able to do any
economic<00:03:56.400> damage<00:03:56.610> there<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:56.939> meantime

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
economic damage there in the meantime

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.789 
economic damage there in the meantime
looks<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.540> rumble<00:03:57.840> tucking<00:03:58.140> too<00:03:58.230> high<00:03:58.319> so

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
looks like rumble tucking too high so

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.460 
looks like rumble tucking too high so
rumble<00:03:59.129> handling<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.670> very<00:03:59.970> very<00:04:00.060> well

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
rumble handling that very very well

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.809 
rumble handling that very very well

really doing a fantastic job now he has

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.610 
really doing a fantastic job now he has

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
his erdman count up to kind of absorb

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.259 
his erdman count up to kind of absorb
any<00:04:05.159> additional<00:04:05.610> attacks<00:04:05.879> that<00:04:06.000> might<00:04:06.150> be

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
any additional attacks that might be

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.449 
any additional attacks that might be
coming<00:04:06.390> his<00:04:06.569> way<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.099> he's<00:04:08.099> going<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.400> a

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
coming his way and he's going to have a

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.490 
coming his way and he's going to have a
spy<00:04:08.670> rope<00:04:08.849> but<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.330> will<00:04:09.510> be<00:04:09.629> behind<00:04:09.810> Hugh

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
spy rope but and it will be behind Hugh

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.110 
spy rope but and it will be behind Hugh
inspire<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.519> don't<00:04:11.730> think<00:04:11.849> it's<00:04:11.970> going<00:04:12.060> to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
inspire but I don't think it's going to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.179 
inspire but I don't think it's going to
be<00:04:12.180> significantly<00:04:12.750> behind<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.439> may<00:04:13.709> be<00:04:13.769> well

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
be significantly behind it may be well

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.440 
be significantly behind it may be well
obviously<00:04:14.519> it'll<00:04:14.760> be<00:04:14.879> three<00:04:15.120> hundred<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.420> two

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
obviously it'll be three hundred to two

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.390 
obviously it'll be three hundred to two
points<00:04:15.689> attic<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.229> smaller<00:04:16.530> map<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:17.310> would

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
points attic in a smaller map that would

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.439 
points attic in a smaller map that would
be<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.519> bigger<00:04:17.759> difference<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.209> looks<00:04:18.359> like

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
be a bigger difference it looks like

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.270 
be a bigger difference it looks like
it's<00:04:18.540> going<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.690> be<00:04:18.810> about<00:04:18.870> 250<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.560> smaller<00:04:20.070> map

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
it's going to be about 250 a smaller map

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.439 
it's going to be about 250 a smaller map
that<00:04:20.430> would<00:04:20.519> be<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.639> bigger<00:04:20.850> difference<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:21.359> at

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
that would be a bigger difference but at

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.570 
that would be a bigger difference but at
this<00:04:21.540> on<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.530> map<00:04:22.770> not<00:04:23.070> as<00:04:23.220> much<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.520> it

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
this on this map not as much and it

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.950 
this on this map not as much and it
looks<00:04:23.699> like<00:04:23.729> human<00:04:24.060> our<00:04:24.210> Rumble<00:04:24.540> being<00:04:24.720> very

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
looks like human our Rumble being very

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.950 
looks like human our Rumble being very
intelligent<00:04:25.320> getting<00:04:25.680> that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
intelligent getting that

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.240 
intelligent getting that

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
Overlord out of the way because that's

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.740 
Overlord out of the way because that's
additional<00:04:27.669> factors<00:04:27.970> losing<00:04:28.270> overlords<00:04:28.660> out

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
additional factors losing overlords out

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.730

back so he's going to bring the circles

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.150 
back so he's going to bring the circles
back<00:04:50.259> maybe<00:04:50.500> just<00:04:50.740> trying<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:50.919> pin<00:04:51.069> those

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
back maybe just trying to pin those

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.950 
back maybe just trying to pin those
organs<00:04:51.460> in<00:04:51.639> or<00:04:52.150> just<00:04:52.330> maybe<00:04:52.509> trying<00:04:52.900> to

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
organs in or just maybe trying to

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.300

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
guarantee that those circles don't get a

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.469 
guarantee that those circles don't get a
spot<00:04:54.520> on<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.729> second<00:04:54.970> hatchery<00:04:55.270> I'm<00:04:55.360> not

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
spot on that second hatchery I'm not

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.379 
spot on that second hatchery I'm not
sure<00:04:55.690> at<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:55.900> point<00:04:56.280> well<00:04:57.280> he<00:04:57.789> I<00:04:58.120> gotta

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
sure at this point well he I gotta

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:59.999 
sure at this point well he I gotta
assume<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:58.750> he<00:04:58.960> knows<00:04:59.410> that<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.710> second

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
assume that he knows that the second

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.189 
assume that he knows that the second
hatchery<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.490> actually<00:05:01.240> know<00:05:01.509> that<00:05:01.539> second

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
hatchery I actually know that second

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.110

he's<00:05:04.360> completely<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:04.960> dark<00:05:05.020> he<00:05:05.320> doesn't

he's completely in the dark he doesn't

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.830 
he's completely in the dark he doesn't
know<00:05:05.710> what<00:05:06.370> kind<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:06.669> build<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.210> think<00:05:07.660> he<00:05:07.750> has

know what kind of build I think he has

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.810 
know what kind of build I think he has
to<00:05:07.900> suspect<00:05:08.560> because<00:05:08.919> that<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.550> sudden

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
to suspect because that that sudden

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.670 
to suspect because that that sudden
colony<00:05:10.060> was<00:05:10.240> down<00:05:10.509> and<00:05:10.720> he<00:05:11.110> saw<00:05:11.259> that<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.530> fact

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
colony was down and he saw that the fact

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.560 
colony was down and he saw that the fact
that<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.919> lair<00:05:12.070> wasn't<00:05:12.400> being<00:05:12.580> upgraded<00:05:12.759> so<00:05:13.539> I

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
that the lair wasn't being upgraded so I

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.120 
that the lair wasn't being upgraded so I
think<00:05:13.780> he<00:05:14.020> has<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.169> have<00:05:14.410> an<00:05:14.500> inkling<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:14.979> an

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
think he has to have an inkling of an

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.379 
think he has to have an inkling of an
idea<00:05:15.220> any<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.610> think<00:05:15.940> he<00:05:16.030> did<00:05:16.180> see<00:05:16.360> that

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
idea any I think he did see that

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.820 
idea any I think he did see that
actually<00:05:16.780> I'm<00:05:16.900> sorry<00:05:17.110> that<00:05:17.169> second<00:05:17.530> hatchery

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
actually I'm sorry that second hatchery

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.740 
actually I'm sorry that second hatchery
going<00:05:18.520> down<00:05:18.639> now<00:05:18.820> he's<00:05:18.880> getting<00:05:19.270> his<00:05:19.449> second

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
going down now he's getting his second

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.159 
got a second hattrick even this is big
actually<00:05:21.820> because<00:05:22.419> he's<00:05:22.539> getting<00:05:22.810> his<00:05:22.930> second

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
actually because he's getting his second

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.390 
actually because he's getting his second
hatchery<00:05:23.440> down<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.740> gas<00:05:23.919> and<00:05:24.130> if<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.280> can

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
hatchery down to the gas and if you can

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.680 
hatchery down to the gas and if you can
get<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.849> not<00:05:24.970> significantly<00:05:25.539> faster

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
get that and not significantly faster

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.140 
get that and not significantly faster
than<00:05:25.990> then<00:05:26.560> rumbles<00:05:26.979> if<00:05:27.520> you<00:05:27.699> can<00:05:27.789> get<00:05:27.909> that<00:05:27.940> a

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
than then rumbles if you can get that a

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.640 
than then rumbles if you can get that a
second<00:05:28.630> gas<00:05:28.750> producing<00:05:29.169> for<00:05:29.319> him<00:05:29.409> he's<00:05:29.530> going

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
second gas producing for him he's going

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.649 
second gas producing for him he's going
to<00:05:29.740> be<00:05:29.830> in<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.949> very<00:05:30.070> strong<00:05:30.280> position<00:05:30.659> the

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
to be in a very strong position the

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.870 
to be in a very strong position the
question<00:05:31.990> is<00:05:32.080> will<00:05:32.710> how<00:05:33.159> much<00:05:33.310> damage<00:05:33.490> can<00:05:33.759> you

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
question is will how much damage can you

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.189 
question is will how much damage can you
do<00:05:33.970> with<00:05:34.090> these<00:05:34.180> medalists<00:05:34.539> and<00:05:34.810> will<00:05:34.960> he<00:05:35.110> be

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
do with these medalists and will he be

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.779 
do with these medalists and will he be
able<00:05:35.229> to<00:05:35.409> weather<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.650> counter-attack<00:05:36.220> for

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
able to weather a counter-attack for

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
Earthlings on the field as you can see

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.779 
Earthlings on the field as you can see
he's<00:05:41.650> just<00:05:41.680> gathering<00:05:42.039> up<00:05:42.190> gonna<00:05:42.400> looks<00:05:42.639> like

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
he's just gathering up gonna looks like

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:43.800 
he's just gathering up gonna looks like
actually<00:05:43.060> just<00:05:43.240> going<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.419> gather<00:05:43.539> up<00:05:43.690> in

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
actually just going to gather up in

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.140 
actually just going to gather up in
guard<00:05:44.020> he<00:05:44.949> out<00:05:45.430> in<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.610> field<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:45.909> little<00:05:46.030> bit

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
guard he out in the field a little bit

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.600 
guard he out in the field a little bit
here<00:05:46.710> Overlord<00:05:47.710> coming<00:05:47.949> back<00:05:48.070> from<00:05:48.280> Rumble

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
here Overlord coming back from Rumble

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.040 
here Overlord coming back from Rumble
not<00:05:48.759> losing<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.060> as<00:05:49.389> you<00:05:49.449> can<00:05:49.570> see<00:05:49.690> six<00:05:49.900> meals

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
not losing it as you can see six meals

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.050 
not losing it as you can see six meals
being<00:05:50.320> produced<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:51.580> so<00:05:51.759> it<00:05:51.849> looks<00:05:52.000> like

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
being produced and so it looks like

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.560 
being produced and so it looks like
Rumble<00:05:52.900> actually<00:05:53.199> just<00:05:54.070> he's<00:05:55.060> economically

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
Rumble actually just he's economically

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.180 
Rumble actually just he's economically
head<00:05:55.840> I<00:05:56.080> should<00:05:56.440> say<00:05:56.560> and<00:05:56.680> he's<00:05:56.800> ahead<00:05:56.949> as<00:05:57.159> far

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
head I should say and he's ahead as far

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
head I should say and he's ahead as far
as<00:05:57.340> production<00:05:57.550> looks<00:05:57.820> like<00:05:57.909> he's<00:05:58.060> putting

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
as production looks like he's putting

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.779 
as production looks like he's putting
down<00:05:58.419> his<00:05:58.719> secondary<00:05:59.680> down<00:05:59.919> now<00:06:00.130> which<00:06:00.759> is

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
down his secondary down now which is

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.060 
down his secondary down now which is
significantly<00:06:01.479> behind<00:06:01.690> human<00:06:02.440> secondary<00:06:02.889> so

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
significantly behind human secondary so

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.980 
significantly behind human secondary so
he's<00:06:03.250> going<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.400> be<00:06:03.520> way<00:06:04.060> behind<00:06:04.240> on<00:06:04.539> as<00:06:04.750> far<00:06:04.900> as

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
he's going to be way behind on as far as

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.159 
he's going to be way behind on as far as
that<00:06:05.139> second<00:06:05.380> gas<00:06:05.530> goes<00:06:05.770> down<00:06:06.690> again<00:06:07.690> at<00:06:08.080> the

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
that second gas goes down again at the

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.390 
that second gas goes down again at the
question<00:06:08.440> but<00:06:08.710> he's<00:06:08.830> going<00:06:08.949> to<00:06:09.009> be<00:06:09.070> ahead<00:06:09.190> and

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
question but he's going to be ahead and

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.680 
question but he's going to be ahead and
production<00:06:09.759> at<00:06:09.880> this<00:06:10.000> point<00:06:10.210> so<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.419> question

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
production at this point so the question

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.450 
production at this point so the question
is<00:06:10.750> will<00:06:11.050> he<00:06:11.080> push<00:06:11.289> ahead<00:06:11.409> and<00:06:12.190> get<00:06:12.310> some

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
is will he push ahead and get some

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.520 
is will he push ahead and get some
damage<00:06:12.699> down<00:06:12.849> as<00:06:13.030> you<00:06:13.120> can<00:06:13.210> see<00:06:13.330> that<00:06:13.479> gas<00:06:13.659> nice

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
damage down as you can see that gas nice

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.740 
damage down as you can see that gas nice
timing<00:06:14.830> putting<00:06:15.190> down<00:06:15.310> that<00:06:15.340> gas<00:06:15.639> so<00:06:16.509> we<00:06:16.539> can

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
timing putting down that gas so we can

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.270 
timing putting down that gas so we can
start<00:06:17.020> harvesting<00:06:17.229> immediately<00:06:18.009> as<00:06:18.070> that

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
start harvesting immediately as that

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.550 
start harvesting immediately as that
second<00:06:18.550> hatchery<00:06:18.820> goes<00:06:18.969> up<00:06:19.150> so<00:06:20.110> it'll<00:06:20.469> be

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
second hatchery goes up so it'll be

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.499 
second hatchery goes up so it'll be
interesting<00:06:20.650> but<00:06:21.099> but<00:06:21.820> it'll<00:06:22.090> still<00:06:22.240> be<00:06:22.330> three

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
interesting but but it'll still be three

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:24.089 
interesting but but it'll still be three
hatcheries<00:06:22.840> versus<00:06:23.139> two<00:06:23.320> so<00:06:23.590> rumple's<00:06:23.949> still

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
hatcheries versus two so rumple's still

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.260 
hatcheries versus two so rumple's still
going<00:06:24.219> to<00:06:24.280> have<00:06:24.340> to<00:06:24.490> absorb<00:06:24.699> attacks<00:06:25.030> for<00:06:25.210> a

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
going to have to absorb attacks for a

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.060 
going to have to absorb attacks for a
little<00:06:25.389> bit<00:06:25.539> getting<00:06:26.469> an<00:06:26.560> evolution<00:06:26.949> chamber

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
little bit getting an evolution chamber

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.629 
little bit getting an evolution chamber
down<00:06:27.280> to<00:06:27.460> do<00:06:27.610> so<00:06:27.789> it<00:06:27.909> looks<00:06:28.060> like<00:06:28.650> but<00:06:29.650> uh<00:06:29.710> but

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
down to do so it looks like but uh but

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.100 
down to do so it looks like but uh but
he<00:06:30.759> could<00:06:31.000> also<00:06:31.150> push<00:06:31.419> up<00:06:31.570> an<00:06:31.690> attack<00:06:31.930> if<00:06:32.080> he

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
he could also push up an attack if he

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.899 
he could also push up an attack if he
wanted<00:06:32.380> to<00:06:32.440> I<00:06:32.710> just<00:06:33.190> try<00:06:33.280> to<00:06:33.310> out<00:06:33.460> labra<00:06:33.729> looks

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
wanted to I just try to out labra looks

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.100 
wanted to I just try to out labra looks
like<00:06:34.000> he's<00:06:34.120> producing<00:06:34.419> couple<00:06:34.719> scourge<00:06:34.930> he's

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110

gas and just I guess gather up kind of a

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:38.719 
gas and just I guess gather up kind of a
strike<00:07:37.410> force<00:07:37.650> here<00:07:37.860> another<00:07:38.099> Overlord<00:07:38.520> being
