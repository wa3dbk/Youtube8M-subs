00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.300
 hi my name is juan carlos laime in 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.540
 this opportunity we are going to make a 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.980
 Oracle 11g installation in a system 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.020
 operating windows 7 64 bits 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.020
 we open the website to achieve with 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.530
 and download the necessary files 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.530
 for our installation 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.930
 within the oracle page we do 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.800
 click on the download option 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.800
 now with the time 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.640
 in this part we have to accept the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.309
 license 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.309
 and download the oracle database 11g 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.020
 in my case my 64 operating system 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 bits 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.000
 and in this part I release the two 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.489
 archives besieged it is possible that this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.370
 page asks you to register if that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.940
 it happens they register to be able to download 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.940
 the necessary files 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.070
 in my case I have already downloaded those 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.070
 I have it in my folder 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.310
 and what we have to do here is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.580
 unzip each file in a folder 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.580
 Independent 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.659
 as in this case 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.320
 and then the unzipped files of the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.950
 folder 2 we have to copy them to the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.409
 folder 1 that way we are 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.460
 getting all the complete installer 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.700
 of Oracle 11g in the first folder if 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.960
 we do not perform this step 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.479
 possibly at the time of performing the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.440
 installation of the oracle we would be 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.440
 having errors 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 well my folder that I created is this 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:05.500
 all we have to do is 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.500
 run the installer file 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.840
 we wait a few moments 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.810
 we see that it is loading the window of the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.190
 gold alcohol 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.280
 disable the option of updates 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.650
 we give you next 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.440
 in this little window we give you yes 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.700
 create and configure database 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.700
 class of desk 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.370
 and in my case, copy it and the unit 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:47.879
 we change the unit 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.879
 we give the administrator a password 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.870
 we give you next 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.450
 the now with this checking the 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.450
 minimum requirements for installation 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.460
 it gives me a history of parameters 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.890
 we finish 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.450
 and the parrot with begins to be the copy of 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.540
 all the necessary files 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.069
 to have the database ready what 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.959
 only thing we have to do is wait 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.959
 until the installation concluded 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.150
 good at the moment is being created 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.150
 our database 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.099
 this database is a database 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.099
 initial that creates the default 'oracle' 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.470
 well I just created our base of 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.690
 data in this part we can see the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.410
 active users that by default have 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.410
 the 'oracle' 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.410
 we will accept 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.690
 this address here 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.520
 with this address we can enter the 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.080
 enterprise manager to be able 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.380
 manage our databases of 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.380
 oracle 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.199
 good we give you to accept 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.340
 and with this we will have finished our 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.340
 installation of oracle 11g 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.790
 good with me until next 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.790
 opportunity that would be all thanks
