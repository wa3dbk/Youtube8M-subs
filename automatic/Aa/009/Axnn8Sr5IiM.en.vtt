 You's a once thought be some people that are looking for something of 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.530
 Please have a look at Diapason No. 183, but 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.860
 2300 units serial number 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:39.350
 23 What is the number? 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:42.350
 It was not made by Kawai Instruments made by Mr. Ohashi 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:49.910
 There is no doubt that it is a diapason 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.520
 Just because the age has passed a lot ぇ What does this mean? 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.600

 I'm hurt a little 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:34.580
 I made two ivory but I made it with a large ivory keyboard 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.830
 I think that it will be better because the material that was the sound when I put the ball is no longer half-life 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.420
 But it seems to take quite a bit 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.420
