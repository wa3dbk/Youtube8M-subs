00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.010
 smilies some of the latest videos talked about perimeter protections of 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.759
 volumetric protection 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.550
 today we are talking about some suggestions for correct installation 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.339
 and let's start with active infrared barriers 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.550
 the first advice can only be linked to interference, remember that 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.929
 active infrared barriers ban the alarm stops fascism 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.739
 therefore it is essential not to place in areas where it is possible that branches of 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.140
 fraud trees how many animals can pass through the split transmitter 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.180
 receiver 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.900
 and even blindly advised against installing barriers in situations a 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.830
 risk of contact with water 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.010
 for example adjacent to a road with car passage and in which easy that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.820
 fountain is formed 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.860
 useful advice 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.960
 indicated surfaces subjected to vibration set movement cause false alarms 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.760
 and then pay attention to the lights 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.750
 if receiver does not have to look towards lucid reality it is like that if the sun 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.730
 but from dawn to sunset 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.050
 but even the lights of the cars may not even be a beautiful light that illuminates the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.630
 garden 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.820
 once the correct position has been chosen and must pay attention to the synchronism between 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.960
 transmitter receiver 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.240
 first of all check the way the eyes know perfectly oriented 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.470
 I lost the other 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.630
 for example receiver not satis pirates of the senses from a pedometer wall 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.010
 to get the best alignments the hr fb sky fb barriers are better 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.200
 money also the possibility of being regulated with railings of 90 degrees for 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.640
 implant sign in 10 degrees vertically but also fb illy masks can 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.630
 fight up to 180 degrees 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.840
 for me for the perfect workout 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.560
 also those who live in install camariere hrs dispositifs one above 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.710
 the other cask alcatel remember to alternate transmitter receiver on 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.100
 same side to avoid interference 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.689
 and remember that the hrs dtb needs the connection of the child of 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.860
 synchronism 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.080
 ecclesiastes arrests and in family asked melody mount the cover of 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.110
 transmitter 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.169
 perfects the camper switch 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.329
 only in this way can the condition of alignment be known 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.649
 more practical still the speech to attack fb xd f 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:26.119
 circles have been requested can be used to set ports different frequencies 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.319
 avoiding interference when multiple transmitters are mounted on it 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.199
 side but we also come up with some advice for the volume protections it gives you 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.060
 indoor

 yamaha r6 r1 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.849
 first of all remember that we are combining two technology 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.609
 passive infrared pellet microwave 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.780
 if the new sensitive to today's climb 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.780
 ma - offices approaching fantasy 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.480
 remember what the survey of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.029
 Infrared decreases in the presence of glass fluorescent lights 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.869
 definitely lucky strike 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.869
 but also sheets of transparent iphone paper 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.709
 as far as microwaves are concerned, it is good to know that the small rooms are placed 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.239
 moscato d'asti easily with the result indicating that they go beyond the walls 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.249
 and slowly false alarms 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.680
 to prevent this from happening it is sufficient to regulate the issue of 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:19.639
 frond 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.579
 but when installing a volumetric sensor it is advisable to follow also in 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.199
 small tricks 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.700
 the recommended height of the spark gap 70 and obviously without the floor 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.469
 and of course avoids disco 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.659
 news in direct sunlight and proximity to heat sources 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.620
 but it is also useful region with strong air currents that surfaces that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.819
 they can vibrate 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.059
 ff moves without now 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.779
 be also to the movement in the room like a lioness like jazz you free yourself from 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.459
 move yourself 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.629
 but this should be obvious 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.609
 finally, a couple of more technical tips try to make tests of 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.469
 detection by separating the two technologies 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:02.609
 i salate them in the most suitable way and above all compare the area 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.059
 to protect these operations with unreal sensor coverage volume 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.699
 they are very important because a wrong calibration involves the 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.709
 detection of objects outside the environment to be protected 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:18.049
 clinique women can indeed surpass them wall wooden semi-final tickets 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.019
 face 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.580
 I have dwelt a bit and in the end this video is nothing but a list 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.710
 of advice 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.070
 but I hope they are useful and maybe you told me something never go 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:28.719
 thought
