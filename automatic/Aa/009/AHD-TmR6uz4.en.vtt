well<00:00:19.310> we'll<00:00:20.310> back<00:00:20.520> off<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.359> little<00:00:21.630> bit<00:00:22.010> what

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
well we'll back off one little bit what

well we'll back off one little bit what
are<00:00:23.039> we<00:00:23.160> hoping<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.699> achieve<00:00:23.960> number<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.199> to

stop the growth of the cancer and it's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.849 
stop the growth of the cancer and it's
an<00:00:29.730> odd<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.240> bit<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.109> may<00:00:31.230> sound<00:00:31.529> silly

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
an odd little bit and it may sound silly

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.420 
an odd little bit and it may sound silly
if<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.430> live<00:00:32.640> long<00:00:32.940> enough<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.329> may<00:00:34.050> live<00:00:34.430> if

if you live long enough you may live if
you<00:00:35.640> live<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> cancer<00:00:36.660> long<00:00:36.870> enough

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you live with the cancer long enough

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100 
you live with the cancer long enough
eventually<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.370> body<00:00:38.610> will<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> it's

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
eventually the body will do it it's

off they continue your cancer is live

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.610 
off they continue your cancer is live
and<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.610> tumor<00:00:50.940> cells<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> time<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that you will then stand still you'll

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.590 
that you will then stand still you'll
have<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> cancer<00:00:58.609> health<00:00:59.609> should<00:01:00.059> come<00:01:00.359> back

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
have the cancer health should come back

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
have the cancer health should come back
and<00:01:00.870> you're<00:01:01.020> standing<00:01:01.410> still<00:01:01.760> another<00:01:02.760> way<00:01:03.090> is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and you're standing still another way is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.070 
and you're standing still another way is
the<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.780> my<00:01:03.960> thighs<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.880> body<00:01:06.150> with

the to my thighs and the body with

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.520 
the to my thighs and the body with
another<00:01:07.380> immune<00:01:07.770> response<00:01:08.630> wraps<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.930> with

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
another immune response wraps it with

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.429 
another immune response wraps it with
function<00:01:11.150> essentially<00:01:12.260> fibroblasts<00:01:13.260> are<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
function essentially fibroblasts are in

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.520 
function essentially fibroblasts are in
connective<00:01:13.979> tissue<00:01:14.220> walls<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.939> off<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
connective tissue walls it off and the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.429 
connective tissue walls it off and the
best<00:01:16.770> way<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> total<00:01:18.390> regression<00:01:19.259> of

best way is for a total regression of

best way is for a total regression of
the<00:01:19.710> tool<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.270> those

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the tool you can have all of those

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.810 
the tool you can have all of those
responses<00:01:23.750> how<00:01:24.750> does<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.229> occur<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:26.250> the

when the soul ruptures it liberates the

you<00:02:01.210> get<00:02:01.390> your<00:02:01.450> thumbs<00:02:02.260> jeonnam<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.730> open

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
you get your thumbs jeonnam and you open

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.780 
you get your thumbs jeonnam and you open
them<00:02:04.150> up<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.480> you<00:02:04.540> find<00:02:04.840> dead<00:02:05.110> tumor<00:02:05.590> all<00:02:06.310> over

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
them up and you find dead tumor all over

the place yet they were never treated

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.540 
the place yet they were never treated
which<00:02:10.450> means<00:02:10.750> there<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.110> an<00:02:11.380> immune<00:02:11.740> mechanism

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
which means there is an immune mechanism

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.260 
which means there is an immune mechanism
we're<00:02:13.330> adding<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.200> make<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.770> more

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
we're adding it to make it more

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.330 
we're adding it to make it more

if you want blockage you have rampant

if you want blockage you have rampant
