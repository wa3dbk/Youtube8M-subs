00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.420
 what is the difference between a 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.309
 voltage stabilizer and a charger 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.220
 of batteries is what we're going to see in the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.680
 next video but show you in this 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.320
 video we are using two devices a 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.320
 voltage stabilizer Company 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.869
 auto Land of psm 1 and a charger 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.629
 very good batteries that I do not personal e 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.430
 used and is of very good quality is 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.790
 totally electronic is also a 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.530
 charger from 2 to 25 amps and 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.329
 then we are going to analyze in the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.010
 oscilloscope especially the quality of the 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.870
 voltage delivered remember that the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.970
 battery charger what it does is a 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.969
 rectification and delivery a voltage with 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.190
 Fluctuating voltage to achieve 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.989
 the load in the shortest time the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.540
 stabilizer on the contrary no 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.840
 pretends to charge the batteries but yes 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.630
 can load it but what it allows is 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.090
 maintain a constant voltage with 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.310
 variable amperage what it does is regulate 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.640
 the amount of current it delivers 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.470
 to be able to keep the voltage stable 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.479
 they are two different concepts but 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.930
 let's see it on the oscilloscope for 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:28.130
 better understand the qualities of each one 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.930
 ok here we are already with the stabilizer 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.619
 of voltage at this time I'm going to 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.619
 activate it 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.950
 and here it's being activated let's see where 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.820
 raise the voltage but let's see that the curl 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.240
 the amount of curl is practically 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.030
 nothing 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.710
 now let's apply a charge let's 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.070
 turn on the high lights and we see that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:00.900
 equal the amount the variation let's say or 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.140
 the oscillation in terms of curl is not 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.180
 apply see also the difference 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.820
 we can already disconnect the lights we are going to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.870
 go here to battery voltage and 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.680
 let's see then 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.560
 without the applied lights we see that it has 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.319
 12.9 and now let's apply the lights 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.130
 let's see that there is no variation or 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:32.069
 variation is very little 12.6 12.7 against 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.500
 12.9 practically 22.2 volts a 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.920
 fifth of volts let's remove the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.380
 lights and we see that it goes up to 1290 against 12 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.910
 70 is practically a quarter of a volt 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.890
 the variation 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.640
 now let's disconnect the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:52.049
 stabilizer and let's see the variation 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.959
 now we have here in the battery 12 20 and 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.239
 now let's apply the lights and see 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.030
 that we practically have volts and 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.300
 medium that is 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.180
 what lowers our attention 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.190
 then this is the process we can 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.160
 drop the lights to see how it 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.870
 recover the battery and we see 12 and a half 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.450
 11 and a half 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.849
 the recovery is obviously slow 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.519
 now let's do this same thing but with 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.569
 the battery charger let's see 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.999
 how much does he 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.159
 this charger and obviously we know that 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.810
 the signal will be very contaminated by 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.450
 risso but let's do the test with 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.609
 the charger but now what are we going to 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.609
 to do is connect our charger 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.359
 batteries to see the variation first 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.819
 in voltage 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.639
 here I am in 2 amps and let's see 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:46.700
 where it goes up 25 amps the voltage goes 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:50.780
 of 12.6 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.780
 to practically 13.6 or in the same 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:59.200
 charger there is a voltage variation of 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.540
 one of a volt now let's apply 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.640
 the high lights we are going to light the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.920
 lights and we see that there is also a 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.920
 variation of practically 12 points 9 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.350
 here we are releasing the lights to 14 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.510
 points together 1 then a variation of 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.359
 more than one volt we are going to apply the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.459
 lights again let's see what falls to 13 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.950
 practically 13 volts and if what 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.780
 let's go up to 13.87 we forget 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.780
 also the differences now let's go to the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:38.490
 let's go to the alternator curl 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.710
 and let's see what we see is a signal 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.560
 totally different 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.840
 let's see that there are eventually variations 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.490
 now let's apply the lights we see 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.530
 that there is a fluctuation not only in the 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.580
 voltage but also in the amount of 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.890
 rizzo we see very dirty wave very 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.090
 contaminated because the charger 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:04.320
 batteries is not a device 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.320
 specialized for programming 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.270
 it is important that you take this into account 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.730
 the time to do a programming never 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.900
 do it with a battery charger not 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.560
 there is no doubt that there is a big difference 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.630
 between using a battery charger or a 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.250
 voltage stabilizer at the time of 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.020
 do a schedule 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.850
 remember that in some vehicles that 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.610
 they have a lot of electronics there could be a 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.830
 consumption of 40 50 and up to 60 amps 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.140
 every time we remove the start in the 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.090
 contact or we put the start nor that 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.890
 procedure is many times required 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.900
 in the settings remove the contact 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.960
 and put the contact and there could be a 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.510
 very large voltage fluctuation if not 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.940
 we have a good stabilizer two 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.890
 different equipment for functions 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.080
 different one thing is to load a 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.550
 battery and another thing is to have a 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.520
 stabilizer to make a 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.470
 programming and we do not want it 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.210
 go to ruin some module that is 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.610
 programming that normally is fine 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.039
 constructed 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.750
