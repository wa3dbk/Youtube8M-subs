00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
the first thing I won't be completely

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.830 
the first thing I won't be completely
honest<00:01:06.340> will<00:01:06.520> be<00:01:06.640> bets<00:01:07.410> I<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:09.880> like<00:01:10.690> the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
honest will be bets I don't like the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.300 
honest will be bets I don't like the
animation<00:01:11.230> off<00:01:11.590> I<00:01:12.120> really<00:01:13.120> don't<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:15.130> I

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
animation off I really don't like I

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.520 
animation off I really don't like I
understand<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.210> sets<00:01:16.480> the<00:01:16.630> mood<00:01:16.810> it's<00:01:17.380> like

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
understand it sets the mood it's like

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.010 
understand it sets the mood it's like
it's<00:01:17.830> for<00:01:18.370> me<00:01:18.400> I<00:01:18.850> think<00:01:19.360> if<00:01:19.510> someone<00:01:19.780> else

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
it's for me I think if someone else

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.750 
it's for me I think if someone else
watch<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.530> they<00:01:20.620> liked<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:20.980> I<00:01:21.040> mean<00:01:21.190> yeah

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
watch it and they liked it I mean yeah

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.430 
watch it and they liked it I mean yeah
if<00:01:21.970> you<00:01:22.090> like<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> animation<00:01:22.720> go<00:01:22.990> watch<00:01:23.200> it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
if you like the animation go watch it

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.460 
if you like the animation go watch it
animate<00:01:24.070> but<00:01:24.310> I<00:01:25.290> don't

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
animate but I don't

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.590 
animate but I don't
it<00:01:26.620> fits<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.130> mood<00:01:27.400> correctly<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.210> fits<00:01:28.480> it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
it fits the mood correctly it fits it

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.070 
it fits the mood correctly it fits it
perfectly<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:29.200> think<00:01:29.620> but<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.280> me<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.880> don't<00:01:31.690> like

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
perfectly I think but to me I don't like

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.790 
perfectly I think but to me I don't like
it<00:01:32.290> at<00:01:32.470> all

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
it at all

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.300 
it at all
I<00:01:32.830> really<00:01:33.370> don't<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.720> just<00:01:35.050> not<00:01:35.170> for<00:01:35.350> me<00:01:35.470> me

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
I really don't it's just not for me me

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.550 
I really don't it's just not for me me
personally<00:01:36.490> what<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.170> animation<00:01:38.170> if<00:01:38.380> the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
personally what is animation if the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.060 
personally what is animation if the
animation<00:01:39.220> was<00:01:39.400> like<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.550> regular<00:01:39.790> animation<00:01:40.540> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
animation was like a regular animation I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.740 
animation was like a regular animation I
would<00:01:42.070> pile<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.940> me<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.180> lot<00:01:43.420> but

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
would pile like this and me a lot but

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.969 
would pile like this and me a lot but
because<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:44.320> animation

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
because the animation

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.350 
because the animation
it<00:01:46.610> brings<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:47.030> down<00:01:47.060> upon<00:01:47.570> adoption<00:01:48.409> so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
it brings it down upon adoption so

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.060 
it brings it down upon adoption so
