don't know I got a and round number two

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.050 
don't know I got a and round number two
I'm<00:02:51.650> gonna<00:02:51.740> try<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> little<00:02:52.310> bit<00:02:52.520> more<00:02:52.700> harder

next room all righty round number two

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.490 
next room all righty round number two
let's<00:02:58.820> do<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.180> I'm<00:02:59.810> gonna<00:02:59.989> try<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.200> little<00:03:00.350> bit

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
let's do this I'm gonna try a little bit

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.229 
let's do this I'm gonna try a little bit
more<00:03:00.560> harder<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.160> see<00:03:01.370> like<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.820> can<00:03:02.090> get<00:03:02.209> a

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
more harder to see like I can get a

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.930 
more harder to see like I can get a
taste<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:02.870> wheels<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.380> drugs<00:03:03.800> all<00:03:04.100> right

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
taste of this wheels and drugs all right

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.220 
taste of this wheels and drugs all right
let's<00:03:05.270> see<00:03:05.390> I'm<00:03:05.510> probably<00:03:05.690> not<00:03:05.840> gonna<00:03:05.989> talk

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
let's see I'm probably not gonna talk

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.180 
let's see I'm probably not gonna talk
too<00:03:06.410> much<00:03:06.680> Oh<00:03:11.950> God

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.550 

Oh<00:03:23.230> Oh<00:03:24.190> all<00:03:26.040> right<00:03:27.069> oh<00:03:27.250> damn<00:03:27.670> sweet<00:03:28.599> oh<00:03:28.870> well

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.220 
Oh Oh all right oh damn sweet oh well
that<00:03:29.680> was<00:03:29.770> not<00:03:30.700> expected<00:03:31.330> but<00:03:31.720> anyways<00:03:32.020> yeah<00:03:32.200> I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
that was not expected but anyways yeah I

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.690 
that was not expected but anyways yeah I
think<00:03:32.349> his<00:03:32.709> trucks<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.190> wheels<00:03:33.280> are<00:03:33.430> actually

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
think his trucks and wheels are actually

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.690 
think his trucks and wheels are actually
pretty<00:03:33.849> good<00:03:34.980> yeah<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.040> think<00:03:36.190> they<00:03:36.430> actually

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
pretty good yeah I think they actually

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.770 
pretty good yeah I think they actually
are<00:03:36.819> pretty<00:03:37.060> good<00:03:37.209> it's<00:03:37.390> probably<00:03:37.510> just

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
are pretty good it's probably just

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.120 
are pretty good it's probably just
lagging<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.500> little<00:03:38.770> bit<00:03:38.890> or<00:03:38.980> my

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
lagging just a little bit or my

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.479 
lagging just a little bit or my
controllers<00:03:39.640> actually<00:03:40.090> on<00:03:41.130> it's<00:03:42.130> on<00:03:42.250> three

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
controllers actually on it's on three

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.580 
controllers actually on it's on three
bars<00:03:42.730> it's<00:03:42.970> not<00:03:43.030> four<00:03:43.330> boards<00:03:43.720> but<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.410> might

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
bars it's not four boards but it might

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.110 
bars it's not four boards but it might
be<00:03:44.709> my<00:03:44.860> control<00:03:45.190> like<00:03:45.370> in<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.610> big<00:03:45.790> way

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
be my control like in a big way

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.910 
be my control like in a big way
it's<00:03:46.450> whatever<00:03:46.900> but<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:47.170> do<00:03:47.260> like<00:03:47.560> his<00:03:47.709> wheels

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
it's whatever but I do like his wheels

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.710 
it's whatever but I do like his wheels
and<00:03:48.130> truck<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.459> it's<00:03:48.610> pretty<00:03:48.700> good<00:03:48.910> we'll<00:03:49.569> see

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
and truck so it's pretty good we'll see
