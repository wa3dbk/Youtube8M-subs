their calories cut the carbohydrates

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.120 
their calories cut the carbohydrates
they<00:00:30.300> get<00:00:30.539> results<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:31.500> life<00:00:31.740> pushes

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
they get results and then life pushes

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.950 
they get results and then life pushes
back<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> regain<00:00:32.910> their<00:00:33.090> way<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.750> rather

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
back in the regain their way so rather

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.780 
back in the regain their way so rather

know kind of experiment so where does it
say<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> food<00:02:26.730> label<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.180> ratio<00:02:27.570> how<00:02:27.750> am<00:02:27.840> I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
say on the food label the ratio how am I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.460 
say on the food label the ratio how am I
get<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:29.300> that's<00:02:30.300> what<00:02:30.510> we're<00:02:30.690> doing<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:31.260> big

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
get it that's what we're doing with big
