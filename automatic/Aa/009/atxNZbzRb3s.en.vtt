then I put the barrel in there and I

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.630 
then I put the barrel in there and I
poured<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.380> bunch<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.650> silicone<00:01:33.130> in<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.460> made<00:01:33.610> a

one<00:01:33.909> part<00:01:34.150> mold<00:01:34.360> cracked<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.380> open<00:01:35.730> cut<00:01:36.730> a<00:01:36.760> slit

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
one part mold cracked it open cut a slit

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.270 
one part mold cracked it open cut a slit
in<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.330> side<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.080> then<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:38.680> cast<00:01:38.920> it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
in the side of it and then I cast it

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.210 
in the side of it and then I cast it
with<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.420> metal<00:01:41.140> rod<00:01:41.290> down<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.710> middle<00:01:41.860> with

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
with a metal rod down the middle with

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.590 
with a metal rod down the middle with
some<00:01:42.990> foam<00:01:43.990> on<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.620> rod<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:45.040> take<00:01:45.250> up<00:01:45.400> space

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
some foam on the rod to take up space

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.000 
some foam on the rod to take up space
this<00:01:46.600> way<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.900> finished<00:01:47.170> piece<00:01:47.380> has<00:01:47.650> a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
this way the finished piece has a

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.980 
this way the finished piece has a
threaded<00:01:48.430> rod<00:01:48.730> coming<00:01:49.180> out<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:49.570> so<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.870> is

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
threaded rod coming out of it so it is

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.870 
threaded rod coming out of it so it is
supported<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.710> can<00:01:50.950> be<00:01:51.070> screwed<00:01:51.490> into<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
supported and can be screwed into the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.580 
supported and can be screwed into the
receiver<00:01:52.480> body<00:01:52.870> of<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:54.250> rifle<00:01:55.050> today<00:01:56.050> and
