00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.839 
hello guys today i got my fifth package
from<00:00:03.750> dealextreme<00:00:04.549> so<00:00:05.549> let's<00:00:06.299> unbox<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:07.849> here

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
from dealextreme so let's unbox it here

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.110 
from dealextreme so let's unbox it here
on<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.269> back<00:00:10.170> taste<00:00:10.590> dolls<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.429> toys<00:00:11.670> and

on the back taste dolls and toys and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.540 
on the back taste dolls and toys and
toys<00:00:13.190> okay<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.519> let's<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
toys okay so let's see what it and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.900 
toys okay so let's see what it and
here's<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:18.830> 4<00:00:19.830> x<00:00:20.010> 4<00:00:20.369> x<00:00:20.400> 4<00:00:20.970> rubik's<00:00:21.689> cube<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> let's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
here's a 4 x 4 x 4 rubik's cube so let's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.790 
here's a 4 x 4 x 4 rubik's cube so let's
open<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.529> this<00:00:25.529> box<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:26.220> quite<00:00:26.609> small<00:00:27.800> index

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
open up this box is quite small index

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.299 
open up this box is quite small index
check<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:31.219> looks<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.399> here's<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.910> manual<00:00:33.780> on

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
check that looks like here's a manual on

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.889 
check that looks like here's a manual on
how<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.550> solve<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:37.489> but<00:00:38.489> Sally<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.600> in

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
how to solve it but Sally it's in

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:50.479 
how to solve it but Sally it's in
Chinese<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:44.040> reduce<00:00:45.530> use<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:48.350> um<00:00:49.489> now

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
Chinese and I can reduce use this um now

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.299 
Chinese and I can reduce use this um now
here's<00:00:51.620> cube<00:00:52.620> itself<00:00:55.670> has<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:56.969> nice<00:00:57.289> colors

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
here's cube itself has some nice colors

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
here's cube itself has some nice colors
and<00:00:59.840> it's<00:01:00.840> quite<00:01:01.230> small<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.899> let's<00:01:03.899> try<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and it's quite small so let's try a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.690 
and it's quite small so let's try a
loose<00:01:04.979> now<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:07.070> smooth<00:01:10.369> right<00:01:11.369> out

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
loose now that really smooth right out

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.880 
loose now that really smooth right out
of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.150> box<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:14.900> slow<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.909> yeah<00:01:18.890> it's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of the box it's really slow so yeah it's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.749 
of the box it's really slow so yeah it's
really<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:21.290> let's<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:22.500> help<00:01:22.770> cuts

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
really good on let's see help cuts

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:37.880 
really good on let's see help cuts
corners<00:01:26.060> pretty<00:01:27.060> nicely<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:31.939> yeah<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:36.560> if<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
corners pretty nicely so yeah and if you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.600 
corners pretty nicely so yeah and if you
did<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.189> size<00:01:38.490> comparison<00:01:39.920> here<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> free

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
did a size comparison here is a free

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.249 
did a size comparison here is a free
this<00:01:41.670> weekend's<00:01:42.299> free<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:44.450> it's<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.960> bit

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
this weekend's free and it's just a bit

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.639 
this weekend's free and it's just a bit
bigger<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.860> x.x<00:01:47.460> packed<00:01:48.170> expected<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.619> be

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
bigger and x.x packed expected it to be

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.410 
bigger and x.x packed expected it to be
a<00:01:49.979> lot<00:01:50.610> bigger<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:53.299> anyways<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.930> good<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
a lot bigger so anyways it's good and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.420 
a lot bigger so anyways it's good and
here's<00:01:57.420> today's<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.860> stood<00:01:59.130> from

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
here's today's that I stood from

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.120 
here's today's that I stood from
dealextreme<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:02.390> yeah<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:04.350> not<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.860> lot

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
dealextreme to and yeah it's not a lot

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.440 
dealextreme to and yeah it's not a lot
bigger<00:02:05.430> than<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.680> so

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
bigger than it so

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.940 
bigger than it so
let's<00:02:09.410> move<00:02:09.739> on<00:02:10.930> well<00:02:11.930> here's<00:02:12.379> a<00:02:12.470> lower<00:02:12.709> one

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
let's move on well here's a lower one

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.770 
let's move on well here's a lower one
for<00:02:13.400> my<00:02:13.550> friend<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.840> need<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.590> open<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.780> and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
for my friend so I need to open this and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.910 
for my friend so I need to open this and
the<00:02:18.110> last<00:02:18.140> thing<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:19.540> I'm<00:02:20.540> not<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:21.110> Rubik's<00:02:21.650> Cube

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
the last thing is I'm not a Rubik's Cube

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.520 
the last thing is I'm not a Rubik's Cube
it's<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.580> mirror<00:02:23.090> block<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:27.110> looks<00:02:27.290> pretty

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
it's a mirror block and it looks pretty

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.440 
it's a mirror block and it looks pretty
nice<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.980> moves<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:32.239> good<00:02:34.450> please

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
nice and you moves really good please

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
nice and you moves really good please
move<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.980> thing<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.250> how<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.910> works<00:02:44.470> that

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
move so the thing is how it works that

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.059 
move so the thing is how it works that
the<00:02:46.180> every<00:02:47.180> QB<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.290> different<00:02:48.920> size<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:51.769> a

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
the every QB is different size so it's a

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.000 
the every QB is different size so it's a
bit<00:02:52.459> harder<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.030> solve<00:02:54.340> no<00:02:55.340> than<00:02:56.500> normal<00:02:57.500> three

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
bit harder to solve no than normal three

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.089 
bit harder to solve no than normal three
times<00:02:58.190> for<00:02:58.430> hands-free<00:02:58.760> Rubik's<00:02:59.329> Cube

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
times for hands-free Rubik's Cube

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.559 
times for hands-free Rubik's Cube
because<00:03:01.099> that<00:03:01.849> here<00:03:02.450> are<00:03:02.599> no<00:03:02.840> colors<00:03:03.260> but<00:03:03.650> just

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
because that here are no colors but just

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:15.370 
because that here are no colors but just
the<00:03:05.569> how<00:03:06.110> big<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.880> pace<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:11.799> if<00:03:13.420> turn<00:03:14.420> oh<00:03:14.810> it

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
the how big the pace is so if turn oh it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.300 
the how big the pace is so if turn oh it
almost<00:03:15.650> fell<00:03:16.160> apart<00:03:17.440> haha<00:03:20.769> yeah<00:03:21.769> it's<00:03:22.069> a

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
almost fell apart haha yeah it's a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.090 
almost fell apart haha yeah it's a
floppy<00:03:26.829> they<00:03:27.829> are<00:03:28.040> kind<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.519> floppy<00:03:30.100> int

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
floppy they are kind of floppy int

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:40.440 
floppy they are kind of floppy int
expect<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:37.420> now<00:03:38.420> we'll<00:03:38.660> see<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:38.930> core

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
expect that now we'll see the core

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.780 
expect that now we'll see the core
that's<00:03:41.450> pretty<00:03:41.840> weird<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:43.900> yeah<00:03:45.400> that's<00:03:46.400> it

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
that's pretty weird so yeah that's it

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.949 
that's pretty weird so yeah that's it
