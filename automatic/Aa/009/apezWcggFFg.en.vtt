00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.940
 Hello, how are you doing? 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.400
 guys and girls from youtube we see how 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.009
 is with this new video tutorial in the 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.259
 that I'm going to teach you how to get on 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.029
 performance of your pc since I made a 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.070
 video of lopd and fine and they told me many 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.880
 that it did not work for them that they had a lot 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.840
 side on the servers that is playing 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.600
 in a world or just a player and I was going 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.030
 quite the one with all the animations or 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.640
 yes all the animations of the game and 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.390
 Well, I 'm good for how to improve the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.600
 myth of your pc to play or to open 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.150
 installers of the defect are not for 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.630
 example minecraft any game can 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.540
 be hello and so on and so good 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.579
 first step would be to start or in the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.220
 start sign and put on panel 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.110
 control and then in programs that is not 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.630
 in being in uninstalling a program but 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.150
 in programs and here in java they click 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.150
 a single click nothing else works 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.640
 and they go to the java tab up here 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.070
 and they show him and they put this to him that I 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.660
 I have depending on your computers the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.900
 mine is 4 is a laptop is not so 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.730
 powerful but it is 4 and so good if 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.110
 they have a bigger computer because they can 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.030
 put 4 less you can put 1 gb and 500 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.910
 etcetera not the fact that they put you 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.150
 something here she goes that is an installer 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.640
 or an executer that by default does not 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.890
 brings nothing and well then it would take 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.810
 a lot if you do not put anything and that is one 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.210
 of the mistakes that people do not usually 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.979
 put as they do not know or have or do not 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.540
 have this knowledge of this 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.369
 application is worth then we give in 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.600
 apply as they have it as I do 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.580
 I have and we accept and he is already 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.300
 would have more memory to run it with 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.010
 our utility 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.480
 the second step would be to put again 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.180
 home and here on the team tab 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.500
 and here at the top where 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.500
 says system properties 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.580
 we go in advanced configuration of 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.490
 system here 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.200
 on the left the configuration our 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.120
 in the system and then here we do not have 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760
 to open any tab is only 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.620
 Advanced options in configuration and 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.200
 here they are going to put you in 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.600
 customize and they will disable all and 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.930
 then they're going to put him here to apply me 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.620
 I do not do it because when I deactivate everything 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.630
 this would tell me that I can not win if I do not 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.910
 I can record since you can install already 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.220
 all animations and so on this is 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.680
 so that the executed ones that are 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.670
 running when you open a computer 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.520
 turn it off then turn off be it 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.070
 off and all the memory and everything is 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.910
 in the game ong main counter that 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.040
 is running at the moment you 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.320
 you open a game and so on and not put 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.530
 happened or you deactivate everything and to 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.790
 re-activate it again so it does 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.650
 the same is true in the beginning as a team and here 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.510
 in system properties in 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.599
 Advanced configuration 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.060
 and configuration and here then they return it 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.010
 to put or just leave you here in 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.170
 where it says let windows leave you the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.890
 appropriate configuration for the equipment and 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.400
 this is this you do not have to activate 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.510
 and this is one that by default appears 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.909
 deactivated if you want it 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.129
 deactivate it can activate it but 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.879
 because many computers have it that way 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:48.659
 by default because it is an application that 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.430
 Well, it's not so, it's not quite used and 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.220
 I do not like what it does 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:59.290
 then that would be one in the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:03.069
 second and the third would be to go to 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.349
 here on the desktop and click 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.270
 secondary or right click as they call it 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.750
 and they put you in customize 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.050
 and where it says below basic issues and 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.030
 high contrast put you in black high 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.860
 contrast you can put in these 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.930
 but I like this one because in 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.450
 this looks how transparent this is what 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.730
 that gives the this is all transparent 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.940
 from each window is what gives you the 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.070
 defect and then yes that in 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.700
 when you download this, you will see a 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.850
 a difference of the installer game 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.009
 the executer that you are executing in 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.169
 the moment then 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.300
 a big difference the truth to me 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.189
 surprised when I did this because I 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.199
 I started to investigate about the java and so on 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.990
 because I said no, there must be 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.869
 another other executer although it works 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.779
 better than it already goes and well then this would be 

00:04:54.869 --> 00:05:00.029
 everything is put here in black high in 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:03.449
 black in high contrast I do not put 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.520
 because as I say I'm doing well like this when 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.559
 I'm recording when I'm playing if 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.680
 I usually put this because in some 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:15.749
 servers that have more than one thousand 2000 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.870
 players playing because the truth is going 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:23.639
 super guided I do not know how people who 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:26.069
 record in those cerves and I would then tax 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.439
 there and I would go more or less as they give 50 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.830
 fps recording but I would not like anything to 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.350
 watch a video like this everything has guided 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.310
 and well, this would be everything they put 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.840
 here and they are going to say wait and they are 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.640
 is going to change this in black and for 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.200
 re -activate it simple again 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.640
 they put it back or to activate it 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.450
 is to deactivate it they put it back in 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.070
 customize and they will go down and in black 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.500
 high contrast no longer if you do not give in 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.630
 anybody that you corner on topics to 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.230
 it in whatever you have 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:00.200
 executed or that you like it 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:04.440
 he gives no and the design would be changed 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.470
 of what would be the desktop of the pc 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.500
 and well, this would be all the fourth 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.080
 the fourth would be to open the flame the main 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.960
 craft I'm sorry the truth is I do not 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.790
 I do because then I'm doing super well and 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.530
 I do not want to mess it up so much 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.750
 minecraft give so much memory to 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.790
 minecraft that would be another option in 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.010
 I told him where and who will 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:30.660
 edit profile and here where it says 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.940
 give arguments here and here can you 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.740
 upload the memory if you have a 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.920
 very powerful computer because they can give you 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.290
 up to 2 to 4 gb because they have a 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.730
 order a computer that exceeds the limit 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.430
 of the gigabytes that are putting you 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.340
 here it's worth the minecraft by default it's going 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.800
 with a gigabyte nothing more and then the 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.780
 truth is very good since in minecraft 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.400
 by default it does not have what 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.260
 uses everything arrived and when it is 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.990
 playing when you're playing and so on 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.340
 and well, it's going very well for me, 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.800
 Minecraft 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.470
 and well, those would be the tips when 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.139
 do this what I told you they are going to see a 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.310
 great difference of the installer that are 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.740
 running at the time of playing 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:17.840
 and as you see here, it's going really well or 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.580
 be nothing of the and well then this would be 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.260
 everything and see you in the next 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:28.340
 chapter I do not know about the yale or any 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:32.770
 that chapter that goes up and then it would be good 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.770
 everything and see you in the other
