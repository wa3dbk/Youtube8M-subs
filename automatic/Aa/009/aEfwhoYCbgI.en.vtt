how much do you think this car owes you
hmm<00:02:32.820> i'd<00:02:33.540> say<00:02:33.780> probably<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.920> region<00:02:35.280> of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
hmm i'd say probably in the region of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.000 
hmm i'd say probably in the region of
100<00:02:35.730> grand<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.350> hundred<00:02:37.350> thousand<00:02:37.710> pounds<00:02:37.920> is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
100 grand a hundred thousand pounds is

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.000 
100 grand a hundred thousand pounds is
quite<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> lot<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.460> money<00:02:39.350> yes<00:02:40.350> i<00:02:40.560> will<00:02:40.620> appear

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
quite a lot of money yes i will appear

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.650 
quite a lot of money yes i will appear
really<00:02:41.190> years<00:02:41.490> but<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:41.910> pretty<00:02:42.030> good<00:02:42.300> value

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
really years but it's pretty good value

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.940 
really years but it's pretty good value
when<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.170> think<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.800> world's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
when it you think it is the world's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.370 
when it you think it is the world's

eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.600 
eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds
that<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.170> pretty<00:02:52.470> good<00:02:52.709> value<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.250> quite<00:02:53.580> a

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
that is pretty good value it is quite a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.850 
that is pretty good value it is quite a
bit<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:54.150> an<00:02:54.510> acceleration<00:02:55.080> stakes<00:02:55.590> the

bit in an acceleration stakes the
bugatti<00:02:56.220> veyron<00:02:56.490> would<00:02:56.850> be<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.720> long<00:02:58.050> long

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260

way<00:02:58.440> back<00:02:58.700> toast<00:02:59.700> toast<00:03:00.240> but<00:03:00.690> i<00:03:00.840> wouldn't<00:03:01.110> swap

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
way back toast toast but i wouldn't swap

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.810 
way back toast toast but i wouldn't swap
this<00:03:01.440> for<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.680> beer<00:03:01.860> gut<00:03:01.980> avarom<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:02.670> for

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
this for a beer gut avarom that's for

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.150 
this for a beer gut avarom that's for
sure<00:03:03.200> probably<00:03:04.200> because<00:03:04.620> he<00:03:04.709> couldn't<00:03:04.950> do

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
sure probably because he couldn't do

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.840 
sure probably because he couldn't do
this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.690 

so<00:03:13.850> what<00:03:14.000> makes<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:14.480> fast<00:03:15.430> well<00:03:16.430> a

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
so what makes it so fast well a

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.460 
so what makes it so fast well a
beautifully<00:03:17.420> crafted<00:03:17.630> engine<00:03:18.140> with<00:03:18.290> two

beautifully crafted engine with two
enormous<00:03:18.860> turbo<00:03:19.550> certainly<00:03:20.090> helped<00:03:20.330> but<00:03:21.080> this

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
enormous turbo certainly helped but this

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.870 
enormous turbo certainly helped but this
isn't<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:21.560> lots<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.040> fast<00:03:22.340> bits<00:03:22.580> lung

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
isn't just lots of fast bits lung

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.030 
isn't just lots of fast bits lung
together<00:03:23.270> it's<00:03:23.600> nine<00:03:23.990> point<00:03:24.320> three<00:03:24.410> liters<00:03:25.010> of

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
together it's nine point three liters of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.550 
together it's nine point three liters of
perfectly<00:03:25.640> tuned<00:03:25.970> v8<00:03:26.330> just<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.990> millimeter<00:03:27.230> of

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
perfectly tuned v8 just a millimeter of

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.990 
perfectly tuned v8 just a millimeter of
throttle<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.070> enough<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.400> break<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.580> speed

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
throttle is enough to break the speed

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.640 
throttle is enough to break the speed
limit<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.630> probably<00:03:29.870> find<00:03:30.170> it's<00:03:30.350> not<00:03:30.410> that

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
limit you probably find it's not that

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.790 
limit you probably find it's not that
easy<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:30.980> gain<00:03:31.220> yeah<00:03:32.210> you're<00:03:32.330> telling<00:03:32.660> me

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
easy to gain yeah you're telling me

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:52.160 
easy to gain yeah you're telling me
luxury<00:03:33.800> luxury<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.370> not<00:03:34.550> it's<00:03:34.700> fine<00:03:35.180> point<00:03:35.480> no

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.020 

feels<00:03:52.319> very<00:03:52.650> wrong<00:03:52.950> indeed<00:03:54.200> but<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.319> like<00:03:55.530> it

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.470 

how<00:03:58.330> tempted<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.930> here<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.350> just<00:03:59.500> give<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.830> a<00:04:00.480> bit

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
how tempted I here to just give it a bit

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.910 
how tempted I here to just give it a bit
of<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.660> squirt<00:04:01.990> all<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.560> time<00:04:02.800> all<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.220> time

fuel<00:04:24.930> stops<00:04:25.290> are<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.590> regular<00:04:26.190> thing<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:28.160> how

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
fuel stops are a regular thing so how

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.710
