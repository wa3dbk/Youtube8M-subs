00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.930
 we are at the cannes salon aboard yours 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.210
 up to 16 a very special boat 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.039
 a boat that could be misleading 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.369
 to see it from the outside might seem like one 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 classic boat a boat that recalls the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.720
 vintage boats but then look at it well 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 getting closer we realize that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.870
 instead an extremely modern boat 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.800
 a boat that plays on this union between 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 between the classic and suggested by the great 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.960
 mahogany and modern surface instead 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.940
 suggested by the wheelhouses in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.449
 toga carbon painted in gray 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.159
 and a whole series of options 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.500
 a whole range of equipment that 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.409
 instead they are from modern boat and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.299
 especially the very fast boat is one 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.930
 berry and how the yard defines it is 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:09.840
 a day cruiser a boat for use 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.210
 daily for small cruises e 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.549
 serenely we see that he has a cockpit 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.039
 very large with all this surface 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.799
 back here that becomes with the pillows 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:23.670
 a large sundeck a boat with a 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.109
 carbon mast with all the rigging 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.509
 in rod with an ati bulb or one 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.909
 boat is made for racing made for 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.299
 have fun and this is the ultimate goal of 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.399
 torino 16 a boat to be used for or 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.249
 for the daily exit or for 2 3 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.469
 cruise days but still cross 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.960
 a boat to go and just have fun 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.850
 how do you see the helmsman at all 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.530
 the equipment at hand for which 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.600
 it is a boat that can carry can 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.990
 check by yourself even without a real one 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.130
 and own crew and lettuce is 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.409
 characterized by these bands of 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.110
 mahogany that mate with gray 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.320
 of the central part of the escape 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.600
 and the beautiful tech bridge at the bow 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.060
 we find a great champion of the anchor 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.380
 like a compass-folded anchor that 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.510
 the lid comes out hydraulically 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.670
 cavone is designed in such a way that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.370
 can be closed by leaving open 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.180
 only a bow part where 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.970
 then the anchor will also come out internally 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.430
 a very special boat first of all 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.440
 it is a caston boat for which no 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.300
 we have one like the other when yes 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.030
 go to the construction site, decide with the construction site 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.420
 with the designer what kind of boat is it 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.190
 want you can intervene on the volumes 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.630
 on the finishes on anything 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.430
 want until you can do the 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:51.370
 custom boat exactly like one 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.830
 adhesion we see the space of the bathroom 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.640
 of the owner's bathroom that is not that 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.640
 classic and a passing bathroom that 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.950
 through this bulkhead that opens and 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.610
 it multiplies multiply 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.980
 in the space dedicated to the shower while 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.739
 instead the space of the slab and will remain 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.269
 a traditional space that I can 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.129
 use at any time also in 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.470
 also during navigation 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.500
 we also see the aft cabins are 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.130
 these have very large ones 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.860
 very special cabinets finishes 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.440
 of the boat are very original as for 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.189
 example this large sink that is one 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.189
 what absolutely in 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.189
 unusual
