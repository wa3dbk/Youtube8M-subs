00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.280
 hello to you all seriously and in general I 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.170
 I want to do a review on my assembly 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.260
 minecraft 1 6 4 versions with mods with 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.750
 global module just extra 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.300
 mods any interesting full but just 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.070
 we start with the mod it morph of course here 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.590
 can turn into different dead 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.090
 you animal mobs and so on that is 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.919
 for example from his killed pig then you 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.470
 where can you turn as i see 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.989
 for example you killed them rita can too 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.059
 turn into him but from him 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 I still have a standard skin with him 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.750
 turn turning takes 4 total 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 only seconds to 4 seconds in general, then 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.460
 we also got rid of iron chest 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.219
 We consider it as a separate and events 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.019
 multipatch from to a huge chest here 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.269
 actually i'm using three chests 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.210
 multipatch is added with but they are the same 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.120
 interesting and here is a huge chest for 5 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.489
 pages five whole pages 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.500
 it's heavy enough to craft but 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.440
 while I am peaceful in the chest, I will regret the thought 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.870
 I think there are 5 or 4 diamonds and four 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.820
 ordinary chest thought up for such 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.090
 huge hazelnuts it's not so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 a lot but if for example compare from 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.790
 crystal chest is the best on 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.700
 arm6 is more difficult to craft 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.710
 much more expensive than the mod also added 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 on big mac that's big dad back pack 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.690
 as if on a big chest curb place 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.600
 gives extra 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.890
 inventory as well as a small chest 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.850
 ipad small chest 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:44.000
 A little chest and there is such a mod on 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.310
 it is necessary on purpose I will say there is a mod very 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.110
 interesting mod on light bulbs such here 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.030
 light bulbs in as you see here they stand they 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.420
 pretty pretty light well a 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.900
 Here are simple lamps, that is, for example, here 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.460
 aqua lamp you need a bucket of water and and 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.920
 around it is an iron grid 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.110
 well and identical to the same glory 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.830
 for example luck in a bucket of lava and also 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.530
 iron bars here and doing here 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.070
 fashion lamps fucking just divine 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.990
 rpg a lot and what divine adds 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.040
 rpg also add awesome 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.160
 picks that is kirkina very let 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.640
 getting 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.850
 as fast than the example of Creative 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.400
 my thigh to the pick she is so she 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.750
 this earth is bathing dripping so keep 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.520
 posts than diamond spade 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.950
 write what she will do with comments 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.940
 just it is not eggs this is unreal 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.040
 cool here as well added mod on twilight 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.860
 forest here it is actually here 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.709
 separate blocks one trees also have 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.910
 armor on the chest of the ancients you always give 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.280
 throw individual shoes 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.160
 and also my favorite mod of course 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.080
 kinder end how could he have passed by 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.300
 my favorite mod that can allow 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.960
 craft separately every time 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.970
 all sorts of tools there are picks swords of all 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.960
 full of fuck just look how much 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.150
 kerak balls 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.790
 Here is this plate this war plates 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.240
 have them can also be killed and do not look 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.520
 to go nuts how many moto pools it just isn't 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.650
 Immediately Sufi swords what well it seems 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.740
 us fieschi swords of course beat in 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.760
 oblivion also has full maker mod 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.990
 we also added magnetization here 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.120
 I feel like I have put on here 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.750
 here she is an example of his throw that with 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.940
 big backpack 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.800
 he would lure me magnets since 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.260
 until going back to inventory 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.150
 In general, it throws it back and everything 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.780
 and also added a mod on obsidian so in 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.000
 In general, here is also a very interesting chamotte 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.940
 here we have for example all dance world cup 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.860
 Sinyavsky sword drank usually diamond sword on 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.070
 kill only 7 top 10 damage 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.710
 robots are quite a good advantage 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.720
 here and so here is obsidian armor she 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.690
 It is also very good here generally their villas 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.190
 and craft it looks like 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.260
 for example a helmet there and so on so on 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.209
 so forth well, put up what he needs 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.239
 making a weapon of course will be much 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.980
 easier to craft than all this is now also 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.639
 eat obsidian shard obsidian block 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.259
 natural obsidian sticks 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.169
 all standard tool until all 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.449
 I added to the record at different 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.430
 dress fpg monsters and all sorts of 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.669
 various here various velu straightened 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.379
 glass and loop so on so on 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.620
 various blocks were also added later 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:36.810
 here with the help of mods legs also we are not 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.389
 could get past the food the food the food is very 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.039
 important minecraft added very mod no 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.770
 more food or something like that 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.830
 does not remember exactly here potions 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.219
 some luncheon test throne too 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.650
 item and also jackets we added all 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:56.310
 the same thing everyone enchanted than 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.330
 added for char well of course 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.189
 separate morphs are also advantages there 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.069
 certain adds this mod morph 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.560
 which you say goodbye 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.050
 you can even crawl jump with 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.050
 using examples and ifrit it can also 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.789
 added added brand of coils 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.759
 finally plus here for example take the sword 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.129
 and yes here they are what we waste 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.080
 for example you want to definitely steal 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.389
 Finally and black do not know what kind of protection 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.310
 just randomly can drag on that 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.439
 anything standard glasses 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.419
 spells in as well if you want 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.629
 definitely why why go here 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:36.599
 Stsevola could for example start again 128 for 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:39.360
 charlton so it is expensive and a conspiracy of fire 2 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.740
 stand along with the guests sharpness 5 to 54 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.020
 level yes and so on so on so on 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.089
 further strength is usually repeated 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.280
 about the highest for tea 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:50.850
 now we will check that yes how 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.230
 and here is the return of 2 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:58.370
 but it's just an awesome sword 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:03.030
 Well, in general, then I think everything is up to 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.620
 separate as craft and separate review 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.110
 mods I will not on this build 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.240
 that she's a huge hell also added 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.520
 battle towers just battle towers of 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.530
 also very useful thing is like this 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.180
 for example upstairs the boss is sitting and inside you 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.790
 must pass all T-shirts also 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.970
 and the dishes go up and 8 at the most important 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.700
 there will be a chest with a deadly noise 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.980
 just as loot and inside too, have 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.800
 little chests there will be loot too 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.270
 comforter not so let's say well 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.300
 also added the generation of the world 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.480
 the extra you down is called here 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.419
 not down yes just beautiful money world 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.350
 generates the world from the same obs absolutely 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:46.020
 volume in general, here with the same absolutely 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.690
 volumes and just nothing is added 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.910
 nicotine killed on just more opinion 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:55.590
 everything is smooth, smooth and beautiful 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.300
 looks like new mountains just like you and 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.310
 You were a service in general, that's all I wanted 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.070
 All that while gold showed in general 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.660
 link to the assembly will be in the description if 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.000
 you like this build like 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.190
 write comments subscribe to my
