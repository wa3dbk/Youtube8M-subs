00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.410
 Sergey Mikhailov 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.839
 and our permanent video heading 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 dedicated to the review of games and programs for 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.670
 windows phone platform runway 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.160
 The first application for today will be 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.119
 creation from microsoft called 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.760
 happy leps 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.039
 if someone else did not guess the name 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.189
 what kind of beast we are reporting this 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.660
 program to create timelapse video 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 it is possible to use 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 pre-prepared rollers as well 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 video recording straight from the interface 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.840
 programs are present acceleration in 24 16 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.270
 and 32 times in microsoft state that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.030
 This program not only accelerates your 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.320
 movie but in case of need 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.989
 stabilizes his link for example 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.539
 the video I accelerated you find in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.239
 the description of this video if you always 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.920
 lacked such a tool 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.369
 Your camera functionality is required 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.020
 pay attention to this application 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.600
 go to the games the first one on 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.970
 today belongs to the genre of turrets and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.280
 bears the title of defense for mind 2 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.530
 the essence of the game is no different from 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 analogs built towers along the road by 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.630
 which your potential run 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.540
 the victims we throw them make money and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.450
 again we build a tower to improve your battle 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.979
 Arsenal is understandably possible and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.259
 air support 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.930
 why this game got into today 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.180
 a selection of everything is just she simply nothing 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.549
 no worse than analogs and also has 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.380
 pretty good object models 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.140
 contrasting on the background 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.720
 cartoon and sloppy drawn solutions 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.119
 from other studios next play on 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.189
 today will stick surgeon plus you 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.680
 play for the man who 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.710
 moves on poles of different widths 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.960
 which rise above the abyss your 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.840
 the task of building ferries for him 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.329
 here the main thing is not to overdo it with a long and 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.000
 niche matitsa with her for our character 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.110
 fall down is also desirable to fall 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.930
 the end of the conditional bridge in the middle of the support 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.300
 it will be you plus one to karma in the same 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.400
 If you want to finally 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.800
 spoil your nerves you can fight 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.500
 because of conditional cherries which 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.280
 located right under your crossings 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.590
 imho 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.440
 the game was not very boring and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.320
 unusual so it definitely deserves on 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.640
 existence last game for today 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.100
 will crossy road 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.770
 you play for the chicken to whom it 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.560
 life seemed too boring and he 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.260
 decided to walk across the freeway 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.959
 your task is extremely simple to pass as 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.720
 possible further and survive I am not 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.790
 a fan of pixel-based graphics games 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.700
 but it even hooked me 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.100
 I recommend friends if you know 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.120
