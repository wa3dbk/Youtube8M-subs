00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello to all is the phenomenon 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.799
 today I propose a recipe 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.220
 very easy and quick to prepare 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.020
 especially for children 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.150
 here I am stale bread I 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:20.640
 attacked I did yes it's my son there 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.460
 who wants to cook with you 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.820
 a reform is so I said there I 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.070
 had about a baguette 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.710
 stale 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.680
 so I just like I was there that I have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.540
 dipped in very simple water then 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.160
 I will add four portions of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.120
 cheese 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.320
 Here cheese or Laughing Cow 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.750
 then laughed as you want it I'll 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 is but not too much because the bread the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.800
 cheese is already salty but I like 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.470
 I like to put just a small 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.520
 pinch then some black pepper just a 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.350
 little bit 2nd and grated cheese 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.810

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.840
 minutes and after we will come to fry them 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.590
