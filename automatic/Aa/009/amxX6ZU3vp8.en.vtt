00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.140
 I needed everyone the series of several years 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 3 billion 32 years 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.909
 lm swimming and martial arts and caring about his health 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.379
 and the desserts that we propose to allow us to refuel 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:16.619
 antioxidants 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.330
 in other words we will come 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.560
 - avi and healthy 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 one by one the virtues of the track 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.800
 today the feminine one proposes its recipe of 30 balls with the pears track 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.350
 etc. and then nyon a little certainty understand our nutrition expert 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.719
 even if he had paid it is what we have to do 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.659
 hundred for his country and peace he was not bad 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.050
 points 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.080
 I bring my grain of salt in the recipe of these lines forever 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.560
 slightly do 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.830
 roasted and pistachios and pine nuts beforehand you put a 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.650
 a little stab to let go 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.030
 in parallel with 110 32 pears 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.340
 so know that 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.350
 the pear 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.360
 free in general more walls than natural sugar so it avoids you 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 to add that is not bad 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.940
 once you have been more shitting your points especially wanted to keep the cage 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.070
 Montreal will we do 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.270
 the hairs are left 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.230
 in this case, it is once you are in the year you can take 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.140
 other types of powers 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.950
 it is worth recalling for example 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.520
 we made a caramel caramel sans-zo pays tiers 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.620
 you listen to the gas 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.150
 without your stove 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.230
 we will try to do a little bit 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.140
 help yourself health with the hand it's starting to heat up you're going to put 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.140
 our brown sugar 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.760
 white it works too 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.850
 you will see family with children you have to watch a little bit 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.770
 then you see your caramel melted 5 the fact of not putting any 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.160
 the water was really asking me in front of your caramel otherwise you can do everything in 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.890
 adding a little water 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 you have been in power 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.430
 m 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.790
 3 weiss appeal 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.790
 c 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.739
 it is much less strong 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.809
 in fact in earlier 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.809
 everything mixes well in the pan 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.179
 you resume 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.879
 pistachios and roasted pine nuts 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.659
 that you are going to put on a paper towel because deleterious 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.109
 roasted can certainly give them taste 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.109
 but in addition to removing the excess sheets 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.089
 we filed 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.389
 pears 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.389
 it was necessary to make a gap 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.539
 and we will add 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.199
 Above 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.199
 but who has no problem 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.329
 and at the last moment before serving to 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.709
 you can deliver 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.449
 a little sugar over 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.789
 finish on a sweet note 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.789
 so obviously you have not abuse before 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.339
 I advise you to focus on desserts that use 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.539
 this recipe proposed by these presenter links a double benefit that 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.289
 of associating the low side points and the dried fruits of the other with the pine nuts 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:26.689
 of pine and pistachios both contain antioxidants that have 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.379
 delaying cellular aging 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.769
 and then everyone left the pistachios contain in addition to 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.769
 unsaturated lipids that are good graces 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.180
 allow to contribute to a good balance a few emotional states 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.849
 you will be able to slim down cleverly by strengthening your natural defenses 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.699
 and boosting your brain 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:53.229
 that's all right and will ultimately guarantee you keep your motivation of 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:57.569
 to lose weight to take pleasure do us good I take advantage of 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.429
 the opportunity to make a little wink the treasure hunt in every 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:03.669
 scene also the light Montpellier and nights that has a small idea 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.440
 no longer use the power of a woman and a water 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.689
 you have filed 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.419
 to can 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.549
 peelings more precisely this is like this 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.279
 like that we do not throw anything 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.969
 plus it's a look you can redo on other recipes on a 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.959
 tatin of pears even a guinea fowl not 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.480
 the apple version 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.050
 and quite feasible 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.680
 you added 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.889
 a vanilla pod split in half 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.129
 just like this 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.460
 we are well 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.569
 all the interior 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.910
 then you'll leave compote rather caramelize the peelings of 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.020
 power for about ten minutes then you mixed 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.669
 and you'll add a little bit of credibility 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.750
 I think it's a 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.750
 a good idea proposed by karin to do 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.020
 lightened in quotation marks 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.020
 provided as for the rest do not abuse 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.769
 besides that since their scientific studies that show a 

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:01.520
 close correlation 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.530
 between the quality of our food and pleasure 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.050
 hat that is in the emotional I think it's a past actually 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.039
 important because we do 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.159
 if we are in a year 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.959
 in the right emotional balance we will be able - 6 hours and keep them 

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:20.069
 our soul so this moment in the duration 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:24.199
 if we start to get into his ranks a state of frustration obviously that 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.449
 our motivation 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.580
 the sealed sim and sooner or later he said to have a pendulum back and the 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.800
 crack people 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.870
 and that's damaging so I'm in favor of being allowed 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.569
 in quotation marks away but I still have that I do not like too much alone 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.429
 mill the goal and eat better to feel better in order to boost 

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:46.020
 your good mood and make you happy 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.370
 in a word 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.550
 this is the cup once you have mixed with a little cream you can 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.389
 buy 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.210
 otherwise your Basel skull took him to a small town next door 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.580
 this recipe his father finds on the website of viva el papa as 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.080
 I always said that we 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.649
 the safest series
