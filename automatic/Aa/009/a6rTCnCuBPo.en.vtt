to expand it you just bring this one

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.400 
to expand it you just bring this one
around<00:04:21.560> now<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.830> expanded<00:04:24.080> obviously<00:04:25.080> fill

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
around now it is expanded obviously fill

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.750 
around now it is expanded obviously fill
up<00:04:25.530> with<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.680> lot<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.920> stuff<00:04:26.100> in<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:27.620> however

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
up with a lot of stuff in it however

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.730 
up with a lot of stuff in it however
very<00:04:29.760> pleased<00:04:30.030> with<00:04:30.240> them

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
very pleased with them

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.690 
very pleased with them
these<00:04:31.740> are<00:04:32.130> reflective<00:04:33.090> details<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:35.430> there

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
these are reflective details on there

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.790 
these are reflective details on there
and<00:04:35.910> on<00:04:36.090> there<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.930> helps<00:04:37.140> with<00:04:37.260> visibility

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
and on there so it helps with visibility

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.659 
and on there so it helps with visibility
a<00:04:37.830> little<00:04:38.040> bit<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.800> as<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:41.070> showed<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.340> they're

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
a little bit and as I showed you they're

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:42.820 
a little bit and as I showed you they're
very<00:04:41.820> easy<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.330> get<00:04:42.450> on<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.570> off<00:04:42.750> now

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
very easy to get on and off now

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.120 
very easy to get on and off now
installing<00:04:43.830> them<00:04:44.270> took<00:04:45.270> me<00:04:45.390> about<00:04:45.570> an<00:04:45.690> hour

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
installing them took me about an hour

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.290 
installing them took me about an hour
slowly<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.370> methodically<00:04:47.490> following<00:04:48.210> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
slowly and methodically following the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.480 
slowly and methodically following the
instructions<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:48.990> basically<00:04:49.350> take<00:04:50.340> the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
instructions you basically take the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.270 
instructions you basically take the
footpegs<00:04:50.910> off<00:04:51.290> replace<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.470> bolts<00:04:52.770> with

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
footpegs off replace the bolts with

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.030 
footpegs off replace the bolts with
these<00:04:53.430> bolts<00:04:54.110> put<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.200> foot<00:04:55.380> pegs<00:04:55.650> back<00:04:55.830> on

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
these bolts put the foot pegs back on

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.290 
these bolts put the foot pegs back on
with<00:04:56.220> this<00:04:57.140> mechanism<00:04:58.140> there<00:04:58.320> which<00:04:58.530> locks<00:04:58.800> on

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
with this mechanism there which locks on

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.050 
with this mechanism there which locks on
as<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.540> showed<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.370> assembling<00:05:02.850> is<00:05:02.940> you

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
as I showed you so the assembling is you

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.700 
as I showed you so the assembling is you
have<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.300> assemble<00:05:03.540> this<00:05:03.840> little<00:05:04.140> bit<00:05:04.290> and<00:05:04.560> you

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
have to assemble this little bit and you

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.050 
have to assemble this little bit and you
have<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.950> then<00:05:05.330> tick<00:05:06.330> off<00:05:07.040> both<00:05:08.040> side<00:05:08.280> pegs<00:05:08.610> put

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
have to then tick off both side pegs put

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.600 
have to then tick off both side pegs put
them<00:05:09.150> back<00:05:09.240> over<00:05:09.419> these<00:05:09.630> longer<00:05:10.260> bolts<00:05:10.610> make

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
them back over these longer bolts make

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.710 
them back over these longer bolts make
sure<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:11.880> have<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.030> little<00:05:12.150> bit<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.479> lock

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
sure you have a little bit of that lock

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.620 
sure you have a little bit of that lock
tight<00:05:12.960> stuff<00:05:13.260> to<00:05:13.440> finish<00:05:14.040> them<00:05:14.160> off<00:05:14.310> with<00:05:14.630> but

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
tight stuff to finish them off with but

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.969 
tight stuff to finish them off with but
as<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.870> said<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.080> took<00:05:16.200> me<00:05:16.320> an<00:05:16.410> hour<00:05:16.500> doing<00:05:16.830> it

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
as I said it took me an hour doing it

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.040 
as I said it took me an hour doing it
slowly<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.400> methodically<00:05:17.690> I'm<00:05:18.690> sure<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:18.960> can

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
slowly and methodically I'm sure it can

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.600 
slowly and methodically I'm sure it can
be<00:05:19.080> done<00:05:19.140> faster<00:05:19.680> but<00:05:19.800> I<00:05:19.830> would<00:05:20.250> say<00:05:20.340> that's<00:05:20.490> a

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
be done faster but I would say that's a

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.810 
be done faster but I would say that's a
good<00:05:20.729> average<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:23.100> I<00:05:23.190> think<00:05:23.400> they<00:05:23.460> look<00:05:23.580> great

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
good average and I think they look great

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.850 
good average and I think they look great
too<00:05:25.370> now<00:05:26.370> each<00:05:26.580> of<00:05:26.610> these<00:05:26.850> bags<00:05:27.830> they<00:05:28.830> are

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
too now each of these bags they are

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.770 
too now each of these bags they are
water-resistant<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:29.970> imagine<00:05:30.510> they're<00:05:30.630> not

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
water-resistant I imagine they're not

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.830 
water-resistant I imagine they're not
watertight<00:05:31.669> as<00:05:32.669> in<00:05:32.910> if<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.270> ride<00:05:33.450> for<00:05:33.479> hours

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
watertight as in if you ride for hours

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.420 
watertight as in if you ride for hours
and<00:05:34.110> pouring<00:05:34.470> around<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:34.830> they<00:05:34.979> come<00:05:35.220> with

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
and pouring around so they come with

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.640 
and pouring around so they come with
these<00:05:36.140> waterproof<00:05:37.140> bags<00:05:37.610> for<00:05:38.610> each<00:05:38.729> side<00:05:39.650> you

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
these waterproof bags for each side you

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.500 
these waterproof bags for each side you
see<00:05:40.860> it's<00:05:40.979> waterproof<00:05:41.400> on<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.820> inside<00:05:44.450> not<00:05:45.450> on

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
see it's waterproof on the inside not on

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.770 
see it's waterproof on the inside not on
the<00:05:45.780> outside<00:05:46.880> some<00:05:47.880> of<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.180> put<00:05:48.360> stuff<00:05:48.510> in

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
the outside some of you put stuff in

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.330 
the outside some of you put stuff in
there<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.440> put<00:05:49.620> this<00:05:49.710> inside<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.130> bag<00:05:50.310> and

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
there you put this inside the bag and

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.719 
there you put this inside the bag and
load<00:05:50.640> into<00:05:50.820> they're<00:05:51.950> all<00:05:52.950> very<00:05:53.160> good<00:05:53.400> very

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
impressed with them and I think they

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.879

the design for sport bikes look good on

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.490 
the design for sport bikes look good on
them<00:06:38.199> -<00:06:38.350> you're<00:06:38.500> seeing<00:06:38.710> them<00:06:38.800> on<00:06:38.889> them
