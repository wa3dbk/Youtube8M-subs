00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.680
 hello in this video I will teach how to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 volume to hair with this scene if it 's 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.849
 bile before you start showing them as 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.099
 I use my hair I will make a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.000
 intermediate review on these tongs 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.000
 in case someone is interested 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.640
 first of all I inform you that this 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.800
 bile mark pro there are three models that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.110
 I bought the first 19 mm of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.900
 diameter but there is also the 25 and the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.940
 of 32 mm the price of mine was about 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.810
 the 20 euros although I already have more or 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.810
 less a couple of years 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.630
 the cable is fully rotatable by 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.480
 which gives a lot of comfort when 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.070
 put it on the table 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.680
 has a total of 10 positions 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.300
 temperature as you see here points out the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.160
 characteristic safe positions or the 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.820
 hair type I'm going to put it on 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.820
 number 8 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.850
 finally teach you dagger tongs 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.620
 they are the ones that have the piece although I do not 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 he used it because in this way I think 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.299
 that the hair stays more natural 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.920
 now that you have done a brief way the 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.920
 characteristics of these fabrics chairs 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.610
 baby I 'm going to make you a wave hairstyle 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.610
 what do you think about 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 first I divide it in two and then I go 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.560
 taking the hair by locks 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.510
 As I said, I do not use the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.460
 princess of the tongs simply 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.570
 I take the lock and around the pincer 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.570
 up to give volume 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.000
 do not screw the hair from the root then 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.440
 from half the hair to the tips 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.450
 I keep separated in the hair and twisting it 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.080
 by tufts and little by little you will see how 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.080
 acquires volume 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.850
 or not 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.970
 he takes care 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.209
 now 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.209
 of love 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.010
 ah 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.019
 good me 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.700
 at the end put a picture of the before and the 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.560
 later so that you see that yes that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.239
 you really notice the difference and if you do it 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.579
 quietly at home you will see how it 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.939
 There is a very nice hair and it shows 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.939
 volume 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.310
 to me 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.860
 or 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.519
 the inheritance 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.989
 and 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.989
 tony gwynn jr 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.800
 tension 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.610
 wish 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.610
 and me 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.630
 and I 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.630
 now 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.819
 Y 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.819
 that is me 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.120
 yes 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 but 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.670
 EU 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.419
 you see the final result I think 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.639
 It has been good enough and only 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.630
 is the difference anyway 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.520
 I hope you comment what you think 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.860
 and if you want to make a request 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.199
 related to hair seemed very 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.120
 well and as I always say a little kiss for 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.120
