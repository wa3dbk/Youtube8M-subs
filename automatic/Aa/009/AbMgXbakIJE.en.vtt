00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
he couldn't throw it to D so he tried to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.390 
he couldn't throw it to D so he tried to
make<00:02:28.530> something<00:02:28.710> happen<00:02:28.860> with<00:02:29.040> his<00:02:29.160> feet

young<00:02:29.730> quarterback<00:02:30.210> he<00:02:30.600> should<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:30.900> just

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
young quarterback he should have just

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.390 
young quarterback he should have just
fired<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.680> bow<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.070> we'd<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.220> been

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
fired it out of bow so we'd have been

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.620 
fired it out of bow so we'd have been
third<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.760> five<00:02:32.910> instead<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.240> third<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.510> 11

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
third and five instead of third and 11

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.040 
third and five instead of third and 11
but<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:35.400> lined<00:02:35.670> up<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:35.940> put<00:02:36.360> D<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.690> slot

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
but we lined up we put D in the slot

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.170 
but we lined up we put D in the slot
they<00:02:37.320> call<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> timeout<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.460> expected<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
they call a timeout which I expected I

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.490

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
didn't want to use the time out there I

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.170 
didn't want to use the time out there I
figured<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.100> put<00:02:41.310> him<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.550> slot<00:02:41.850> they're

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
figured if I put him in a slot they're

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.790 
figured if I put him in a slot they're
going<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.360> call<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.540> timeout<00:02:42.960> so<00:02:43.470> when<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.620> call

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
going to call a timeout so when you call

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.010 
going to call a timeout so when you call
a<00:02:43.830> timeout<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.460> call<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.850> play<00:02:45.000> we<00:02:45.150> wanted<00:02:45.630> it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
a timeout we call the play we wanted it
