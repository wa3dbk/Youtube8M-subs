amazing horrible things that are trying
to<00:00:55.989> kill<00:00:56.379> me<00:00:56.620> I'm<00:00:56.980> actually<00:00:57.190> playing<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:57.670> on

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
to kill me I'm actually playing this on

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.509 
to kill me I'm actually playing this on
easy<00:00:58.030> mode<00:00:58.179> so<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.199> should<00:00:59.469> give<00:00:59.620> you<00:00:59.769> a<00:00:59.800> sort

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
easy mode so that should give you a sort

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.429 
easy mode so that should give you a sort
of<00:01:00.579> clear<00:01:00.969> idea<00:01:01.629> as<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:02.879> how<00:01:03.879> tough<00:01:04.390> this<00:01:05.110> came

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
of clear idea as to how tough this came

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.219 
of clear idea as to how tough this came
actually<00:01:05.710> can<00:01:06.250> be<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:07.330> spots<00:01:07.810> this<00:01:07.960> is<00:01:08.080> also

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
actually can be in spots this is also

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.990 
actually can be in spots this is also
the<00:01:08.350> first<00:01:08.439> level<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.610> it's<00:01:10.090> it's<00:01:10.360> hard<00:01:10.600> yo<00:01:12.000> so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
the first level so it's it's hard yo so

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.289 
the first level so it's it's hard yo so
basically<00:01:14.280> basically<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.759> total<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.150> games

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
basically basically the total of games

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.300 
basically basically the total of games
have<00:01:16.450> always<00:01:16.540> been<00:01:16.750> these<00:01:16.900> kind<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.310> tool

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
have always been these kind of tool

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.149 
have always been these kind of tool
based<00:01:18.549> affairs<00:01:18.820> where<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.590> sort<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.680> move<00:01:20.920> the

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
based affairs where you sort of move the

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.149 
based affairs where you sort of move the
control<00:01:21.490> around<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.939> physical<00:01:22.390> space<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.159> you

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
control around in physical space and you

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.130 
control around in physical space and you
know<00:01:24.280> it<00:01:24.460> moves<00:01:24.729> arrows<00:01:25.180> around<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:26.020> know

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
know it moves arrows around you know

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.499 
know it moves arrows around you know
this<00:01:26.350> sort<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.890> arrow<00:01:27.340> thing<00:01:27.700> around<00:01:27.939> and<00:01:28.240> you

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
this sort of arrow thing around and you

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.210 
this sort of arrow thing around and you
have<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.960> destroy<00:01:29.380> dots<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.710> have<00:01:32.979> got

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
have to destroy dots here you have got

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.310 
have to destroy dots here you have got
to<00:01:33.490> get<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> end<00:01:34.180> of<00:01:34.509> this<00:01:34.810> sequence

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
to get to the end of this sequence

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.530 
to get to the end of this sequence
collect<00:01:36.159> as<00:01:36.280> many<00:01:36.399> diamonds<00:01:36.850> things<00:01:37.299> as<00:01:37.450> you

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
collect as many diamonds things as you

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.520 
collect as many diamonds things as you
possibly<00:01:37.899> can<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.579> just<00:01:40.570> generally<00:01:41.170> avoid

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
possibly can and just generally avoid

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.590 
possibly can and just generally avoid
not<00:01:41.710> getting<00:01:42.009> hit<00:01:42.220> so<00:01:42.790> going<00:01:43.299> through<00:01:43.479> those

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
not getting hit so going through those

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.240 
not getting hit so going through those
green<00:01:43.930> targets<00:01:44.380> there<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.680> opens<00:01:45.009> up<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
green targets there that opens up the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.190 
green targets there that opens up the
new<00:01:45.399> space<00:01:45.670> up<00:01:45.969> got<00:01:46.420> through<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.719> checkpoint

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
new space up got through the checkpoint

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.020 
new space up got through the checkpoint
thank<00:01:47.530> goodness<00:01:47.829> for<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.040> watch<00:01:48.549> out<00:01:48.820> for

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
thank goodness for that watch out for

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.020 
thank goodness for that watch out for
that<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:50.140> really<00:01:50.350> kind<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.369> tough<00:01:51.520> in<00:01:51.820> this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
that really really kind of tough in this

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.179 
that really really kind of tough in this
the<00:01:53.020> other<00:01:53.170> two<00:01:53.350> live<00:01:53.619> games<00:01:53.829> kind<00:01:54.009> of<00:01:54.070> had

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
the other two live games kind of had

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.219 
the other two live games kind of had
weapons<00:01:54.460> I've<00:01:54.850> not<00:01:55.060> come<00:01:55.210> up<00:01:55.390> against<00:01:55.810> any<00:01:56.079> of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
weapons I've not come up against any of

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.389 
weapons I've not come up against any of
those<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.740> know<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.860> haven't<00:01:57.009> being<00:01:57.189> able<00:01:57.340> to

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
those you know I haven't being able to

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.969 
those you know I haven't being able to
fight<00:01:57.640> back<00:01:57.670> basically<00:01:58.450> yet<00:01:58.829> there's<00:01:59.829> plenty

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
fight back basically yet there's plenty

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.590 
fight back basically yet there's plenty
of<00:02:00.159> spaces<00:02:00.460> where<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:00.880> game<00:02:01.030> is<00:02:01.060> essentially

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
of spaces where the game is essentially

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.149 
of spaces where the game is essentially
tricking<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.200> run<00:02:02.380> into<00:02:02.649> things<00:02:02.799> that<00:02:02.979> you

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
tricking you to run into things that you

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.609 
tricking you to run into things that you
don't<00:02:03.280> want<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.610> run<00:02:03.789> into<00:02:03.960> which<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:05.200> kind<00:02:05.560> of

high school you've got I think some

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.430

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
this I think the people who aren't going

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.670 
this I think the people who aren't going
to<00:02:52.970> adore<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.360> other<00:02:53.630> people<00:02:53.900> who<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.650> know

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
to adore this other people who you know

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.740 
to adore this other people who you know
like<00:02:54.980> they've<00:02:55.460> seen<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.120> just<00:02:56.360> kind<00:02:56.720> of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
like they've seen this and just kind of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.750 
like they've seen this and just kind of
don't<00:02:57.020> really<00:02:57.440> comprehend<00:02:57.950> what's<00:02:58.250> going<00:02:58.610> on

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.870 
don't really comprehend what's going on
I<00:02:58.940> think<00:02:59.840> for<00:02:59.990> them<00:03:00.140> it's<00:03:00.440> probably<00:03:01.400> not<00:03:01.670> going

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
I think for them it's probably not going

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.090 
I think for them it's probably not going
to<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.210> most<00:03:02.330> fun<00:03:02.630> in<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.840> world<00:03:03.080> but<00:03:03.680> I
