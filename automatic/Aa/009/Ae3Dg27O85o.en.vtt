way the doors open up like that I'll do

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.000 
way the doors open up like that I'll do
that<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.789> both<00:01:00.180> sheets<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.690> paper<00:01:03.019> top<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that on both sheets of paper top and the

that on both sheets of paper top and the
bottom

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 

next<00:01:09.870> we're<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.140> fold<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.440> in<00:01:10.620> half<00:01:10.650> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
next we're going to fold this in half so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.380 
next we're going to fold this in half so
use<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.250> first<00:01:11.700> crease<00:01:11.940> that<00:01:12.120> we<00:01:12.210> already

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
use that first crease that we already

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.690 
use that first crease that we already
had<00:01:12.660> that<00:01:13.230> we<00:01:13.350> already<00:01:13.560> made<00:01:13.680> go<00:01:14.460> ahead<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
had that we already made go ahead and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.220 
had that we already made go ahead and
fold<00:01:14.940> those<00:01:15.210> both<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.690> half

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
fold those both in half

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.970 
fold those both in half
that'll<00:01:17.160> give<00:01:17.340> us<00:01:17.750> two<00:01:18.750> bars<00:01:19.050> just<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.770> this

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
that'll give us two bars just like this

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.250 
that'll give us two bars just like this
now<00:01:20.970> from<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.480> they're<00:01:21.690> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.870> diverge

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
now from here they're going to diverge

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.390 
now from here they're going to diverge
they're<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:23.070> different

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
they're going to be a little different

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.430 
they're going to be a little different
steps<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.120> each<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:24.990> sure<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.260> pay

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
steps on each one so make sure you pay

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.080 
steps on each one so make sure you pay
really<00:01:25.710> close<00:01:25.830> attention<00:01:26.010> what<00:01:26.850> we're<00:01:26.970> going

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
really close attention what we're going

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.150 
really close attention what we're going
to<00:01:27.120> do<00:01:27.300> is<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.140> same<00:01:28.380> folds<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.070> they're

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
to do is the same folds but they're

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.950 
to do is the same folds but they're
going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.490> opposite<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.150> both<00:01:30.360> sides<00:01:30.660> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
going to be on opposite on both sides so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.940 
going to be on opposite on both sides so
make<00:01:31.110> sure<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.320> pay<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.680> close<00:01:31.770> attention

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
make sure you pay really close attention

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.780 
make sure you pay really close attention
I'm<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.640> fold<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.660> top<00:01:33.960> left<00:01:34.580> over<00:01:35.580> on

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
I'm going to fold the top left over on

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.930 
I'm going to fold the top left over on
the<00:01:35.970> left-hand<00:01:36.330> side<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:38.040> top<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
the left-hand side and the top right on

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.840 
the left-hand side and the top right on
the<00:01:39.440> right-hand<00:01:40.440> side<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.220> will<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the right-hand side so they will be the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
the right-hand side so they will be the
same<00:01:42.030> folds<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.050> how<00:01:43.170> they're<00:01:43.350> going

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
same folds but you see how they're going

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.859 
same folds but you see how they're going
in<00:01:43.680> opposite<00:01:44.130> directions<00:01:44.190> like<00:01:44.760> that<00:01:45.000> it's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
in opposite directions like that it's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.420 
in opposite directions like that it's
right<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.350> top<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.130> they<00:01:47.190> do<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
right there at the top and they do the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
right there at the top and they do the
same<00:01:47.460> thing<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.000> bottom<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.170> time

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
same thing at the bottom but this time

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.359 
same thing at the bottom but this time
I'm<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:51.510> bottom<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I'm going to go the bottom right on the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.400 
I'm going to go the bottom right on the
left-hand<00:01:53.820> side<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.600> bottom<00:01:54.900> left<00:01:55.140> on

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
left-hand side and the bottom left on

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.570 
left-hand side and the bottom left on
the<00:01:55.470> right-hand<00:01:55.979> side<00:01:57.410> just<00:01:58.410> like<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.619> now

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
the right-hand side just like that now

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.620 
the right-hand side just like that now
if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.910> were<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.060> put<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.300> two<00:02:00.330> them<00:02:00.540> together

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
if you were to put the two them together

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.670 
if you were to put the two them together
you<00:02:00.869> sort<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.200> how<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.380> looks<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> little

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you sort of see how it looks a little

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.760 
you sort of see how it looks a little
bit<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> rocketship<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:04.410> like<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
bit like a rocketship just like that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.950 
bit like a rocketship just like that
what<00:02:05.040> we're<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.810> we're<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:06.900> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.160 
what we're going to do is we're going to
split<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.470> rocketship<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.100> half<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.869> line<00:02:09.869> up

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
split the rocketship in half and line up

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.850 
split the rocketship in half and line up
the<00:02:10.920> two<00:02:11.160> bottom<00:02:11.580> points<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.560> makes<00:02:13.739> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the two bottom points so it makes a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.670 
the two bottom points so it makes a
little<00:02:13.980> bit<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.400> V<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:15.600> like<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.050> go

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
little bit of a V just like this go

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.080 
little bit of a V just like this go
ahead<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.920> take<00:02:17.040> one<00:02:17.070> finger<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.790> hold<00:02:17.940> that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
ahead and take one finger and hold that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.360 
ahead and take one finger and hold that
hold<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.660> V<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.110> place<00:02:19.380> now<00:02:20.100> I'm<00:02:20.160> going<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
hold that V in place now I'm going to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.670 
hold that V in place now I'm going to
take<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:21.390> flap<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.410> left-hand

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
take this flap the one on the left-hand

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.220 
take this flap the one on the left-hand
side<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.489> I'm<00:02:23.640> going<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.910> fold<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.360> down<00:02:24.630> like

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.360 

this<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.680> what's<00:02:28.800> going<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.950> happen<00:02:29.280> is

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
this this is what's going to happen is

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.250 
this this is what's going to happen is
this<00:02:29.580> edge<00:02:29.850> right<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.660> going<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.840> line<00:02:31.080> up

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
this edge right here is going to line up

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.640 
this edge right here is going to line up
along<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:32.640> edge<00:02:32.970> see<00:02:33.900> how<00:02:33.959> as<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.170> bring<00:02:34.440> this

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
along this edge see how as I bring this

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.600 
along this edge see how as I bring this
down<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:36.269> lines<00:02:36.600> up<00:02:36.810> right<00:02:37.050> along<00:02:37.350> there<00:02:37.650> then

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
down it lines up right along there then

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.460 
down it lines up right along there then
the<00:02:38.790> same<00:02:39.030> thing<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.480> other<00:02:39.510> side<00:02:39.840> where

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
the same thing on the other side where

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.500 
the same thing on the other side where
this<00:02:40.650> edge<00:02:40.950> right<00:02:41.280> here<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.330> line<00:02:42.480> up

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
this edge right here is going to line up

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.910 
this edge right here is going to line up
along<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.930> edge<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.739> come

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
along this edge so it's going to come

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.890 
along this edge so it's going to come
down<00:02:43.970> it's<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.150> fold<00:02:45.360> towards<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
down it's going to fold towards the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.539 
down it's going to fold towards the
bottom<00:02:46.049> right<00:02:47.390> like<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:50.280> makes<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
bottom right like that that makes a

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.060 
bottom right like that that makes a
little<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.970> an<00:02:51.090> M<00:02:51.269> shape<00:02:51.830> next<00:02:52.830> we're

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
little bit like an M shape next we're

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.520 
little bit like an M shape next we're
going<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.220> flip<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.730> two<00:02:53.910> over<00:02:54.239> give<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.410> bit

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
going to flip the two over give it a bit

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.720 
going to flip the two over give it a bit
of<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.680> w<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:57.860> now<00:02:58.860> once<00:02:59.100> we<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.280> them<00:02:59.549> this

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
of a w and now once we have them this

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.220 
of a w and now once we have them this
way<00:02:59.970> we're<00:03:00.239> going<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> same<00:03:00.780> fold<00:03:01.049> again

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
way we're going to the same fold again

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.840 
way we're going to the same fold again
we're<00:03:01.380> going<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> take<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.890> flap<00:03:02.190> I'm<00:03:02.700> going

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
we're going to take this flap I'm going

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.220 
we're going to take this flap I'm going
to<00:03:02.940> fold<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.269> down<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> bottom<00:03:03.900> corner

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
to fold it down to the bottom corner

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.800 
to fold it down to the bottom corner
again<00:03:05.010> using<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.580> edge<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.450> line<00:03:06.630> up<00:03:06.780> with

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
again using this edge to line up with

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.080 
again using this edge to line up with
this<00:03:07.080> edge<00:03:08.209> just<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.330> this

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
this edge just like this

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.900 
this edge just like this
like<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:14.280> same<00:03:14.460> thing<00:03:14.670> over<00:03:14.820> here

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
like that and the same thing over here

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.050 
like that and the same thing over here
this<00:03:15.660> edge<00:03:15.900> right<00:03:15.930> here<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.530> going<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.770> line<00:03:16.920> up

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
this edge right here is going to line up

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.130 
this edge right here is going to line up
right<00:03:18.060> along<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.990> center<00:03:20.900> great<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.020> these

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
right along that center great so these

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.190 
right along that center great so these
two<00:03:22.380> are<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.920> same<00:03:23.420> types<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.630> folds<00:03:25.080> but

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
two are the same types of folds but

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.630 
two are the same types of folds but
they're<00:03:25.440> opposites<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.130> each<00:03:26.250> other<00:03:26.460> they're

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
they're opposites of each other they're

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.940 
they're opposites of each other they're
mirror<00:03:26.880> images<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:28.770> now<00:03:28.920> flip<00:03:29.220> them<00:03:29.370> over<00:03:30.950> so

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
mirror images so now flip them over so

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.160 
mirror images so now flip them over so
now<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.160> see<00:03:32.490> how<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.880> side<00:03:32.940> has<00:03:33.480> two

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
now you see how this side has two

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.560 
now you see how this side has two
triangles<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.760> shape<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.300> middle

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
triangles and this shape in the middle

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.100 
triangles and this shape in the middle
right<00:03:36.750> there<00:03:37.700> what's<00:03:38.700> going<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.910> happen<00:03:39.300> and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
right there what's going to happen and

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.330 
right there what's going to happen and
I'll<00:03:40.230> show<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.440> how<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.710> do<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.190> one

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
I'll show you how to do it on this one

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.110 
I'll show you how to do it on this one
right<00:03:41.460> here<00:03:41.640> first

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
right here first

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.470 
right here first
we're<00:03:42.840> going<00:03:42.960> to<00:03:43.020> take<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:44.220> triangle<00:03:44.640> that's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
we're going to take this triangle that's

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.760 
we're going to take this triangle that's
right<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:46.110> we're<00:03:46.200> going<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.350> fold<00:03:46.590> it

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
right here and we're going to fold it

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.820 
right here and we're going to fold it
all<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:46.980> way<00:03:47.700> over<00:03:48.260> I'm<00:03:49.260> going<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.470> fold<00:03:49.710> it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
all the way over I'm going to fold it

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.280 
all the way over I'm going to fold it
over<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.460> entire<00:03:50.790> model<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.720> along<00:03:52.020> this<00:03:52.230> is

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
over the entire model so along this is

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.360 
over the entire model so along this is
the<00:03:52.440> line<00:03:52.680> that's<00:03:52.770> going<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> be<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.130> crease

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
the line that's going to be the crease

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.980 
the line that's going to be the crease
so<00:03:53.580> this<00:03:53.820> edge<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.120> going<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.570> come<00:03:54.690> up<00:03:54.780> against

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
so this edge is going to come up against

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.530 
so this edge is going to come up against
this<00:03:55.170> edge<00:03:55.490> pull<00:03:56.490> it<00:03:56.610> all<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.820> way<00:03:57.030> over<00:03:57.270> and

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
this edge pull it all the way over and

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.660 
this edge pull it all the way over and
the<00:03:57.780> same<00:03:58.020> thing<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.380> bottom<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:59.370> edge

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
the same thing on the bottom this edge

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.960 
the same thing on the bottom this edge
up<00:03:59.850> to<00:03:59.970> here<00:04:00.440> just<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.760> now<00:04:02.760> I'm<00:04:02.850> going

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
up to here just like that now I'm going

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.650 
up to here just like that now I'm going
to<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.180> same<00:04:03.390> thing<00:04:03.750> on<00:04:04.100> this<00:04:05.100> one<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.450> go

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
to do the same thing on this one so go

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.210 
to do the same thing on this one so go
ahead<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.810> make<00:04:07.020> sure<00:04:07.080> that<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.440> push<00:04:07.890> really

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
ahead and make sure that you push really

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.350 
ahead and make sure that you push really
hard<00:04:08.340> on<00:04:08.610> these<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.790> want<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.970> get<00:04:09.060> these<00:04:09.120> nice

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
hard on these you want to get these nice

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.000 
hard on these you want to get these nice
and<00:04:09.570> flat<00:04:09.780> they're<00:04:10.350> going<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.560> want<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.800> pop<00:04:10.980> up

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
and flat they're going to want to pop up

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.280 
and flat they're going to want to pop up
like<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:11.760> that's<00:04:11.820> okay<00:04:12.260> same<00:04:13.260> thing

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
like that but that's okay same thing

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.870 
like that but that's okay same thing
over<00:04:13.530> here<00:04:13.620> I'm<00:04:13.860> going<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.040> fold<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.640> edge

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
over here I'm going to fold this edge

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.390 
over here I'm going to fold this edge
over<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:17.480> this<00:04:18.480> edge<00:04:18.690> over<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:19.920> again<00:04:20.220> it's

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
over and this edge over so again it's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.970 
over and this edge over so again it's
the<00:04:20.520> same<00:04:20.549> folds<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:21.210> they<00:04:21.299> look<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.980> little

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
the same folds but they look a little

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.930 
the same folds but they look a little
different<00:04:23.160> cuz<00:04:23.640> they're<00:04:23.990> mirror<00:04:24.990> images<00:04:25.940> now

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
different cuz they're mirror images now

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.360 
different cuz they're mirror images now
we've<00:04:27.840> got<00:04:27.990> here<00:04:28.200> are<00:04:28.320> two<00:04:28.530> units<00:04:28.920> that<00:04:29.130> if<00:04:29.280> you

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
we've got here are two units that if you

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.620 
we've got here are two units that if you
look<00:04:29.520> at<00:04:29.700> them<00:04:29.790> like<00:04:29.940> this<00:04:30.090> they<00:04:30.300> kind<00:04:30.480> of<00:04:30.510> have

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
look at them like this they kind of have

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.470 
look at them like this they kind of have
a<00:04:30.660> little<00:04:30.750> bit<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.080> C<00:04:31.350> shape<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.920> them<00:04:32.480> what's

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
a little bit of a C shape to them what's

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.360 
a little bit of a C shape to them what's
going<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.690> happen<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.260> we're<00:04:34.950> going<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.130> try

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
going to happen is we're going to try

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.180 
going to happen is we're going to try
and<00:04:35.430> interlock<00:04:36.000> these<00:04:36.330> two<00:04:36.600> together<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:38.040> way

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
and interlock these two together the way

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.600 
and interlock these two together the way
that<00:04:38.370> works<00:04:38.610> take<00:04:39.740> one<00:04:40.740> of<00:04:40.920> them<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.100> put<00:04:41.340> it

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
that works take one of them and put it

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.300 
that works take one of them and put it
down<00:04:41.790> on<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.000> table<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:43.830> one<00:04:44.010> from<00:04:44.100> using

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
down on the table this one from using

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.370 
down on the table this one from using
the<00:04:44.550> purple<00:04:44.880> one<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.180> make<00:04:45.720> sure<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.200> the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
the purple one and make sure that the

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.120 
the purple one and make sure that the
way<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.530> have<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:47.160> with<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:49.410> triangle

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
way you have it is with the the triangle

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.590 
way you have it is with the the triangle
on<00:04:50.220> this<00:04:50.370> side<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.790> triangle<00:04:51.180> here<00:04:51.420> and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
on this side and the triangle here and

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.430 
on this side and the triangle here and
then<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.780> shape<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.080> middle<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:52.320> there's

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
then the shape the middle so there's

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.290 
then the shape the middle so there's
three<00:04:52.740> shapes<00:04:53.070> on<00:04:53.280> this<00:04:53.430> that's<00:04:53.670> pointed<00:04:54.150> up

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
three shapes on this that's pointed up

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.240 
three shapes on this that's pointed up
if<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.140> flip<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.500> over<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.680> look<00:04:55.860> at<00:04:55.980> it<00:04:56.040> this

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
if you flip it over and look at it this

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.920 
if you flip it over and look at it this
is<00:04:56.310> just<00:04:56.640> two<00:04:56.820> triangles<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.720> looks

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
is just two triangles so it looks

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.050 
is just two triangles so it looks
different<00:04:58.190> but<00:04:59.190> just<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.700> it<00:04:59.850> where<00:04:59.970> it

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
different but just have it where it

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.660 
different but just have it where it
looks<00:05:00.210> this<00:05:00.450> side<00:05:00.630> up<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.100> now<00:05:02.100> I'm<00:05:02.340> going<00:05:02.580> to

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
looks this side up and now I'm going to

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.270 
looks this side up and now I'm going to
take<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.180> other<00:05:03.210> pick<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:04.020> other<00:05:04.200> piece<00:05:04.500> I'm

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
take the other pick the other piece I'm

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.610 
take the other pick the other piece I'm
going<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.550> flip<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:05.940> over<00:05:06.090> so<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:07.170> just<00:05:07.530> the

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
going to flip it over so that just the

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.370 
going to flip it over so that just the
two<00:05:07.770> triangles<00:05:08.310> are<00:05:08.400> showing<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.200> I'm<00:05:10.200> going

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
two triangles are showing and I'm going

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.570 
two triangles are showing and I'm going
to<00:05:10.440> put<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.860> on<00:05:10.980> top

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
to put it on top

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.130 
to put it on top
as<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:13.610> plus<00:05:14.000> sign<00:05:15.910> just<00:05:16.910> like<00:05:17.060> this<00:05:17.390> now<00:05:17.960> we've

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
as a plus sign just like this now we've

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.720 
as a plus sign just like this now we've
got<00:05:18.290> everything<00:05:18.590> lined<00:05:18.800> up<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.460> once<00:05:19.610> you

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
got everything lined up and once you

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.520 
got everything lined up and once you
have<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:19.970> right<00:05:20.090> here<00:05:20.150> these<00:05:20.900> folds<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:21.440> we

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
have it right here these folds that we

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.800 
have it right here these folds that we
already<00:05:21.920> made<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:23.300> see<00:05:23.480> how<00:05:23.600> they're<00:05:23.780> all

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
already made you see how they're all

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.090 
already made you see how they're all
happy<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.320> go<00:05:24.440> that<00:05:24.620> way<00:05:24.740> because<00:05:24.830> we've

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
happy to go that way because we've

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.230 
happy to go that way because we've
already<00:05:25.190> creased<00:05:25.520> them<00:05:25.640> down<00:05:25.820> go<00:05:26.000> ahead<00:05:26.030> and

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
already creased them down go ahead and

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.260 
already creased them down go ahead and
fold<00:05:26.450> that<00:05:26.630> one<00:05:26.840> down<00:05:27.080> but<00:05:27.890> when<00:05:28.130> you<00:05:28.220> do<00:05:28.460> we're

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
fold that one down but when you do we're

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.750 
fold that one down but when you do we're
going<00:05:29.390> to<00:05:29.450> weave<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.780> underneath<00:05:30.650> this<00:05:31.430> big

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
going to weave it underneath this big

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.520 
going to weave it underneath this big
blue<00:05:32.000> triangle<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:32.780> see<00:05:32.990> how<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.260> comes

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
blue triangle so you see how it comes

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.370 
blue triangle so you see how it comes
down<00:05:34.160> and<00:05:34.520> it's<00:05:35.240> been<00:05:35.450> pushed<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.960> sits<00:05:36.230> now

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
down and it's been pushed it sits now

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.770 
down and it's been pushed it sits now
underneath<00:05:36.890> that<00:05:37.760> blue<00:05:38.000> triangle<00:05:38.480> so<00:05:38.570> you<00:05:38.630> can

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
underneath that blue triangle so you can

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.290 
underneath that blue triangle so you can
sort<00:05:38.960> of<00:05:39.050> weave<00:05:39.290> it<00:05:39.320> under<00:05:39.860> this<00:05:40.070> way<00:05:40.250> or<00:05:41.240> just

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
sort of weave it under this way or just

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.150 
sort of weave it under this way or just
pick<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.870> triangle<00:05:42.260> up<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:42.650> put<00:05:42.830> it<00:05:42.920> under

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
pick the triangle up and put it under

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.830 
pick the triangle up and put it under
and<00:05:43.400> then<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:43.940> same<00:05:44.150> thing<00:05:44.180> here<00:05:44.570> we're<00:05:44.720> going

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
and then the same thing here we're going

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.620 
and then the same thing here we're going
to<00:05:44.900> fold<00:05:45.140> this<00:05:45.320> one<00:05:45.530> over<00:05:45.760> but<00:05:46.760> fit<00:05:47.510> it

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
to fold this one over but fit it

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.980 
to fold this one over but fit it
underneath<00:05:48.940> that<00:05:49.940> blue<00:05:50.240> triangle<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:50.840> see

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
underneath that blue triangle you see

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.510 
underneath that blue triangle you see
how<00:05:51.080> it<00:05:51.169> makes<00:05:51.320> a<00:05:51.410> nice<00:05:51.530> weaving<00:05:52.190> pattern

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
how it makes a nice weaving pattern

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.280 
how it makes a nice weaving pattern
right<00:05:52.730> there<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.720> it's<00:05:53.870> holding<00:05:54.169> together

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
right there and it's holding together

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.810 
right there and it's holding together
pretty<00:05:54.680> well<00:05:54.950> at<00:05:55.070> this<00:05:55.160> point<00:05:55.280> it<00:05:55.550> should<00:05:55.610> get

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
pretty well at this point it should get

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.670 
pretty well at this point it should get
a<00:05:55.880> little<00:05:56.090> bit<00:05:56.240> more<00:05:56.390> stable<00:05:56.630> and<00:05:56.930> make<00:05:57.530> sure

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
a little bit more stable and make sure

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.900 
a little bit more stable and make sure
that<00:05:57.800> you<00:05:57.860> try<00:05:58.040> to<00:05:58.070> get<00:05:58.220> them<00:05:58.340> where<00:05:58.490> these<00:05:58.640> two

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
that you try to get them where these two

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.420 
that you try to get them where these two
are<00:05:59.150> always<00:05:59.900> at<00:06:00.140> a<00:06:00.500> 90<00:06:01.070> degree<00:06:01.400> or

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
are always at a 90 degree or

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.340 
are always at a 90 degree or
perpendicular<00:06:02.270> angle<00:06:02.419> as<00:06:02.720> much<00:06:02.900> as<00:06:03.050> you<00:06:03.169> can

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
perpendicular angle as much as you can

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.460 
perpendicular angle as much as you can
so<00:06:03.790> we've<00:06:04.790> got<00:06:04.910> this<00:06:05.169> now<00:06:06.169> we're<00:06:06.290> going<00:06:06.410> to

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
so we've got this now we're going to

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.130 
so we've got this now we're going to
flip<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:06.860> entire<00:06:06.950> model<00:06:07.490> over<00:06:07.760> and<00:06:07.940> we<00:06:08.930> have

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
flip the entire model over and we have

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.020 
flip the entire model over and we have
the<00:06:09.380> last<00:06:09.590> two<00:06:09.830> steps<00:06:10.010> are<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:10.400> same<00:06:10.700> thing

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
the last two steps are the same thing

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.150 
the last two steps are the same thing
we're<00:06:11.150> going<00:06:11.240> to<00:06:11.330> use<00:06:11.510> these<00:06:11.810> flaps<00:06:12.710> that<00:06:12.950> come

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
we're going to use these flaps that come

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.280 
we're going to use these flaps that come
over<00:06:13.400> and<00:06:13.580> what<00:06:14.240> we're<00:06:14.360> going<00:06:14.480> to<00:06:14.510> do<00:06:14.720> is<00:06:14.960> we're

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
over and what we're going to do is we're

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.950 
over and what we're going to do is we're
going<00:06:15.410> to<00:06:15.500> weave<00:06:15.860> them<00:06:16.540> underneath<00:06:17.540> those

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
going to weave them underneath those

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.320 
going to weave them underneath those
panels<00:06:18.410> so<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:18.650> see<00:06:18.890> how<00:06:19.010> that<00:06:19.220> this<00:06:19.790> blue<00:06:20.150> one

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
panels so you see how that this blue one

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.040 
panels so you see how that this blue one
fit<00:06:20.630> underneath<00:06:21.260> the<00:06:21.640> purple<00:06:22.640> flap<00:06:23.050> right

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
fit underneath the purple flap right

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.469 
fit underneath the purple flap right
there<00:06:24.290> if<00:06:24.440> it's<00:06:24.560> right<00:06:24.890> underneath<00:06:25.310> and<00:06:25.640> then

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
there if it's right underneath and then

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:27.640 
there if it's right underneath and then
we've<00:06:26.600> got<00:06:26.750> the<00:06:26.840> last<00:06:27.050> one<00:06:27.260> here<00:06:27.440> we're<00:06:27.530> going

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
we've got the last one here we're going

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.860 
we've got the last one here we're going
to<00:06:27.710> fold<00:06:27.890> that<00:06:27.979> one<00:06:28.250> up<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:28.580> now<00:06:29.360> I'm<00:06:29.630> going<00:06:29.780> to

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
to fold that one up and now I'm going to

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.500 
to fold that one up and now I'm going to
weave<00:06:30.169> it<00:06:30.910> underneath<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:33.470> purple<00:06:33.830> one<00:06:34.010> there

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
weave it underneath the purple one there

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.510 
weave it underneath the purple one there
just<00:06:35.510> like<00:06:35.660> that<00:06:35.860> and<00:06:36.860> once<00:06:37.100> you've<00:06:37.250> done<00:06:37.400> that

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
just like that and once you've done that

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.680 
just like that and once you've done that
on<00:06:37.550> both<00:06:37.640> sides<00:06:37.820> that<00:06:38.710> is<00:06:39.710> the<00:06:39.890> completed

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
on both sides that is the completed

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.310 
on both sides that is the completed
origami<00:06:41.690> ninja<00:06:41.960> star

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.780 

I<00:06:45.350> like<00:06:45.830> to<00:06:45.920> do<00:06:46.010> that<00:06:46.130> the<00:06:46.280> end<00:06:46.370> that's<00:06:46.670> an

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
I like to do that the end that's an

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.180 
I like to do that the end that's an
interesting
