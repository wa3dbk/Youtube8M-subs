00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.800
We are with Nissan X-Trail in Dalaman. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The X-Trail with 7-seats is the big brother of the Qashqai, which is accepted as the phenomenon of crossover class, 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
looks much more modern with its renewed form. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's see if the new X-Trail will follow on the successful footsteps of the Qashqai. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
The X-Trail's design is quite similar to the Qashqai. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
In fact it is not easy to differentiate the two models when you look from the front.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
When you look from the side it is easily understood that the X-Trail is longer. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
At the rear the transparent taillights that has been positioned a bit higher draws attention. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.000
The third generation X-Trail instead of the box form design of the first two generations has been formed with more round and with more curvy lines. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And if you ask me it became more youthful and better looking.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
Of course the elixir of youth has not been applied to the exterior only. The X-Trail's interior is brand new too. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Actually it is not because we can see that the controls, displays and the equipment are exactly like the ones in the Qashqai. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The quality of the materials used in the cockpit is high and to reach and to use the controls is easy. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The interior is spacious; there is no problem in the front. You are very comfortable here. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The cockpit with high quality materials and comfy seats offer quality ride. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the second row seats good knee and headroom is offered. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Here, even the adults can cross their legs and that is very good. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But I can't say the same things for the third row seats. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Because adults can only sit here when they really have to. Apart from this only children can use this row. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The X-Trail offers 550-liter boot capacity. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And this means it is 120-liter more than the 430-liter capacity of the Qashqai. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Of course this is only true at 5-persons sitting arrangement. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If you take all the 7-seats in to account then you are only left with an area small items. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.000
The X-Trail is only imported to our country with 1.6-liter diesel engine.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I have already reviewed this engine, which develops 130 HP and 320 Nm or torque in the Nissan Qashqai test. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But that had a 6-speed gearbox. This car I'm driving has continuously variable gearbox called X-Tronic. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The compatibility of the gearbox with the engine is good. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It raises no problems. Moreover due to its continuously variability it has a quite nature. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.500
But nevertheless if you want to use it manually then due to its locked ratios it gives you the feeling as if you are driving with a normal classic type gearbox. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Due to developing 320 Nm or torque over 1750 rpm the engine offers pleasant driving features. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I really admire this engine. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
As always you of course are curious about the fuel consumption of the X-Trail. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But unfortunately this time I'll not be able to give any figure. Because I had no chance of driving this car excessively at this route. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Anyway as you can see there is no license plate on this car. At the moment I'm driving this car with temporary license plate. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Therefore on the short route that I drove to pronounce a figure will not be correct. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But let me tell you that as the X-Trail has similar weight and dimensions as the Qashqai 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
it will be quite normal to have fuel consumption figures close to the Qashqai's since they use the same engine.  

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.000
There is only the automatic gearbox difference here and I guess that it may add half liter or maybe 1-liter more to the fuel consumption value. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The thing to be told about driving features is in general terms that it is comfortable. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Honestly I've mentioned earlier that the seats are comfortable. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
But the weight balance of the steering wheel and impact absorption characteristics of the suspensions really deserves praise. 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.000
The Nissan X-Trail with its modern design attracts more attention. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.500
Due to its 1.6-liter diesel engine it of course has more reasonable price than the previous one. 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.220
But if you don't need the extra 2 seats in the boot then the Qashqai seems to be a more logical choice. 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.000
See you...
