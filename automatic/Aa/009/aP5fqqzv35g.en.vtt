00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.199 
majority population we're not interested
in<00:03:57.200> plans<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.739> come<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:58.160> where<00:03:59.120> the

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
in plans that come in where the

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.539 
in plans that come in where the
corporate<00:03:59.540> sector<00:03:59.810> comes<00:04:00.079> in<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.380> only<00:04:00.650> uses

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
corporate sector comes in it only uses

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.059 
corporate sector comes in it only uses
the<00:04:01.579> majority<00:04:02.060> population<00:04:02.690> as<00:04:02.870> workers<00:04:03.200> we're

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
the majority population as workers we're

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.890 
the majority population as workers we're
concerned<00:04:04.370> about<00:04:04.519> control<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.480> ownership

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
and so this is an example of a an

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.250 
and so this is an example of a an
agricultural<00:04:11.030> project<00:04:11.209> which<00:04:11.599> is<00:04:11.750> controlled

able to control the revenue generated
from<00:04:16.639> this<00:04:17.150> farm<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:17.660> we<00:04:17.750> want<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.019> model<00:04:18.440> not

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
from this farm and we want to model not

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.229 
from this farm and we want to model not
only<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.949> growing<00:04:19.280> techniques

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
only the growing techniques

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
leadership within the city but most

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.770 
leadership within the city but most
importantly<00:05:13.099> we<00:05:13.370> think<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:13.819> not<00:05:14.090> so<00:05:14.360> much<00:05:14.479> even

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
importantly we think is not so much even

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.210 
importantly we think is not so much even
in<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.930> political<00:05:15.349> leadership<00:05:15.590> but<00:05:15.949> what's

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
in the political leadership but what's

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.279 
in the political leadership but what's
most<00:05:16.430> important<00:05:16.880> is<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.150> people<00:05:17.569> being

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
most important is the people being

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.080 
most important is the people being
mobilized<00:05:18.889> in<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.340> people's<00:05:19.699> consciousness

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090

being<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.789> way<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.060> work<00:05:23.449> on<00:05:23.569> their<00:05:23.750> own<00:05:23.780> behalf

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
being a way to work on their own behalf

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.129 
being a way to work on their own behalf
once<00:05:25.009> people<00:05:25.219> are<00:05:25.400> mobilized<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.300> see<00:05:26.509> that

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
once people are mobilized and see that

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.870 
once people are mobilized and see that
they<00:05:27.320> can<00:05:27.380> begin<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.860> work<00:05:28.219> for<00:05:28.580> their<00:05:28.699> own
