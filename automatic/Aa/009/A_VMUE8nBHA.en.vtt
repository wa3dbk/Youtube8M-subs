00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.069
 hello how good is that 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.980
 I'm doing videos of simple things 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.130
 about the botxo another user in the 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.300
 comments tells me that he has a 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.600
 just got a vocho from the 90s 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:24.410
 he says he has the original cat 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.199
 the cat of 8 but I do not know where it is placed 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.560
 and on the other hand I do not know where he keeps 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.230
 very well is fair is fair and if it is 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.030
 true there is this is in this kind of 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.260
 webs always and of course if with pleasure 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.910
 I'm going to make a very short video about 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.990
 where the cat is placed how 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.930
 use and where it is saved true good what 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:52.190
 first is where is where should the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.670
 original botxo cat kept good 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.220
 our original botxo cat from 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.170
 Volkswagen factory decided to put it down 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.110
 of the seat here behind the battery 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.400
 then for this to work the bocho 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 should have 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 of metal that is there right now that takes away 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.540
 the hook will see it better and a 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.680
 small metal hook for 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.320
 keep it in place then what 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.450
 I'm going to do, I'm going to remove it with a 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:30.740
 the screwdriver is already and now only with the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.430
 hand we removed the the the cat and had 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.890
 how it goes like that and there's the support for 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 stop the cat yes yes battle in a little 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.229
 just pushing or doing that 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.660
 support with the hand I tell them is not no 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.750
 he has a lot of science he is not soldier with 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.400
 with a very thick metal this is then 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.060
 can easily accommodate truth 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.020
 so this is how the cat should go 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.940
 original here is 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.760
 the next question told me where was 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.980
 place to lift the boob if we 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.979
 let's go here the height of the rim 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.400
 back here below we will find this 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.920
 support 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.250
 this is where our cat goes 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.900
 to be able to raise our 8 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.730
 unfortunately because the eights are 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.519
 many muds with time and with 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.560
 blows because we can go bending there 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.269
 is when our original cat 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.840
 it may even become unusable 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.120
 because they are the only supports 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.680
 the combi for example also has its 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.080
 own supports but the combi has 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.700
 four for its length and the cat 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.220
 original of the combi is also like 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.170
 this one but it's longer then for 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.660
 place it what we're going to do is this 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.989
 then what we are going to do is 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.390
 insert this part of the cat here in the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.010
 support is maybe a bit loose 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.730
 do not worry about that, let's use 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.060
 this lever and like a crank this goes 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.060
 to go down 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.150
 so let's make sure that it fits 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.250
 ok on the floor if you want to put something 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.080
 down this plate so it does not slip 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.069
 I think it's good but it's not so 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.610
 necessary and turning our crank 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.230
 let's go lifting our 8 pulling 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.350
 to the right to the hands of the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:31.050
 Watch how it is going up 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:34.709
 he listens truthfully then and has gone 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:40.190
 going up and to download it only what 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:42.090
 we do the reverse we go down here 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.630
 until our cat is 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.180
 completely free truth 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.810
 until my spirit is already free and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.670
 we get out that's all this is the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.050
 function and this is how you should use this 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.530
 cat 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.940
 as simple as that now in those 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.460
 supports that you saw maybe 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.770
 many many no longer have them so 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.450
 same that I tell you based on blows and 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.860
 Over time, they can be 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.860
 detach can fall 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.870
 What can I recommend for this case? 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.370
 Well look at those who want those who 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.100
 they still have their original expense and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.940
 they want to use it because they are going to have to 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.629
 go to a junkyard or yonke and 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.220
 look for these supports 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:33.090
 unless they have a tinsmith who 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.909
 I can do something to them something that serves them 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.909
 with that cat but try to make it 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:41.699
 sure because there will be nothing worse than 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:43.650
 place an adaptation that are 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.840
 changing a tire or something and suddenly 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.270
 that adaptation fails and the boom falls 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.680
 and they already know not the consequences 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.820
 they can be even fatal then good 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.550
 that is my recommendation 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.790
 I wait for the user who asks me for the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.930
 video that has been useful 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.570
 I hope that you also to those who do not 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.870
 they knew how like those who had the same 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.920
 doubt then I hope it serves you and we 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.920
 we see until the next
