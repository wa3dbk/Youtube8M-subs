00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 war conditions of economic crisis and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.600
 political disputes in Ukraine almost 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.309
 passed unnoticed event which 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 another time would have caused a spicy 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.360
 Chernobyl zone discontent began 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.639
 construction of waste storage 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.680
 nuclear fuel country that survived 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.350
 the worst man-made disaster in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.970
 history will be a new dangerous object 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.810
 expert opinion listened to our 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.550
 Timur Syr Oziev 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.029
 kilometers of deaf fence belted 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.980
 barbed wire everywhere you look 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 dead land is completely saturated 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.270
 radioactive substances and that is the zone 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.059
 alienation of the Chernobyl NPP 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.070
 living and working here is forbidden where 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.450
 the biggest accident occurred in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.610
 history of nuclear energy 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 construction of a storage facility began 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.640
 nuclear waste specialists surprised 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.250
 haste with which it is taken so 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.739
 ambiguous decision by the authorities of Ukraine 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.270
 allocated land only in April in others 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.789
 countries only to choose places for 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.790
 vault issued a separate license 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.740
 why there geological 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.670
 research what exactly this area will be 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.390
 is safe 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.600
 and where the project is nothing but already selected. 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.670
 this has never been nuclear 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 waste will not be stored in deep 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.810
 heavy-duty concrete bins like this 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 make in most countries they will be placed 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.030
 on open areas in containers 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.939
 waste will be brought from nuclear power plants immediately 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.040
 no recycling is key 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.900
 spent nuclear fuel is extremely 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.600
 hazardous radioactive material 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.090
 even microscopic particles are deadly 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.130
 dangerous any abnormal situation by 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.110
 professional opinion can turn into 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.869
 a catastrophe for the whole of Europe and Russia 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.750
 any fuel even if it is already unloaded 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.450
 from the reactor it emits a lot of energy 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.040
 heat comes from it and so that it does not exist 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.470
 no nuclear accident this heat is necessary 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.719
 shoot simply put should they should 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.930
 be in water, respectively, water 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.150
 should be cooled and so on then 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.210
 that is, if the fuel overheats then 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.630
 about to happen nuclear accident so 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.940
 what happened in fukushima ukraine 4 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.370
 operating nuclear power stations Zaporizhia 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.550
 rabbinical Khmelnitsky South Ukrainian 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.930
 they installed 15 units they 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.030
 produce half of everything 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.250
 electricity in the country by quantity 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.820
 Reactors of Ukraine ranks fifth in 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.310
 Europe 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.980
 10 in the world NPP are working on Russian 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.630
 nuclear fuel waste 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.209
 return to Russia where it 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.239
 recycle create new 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.610
 nuclear facility in which there will be 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.950
 to be stored 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.850
 high level nuclear materials 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.510
 accordingly increase risks and threats with 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.280
 point of view there terrorism and so on 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.560
 instead of security, Kiev authorities 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.140
 talk about money vault will allow 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.180
 save Ukraine pays Russia for 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.520
 nuclear shipment transportation 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.020
 waste that's just why it took 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.730
 spend millions of dollars on 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.720
 expensive object when budgeted 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.100
 huge hole 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.049
 then all the same energy issues 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.209
 independence since we don't have to 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.820
 depend on one service provider 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.500
 American brand westinghouse fuels 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.330
 alternative to Russian on him and 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.209
 plan to go Ukrainian nuclear scientists 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.670
 and not the first time in 2010 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.299
 South Ukrainian NPP worked on fuel 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.910
 and us 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.170
 then serious problems arose 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.450
 power units had to stop 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.280
 repair reactors are built by 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.530
 Soviet project and calculated 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.299
 exclusively on our fuel from 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.269
 American had to be abandoned 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.970
 the experiment cost the treasury 175 million 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.860
 dollars in the Czech Republic is the same attempt to replace 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.019
 fuel nearly turned into tragedy 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.360
 environmentalists staged numerous actions 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.000
 protest scientists demanded a revision 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.650
 decision 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 under the influence of radiation fuel 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.130
 elements of American production 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.020
 bent and lost tightness 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.820
 there was a leak of radioactive water in 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.370
 reactor loop is an emergency 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.170
 then the state nuclear committee 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.850
 regulation of Ukraine banned 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.280
 use of American fuel 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.840
 half a year ago the manager who 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.480
 adopted such a decision new Kiev 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.580
 authorities fired repeat failed 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.680
 the experiment now does not interfere 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.300
 problem to do with waste 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.000
 american fuel laws usa 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.280
 prohibit the carriage of the country radioactive 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.840
 waste therefore it was decided to create 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.150
 storage in Ukraine 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.340
 engaged in the construction of the American 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.390
 the company indicated in the project that it is only 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.420
 first of all 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.790
 so maybe 2 and 3 exactly in 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.770
 this opportunity according to experts 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.290
 and the main danger lies 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.890
 we can not exclude the possibility that this 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.280
 the vault will go and go 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.200
 fuel waste fuel and 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.900
 foreign origin of European countries 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.780
 so we will have in Ukraine 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.180
 storage and spent wind on fuel 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.890
 Not only 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.990
 Ukraine but also other countries of Europe in 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.880
 next year the Ukrainian government in 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.490
 one and a half times reduces the cost of 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.230
 content and c on security in 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.050
 same time switching to american 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.700
 fuel will increase 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.430
 costs its cost is higher than the Russian 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.919
 50 percent if the project is 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.169
 implemented according to experts of Ukraine 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.800
 may pay too high for it 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.990
 the price 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.310
