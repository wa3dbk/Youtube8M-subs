that's<00:00:41.899> mainly<00:00:42.229> that's<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:43.039> reason<00:00:43.339> why<00:00:43.519> this

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
that's mainly that's the reason why this

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.789 
that's mainly that's the reason why this
gun<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:44.899> bad<00:00:45.859> and<00:00:46.579> you<00:00:47.539> see<00:00:47.749> also<00:00:47.899> this

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
gun is so bad and you see also this

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.160 
gun is so bad and you see also this
restaurant<00:00:49.219> sniper<00:00:49.399> rifle<00:00:49.699> got<00:00:49.819> to<00:00:49.969> the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
restaurant sniper rifle got to the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.919 
restaurant sniper rifle got to the
Russian<00:00:51.170> sniper<00:00:51.319> scope<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.389> disco<00:00:53.389> or<00:00:53.629> we'll

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
Russian sniper scope and disco or we'll

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.039 
Russian sniper scope and disco or we'll
all<00:00:54.049> also<00:00:54.769> make<00:00:54.949> this<00:00:55.190> gun<00:00:55.809> some<00:00:56.809> worse

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
all also make this gun some worse

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.549 
all also make this gun some worse
because<00:00:57.519> it<00:00:58.519> will<00:00:58.670> be<00:00:58.819> hard<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.089> use<00:00:59.299> at<00:00:59.559> longer

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
because it will be hard to use at longer

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.229 
because it will be hard to use at longer
ranges<00:01:01.389> and<00:01:03.369> if<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:04.519> are<00:01:04.640> going<00:01:04.879> for<00:01:05.030> body
