00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
much darker so my suggestion would be

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.950 
much darker so my suggestion would be
first<00:04:35.680> try<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.130> lose<00:04:36.580> weight<00:04:36.880> because<00:04:37.330> as<00:04:37.690> long

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
first try to lose weight because as long

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.700 
first try to lose weight because as long
as<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.440> rob<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:40.120> useless<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:41.260> use<00:04:41.440> my

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
as you rob it's useless to use my

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.920 
as you rob it's useless to use my
products<00:04:42.280> because<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.060> will<00:04:43.240> help<00:04:43.389> to<00:04:43.690> lighten

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
products because it will help to lighten

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.080 
products because it will help to lighten
but<00:04:44.440> actually<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.130> will<00:04:45.310> make<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.669> skin<00:04:45.790> more

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
but actually it will make the skin more

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.129 
but actually it will make the skin more
sensitive<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.870> if<00:04:47.380> they<00:04:47.620> are<00:04:47.710> still<00:04:47.860> rubbing

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
sensitive and if they are still rubbing

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.990 
sensitive and if they are still rubbing
it<00:04:50.139> can<00:04:50.590> make<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.980> actually<00:04:51.160> worse

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
it can make it actually worse

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.150 
it can make it actually worse
