loved through this book to try and find

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.220 
loved through this book to try and find
exactly<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.210> looks<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.050> really

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
exactly what it looks like it was really

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.790 
exactly what it looks like it was really
hard<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> find<00:00:19.740> one<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.400> think<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.880> guy<00:00:21.180> has

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
hard to find one so I think this guy has

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.509 
hard to find one so I think this guy has
on<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.250> best<00:00:23.550> representation<00:00:24.680> of<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.859> um

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
on like the best representation of it um

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.580 
on like the best representation of it um
yeah<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.869> actually<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.470> much

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
yeah I think it's actually pretty much

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.950 
yeah I think it's actually pretty much
identical<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.970> let<00:00:30.599> me<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:30.869> if
