off but this is just so awesome really

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.990 
off but this is just so awesome really
nice<00:01:59.409> and<00:02:00.299> different<00:02:01.299> for<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.840> wallet<00:02:02.229> but<00:02:02.439> cool

nice and different for a wallet but cool

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.639 
nice and different for a wallet but cool
because<00:02:04.000> we<00:02:04.299> don't<00:02:04.479> see<00:02:04.539> much<00:02:04.780> green<00:02:05.379> like

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
because we don't see much green like

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.729 
because we don't see much green like
this<00:02:05.859> it's<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.549> different<00:02:07.000> type<00:02:07.299> of<00:02:07.359> brain<00:02:07.739> move

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
this it's a different type of brain move

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.069 
this it's a different type of brain move
on<00:02:08.829> to<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.160> second<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.880> song<00:02:10.119> called<00:02:10.329> demonic

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
on to the second a song called demonic

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.520 
on to the second a song called demonic
energy<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.849> is<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> low-level<00:02:13.840> sow

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
energy this is like a low-level sow

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.479 
energy this is like a low-level sow
think<00:02:14.829> most<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.459> it's<00:02:16.389> like<00:02:16.599> a<00:02:16.630> bright<00:02:17.489> red

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
think most of it it's like a bright red

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.849 
think most of it it's like a bright red
orange<00:02:19.030> yellow<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> bright<00:02:20.200> warlock<00:02:20.680> so

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
orange yellow like a bright warlock so

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.129 
orange yellow like a bright warlock so
you<00:02:21.099> don't<00:02:21.280> see<00:02:21.430> many<00:02:21.549> of<00:02:21.730> them<00:02:21.910> nowadays<00:02:22.150> you

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:23.139 
you don't see many of them nowadays you

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.500 
you don't see many of them nowadays you
see<00:02:23.169> all<00:02:23.410> dark<00:02:23.709> on<00:02:23.889> so<00:02:24.130> it's<00:02:24.280> really<00:02:24.510> unique

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
see all dark on so it's really unique

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.750 
see all dark on so it's really unique
and<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:26.200> change<00:02:26.829> from<00:02:27.069> what<00:02:27.280> they<00:02:27.400> normally<00:02:27.549> are

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
