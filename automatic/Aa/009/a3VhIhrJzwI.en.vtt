00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
the hairnet which can be a little tricky

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.710

at times what you want to do is just

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.369 
at times what you want to do is just
kind<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.400> position<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.549> back<00:03:21.109> so<00:03:22.109> that<00:03:22.139> it

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
kind of position it back so that it

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.250 
kind of position it back so that it
won't<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.609> so<00:03:23.819> hard<00:03:24.060> for<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.329> wrap<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:25.049> net

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
won't be so hard for you to wrap the net

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.900 
won't be so hard for you to wrap the net
around<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:26.010> look<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.430> you're<00:03:26.549> trying<00:03:26.849> to

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
around the look that you're trying to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.159 
around the look that you're trying to
achieve<00:03:27.269> at<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.569> end<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.870> day<00:03:28.019> is

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.740 
achieve at the end of the day is
something<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:29.129> and<00:03:29.549> it's<00:03:30.180> hard<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.510> do

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
something like this and it's hard to do

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.970 
something like this and it's hard to do
that<00:03:30.959> when<00:03:31.199> you<00:03:31.290> have<00:03:31.319> locks<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.859> are

feel<00:03:33.569> like<00:03:33.599> using<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.699> thousand<00:03:35.699> and<00:03:35.849> one<00:03:35.959> of

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
feel like using a thousand and one of

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.500 
feel like using a thousand and one of
bobby<00:03:37.260> pins<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.099> that's<00:03:38.790> where<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> hairnet

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
make sure to all back like that if you

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.990 
make sure to all back like that if you
decided<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.859> do<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> little<00:03:53.250> thing<00:03:53.519> like<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.819> did

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
decided to do a little thing like I did

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.699 
decided to do a little thing like I did
at<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.120> top<00:03:54.359> make<00:03:54.690> sure<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:55.079> not<00:03:55.230> covering

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
at the top make sure it's not covering

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.059 
at the top make sure it's not covering
it<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.280> then<00:03:56.579> you<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:57.060> pull<00:03:57.359> it<00:03:58.069> tight

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
it and then you just pull it tight

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.790 
it and then you just pull it tight
enough

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.670 

and<00:04:05.310> sometimes<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.820> have<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.180> sit<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.350> mirror

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
and sometimes I have to sit in a mirror

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680 
and sometimes I have to sit in a mirror
and<00:04:07.830> do<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.400> few<00:04:08.670> times<00:04:08.700> before<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.330> can<00:04:09.420> get

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
and do this a few times before I can get

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.550 
and do this a few times before I can get
it<00:04:09.780> right<00:04:09.990> so<00:04:11.450> might<00:04:12.450> take<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> minute<00:04:13.110> before

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
it right so might take a minute before

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.300 
it right so might take a minute before
you<00:04:13.950> mold<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:16.200> shape<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.740> want<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.130> to

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
you mold it to the shape you want it to

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.910 
you mold it to the shape you want it to
me<00:04:17.490> there's<00:04:18.360> no<00:04:18.480> specific<00:04:18.720> way<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.320> how<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.620> do

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
me there's no specific way to how I do
