for those of you who need to learn to
put<00:00:08.200> the<00:00:08.290> corset<00:00:08.680> on<00:00:08.740> by<00:00:08.980> yourself<00:00:09.160> these

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
put the corset on by yourself these

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.290 
put the corset on by yourself these
would<00:00:10.330> be<00:00:10.420> some<00:00:10.629> simple<00:00:11.020> directions<00:00:12.030> first<00:00:13.030> of

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
would be some simple directions first of

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.010 
would be some simple directions first of
all<00:00:13.450> look<00:00:14.320> at<00:00:14.349> the<00:00:14.679> back<00:00:14.860> of<00:00:14.889> your<00:00:15.130> courses

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
all look at the back of your courses

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.960 
all look at the back of your courses
you'll<00:00:17.020> notice<00:00:17.529> that<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.189> loops<00:00:18.460> that<00:00:18.610> tie

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
you'll notice that the loops that tie

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.179 
you'll notice that the loops that tie
the<00:00:19.029> corset<00:00:19.570> together<00:00:19.900> are<00:00:20.200> in<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.860> very

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
the corset together are in the very

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.320 
the corset together are in the very
syndrome<00:00:22.090> this<00:00:22.750> is<00:00:22.930> what<00:00:23.140> we<00:00:23.320> refer<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.740> as

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
syndrome this is what we refer to as

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.269 
syndrome this is what we refer to as
bi-directional<00:00:25.330> you<00:00:25.990> have<00:00:26.260> three<00:00:26.680> sets<00:00:27.070> of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
bi-directional you have three sets of

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.470 
bi-directional you have three sets of
cross<00:00:27.580> X's<00:00:28.240> above<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:29.050> loop<00:00:30.119> three<00:00:31.119> steps

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
cross X's above the loop three steps

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.560 
cross X's above the loop three steps
below<00:00:31.779> this<00:00:32.710> allows<00:00:33.160> you<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.670> tighten<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.300> top

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
below this allows you to tighten the top

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.509 
below this allows you to tighten the top
and<00:00:34.989> leave<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.500> bottom<00:00:35.860> looser<00:00:36.309> or

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
and leave the bottom looser or

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.750 
and leave the bottom looser or
vice-versa<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:38.530> you<00:00:38.739> want<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.220> loops<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.729> be

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
vice-versa that you want the loops to be

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:49.240 
vice-versa that you want the loops to be
dead<00:00:40.570> center

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.410 

so<00:00:49.820> put<00:00:50.030> on<00:00:50.060> your<00:00:50.240> corset<00:00:51.610> open<00:00:52.610> it<00:00:52.730> up<00:00:52.910> the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
so put on your corset open it up the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.810 
so put on your corset open it up the
full<00:00:53.870> length<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.620> want<00:00:54.830> to<00:00:54.950> extend<00:00:55.400> it<00:00:55.550> where

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
full length you want to extend it where

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.230 
full length you want to extend it where
you<00:00:55.910> have<00:00:55.940> no<00:00:56.360> slack<00:00:56.810> it<00:00:57.500> helps<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.610> BAM<00:00:58.970> the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
you have no slack it helps to BAM the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.900 
you have no slack it helps to BAM the
corset<00:00:59.810> out<00:01:00.080> so<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.190> have<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.460> little

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
corset out so that you have a little

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.330 
corset out so that you have a little
wider<00:01:02.210> area<00:01:02.810> at<00:01:03.020> the<00:01:03.170> top<00:01:03.410> than<00:01:03.860> at<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.130> bottom

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340 
wider area at the top than at the bottom

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.970 
wider area at the top than at the bottom
this<00:01:05.270> is<00:01:05.449> because<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.960> rib<00:01:06.140> cage<00:01:06.440> is<00:01:06.650> usually

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
this is because the rib cage is usually

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.670 
this is because the rib cage is usually
the<00:01:07.100> larger<00:01:07.520> part<00:01:07.790> of<00:01:07.850> your<00:01:08.000> abdomen<00:01:08.210> on<00:01:08.840> the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
the larger part of your abdomen on the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.460 
the larger part of your abdomen on the
laced<00:01:10.100> corsets<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.360> tags<00:01:11.690> should<00:01:12.110> be<00:01:12.230> at<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
laced corsets the tags should be at the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.610 
laced corsets the tags should be at the
top<00:01:13.150> once<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:14.300> have<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:14.630> extended<00:01:15.230> you'll<00:01:15.440> put

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
top once you have it extended you'll put

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:23.469 
top once you have it extended you'll put
this<00:01:15.740> around<00:01:16.130> yourself<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:21.850> make<00:01:22.850> sure<00:01:23.210> that

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
this around yourself and make sure that

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.870 
this around yourself and make sure that
you<00:01:23.660> have<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.080> centered<00:01:24.619> it's<00:01:25.160> hard<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.670> move

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
you have it centered it's hard to move

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.260 
you have it centered it's hard to move
the<00:01:26.030> course<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:26.540> once<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:26.930> tightened<00:01:27.500> it

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
the course that once you tightened it

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.760 
the course that once you tightened it
when<00:01:29.270> your<00:01:29.420> corsets<00:01:29.840> new<00:01:30.170> you'll<00:01:30.410> have<00:01:30.619> to

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
when your corsets new you'll have to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.250 
when your corsets new you'll have to
work<00:01:30.979> with<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.280> front<00:01:31.580> closure<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.300> bus<00:01:32.510> to

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
work with the front closure the bus to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.560 
work with the front closure the bus to
make<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.560> work<00:01:33.770> correctly<00:01:34.280> but<00:01:34.850> after<00:01:35.420> it's

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
make it work correctly but after it's

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.490 
make it work correctly but after it's
your<00:01:35.720> corset<00:01:37.810> then<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.990> should<00:01:39.200> go<00:01:39.350> together

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
your corset then it should go together

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.890 
your corset then it should go together
very<00:01:39.770> simply<00:01:40.610> should<00:01:40.940> pop<00:01:41.270> right<00:01:41.630> together

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
very simply should pop right together

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.070 
very simply should pop right together
because<00:01:42.410> it<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.650> molded<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.280> your<00:01:43.400> body<00:01:44.080> make

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
because it is molded to your body make

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.540 
because it is molded to your body make
sure<00:01:45.410> that<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:45.770> have<00:01:45.950> all<00:01:46.190> of<00:01:46.250> these

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
sure that you have all of these

sure that you have all of these
fasteners<00:01:47.150> closed<00:01:47.770> if<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.830> need<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.369> pull<00:01:49.640> the

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
fasteners closed if you need to pull the

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.150 
fasteners closed if you need to pull the
corset<00:01:50.180> down<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.390> little<00:01:50.720> bit<00:01:50.930> just<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.410> settle
