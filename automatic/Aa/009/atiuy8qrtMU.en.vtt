00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
10 20 minutes to come and train on this

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.080 
10 20 minutes to come and train on this
pitch

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
pitch

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.460 
pitch
so<00:00:18.179> it<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:18.420> asleep<00:00:18.690> cut<00:00:18.930> overcome<00:00:19.289> some

so it really asleep cut overcome some

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.630 
so it really asleep cut overcome some
challenges<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> way<00:00:20.010> haven't<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.400> yeah

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
challenges on the way haven't you yeah

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.120 
challenges on the way haven't you yeah
definitely<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:22.110> don't<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.920> ever<00:00:22.949> will

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
definitely we I don't think we ever will

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.290 
definitely we I don't think we ever will
get<00:00:23.430> rug<00:00:23.550> burn<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.820> curriculum<00:00:24.180> at<00:00:24.270> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
get rug burn the curriculum at the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.849 
get rug burn the curriculum at the
school<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.050> certainly<00:00:25.500> won't<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
school and we certainly won't get a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.590 
school and we certainly won't get a
pitch<00:00:26.100> because<00:00:26.310> we're<00:00:26.460> quite<00:00:26.609> landlocked<00:00:27.029> but

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
pitch because we're quite landlocked but

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.240 
pitch because we're quite landlocked but
having<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.050> link<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.470> old<00:00:28.680> ruts<00:00:28.920> has<00:00:29.070> been

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
having this link with old ruts has been

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189 
having this link with old ruts has been
brilliant<00:00:29.609> because<00:00:29.820> all<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.720> boys<00:00:30.869> play<00:00:31.109> at

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
brilliant because all the boys play at

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.569

the<00:00:31.260> same<00:00:31.439> club<00:00:31.650> together<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.189> they're<00:00:32.340> used

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

to playing in exactly the same style

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.710 
to playing in exactly the same style
they're<00:00:35.220> very<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:35.760> good<00:00:36.000> friends<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> that

they're very very good friends and that

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.210 
they're very very good friends and that
helps<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.770> play<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.130> each

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
helps because they really play for each

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.600 
helps because they really play for each
other

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
other

what's<00:00:38.760> been<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:38.910> secret<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.390> success<00:00:39.870> for

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
what's been the secret to success for

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.000 
what's been the secret to success for
your<00:00:40.140> team<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> good

other in and out and we've just got that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.729 
other in and out and we've just got that
chemistry<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.870> team<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.559> you're

not<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.040> friends<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.910> chemistry<00:00:54.360> isn't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
not really friends the chemistry isn't

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.639 
not really friends the chemistry isn't
there<00:00:54.719> even<00:00:54.840> know<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.140> you're<00:00:55.260> good<00:00:55.440> players

need for one about it he well he breaks
the<00:01:16.799> line<00:01:16.979> well<00:01:17.219> makes<00:01:17.729> his<00:01:17.909> tackles<00:01:18.329> he's<00:01:19.049> not

it's absolutely changed some of their
lives<00:01:25.400> for<00:01:25.729> some<00:01:25.880> of<00:01:26.000> them<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.210> got<00:01:26.390> them<00:01:26.540> out

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
lives for some of them it's got them out

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.480 
lives for some of them it's got them out
of<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.900> pathway<00:01:27.290> that<00:01:27.680> could<00:01:27.950> have<00:01:28.070> taken<00:01:28.250> them

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
of a pathway that could have taken them

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.850 
of a pathway that could have taken them
really<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.420> wrong<00:01:29.570> way<00:01:29.720> for<00:01:29.930> others<00:01:30.530> it's

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
really the wrong way for others it's

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.890 
really the wrong way for others it's
created<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.850> social<00:01:32.030> environment<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.690> they

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
created a social environment that they

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.660 
created a social environment that they
otherwise<00:01:33.020> wouldn't<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.590> had<00:01:33.710> some<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:34.580> them

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
otherwise wouldn't have had some of them

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.249 
otherwise wouldn't have had some of them
stayed<00:01:35.000> in<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.180> hotel<00:01:35.299> for<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.780> first<00:01:36.020> time

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
stayed in a hotel for the first time

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.660 
stayed in a hotel for the first time
when<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:36.530> went<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.890> semi-finals

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
when we went to the semi-finals

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.880 
when we went to the semi-finals
so<00:01:38.180> it's<00:01:38.570> really<00:01:38.780> open<00:01:39.229> their<00:01:39.380> eyes<00:01:39.409> up<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.860> a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
so it's really open their eyes up to a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.020 
so it's really open their eyes up to a
completely<00:01:40.280> different<00:01:40.490> world<00:01:40.759> I<00:01:40.970> suppose

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
completely different world I suppose

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.490 
completely different world I suppose
especially<00:01:41.720> going<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.930> some<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.259> schools

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
especially going to some of the schools

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.719 
especially going to some of the schools
that<00:01:42.560> we've<00:01:42.740> gone<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.220> we've<00:01:43.310> seen<00:01:43.520> some

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
that we've gone to and we've seen some

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.700 
that we've gone to and we've seen some
of<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.330> facilities<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:45.020> think<00:01:45.050> they've

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
of the the facilities I think they've

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.960 
of the the facilities I think they've
been<00:01:45.740> at<00:01:46.009> gravely<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.490> they've<00:01:46.580> just<00:01:46.610> always

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
been at gravely and they've just always

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.310 
been at gravely and they've just always
thought<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.270> other<00:01:47.540> schools<00:01:47.869> are<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.170> like

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
thought that other schools are just like

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.230 
thought that other schools are just like
gravely<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.610> go<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.759> a<00:01:49.909> school<00:01:50.119> where

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
gravely and to go to a school where

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.550 
gravely and to go to a school where
they've<00:01:50.390> got<00:01:50.570> probably<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.899> third<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.380> number

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
they've got probably a third of a number

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.830 
they've got probably a third of a number
of<00:01:51.619> kids<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:52.280> 30<00:01:52.970> times<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.600> amount<00:01:53.720> of

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
of kids but 30 times the amount of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.370 
of kids but 30 times the amount of
facilities<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.649> I<00:01:55.270> suppose<00:01:56.270> what<00:01:56.899> I<00:01:56.929> like<00:01:57.170> is

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
facilities is I suppose what I like is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.290 
facilities is I suppose what I like is
that<00:01:57.500> they<00:01:57.619> don't<00:01:58.009> take<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.520> negatively<00:01:59.119> they

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
that they don't take it negatively they

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.790 
that they don't take it negatively they
don't<00:01:59.539> start<00:01:59.899> moaning<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:00.410> whinging<00:02:00.679> that

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
don't start moaning and whinging that

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.230 
don't start moaning and whinging that
they<00:02:00.920> all<00:02:01.100> we<00:02:01.310> don't<00:02:01.460> have<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.090> don't

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
they all we don't have this and we don't

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.029

before<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:58.459> we're<00:02:58.579> not<00:02:58.700> on<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:58.850> circuit<00:02:59.510> of

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
before and we're not on that circuit of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.479 
before and we're not on that circuit of
traditional<00:03:00.470> rugby<00:03:00.680> playing<00:03:00.890> school<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.430> I

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
traditional rugby playing school so I

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.039 
traditional rugby playing school so I
think<00:03:01.609> they<00:03:02.180> think<00:03:02.450> oh<00:03:02.510> we've<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:02.900> entered

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
think they think oh we've just entered

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.360 
think they think oh we've just entered
another<00:03:03.380> competition<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.070> think<00:03:04.250> now

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
another competition but I think now

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.470 
another competition but I think now
we're<00:03:04.549> playing<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.790> trick<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.180> think<00:03:05.390> they

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
we're playing a trick and I think they

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.699 
we're playing a trick and I think they
realise<00:03:05.810> actually<00:03:05.989> yeah<00:03:06.260> there's<00:03:06.470> probably

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
realise actually yeah there's probably

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.259 
realise actually yeah there's probably
something<00:03:06.890> quite<00:03:07.130> important<00:03:07.519> about<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.820> yeah

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
something quite important about it yeah

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.640 
something quite important about it yeah
it's<00:03:08.420> great<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.780> see<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:08.989> state<00:03:09.200> school<00:03:09.440> going

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
it's great to see a state school going

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
I've seen in their highlight reel we've

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.800 
I've seen in their highlight reel we've
got<00:03:39.220> shown<00:03:39.400> earlier<00:03:39.849> with<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.450> gas<00:03:40.599> they've

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
got shown earlier with the gas they've

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.690 
got shown earlier with the gas they've
gotten<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.620> natural<00:03:41.950> ability<00:03:42.099> got<00:03:42.549> where

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
gotten the natural ability got where

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.309 
gotten the natural ability got where
they<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:43.060> push<00:03:43.239> anything<00:03:43.629> so<00:03:43.870> hopefully<00:03:44.230> it's

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
they can push anything so hopefully it's

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.930 
they can push anything so hopefully it's
a<00:03:44.380> dry<00:03:44.560> weather<00:03:44.890> day<00:03:45.130> for<00:03:45.160> them<00:03:45.459> because<00:03:45.790> I

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
a dry weather day for them because I

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.039 
a dry weather day for them because I
think<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.330> know<00:03:46.420> they<00:03:46.510> could<00:03:46.690> cause<00:03:46.900> some

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
think you know they could cause some

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:47.610 
think you know they could cause some
serious<00:03:47.200> damage

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
serious damage

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.870 
serious damage
I<00:03:47.739> mean<00:03:47.860> we've<00:03:48.010> overcome<00:03:48.370> some<00:03:48.640> huge

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
I mean we've overcome some huge

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.270 
I mean we've overcome some huge
obstacles<00:03:49.390> it's<00:03:50.049> it's<00:03:50.620> been<00:03:50.829> something<00:03:51.069> that

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
obstacles it's it's been something that

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.710 
obstacles it's it's been something that
I<00:03:51.310> suppose<00:03:51.760> has<00:03:51.910> made<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.180> achievement<00:03:52.630> even

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
I suppose has made the achievement even

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.509 
I suppose has made the achievement even
more<00:03:52.989> remarkable<00:03:53.500> because<00:03:53.680> we've<00:03:54.040> not<00:03:54.190> had<00:03:54.370> it

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
more remarkable because we've not had it

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.430 
more remarkable because we've not had it
all<00:03:54.610> on<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.790> plate<00:03:55.060> or<00:03:55.239> anything<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.319> know

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
they've really enjoyed it as a result a

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.789 
they've really enjoyed it as a result a
