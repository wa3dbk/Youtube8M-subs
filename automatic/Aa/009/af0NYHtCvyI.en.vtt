hi<00:00:05.850> guys<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.330> shocking<00:00:06.690> I'm<00:00:07.379> just<00:00:07.649> going

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
hi guys this is shocking I'm just going

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.009 
hi guys this is shocking I'm just going
to<00:00:07.890> take<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.280> around<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:09.059> USA<00:00:09.510> International

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
to take you around the USA International

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.740 
to take you around the USA International
Circuit<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:11.190> these<00:00:11.460> three<00:00:11.670> stock<00:00:11.880> cars<00:00:12.090> this

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
Circuit in these three stock cars this

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.990 
Circuit in these three stock cars this
is<00:00:12.929> how<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.049> like<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.740> not<00:00:14.490> everyone<00:00:14.730> is

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
is how I like to do it not everyone is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.630 
is how I like to do it not everyone is
the<00:00:15.089> same<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.800> this<00:00:16.800> might<00:00:16.980> not<00:00:17.130> benefit<00:00:17.520> all

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the same so this might not benefit all

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.170 
the same so this might not benefit all
of<00:00:17.670> you

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
of you

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.570 
of you
hopefully<00:00:18.810> it'll<00:00:18.900> benefit<00:00:19.289> some<00:00:19.529> low<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.949> you

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
hopefully it'll benefit some low and you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.330 
hopefully it'll benefit some low and you
will<00:00:20.699> get<00:00:20.850> slightly<00:00:21.090> better<00:00:21.210> times<00:00:22.070> it's<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
will get slightly better times it's a

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.210 
will get slightly better times it's a
really<00:00:23.640> short<00:00:23.820> circuit<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:25.010> mistakes<00:00:26.010> get

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
really short circuit so mistakes get

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.179 
really short circuit so mistakes get
amplified<00:00:26.699> quite<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.840> lot<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.619> important<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
amplified quite a lot it's important to

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.999 
amplified quite a lot it's important to
be<00:00:29.279> nice<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.640> smooth<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.960> control<00:00:31.650> inputs

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
be nice and smooth on the control inputs

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.560 
be nice and smooth on the control inputs
and<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> nice<00:00:34.110> good<00:00:34.530> consistent<00:00:35.160> line

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
and to have a nice good consistent line

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.060 
and to have a nice good consistent line
so<00:00:36.570> let's<00:00:36.960> get<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.260> now<00:00:39.680> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so let's get going now this is just the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
so let's get going now this is just the
up<00:00:41.190> lap<00:00:41.399> though<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.450> important

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
up lap though it's important

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.770 
up lap though it's important
look<00:00:44.039> after<00:00:44.219> tires<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:45.420> know<00:00:45.570> even

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.639 

as<00:00:50.140> you<00:00:50.320> see<00:00:50.500> they're<00:00:50.710> coming<00:00:51.070> up

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
as you see they're coming up

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.599 
as you see they're coming up
let's<00:00:53.649> pause<00:00:53.829> it<00:00:53.859> coming<00:00:54.250> up<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.460> two<00:00:54.579> and

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
let's pause it coming up to two and

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.720 
let's pause it coming up to two and
three<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.210> ten<00:00:55.480> for<00:00:55.769> it's<00:00:56.769> really<00:00:57.370> important

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
three and ten for it's really important

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.790 
three and ten for it's really important
to<00:00:57.789> get<00:00:57.879> a<00:00:57.940> nice<00:00:58.180> exit<00:00:58.839> coming<00:00:59.350> out<00:00:59.589> of<00:00:59.680> turn

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
to get a nice exit coming out of turn

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.329 
to get a nice exit coming out of turn
four<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.480> straight<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:02.589> hot<00:01:03.190> lap

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
four for the straight the hot lap

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.359 
four for the straight the hot lap
doesn't<00:01:03.579> start<00:01:03.909> at<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.089> start<00:01:04.330> line<00:01:04.390> it<00:01:05.369> as

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
doesn't start at the start line it as

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.960 
doesn't start at the start line it as
many<00:01:06.700> might<00:01:07.090> think<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.540> starts<00:01:07.960> around<00:01:08.409> here

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
many might think it starts around here

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.910 
many might think it starts around here
with<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.000> nice<00:01:10.360> line<00:01:10.960> through<00:01:11.380> three<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:11.770> four

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
with a nice line through three and four

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.999 
with a nice line through three and four
to<00:01:12.190> give<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.460> nice<00:01:12.729> high<00:01:13.090> speed<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:14.740> high

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
to give you a nice high speed as high

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.800 
to give you a nice high speed as high
speed<00:01:15.070> as<00:01:15.430> possible<00:01:15.759> on<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.299> front<00:01:16.570> straight

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
speed as possible on the front straight

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.590 
speed as possible on the front straight
so<00:01:17.740> take<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.250> nice<00:01:18.369> high<00:01:18.580> line<00:01:18.759> into<00:01:19.030> three<00:01:19.180> but

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
so take a nice high line into three but

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.930 
so take a nice high line into three but
halfway<00:01:19.960> around<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.380> want<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.560> start<00:01:20.940> cutting

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
halfway around you want to start cutting

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.880 
halfway around you want to start cutting
in<00:01:22.270> toward<00:01:22.659> towards<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.619> apex<00:01:23.830> or<00:01:24.250> four<00:01:24.490> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
in toward towards the apex or four and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.770 
in toward towards the apex or four and
hitting<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.009> accelerator<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:28.270> our<00:01:28.360> maximum

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
hitting the accelerator for our maximum

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
hitting the accelerator for our maximum
speed<00:01:29.170> down<00:01:29.350> straight

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.620 

so<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.869> car<00:01:34.049> starts<00:01:34.320> biting<00:01:34.530> I'm<00:01:34.799> turning<00:01:35.190> in

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
so the car starts biting I'm turning in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.310 
so the car starts biting I'm turning in
towards<00:01:36.630> yellow<00:01:36.780> line

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
towards yellow line

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.370 
towards yellow line
nice<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.890> Becks<00:01:38.130> there

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190 

straight<00:01:41.060> as<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.360> over<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> start/finish

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
straight as you go over the start/finish

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.499 
straight as you go over the start/finish
line<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.580> doing<00:01:44.790> about<00:01:44.970> 105

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
line you want to be doing about 105

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.740 
line you want to be doing about 105
miles<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:45.930> hour<00:01:46.520> plus<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.700> minus<00:01:48.000> 1<00:01:48.960> or<00:01:49.049> 2<00:01:49.200> miles

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
miles an hour plus or minus 1 or 2 miles

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.770 
miles an hour plus or minus 1 or 2 miles
so<00:01:52.190> again<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.220> very<00:01:53.580> short<00:01:53.909> track<00:01:54.149> every<00:01:54.600> mile

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so again a very short track every mile

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.090 
so again a very short track every mile
now<00:01:54.960> where<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> lose<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.799> straight

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
now where you lose down the straight

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.469 
now where you lose down the straight
cause<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.610> owe

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
cause you owe

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.779 
cause you owe
quite<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> lot<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> time<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.340> overall<00:01:59.580> app

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
quite a lot of time on your overall app

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.550 
quite a lot of time on your overall app
so<00:02:00.119> making<00:02:00.539> sure<00:02:00.720> you're<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.080> as<00:02:01.229> fast<00:02:01.409> as

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so making sure you're going as fast as

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.010 
so making sure you're going as fast as
possible<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.070> important<00:02:02.600> coming<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.869> doing

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
possible is important coming up to doing

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.330 
possible is important coming up to doing
one<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.470> there's<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> couple<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.039> reference

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
one here there's a couple of reference

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.059 
one here there's a couple of reference
points<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.850> use<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.299> your<00:02:06.360> braking<00:02:07.069> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
points you can use for your braking the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.609 
points you can use for your braking the
white<00:02:08.220> lines<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:09.050> going<00:02:10.050> into<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.350> turn

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
white lines here going into the turn

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.979 
white lines here going into the turn
they're<00:02:11.370> quite<00:02:11.580> good<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.270> traffic<00:02:12.630> light<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
they're quite good the traffic light and

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.750 
they're quite good the traffic light and
shadow<00:02:13.470> they're<00:02:13.769> all<00:02:13.920> good<00:02:14.100> reference<00:02:14.430> points

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760

I<00:02:14.910> use<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.660> traffic<00:02:15.870> lights<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.860> white

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
I use the traffic lights and the white

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.830 
I use the traffic lights and the white

shadow here for my turning point you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.000 
shadow here for my turning point you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
want to turn in a little bit early and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.309 
want to turn in a little bit early and
keep<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.910> car<00:02:27.060> straight<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.690> into<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.140> top

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
keep the car straight going into the top

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.040 
keep the car straight going into the top
corner<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.370> when<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.550> brake<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.870> don't

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
corner so that when you brake you don't

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.690 
corner so that when you brake you don't
lock<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.470> tires<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:32.040> important<00:02:32.489> not<00:02:32.640> to

try and break and turn too much at the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
same time because your tires will lose

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.670

as<00:03:00.840> possible<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.410> might<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.730> coast<00:03:03.090> a

little bit to get the car on the good

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.729 
little bit to get the car on the good

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.130 
line so that you don't understand out
wide<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.480> importantly<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.600> don't<00:03:09.750> understand

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.479 
wide is importantly you don't understand
out<00:03:10.260> wide<00:03:10.440> because<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.950> will<00:03:11.070> lose<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.400> the

out wide because that will lose you the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.940 
most time if you have to go slightly

a great line there but

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.009 
a great line there but

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.080 
mobile and you'll have to come further
and<00:04:14.109> further<00:04:14.230> away<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:14.799> take<00:04:15.670> note<00:04:15.849> of<00:04:15.879> that

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
and further away so take note of that

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.870 
and further away so take note of that
during<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.690> race<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.560> for<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.859> hot<00:04:18.009> lap<00:04:18.160> less

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880

this<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.750> shadow<00:04:20.410> here<00:04:20.739> is<00:04:20.889> a<00:04:21.340> very<00:04:21.699> good

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
this the shadow here is a very good

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.670 
this the shadow here is a very good
reference<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:23.580> again<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.880> want<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.530> turn<00:04:26.530> in

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680

the brakes it's really important you
don't<00:04:35.919> lock<00:04:36.099> the<00:04:36.250> brakes<00:04:36.630> because<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.930> will

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
don't lock the brakes because that will

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.080 
don't lock the brakes because that will

going into the corner and then training

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.450 
going into the corner and then training
off<00:04:54.340> you'll<00:04:54.970> see<00:04:55.210> my<00:04:55.500> brake<00:04:56.500> light<00:04:56.680> here<00:04:56.889> go<00:04:57.159> up

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
off you'll see my brake light here go up

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.460 
off you'll see my brake light here go up
quite<00:04:57.729> high<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.090> then<00:04:58.720> as<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.139> get<00:04:59.289> further

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
quite high and then as I get further

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.870 
quite high and then as I get further
into<00:04:59.650> corner<00:05:00.070> I'll<00:05:00.220> go<00:05:00.400> lower<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.699> lower

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
into corner I'll go lower and lower

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.450 
into corner I'll go lower and lower
lower<00:05:01.240> until<00:05:01.539> finally<00:05:01.930> calm<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.380> as<00:05:03.190> soon<00:05:03.340> as

lower until finally calm and as soon as

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.770 
lower until finally calm and as soon as
it's<00:05:03.610> gone<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:04.120> want<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.360> be<00:05:04.419> hitting<00:05:04.570> the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
it's gone you want to be hitting the

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.490 
it's gone you want to be hitting the
accelerator<00:05:05.820> but<00:05:06.930> again<00:05:07.930> make<00:05:08.139> sure<00:05:08.169> you're

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
accelerator but again make sure you're

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
accelerator but again make sure you're
on<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.680> right<00:05:08.800> line<00:05:08.979> if<00:05:09.130> you're<00:05:09.220> not<00:05:09.370> on<00:05:09.490> the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
on the right line if you're not on the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.950 
on the right line if you're not on the
right<00:05:09.729> line<00:05:09.909> when<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:10.180> hit<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.360> accelerator

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
right line when you hit that accelerator

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.620 
right line when you hit that accelerator
you<00:05:11.889> will<00:05:12.070> evil<00:05:12.460> over<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.389> will<00:05:13.510> either

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
you will evil over you will either

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.830 
you will evil over you will either
oversteer<00:05:14.320> out<00:05:14.560> wide<00:05:15.039> into<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.490> wall<00:05:15.669> or<00:05:16.270> you

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
oversteer out wide into the wall or you

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.120 
oversteer out wide into the wall or you
could<00:05:17.080> oversteer<00:05:17.889> arm<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:18.960> spin<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.320> hit<00:05:21.039> the

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
could oversteer arm and spin and hit the

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.399 
could oversteer arm and spin and hit the
interval<00:05:21.430> so<00:05:21.760> it's<00:05:22.630> really<00:05:22.900> important<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.320> get

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
interval so it's really important to get

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.010 
interval so it's really important to get
the<00:05:23.500> line<00:05:23.650> right<00:05:23.860> if<00:05:24.039> you<00:05:24.130> don't<00:05:24.370> if<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.870> don't

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
the line right if you don't if you don't

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.270 
the line right if you don't if you don't
think<00:05:26.199> you're<00:05:26.320> on<00:05:26.409> the<00:05:26.500> right<00:05:26.620> line<00:05:26.800> going

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
think you're on the right line going

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.399 
think you're on the right line going
through<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.580> corner<00:05:27.909> it<00:05:28.169> don't<00:05:29.169> worry<00:05:29.320> about

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
through the corner it don't worry about

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.050 
through the corner it don't worry about
hitting<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:29.919> accelerator<00:05:30.070> just<00:05:30.760> make<00:05:30.909> sure

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
hitting the accelerator just make sure

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.300 
hitting the accelerator just make sure
you're<00:05:31.210> on<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.330> right<00:05:31.539> line<00:05:31.690> before<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.020> do

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
you're on the right line before you do

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.740 
you're on the right line before you do
otherwise<00:05:33.310> all<00:05:33.909> kinds<00:05:34.150> of<00:05:34.210> bad<00:05:34.360> things<00:05:34.389> will

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
otherwise all kinds of bad things will

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.700 
otherwise all kinds of bad things will
happen<00:05:35.220> so<00:05:36.220> turning<00:05:36.550> in<00:05:37.530> braking<00:05:38.530> in<00:05:38.650> a

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
happen so turning in braking in a

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.310 
happen so turning in braking in a
straight<00:05:38.949> line<00:05:38.979> at<00:05:39.430> that<00:05:39.729> shadow<00:05:40.240> I've<00:05:41.110> got

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
straight line at that shadow I've got

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.490 
straight line at that shadow I've got
quite<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:41.860> nice<00:05:42.010> line<00:05:42.760> going<00:05:43.090> here<00:05:43.289> you'll<00:05:44.289> see

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
quite a nice line going here you'll see

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.930 
quite a nice line going here you'll see
the<00:05:44.620> car<00:05:44.830> is<00:05:44.919> drifting<00:05:45.130> out<00:05:45.400> wider<00:05:45.610> than

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
the car is drifting out wider than

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.549 
the car is drifting out wider than
braking<00:05:49.530> so<00:05:50.530> a<00:05:50.560> fish<00:05:51.009> braking<00:05:51.430> here

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:52.559 
braking so a fish braking here

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:54.409 
braking so a fish braking here
and<00:05:52.949> the<00:05:53.309> car<00:05:53.489> is<00:05:53.519> still<00:05:53.789> drifting<00:05:53.999> out<00:05:54.239> wide<00:05:54.389> I

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
and the car is still drifting out wide I

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.219 
and the car is still drifting out wide I
didn't<00:05:54.779> slow<00:05:54.959> down<00:05:54.989> quite<00:05:55.619> enough<00:05:56.089> but<00:05:57.089> if<00:05:57.569> you

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
didn't slow down quite enough but if you

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.739 
didn't slow down quite enough but if you
hit<00:05:58.709> the<00:05:58.799> accelerator<00:05:58.859> early<00:05:59.639> when<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:00.569> car

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:00.749 
hit the accelerator early when the car

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:03.819 
hit the accelerator early when the car
is<00:06:00.839> not<00:06:00.959> turning<00:06:01.349> in<00:06:01.729> then<00:06:02.729> it<00:06:03.029> will<00:06:03.239> always

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:03.829 
is not turning in then it will always

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:06.019 
is not turning in then it will always
understeer<00:06:04.829> out<00:06:04.979> light<00:06:05.189> towards<00:06:05.609> a<00:06:05.669> wall<00:06:05.789> and

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
understeer out light towards a wall and

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.149 
understeer out light towards a wall and
you'll<00:06:06.809> have<00:06:06.989> to<00:06:07.109> get<00:06:07.229> off<00:06:07.319> the<00:06:07.439> gas<00:06:07.619> or<00:06:07.889> hit

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
you'll have to get off the gas or hit

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:12.679 
you'll have to get off the gas or hit
more<00:06:08.369> so<00:06:09.379> it's<00:06:10.379> better<00:06:10.769> to<00:06:11.159> lose<00:06:12.059> a<00:06:12.119> tiny<00:06:12.509> bit

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:12.689 
more so it's better to lose a tiny bit

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:14.389 
more so it's better to lose a tiny bit
of<00:06:12.719> time<00:06:12.959> here<00:06:13.019> making<00:06:13.589> sure<00:06:13.769> the<00:06:13.949> car<00:06:14.129> is<00:06:14.369> on

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:14.399 
of time here making sure the car is on

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.179 
of time here making sure the car is on
the<00:06:14.549> correct<00:06:15.029> line<00:06:15.239> rather<00:06:16.229> than<00:06:16.619> having<00:06:16.919> to

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:17.189 
the correct line rather than having to

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:19.039 
the correct line rather than having to
lose<00:06:17.339> a<00:06:17.399> lot<00:06:17.669> of<00:06:17.729> time<00:06:17.939> later<00:06:18.209> trying<00:06:18.659> to<00:06:18.839> avoid

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:19.049 
lose a lot of time later trying to avoid

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:22.759 
lose a lot of time later trying to avoid
hitting<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.469> wall<00:06:19.669> so<00:06:20.669> I<00:06:21.079> wait<00:06:22.079> a<00:06:22.109> little<00:06:22.559> bit

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:22.769 
hitting the wall so I wait a little bit

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:27.289 
hitting the wall so I wait a little bit
on<00:06:22.979> the<00:06:23.819> throw<00:06:24.089> for<00:06:24.509> the<00:06:24.629> car<00:06:24.809> to<00:06:24.929> turn<00:06:25.109> in<00:06:26.299> and

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:27.299 
on the throw for the car to turn in and

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:30.229 
on the throw for the car to turn in and
then<00:06:27.779> once<00:06:27.959> it<00:06:28.109> is<00:06:28.139> turning<00:06:28.559> in<00:06:28.709> I<00:06:29.059> Jam<00:06:30.059> my

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:30.239 
then once it is turning in I Jam my

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.199 
then once it is turning in I Jam my
phone<00:06:30.419> on<00:06:30.509> the<00:06:30.599> accelerator<00:06:31.109> and<00:06:31.319> we're<00:06:31.589> away

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:32.209 
phone on the accelerator and we're away

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:34.789 
phone on the accelerator and we're away
hugging<00:06:33.209> the<00:06:33.479> yellow<00:06:34.049> line<00:06:34.289> quite<00:06:34.589> closely

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:34.799 
hugging the yellow line quite closely

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:37.309 
hugging the yellow line quite closely
it's<00:06:35.099> important<00:06:35.669> I<00:06:35.849> do<00:06:36.659> it<00:06:36.779> quite<00:06:36.899> well<00:06:37.109> there

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
it's important I do it quite well there

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.669 
it's important I do it quite well there
that's<00:06:37.679> not<00:06:37.889> bad<00:06:38.099> and<00:06:39.409> here<00:06:40.409> we<00:06:40.529> are

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:40.679 
that's not bad and here we are

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:42.949 
that's not bad and here we are
got<00:06:40.919> a<00:06:40.949> nice<00:06:41.159> exit<00:06:41.819> just<00:06:42.269> let<00:06:42.449> the<00:06:42.539> car<00:06:42.719> drift

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:42.959 
got a nice exit just let the car drift

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:45.529 
got a nice exit just let the car drift
out<00:06:43.169> wide<00:06:43.729> try<00:06:44.729> not<00:06:44.849> to<00:06:44.969> over<00:06:45.119> stress<00:06:45.419> the

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
out wide try not to over stress the

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.019 
out wide try not to over stress the
tires<00:06:45.809> and<00:06:46.589> that's<00:06:47.189> very<00:06:47.549> important<00:06:47.879> to<00:06:47.909> run

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:48.029 
tires and that's very important to run

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:51.229 
tires and that's very important to run
race<00:06:48.269> the<00:06:48.599> more<00:06:48.779> you<00:06:48.989> turn<00:06:49.369> we've<00:06:50.369> all<00:06:50.789> have<00:06:51.089> to

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:51.239 
race the more you turn we've all have to

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.179 
race the more you turn we've all have to
overcorrect<00:06:51.719> then<00:06:52.259> the<00:06:52.409> more<00:06:52.559> the<00:06:52.709> tires<00:06:52.919> will

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:53.189 
overcorrect then the more the tires will

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:56.329 
overcorrect then the more the tires will
wear<00:06:53.339> out<00:06:53.459> and<00:06:54.349> that<00:06:55.349> will<00:06:55.499> result<00:06:56.039> in<00:06:56.189> quite

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:56.339 
wear out and that will result in quite

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:58.579 
wear out and that will result in quite
bad<00:06:56.610> lap<00:06:56.849> times<00:06:57.089> overall<00:06:57.509> so<00:06:58.199> there<00:06:58.409> you<00:06:58.469> go

00:06:58.579 --> 00:06:58.589 
bad lap times overall so there you go

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:01.850 
bad lap times overall so there you go
that<00:06:58.979> was<00:06:59.039> one<00:06:59.339> lap<00:06:59.549> around<00:06:59.789> USA<00:07:00.719> I<00:07:01.019> hope<00:07:01.589> some

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
that was one lap around USA I hope some

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.429 
that was one lap around USA I hope some
of<00:07:01.889> you<00:07:01.979> find<00:07:02.219> it<00:07:02.309> useful<00:07:03.110> some<00:07:04.110> of<00:07:04.199> you<00:07:04.289> also
