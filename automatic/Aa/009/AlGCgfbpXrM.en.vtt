00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.309
 we are going to give a demonstration of the 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.830
 electrocardiogram 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.820
 first the patient is in 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.030
 recover the salt without the head 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.230
 we must proceed as the notorious cleaning 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.290
 with high if necessary and also 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:53.989
 accurate with the local designation where you 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:01:17.320
 put put the members of the side 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:17.320
 right and right ankle price 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:38.750
 The first step is to complete the line for 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:55.210
 complement the right 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:55.210
 according to the 1st and 2nd 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:13.190
 the text recalled that it was positioning 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.709
 between the second and fourth electrodes 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.800
 while he positions himself in the first 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.130
 fifth electronic room 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:32.799
 intercostal space on the island between 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:37.910
 left clavicular of your car 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.950
 finally the second and 14 in a row here in the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:47.480
 half the way is the third 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:53.319
 nervousness of the same 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.319
 4 only on the previous line 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.689
 and the other 68 will also be the same 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.700
 height c4 c5 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.700
 only in the similar average line 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:20.239
 I think they want us to 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.459
 precordial revelation electrodes and 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.459
 generous great goal ratio 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:37.360
 at the time the program we will have three 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.549
 elevations of one of two and three of a 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.599
 is represented by the difference of 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:47.280
 potential and especially in the right fist 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:50.290
 my other eye on the left fist of 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.140
 21 potential difference between the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:04:05.319
 return of the world made by the 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:15.180
 of 3 in the left ankle thus formed 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:15.180
 the famous mining triangle the rooster 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.770
