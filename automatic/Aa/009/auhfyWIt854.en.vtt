00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
and today we're showing you the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.639 
and today we're showing you the
difference<00:00:05.759> between<00:00:05.990> vodka<00:00:06.990> beer<00:00:07.410> and

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
difference between vodka beer and

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.509 
difference between vodka beer and
tempura<00:00:08.160> batter

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
tempura batter

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.509 
tempura batter
this<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> basic<00:00:09.980> tempura<00:00:10.980> batter<00:00:11.250> with

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
this is a basic tempura batter with

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.410 
this is a basic tempura batter with
sparkling<00:00:12.000> water<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:13.110> mixed<00:00:13.679> into<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.940> pretty

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
sparkling water it's mixed into a pretty

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.390 
sparkling water it's mixed into a pretty
basic<00:00:15.570> mixture<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.320> flour<00:00:16.880> baking<00:00:17.880> soda<00:00:17.910> and

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
basic mixture of flour baking soda and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.950 
basic mixture of flour baking soda and
that's<00:00:20.400> pretty<00:00:20.820> much<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.779> one's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
that's pretty much it so this one's

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.420 
that's pretty much it so this one's
really<00:00:22.080> bubbly<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> sparkling

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
really bubbly because the sparkling

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.029 
really bubbly because the sparkling
water<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:23.850> bubbly<00:00:24.359> water<00:00:24.720> evaporates<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.769> lot

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
water was bubbly water evaporates a lot

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.480 
water was bubbly water evaporates a lot
slower<00:00:26.460> than<00:00:27.260> alcohol<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> nice

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
slower than alcohol so you get a nice

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.609 
slower than alcohol so you get a nice
crisp<00:00:29.910> crust<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> bubbles<00:00:30.900> help<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.470> that

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
crisp crust the bubbles help with that

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.160 
crisp crust the bubbles help with that
as<00:00:31.740> opposed<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> flat<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:33.420> doing<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
as opposed to flat now I'm doing a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.040 
as opposed to flat now I'm doing a
mixture<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.100> vodka<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.090> part<00:00:36.329> vodka<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.750> three

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
mixture of vodka one part vodka to three

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020 
mixture of vodka one part vodka to three
part<00:00:37.290> sparkling<00:00:37.800> water<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> look

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
part sparkling water it's going to look

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
part sparkling water it's going to look
almost<00:00:39.239> identical<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.710> sparkling<00:00:41.129> water

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
almost identical to the sparkling water

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:41.959 
almost identical to the sparkling water
tempura

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
tempura

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.030 
tempura
especially<00:00:42.480> when<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.750> freshly<00:00:43.050> made<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
especially when it's freshly made the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.000 
especially when it's freshly made the
difference<00:00:44.460> being<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.239> vodka

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
difference being that the vodka

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
difference being that the vodka
evaporates<00:00:47.010> much<00:00:47.489> more<00:00:47.820> quickly<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
evaporates much more quickly so the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.920 
evaporates much more quickly so the
batter<00:00:49.590> which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> basically<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.059> skin<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
batter which is basically a skin that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
batter which is basically a skin that
protects<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.219> item<00:00:53.610> you're<00:00:53.760> frying<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
protects the item you're frying and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.049 
protects the item you're frying and
keeps<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.960> moist<00:00:55.260> while<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.920> gets<00:00:56.039> crisp<00:00:56.399> it's

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
keeps it moist while it gets crisp it's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.990 
keeps it moist while it gets crisp it's
going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.420> crisp<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.840> lot<00:00:58.079> faster<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.000> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
going to get crisp a lot faster and the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.670 
going to get crisp a lot faster and the
last<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.600> your<00:01:00.809> traditional<00:01:01.260> beer<00:01:01.440> batter

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
last is your traditional beer batter

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.539 
last is your traditional beer batter
same<00:01:02.219> flour<00:01:02.730> mixture<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:04.439> IPA<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
same flour mixture with an IPA so you

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.429 
same flour mixture with an IPA so you
get<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> flavor<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.540> hops<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.260> get

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
get the flavor of the hops and you get

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
get the flavor of the hops and you get
the<00:01:07.560> darkness<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> beer<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the darkness of the beer but it's a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.250 
the darkness of the beer but it's a
lower<00:01:10.650> alcohol<00:01:10.950> content<00:01:11.490> than<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> vodka

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
lower alcohol content than the vodka

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.510 
lower alcohol content than the vodka
mixture<00:01:13.260> it'll<00:01:13.710> evaporate<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.250> bit

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
mixture it'll evaporate a little bit

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060 
mixture it'll evaporate a little bit
more<00:01:14.670> slowly<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.869> an<00:01:16.020> example<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
more slowly to do an example I have a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
more slowly to do an example I have a
squash<00:01:17.490> blossom<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:18.330> stuff<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.750> goat

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
squash blossom that stuff with goat

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.359 
squash blossom that stuff with goat

restaurant<00:01:20.820> gonna<00:01:21.119> dip<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> basic

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
restaurant gonna dip it in the basic

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
restaurant gonna dip it in the basic
tempura<00:01:22.770> batter<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:23.670> quickly<00:01:23.939> drop<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
tempura batter and then quickly drop it

tempura batter and then quickly drop it
into<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.990> fryer<00:01:25.140> oil<00:01:25.590> that's<00:01:25.860> been<00:01:26.070> heated<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
into the fryer oil that's been heated to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.060 
into the fryer oil that's been heated to
400<00:01:26.729> degrees<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.810> vodka<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> sparkling

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
400 degrees the vodka and sparkling

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.880 
400 degrees the vodka and sparkling
water<00:01:29.280> mixture<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> we'll<00:01:30.900> drop<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
water mixture and we'll drop that in and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.420 
water mixture and we'll drop that in and
last<00:01:32.490> we'll<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> beer<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.920> flour<00:01:34.920> mixture

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
last we'll do the beer and flour mixture

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.249 
last we'll do the beer and flour mixture
which<00:01:36.000> will<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.329> typical<00:01:36.509> beer<00:01:37.020> batter

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
which will be your typical beer batter

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.899 
which will be your typical beer batter
these<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.829> all<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.100> fresh<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
these are all really fresh so the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.670 
these are all really fresh so the
bubbles<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.479> gonna<00:01:39.540> look<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:39.869> similar

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
bubbles are gonna look very similar

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.560 
bubbles are gonna look very similar
right<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.759> batter's<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.180> just

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
right now because the batter's have just

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.210 
right now because the batter's have just
been<00:01:42.810> mixed<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.409> you'll<00:01:43.590> still<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.950> able<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
been mixed but you'll still be able to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.130 
been mixed but you'll still be able to
notice<00:01:44.700> lightness<00:01:45.149> differences<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:46.049> they

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
notice lightness differences when they

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.649 
notice lightness differences when they
come

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
come

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.309 
come
frier<00:01:46.899> so<00:01:47.829> now<00:01:47.950> I'm<00:01:48.070> pulling<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.850> different

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
frier so now I'm pulling the different

with the sparkling water in the flour

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.619 
with the sparkling water in the flour
mixture<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.759> put<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.269> on<00:02:10.299> a<00:02:10.420> paper

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
mixture so I put that one on a paper

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.600 
mixture so I put that one on a paper
towel<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.549> see<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.120> feathery

towel and you can see that it's feathery
from<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.819> sparkling<00:02:16.269> water<00:02:16.590> next<00:02:17.590> I'll<00:02:17.739> pull

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
from the sparkling water next I'll pull

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.430 
from the sparkling water next I'll pull

little<00:02:23.590> bit<00:02:23.709> more<00:02:23.860> crisp<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.840> last<00:02:25.840> we'll

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
little bit more crisp and last we'll

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.250 
little bit more crisp and last we'll
pull<00:02:26.590> out<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.799> beer<00:02:27.450> fried<00:02:28.450> tempura<00:02:28.989> batter

now<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.069> one<00:02:30.340> because<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.849> fresh<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.360> lot<00:02:31.510> of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
now this one because it's fresh a lot of

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.380 
now this one because it's fresh a lot of
the<00:02:31.690> tempura<00:02:32.140> characteristics<00:02:33.150> but<00:02:34.150> it'll

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
the tempura characteristics but it'll

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.509 
the tempura characteristics but it'll
have<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.750> flavor<00:02:35.049> from<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.440> beer<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
little bit more of a cake like texture

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500 
little bit more of a cake like texture
because<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:39.010> alcohol<00:02:39.190> didn't<00:02:39.879> evaporate<00:02:40.390> as

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
because the alcohol didn't evaporate as

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.650 
because the alcohol didn't evaporate as
quickly<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.829> see<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.760> difference

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
quickly and you can see the difference

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.250 
quickly and you can see the difference
being<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.530> beer<00:02:44.920> has<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.250> more<00:02:45.549> fluffy

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
being that the beer has a more fluffy

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.890 
being that the beer has a more fluffy
coating<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:48.549> vodka<00:02:49.000> batter<00:02:49.209> has<00:02:49.599> a<00:02:49.629> very

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
coating the vodka batter has a very

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.140 
coating the vodka batter has a very
crisp<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.560> feathery<00:02:51.310> coating<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.030> it's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
crisp and feathery coating and it's

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.629 
crisp and feathery coating and it's
crisp<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.750> could<00:02:52.900> happen<00:02:53.290> with<00:02:53.650> tongs<00:02:54.220> and

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
crisp you could happen with tongs and

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.270 
crisp you could happen with tongs and
it's<00:02:54.790> gonna<00:02:54.940> make<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.359> crunchy<00:02:55.780> sound<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.440> the

tempura because it was nice and fresh
has<00:02:59.139> a<00:02:59.170> really<00:02:59.440> feathery<00:03:00.389> look<00:03:01.389> to<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:02.340> again

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
has a really feathery look to it again

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.680 
has a really feathery look to it again
these<00:03:03.489> batters<00:03:03.849> are<00:03:03.970> all<00:03:04.060> fresh<00:03:04.389> that's

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
these batters are all fresh that's

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.610 
these batters are all fresh that's
always<00:03:04.900> your<00:03:05.109> best<00:03:05.290> bet

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
always your best bet

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.289

the<00:03:05.829> longer<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.250> batter<00:03:06.400> sits<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.030> more<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
the longer the batter sits the more the

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.240 
the longer the batter sits the more the
water<00:03:07.419> dissipates<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.319> bubbles<00:03:08.650> dissipate

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
water dissipates the bubbles dissipate

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.280 
water dissipates the bubbles dissipate
the<00:03:09.730> alcohol<00:03:10.239> evaporates<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.109> get<00:03:11.260> a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
the alcohol evaporates and you get a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.120 
the alcohol evaporates and you get a
different<00:03:11.650> result

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
different result

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.090 
different result
I've<00:03:13.190> been<00:03:13.370> waiting<00:03:13.850> too
