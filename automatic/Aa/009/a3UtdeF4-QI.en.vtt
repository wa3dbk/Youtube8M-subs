00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
is fairly challenging as I mean in this

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.139

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.450 
game out I mean I guess I make it look
kind<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.479> easy<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.350> pick<00:01:58.649> off<00:01:58.829> kids<00:01:59.100> domes

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
way it is not a one shot kill if you had

way it is not a one shot kill if you had
chow<00:02:25.599> which<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.019> probably<00:02:26.889> the<00:02:27.129> most<00:02:27.159> annoying

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
chow which is probably the most annoying

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.959 
chow which is probably the most annoying
part<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:29.739> gets<00:02:29.920> really<00:02:30.159> frustrating<00:02:30.430> when

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
part and it gets really frustrating when

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.879 
part and it gets really frustrating when
you<00:02:31.090> pick<00:02:31.299> someone<00:02:31.569> off<00:02:31.689> in<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.959> head<00:02:32.109> but

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
you pick someone off in the head but

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.830 
you pick someone off in the head but
they<00:02:33.010> got<00:02:33.189> like<00:02:33.370> stunned<00:02:34.060> or<00:02:34.299> something<00:02:34.689> it's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
they got like stunned or something it's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.920 
they got like stunned or something it's
not<00:02:34.959> one<00:02:35.799> shot<00:02:36.069> yeah<00:02:36.250> maybe<00:02:37.239> their<00:02:37.569> son<00:02:37.810> it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
not one shot yeah maybe their son it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.319 
not one shot yeah maybe their son it
might<00:02:38.049> still<00:02:38.230> be<00:02:38.349> one<00:02:38.500> shot<00:02:38.739> kill<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.329> really

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
might still be one shot kill but really

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.640 
might still be one shot kill but really
if<00:02:40.389> they're<00:02:40.620> damaged<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:42.040> any<00:02:42.280> any<00:02:42.760> amount

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
if they're damaged like any any amount

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.110 
if they're damaged like any any amount
there's<00:02:44.650> really<00:02:45.099> just<00:02:45.219> not<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.609> one<00:02:45.879> shot<00:02:46.060> kill

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
there's really just not a one shot kill

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.959 
there's really just not a one shot kill
which<00:02:46.569> is<00:02:47.250> 110<00:02:48.250> percent<00:02:48.639> the<00:02:48.760> most

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:48.969 
which is 110 percent the most

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.080 
which is 110 percent the most
frustrating<00:02:49.180> part<00:02:49.659> I<00:02:50.639> mean<00:02:51.639> with<00:02:51.790> all<00:02:51.939> these

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
frustrating part I mean with all these

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.129 
frustrating part I mean with all these
snipers<00:02:52.359> it's<00:02:52.719> not<00:02:52.900> too<00:02:53.109> bad<00:02:53.489> um<00:02:54.900> yeah<00:02:55.900> really

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
snipers it's not too bad um yeah really

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.869 
snipers it's not too bad um yeah really
all<00:02:56.409> the<00:02:56.500> other<00:02:56.620> snipers<00:02:57.099> are<00:02:57.219> one<00:02:57.370> shot<00:02:57.579> kills

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
all the other snipers are one shot kills

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.550 
all the other snipers are one shot kills
and<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.180> body<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.569> ballista<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.139> can<00:02:59.290> get

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
and the body the ballista you can get

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.740 
and the body the ballista you can get
some<00:02:59.769> nasty<00:03:00.159> hit<00:03:00.519> markers<00:03:00.909> which<00:03:01.629> is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
some nasty hit markers which is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.689 
some nasty hit markers which is
occasionally<00:03:02.349> annoying<00:03:02.739> but<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.310> bliss<00:03:03.519> is

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:03.699 
occasionally annoying but the bliss is

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.770 
occasionally annoying but the bliss is
super<00:03:04.000> fast<00:03:04.269> which<00:03:04.599> makes<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.930> fun<00:03:06.719> now<00:03:07.719> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
super fast which makes it fun now the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.390 
super fast which makes it fun now the
worst<00:03:07.989> part<00:03:08.260> about<00:03:08.319> using<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:08.859> sniper<00:03:09.099> is

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
worst part about using this sniper is

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.909 
worst part about using this sniper is
you<00:03:10.389> have<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.599> really<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:11.019> sit<00:03:11.409> up<00:03:11.439> in<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
you have to really just sit up in the

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.210 
you have to really just sit up in the
back<00:03:12.159> and<00:03:12.519> long<00:03:12.730> hallways<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.449> try<00:03:13.629> pick

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
back and long hallways and try pick

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.009 
back and long hallways and try pick
adsorption<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.359> this<00:03:16.479> game<00:03:16.689> there's<00:03:16.900> not

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
adsorption and in this game there's not

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.229 
adsorption and in this game there's not
too<00:03:17.290> many<00:03:17.439> long<00:03:17.799> hallways<00:03:18.280> like<00:03:18.879> you<00:03:19.030> see<00:03:19.209> me

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
too many long hallways like you see me

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.599 
too many long hallways like you see me
up<00:03:19.479> here<00:03:19.659> on<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:19.900> roof<00:03:20.169> this<00:03:21.129> is<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> decent

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
up here on this roof this is a decent

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.580 
up here on this roof this is a decent
spot<00:03:22.030> but<00:03:22.359> you<00:03:22.509> just<00:03:22.689> have<00:03:22.840> absolutely<00:03:23.409> no

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
spot but you just have absolutely no

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.740 
spot but you just have absolutely no
cover<00:03:23.889> and<00:03:24.159> you're<00:03:24.370> exposed<00:03:24.759> to<00:03:25.090> people

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
cover and you're exposed to people

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.319 
cover and you're exposed to people
coming<00:03:26.259> from<00:03:26.560> your<00:03:26.739> rear<00:03:26.979> like<00:03:27.939> this<00:03:28.090> kid

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
coming from your rear like this kid

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.349 
coming from your rear like this kid
would've<00:03:28.720> but<00:03:29.019> I'll<00:03:29.349> nope<00:03:30.250> thought<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.150> could

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
would've but I'll nope thought I could

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.979 
would've but I'll nope thought I could
spray<00:03:31.689> them<00:03:31.810> down<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.439> I<00:03:32.500> guess<00:03:32.799> not<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.989> then

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
spray them down but I guess not and then

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.990 
spray them down but I guess not and then
the<00:03:35.349> connection<00:03:35.919> with<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.280> new<00:03:36.459> matchmaking

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
the connection with the new matchmaking

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.219 
the connection with the new matchmaking
system<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.599> all<00:03:37.829> also<00:03:38.829> insanely<00:03:39.699> bad<00:03:40.229> because

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
system is all also insanely bad because

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.199 
system is all also insanely bad because
if<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.680> weren't<00:03:41.889> aware<00:03:42.129> it<00:03:42.459> matches<00:03:42.759> you<00:03:43.090> up

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
if you weren't aware it matches you up

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.990 
if you weren't aware it matches you up
with<00:03:43.449> people<00:03:44.319> with<00:03:45.040> similar<00:03:45.280> kill<00:03:45.819> death

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
with people with similar kill death

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.999 
with people with similar kill death
ratio<00:03:46.120> co<00:03:46.780> instead<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.829> a<00:03:47.949> connection<00:03:48.370> cat

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:50.009 
ratio co instead of a connection cat

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.039 
ratio co instead of a connection cat
compatibility<00:03:51.009> like<00:03:51.519> it<00:03:51.669> used<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:52.780> you're

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
compatibility like it used to so you're

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.689 
compatibility like it used to so you're

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
got some they just leave because they

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.909 
got some they just leave because they

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
kids who have like I mean now I have

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.740 
kids who have like I mean now I have
like<00:04:10.780> a<00:04:11.340> 1.6<00:04:12.340> kill<00:04:12.639> death<00:04:12.819> ratio<00:04:12.909> which<00:04:13.419> isn't

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
like a 1.6 kill death ratio which isn't

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.770 
like a 1.6 kill death ratio which isn't
good<00:04:14.370> it's<00:04:15.370> not<00:04:15.579> as<00:04:15.849> good<00:04:16.030> as<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:16.329> used<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.570> be

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
good it's not as good as it used to be

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.860 
good it's not as good as it used to be
but<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.459> mean<00:04:18.459> it's<00:04:18.669> dropped<00:04:19.299> down<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.539> lot

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
but I mean it's dropped down a lot

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.420 
but I mean it's dropped down a lot
because<00:04:20.109> I've<00:04:20.409> been<00:04:20.440> using<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.919> one-shot

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
because I've been using this one-shot

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.150 
because I've been using this one-shot
sniper<00:04:21.880> rifle

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
sniper rifle

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.640

not<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.150> one<00:04:24.300> trying<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.140> get<00:04:25.230> one<00:04:25.410> shot

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
not this one trying to get one shot

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.820 
not this one trying to get one shot
kills<00:04:25.950> with<00:04:26.160> this<00:04:26.310> garbage<00:04:27.120> sniper<00:04:27.510> rifle<00:04:27.990> and

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
kills with this garbage sniper rifle and

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.070 
kills with this garbage sniper rifle and
it<00:04:28.920> can<00:04:29.100> get<00:04:29.220> pretty<00:04:29.280> frustrating<00:04:30.210> I'll<00:04:30.900> learn

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
it can get pretty frustrating I'll learn

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.450 
it can get pretty frustrating I'll learn
to<00:04:31.260> call<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.530> is<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:31.920> if<00:04:32.010> you're<00:04:32.130> going<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.310> do

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
to call it is so if you're going to do

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.540 
to call it is so if you're going to do
this<00:04:32.640> definitely<00:04:33.120> put<00:04:33.300> variable<00:04:33.780> zoom<00:04:33.960> on<00:04:34.170> I

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
this definitely put variable zoom on I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.680 
this definitely put variable zoom on I
just<00:04:35.550> unlocked<00:04:35.700> at<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.180> beginning<00:04:36.450> of<00:04:36.570> this

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
just unlocked at the beginning of this

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.360 
just unlocked at the beginning of this
game<00:04:36.840> that's<00:04:37.200> why<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.410> didn't<00:04:37.710> have<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:37.980> on<00:04:38.070> a

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
game that's why I didn't have it on a

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.280 
game that's why I didn't have it on a
variable<00:04:39.270> zoom<00:04:39.420> will<00:04:39.660> give<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.930> an<00:04:40.050> actual

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
variable zoom will give you an actual

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.110 
variable zoom will give you an actual
dot<00:04:40.830> in<00:04:41.130> your<00:04:41.250> scope<00:04:41.550> instead<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.000> that

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
dot in your scope instead of that

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.770 
dot in your scope instead of that
triangle<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:43.680> triangle<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.360> inconsistent

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
triangle the triangle is so inconsistent

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.660 
triangle the triangle is so inconsistent
with<00:04:46.230> anything<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:46.860> pretty<00:04:47.340> annoying

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
with anything it's just pretty annoying

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.730 
with anything it's just pretty annoying
but<00:04:49.310> yeah<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.640> also<00:04:50.820> if<00:04:51.360> you're<00:04:51.870> gonna<00:04:52.020> go<00:04:52.530> for

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
but yeah and also if you're gonna go for

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.650 
but yeah and also if you're gonna go for
one<00:04:52.860> shot<00:04:53.100> kills<00:04:53.370> do<00:04:53.610> not<00:04:53.790> put<00:04:54.000> silencer<00:04:54.630> on

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
one shot kills do not put silencer on

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.930 
one shot kills do not put silencer on
because<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:55.920> cannot<00:04:56.220> get<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.430> one<00:04:56.700> shot<00:04:56.880> kill

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
because you cannot get a one shot kill

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.500 
because you cannot get a one shot kill
with<00:04:57.540> silencer<00:04:58.260> attached<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:59.150> that's<00:05:00.150> also

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
with silencer attached and that's also

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.670 
with silencer attached and that's also
very<00:05:00.690> frustrating<00:05:02.330> but<00:05:03.330> uh<00:05:03.390> I<00:05:03.840> mean<00:05:04.500> if<00:05:04.590> you

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
very frustrating but uh I mean if you

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.110 
very frustrating but uh I mean if you
have<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.830> good<00:05:05.010> game<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.250> believe<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.910> game

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120

I had like 20 I think we was like 21 or

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.130 
I had like 20 I think we was like 21 or
22<00:05:10.200> head<00:05:10.500> shots<00:05:10.800> which<00:05:10.980> is<00:05:11.220> absolutely<00:05:11.880> insane

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
22 head shots which is absolutely insane

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.840 
22 head shots which is absolutely insane
especially<00:05:13.140> for<00:05:13.560> kill<00:05:13.770> confirmed<00:05:14.780> but<00:05:15.780> uh

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
especially for kill confirmed but uh

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.430 
especially for kill confirmed but uh
yeah<00:05:17.850> I've<00:05:18.000> been<00:05:18.180> trying<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:18.990> grind<00:05:19.110> this<00:05:19.290> out

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
yeah I've been trying to grind this out

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
and there will definitely be a couple

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.450 
and there will definitely be a couple
