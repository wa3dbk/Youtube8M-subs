00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello that's josé sanchez-alarcos book author looking for work online and 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.790
 within the series of tutorial videos that we have been aggravating we are going to 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.230
 try now the last part about the video tutorial how to overcome a process 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.820
 of selection that is to say we are going to dedicate now to the act car the subject on 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.939
 these individual interviews 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.740
 What is it 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.289
 perhaps one of the most common reasons to scare candidates 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.749
 edie the individual interviews with the placing to fall in the final phase of 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.309
 selection process or simply for an expensive resource worthy the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.550
 interviewer is in front of an audience interviewed then whether it is a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.840
 member of the consultant as sirte the department of human resources of the pt 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.500
 direct is one of course they are this is what makes them txt in the end 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.540
 there a lot of books dedicated to the subject some good others bad others 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.200
 regular and we can not compete with them but we are going to accept or they are not 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.850
 what they are 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.000
 the jealous characters of more basic characteristics 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.220
 let's start with the presence 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.130
 in good if we find that the job we're working 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.370
 presenting requires formal dress 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.250
 that means that the interview Carlos Tevez who formally does so for the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.240
 it does not require it 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.050
 there may be more flexibility in terms of the criteria but of course what 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.100
 this time proximity 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.940
 regarding the issue of what is necessary 15 perfectly clean and discreet 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.740
 the important matter gocho is the relationship with the chronicler dor sometimes 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.930
 that people with very little interview experience are very nervous, which is 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 until normal 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.320
 but what is not so worrying is that it happens that they have seen that it was not 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.110
 as much as it seemed from there that is not at the opposite end it's 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.400
 say a kind of trusty mirror 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.210
 that the town is also to take note 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.980
 especially for a hundred because we run the risk of not checking what the flow is 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.460
 of information that we may be paying I noticed very expensive 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.490
 we have to be 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.079
 strictly careful in what information is exhausted and how 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.000
 we are doing 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.080
 part of the interview the most normal thing is that the relic interview 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.069
 perform the curriculum 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.980
 to go looking for possible contradictions or expand information 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.420
 then there are times that he even does it by means of an open question of the type 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.830
 tell me about you in such a case the logical thing is that on the candidate's part he wants 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.939
 focus on highlighting those points that I had already highlighted 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.799
 the public without necessarily meaning that he will repeat a point 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.489
 per point everything that appears téllez all that sure efe 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.369
 there are times that we can have the work life of social security 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.000
 to refuse would not make sense because it would be interpreted as there is something here 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.469
 to hide but if someone does not like to give authorization to enter 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:56.279
 in the files your penis social security on your own you always have 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:00.079
 the option that was issued before the selection process and in case 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.059
 is requested 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.179
 at that moment it is delivered 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:08.219
 the candidate delivers it and so we get rid of the problem should not enter 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.739
 never in japan and excessive cordiality or behaviors that can 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.159
 pay boxing or silence in other cases provokes an intention 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.119
 deliberate as a way to see how the candidate is responding to that tension 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.849
 while fish that is simply that the interviewer is like that 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.169
 because among the interviewers as in any other profession 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.939
 imaginable I feel that we are in competent kotkai there are also 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.859
 and we can get in touch with one 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.879
 So it's good for a hundred, if that's the case 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.430
 Well, we'll have to do with dad, we will not get into the rag in any way 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:49.189
 i could find ourselves also creates some very new in the trade and that 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.359
 be as afraid as the candidate 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.249
 in such case you are the right thing is not a harlequin an easy excuse nor for 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.200
 presence or behavior 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.039
 so you can eliminate the candidacy 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:06.419
 Beware of overly bright answers danger because these by 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.779
 raise suspicion 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:13.019
 the interviewee may also be interested to know if the candidate has made 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.019
 homework 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.719
 and then I asked him what to know that the company 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.239
 Well, that's why we have internet so we look 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.020
 we look at everything the company says about itself, let's not go here 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.810
 also do not start to get issues of solvency percent conflict and 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.249
 accurate 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.840
 another dangerous issue the salary issue 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.990
 be careful because there we do get with an artist in the environment who are 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.310
 thinking if we overlooked very low we are saying that we do not know 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.760
 really what is the environment of the post 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.080
 and it is one of the trick questions worse is that there may be 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.360
 They can tell us to sell ourselves because we have had and we bring our 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.419
 best qualities 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.430
 and nothing else this is what they seek and in five minutes and until the next she 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.889
