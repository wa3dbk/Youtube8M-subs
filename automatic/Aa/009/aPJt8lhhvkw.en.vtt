00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
thoughts that I had the right angle but

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.809 
thoughts that I had the right angle but
of<00:05:18.949> course<00:05:18.979> he<00:05:19.250> can<00:05:19.430> take<00:05:19.639> this<00:05:19.819> one<00:05:20.060> on

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
of course he can take this one on

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.309 
of course he can take this one on
although<00:05:22.819> it's<00:05:22.970> quite<00:05:23.180> a<00:05:23.270> difficult<00:05:23.569> parties

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
although it's quite a difficult parties

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:29.379 
although it's quite a difficult parties
a<00:05:26.949> real<00:05:27.949> problem<00:05:28.370> if<00:05:28.490> he<00:05:28.580> leaves<00:05:28.759> it<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.150> frame

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
a real problem if he leaves it the frame

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.820 
a real problem if he leaves it the frame
as<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.870> say<00:05:30.110> is<00:05:31.060> 145<00:05:32.060> stephen<00:05:32.960> hendry<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:33.590> the

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
as I say is 145 stephen hendry and the

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.830 
as I say is 145 stephen hendry and the
free<00:05:34.479> pass<00:05:35.479> well<00:05:35.900> Jimmy<00:05:36.259> doesn't<00:05:37.509> about<00:05:38.509> if

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
free pass well Jimmy doesn't about if

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.159 
free pass well Jimmy doesn't about if
there's<00:05:39.080> no<00:05:39.229> possibility<00:05:39.800> he<00:05:40.690> just<00:05:41.690> concede

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
there's no possibility he just concede

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.890 
there's no possibility he just concede
so<00:05:42.620> that's<00:05:42.919> another<00:05:43.430> frame<00:05:43.819> to<00:05:44.210> stephen

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
felt in that frame that je played an

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.749 
felt in that frame that je played an
early<00:06:00.319> shot<00:06:00.650> there<00:06:00.889> to<00:06:01.009> get<00:06:01.159> on<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.460> green

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
was a little bit short of pace and as a

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.209

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.469 
just a small mistake like that which
might<00:06:15.979> go<00:06:16.190> totally<00:06:16.669> unnoticed<00:06:16.699> by<00:06:17.449> the

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
might go totally unnoticed by the

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.100 
might go totally unnoticed by the
audience<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:18.590> yet<00:06:18.770> it<00:06:18.860> cost<00:06:19.069> him<00:06:19.219> the<00:06:19.279> frame

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
audience and yet it cost him the frame

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.269 
audience and yet it cost him the frame
yeah<00:06:21.110> I'm<00:06:21.199> just<00:06:21.319> come<00:06:21.529> first<00:06:21.770> year<00:06:21.889> I<00:06:22.039> can't

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:22.279 
yeah I'm just come first year I can't

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.879 
yeah I'm just come first year I can't
quite<00:06:22.610> remember<00:06:22.849> the<00:06:23.270> shot<00:06:23.509> think<00:06:23.930> he's<00:06:24.020> with

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
quite remember the shot think he's with

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.610 
quite remember the shot think he's with
these<00:06:25.099> two<00:06:25.370> players<00:06:25.669> the<00:06:26.389> smallest<00:06:26.930> error<00:06:27.199> is

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
these two players the smallest error is

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.469 
these two players the smallest error is
liable<00:06:28.039> to<00:06:28.190> cost<00:06:28.400> either<00:06:28.580> of<00:06:28.909> them<00:06:29.029> the<00:06:29.240> frame

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
liable to cost either of them the frame

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:30.159 
liable to cost either of them the frame
that

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
that

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.170 
that
they<00:06:30.860> said<00:06:31.099> they<00:06:31.249> both<00:06:31.460> seem<00:06:31.699> to<00:06:31.729> be<00:06:31.909> playing

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
they said they both seem to be playing

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.350 
they said they both seem to be playing
quite<00:06:33.050> well<00:06:33.349> and<00:06:33.889> I<00:06:34.310> think<00:06:34.340> possibly<00:06:35.090> they've

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
quite well and I think possibly they've

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.260 
quite well and I think possibly they've
raised<00:06:35.629> their<00:06:35.900> game<00:06:36.139> for<00:06:36.409> this<00:06:36.499> final<00:06:37.270> during

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
raised their game for this final during

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.170 
raised their game for this final during
the<00:06:38.449> earlier<00:06:39.289> rounds<00:06:39.349> I<00:06:39.969> think<00:06:40.969> their

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
the earlier rounds I think their

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.080 
the earlier rounds I think their
thoughts<00:06:41.449> were<00:06:41.629> off<00:06:41.779> on<00:06:41.990> other<00:06:42.199> things<00:06:42.560> but

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
thoughts were off on other things but

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.429 
thoughts were off on other things but
they<00:06:44.090> both<00:06:44.330> seem<00:06:44.599> to<00:06:44.629> have<00:06:44.870> the<00:06:45.020> game<00:06:45.229> together

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:45.439 
they both seem to have the game together

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.189 
they both seem to have the game together
today
