00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.440 

all<00:01:38.070> right<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> plastic<00:01:38.939> insulator

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
all right we have the plastic insulator

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.740 
all right we have the plastic insulator
set<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> aside<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:41.580> put<00:01:42.119> back<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.390> when<00:01:42.600> we're

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
set it aside to put back on when we're

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.469 
set it aside to put back on when we're
finished<00:01:43.039> now<00:01:44.039> to<00:01:44.369> remove<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> capacitors

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
finished now to remove the capacitors

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.779 
finished now to remove the capacitors
from<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> board<00:01:46.159> or<00:01:47.159> use<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.430> soldering

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
from the board or use your soldering

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.919 
from the board or use your soldering
iron<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:49.289> D<00:01:49.500> solder<00:01:49.740> wick<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.929> basically

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
iron and the D solder wick and basically

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.600 
iron and the D solder wick and basically
what<00:01:52.140> you'll<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.619> put<00:01:52.860> your<00:01:52.979> D<00:01:53.130> solder<00:01:53.369> wick

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
what you'll do is put your D solder wick

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.800 
what you'll do is put your D solder wick
on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.479> leg<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> capacitor<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.600> put

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
on the leg of the capacitor and then put

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.419 
on the leg of the capacitor and then put
the<00:01:57.899> soldering<00:01:58.200> iron<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.130> soldering

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
the soldering iron there the soldering

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.180 
the soldering iron there the soldering
iron<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.789> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> heat<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.539> solder<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.190> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
iron is going to heat the solder and the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.559 
iron is going to heat the solder and the
wick<00:02:02.369> will<00:02:02.580> absorb<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:05.670> free<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.119> leg<00:02:06.299> of

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
wick will absorb it to free that leg of

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.870 
wick will absorb it to free that leg of
the<00:02:06.690> capacitor<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.729> be<00:02:08.729> removed<00:02:10.580> after<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.760> do

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
the capacitor to be removed after we do

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.970 
the capacitor to be removed after we do
the<00:02:12.030> first<00:02:12.239> one<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.750> go<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.350> second<00:02:13.709> leg<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the first one I go to the second leg and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.009 
the first one I go to the second leg and
then<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.220> should<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.459> able<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:21.720> remove

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
then we should be able to just remove

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.590 
then we should be able to just remove
the<00:02:22.140> capacitor<00:02:22.290> from<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.860> board<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.330> we'll<00:02:24.450> go

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
the capacitor from the board so we'll go

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:46.880 
the capacitor from the board so we'll go
through<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:28.190> our<00:02:29.190> add<00:02:30.060> spacers

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.040 

it's<00:02:47.370> well<00:02:47.550> worth<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.910> on<00:02:48.030> these<00:02:48.180> monitors<00:02:48.390> to

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
it's well worth it on these monitors to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.000 
it's well worth it on these monitors to
get<00:02:49.770> them<00:02:49.950> fixed<00:02:50.160> because<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
get them fixed because of the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.970 
get them fixed because of the
specifications<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.220> these<00:02:53.400> monitors<00:02:54.980> you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
specifications of these monitors you

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.110 
specifications of these monitors you
won't<00:02:56.160> be<00:02:56.250> able<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.430> go<00:02:56.550> out<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.910> buy<00:02:57.090> a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
won't be able to go out and buy a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.410 
won't be able to go out and buy a
replacement<00:02:57.690> one<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:59.850> would<00:02:59.940> be<00:03:00.060> anything

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
replacement one that would be anything

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
replacement one that would be anything
near<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:01.770> quality<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.340> these<00:03:02.490> monitors<00:03:03.440> okay

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
near the quality of these monitors okay

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.920 
near the quality of these monitors okay
so<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:04.680> have<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> two<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:06.120> backlight

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
so we have the two on the backlight

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.630 
so we have the two on the backlight
inverter<00:03:06.960> side<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.070> need<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.370> get<00:03:08.520> two

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
inverter side now I need to get two

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.910 
inverter side now I need to get two
three<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> power<00:03:09.330> supply<00:03:09.540> side<00:03:15.770> and<00:03:16.770> on

just want when you're inserting it you

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.040 
just want when you're inserting it you
want<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.220> make<00:05:14.250> sure<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.700> put<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.090> negative

double<00:05:28.710> then<00:05:29.099> double<00:05:29.340> check<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.669> before<00:05:29.820> you

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
double then double check it before you

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.920 
double then double check it before you
do<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.380> soldering<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.300> say<00:05:33.599> we're<00:05:33.780> just

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
do the soldering and I say we're just

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.170 
do the soldering and I say we're just
going<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.080> repopulate<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.770> board<00:05:35.000> with<00:05:36.000> the

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
going to repopulate the board with the

going to repopulate the board with the
capacitors

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.939 

I'm<00:05:44.599> doing<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:44.960> ask<00:05:45.469> you<00:05:45.620> poke<00:05:45.800> it<00:05:45.830> through

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
I'm doing this ask you poke it through

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.640 
I'm doing this ask you poke it through
you<00:05:46.610> just<00:05:46.870> separate<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:48.020> legs<00:05:48.229> a<00:05:48.379> little<00:05:48.409> bit

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
you just separate the legs a little bit

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.420 
you just separate the legs a little bit
so<00:05:48.860> that<00:05:49.039> they<00:05:49.189> stay<00:05:49.430> in<00:05:49.460> place<00:05:50.000> until<00:05:51.069> we<00:05:52.069> have

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
so that they stay in place until we have

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.439 
so that they stay in place until we have
them<00:05:52.550> soldered<00:05:52.939> in<00:05:57.879> all<00:05:58.879> right<00:05:59.090> now<00:05:59.270> we<00:05:59.330> have

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
them soldered in all right now we have

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.899 
them soldered in all right now we have
the<00:05:59.629> capacitors<00:06:00.139> replaced<00:06:00.500> now<00:06:01.490> we<00:06:01.580> just<00:06:01.849> need

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
the capacitors replaced now we just need

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.520 
the capacitors replaced now we just need
to<00:06:02.120> do<00:06:02.240> that<00:06:02.449> soldering<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:03.110> make<00:06:03.289> the

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
to do that soldering to make the

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.309 
to do that soldering to make the
electrical<00:06:04.310> connections<00:06:05.050> again<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.169> take

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
electrical connections again you take

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.740 
electrical connections again you take
your<00:06:06.379> soldering<00:06:06.740> iron<00:06:06.800> and<00:06:07.159> solder<00:06:07.659> and<00:06:08.659> what

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
your soldering iron and solder and what

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.939 
your soldering iron and solder and what
you<00:06:08.870> want<00:06:09.020> to<00:06:09.080> do<00:06:09.169> is<00:06:09.319> put<00:06:09.560> your<00:06:09.650> soldering

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
you want to do is put your soldering

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.159 
you want to do is put your soldering
iron<00:06:10.159> on<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.639> terminal<00:06:11.090> heat<00:06:11.900> it<00:06:12.080> up

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
iron on the terminal heat it up

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.409 
iron on the terminal heat it up
momentarily<00:06:12.710> then<00:06:13.520> apply<00:06:13.819> the<00:06:13.879> solder<00:06:14.270> and

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
momentarily then apply the solder and

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.879 
momentarily then apply the solder and
then<00:06:14.659> the<00:06:14.750> solder<00:06:14.960> will<00:06:15.199> melt<00:06:15.409> and<00:06:15.650> make<00:06:15.830> a

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
then the solder will melt and make a

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.950 
then the solder will melt and make a
nice<00:06:16.189> clean<00:06:16.639> connection<00:06:18.729> the<00:06:19.729> solder

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
nice clean connection the solder

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.300 
nice clean connection the solder
connection<00:06:20.960> should<00:06:21.229> be<00:06:21.289> bright<00:06:21.680> and<00:06:21.979> shiny

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
connection should be bright and shiny

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.309 
connection should be bright and shiny
metallic<00:06:22.819> colored<00:06:24.669> if<00:06:25.669> it's<00:06:26.029> not<00:06:26.419> shiny<00:06:26.810> then

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
metallic colored if it's not shiny then

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.869 
metallic colored if it's not shiny then
that<00:06:27.469> is<00:06:27.590> what's<00:06:27.800> called<00:06:27.979> a<00:06:28.129> cold<00:06:28.490> solder

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:28.879 
that is what's called a cold solder

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.029 
that is what's called a cold solder
joint<00:06:29.210> and<00:06:29.479> you'll<00:06:30.199> need<00:06:30.379> to<00:06:30.500> heat<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:30.710> up<00:06:30.860> and

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
joint and you'll need to heat it up and

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.610 
joint and you'll need to heat it up and
reapply<00:06:32.000> a<00:06:32.029> little<00:06:32.330> bit<00:06:32.419> of<00:06:32.509> solder<00:06:32.719> to<00:06:33.469> make

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
reapply a little bit of solder to make

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.709 
reapply a little bit of solder to make
sure<00:06:33.770> that<00:06:33.949> it<00:06:34.069> is<00:06:34.159> a<00:06:34.340> good<00:06:34.580> shiny<00:06:35.360> solder

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:35.719 
sure that it is a good shiny solder

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:50.600 
sure that it is a good shiny solder
joint

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.300 

all<00:06:51.610> right<00:06:52.320> now<00:06:53.320> we<00:06:53.380> have<00:06:53.560> the<00:06:53.650> new<00:06:53.770> capacitor

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
all right now we have the new capacitor

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.990 
all right now we have the new capacitor
soldered<00:06:54.700> in<00:06:54.820> and<00:06:55.510> now<00:06:56.440> you<00:06:56.500> take<00:06:56.890> your

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
soldered in and now you take your

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.610 
soldered in and now you take your
diagonal<00:06:58.000> cutters<00:06:58.480> and<00:06:58.750> cut<00:06:59.230> off<00:06:59.380> the

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
diagonal cutters and cut off the

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:15.000 
diagonal cutters and cut off the
remaining<00:07:00.990> legs<00:07:01.990> of<00:07:02.290> the<00:07:02.380> capacitors<00:07:14.010> and

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
remaining legs of the capacitors and

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:21.660 
remaining legs of the capacitors and
then<00:07:15.610> reinstall<00:07:15.910> your<00:07:18.360> insulation<00:07:19.360> layer<00:07:20.670> and

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:21.670 
then reinstall your insulation layer and

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.550 
then reinstall your insulation layer and
there<00:07:22.090> we<00:07:22.180> are<00:07:22.210> one<00:07:22.660> repaired<00:07:23.050> power<00:07:23.290> supply

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
there we are one repaired power supply

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.320 
there we are one repaired power supply
board<00:07:23.860> now<00:07:24.490> I<00:07:24.520> want<00:07:24.670> to<00:07:24.700> take<00:07:24.790> it<00:07:24.910> back<00:07:25.000> over<00:07:25.210> to

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
board now I want to take it back over to

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.140 
board now I want to take it back over to
the<00:07:25.420> monitor<00:07:25.750> and<00:07:25.870> install<00:07:26.860> it<00:07:27.070> and<00:07:27.190> see<00:07:28.090> if

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150 
the monitor and install it and see if

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:39.310 
the monitor and install it and see if
we've<00:07:28.330> got<00:07:28.780> a<00:07:28.810> good<00:07:29.170> repair<00:07:29.470> on<00:07:29.590> it
