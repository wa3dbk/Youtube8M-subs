 kind of emergency then these are 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.809

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.260

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.000
 after the conflict we had 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.940
 we 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 in 95 it was seen the need to improve 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.660
 and also increase the capacity of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.280
 burden on what is personal and 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.860

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.320
 helps a lot to what is the help to the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.820
 population in general and to our 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.000
 detachments in the most 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.729

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.640

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.479
 it's quite broad and how we 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.040
 we showed this ship the government the 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.440
 The Ecuadorian government has acquired it in 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.910
 emergency case when there is any 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.649
 flood and the citizens have to 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.479
 leave emergency as we can 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.460
 observe is quite how you leave so 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.070
 time and we see here also some 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.690
 youngsters to a family also a 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.970
 member of the jungle battalion number 72 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.350
 love that they are in, seeing that 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.030
 the ship is in perfect condition 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.729
 also doing the recognition as 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.860
 citizens knowing what the government 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.450
 has been doing in the field of 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.460
 safety and above all also of 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.940
 prevention for accidents that 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.780
 can give for the climate in our country 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.250
 The only one 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.880
 restriction that you could have is for your 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.300
 size and its strength is always to land 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.030
 in broad sectors where it does not affect 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.640
 which they are housing and 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.170
 facilities that it has therefore is 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.130
 the only restriction there is a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.080
 magnificent aircraft that is always at 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.840
