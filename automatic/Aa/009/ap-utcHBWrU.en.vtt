00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.460
 we are coming to santa monica california the third street walk 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.310
 and all these people are tired of shopping 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.029
 and is hanging out sitting on the park's slopes 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.869
 It is the perfect place to 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.519
 the people and talk to them 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.089
 it sounds a little crazy 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.019
 which the mother can close 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.960
 in terms of presence in 2005 to be with them of important things 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.890
 one of the first things you say he said to his disciples may come to me 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.800
 I will make you offer solutions 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.010
 Regarding fishing 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.400
 more and more interests you expect that the winter months 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.100
 it was precisely the banks but it is very unlikely 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.870
 so every Christian without exception must have his own place of celebration 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.480
 We are trying to reach our friends and family but when Christ 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 diluted throughout the world and preach the gospel to every creature 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.590
 the unknown 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.439
 they are thank God to visit them 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.280
 We have to win 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.180
 in the upper room only two sides 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 and hoping that clueless people 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 the state of baja california durango 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 we are launching the year 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 so 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.570
 some things in my pockets that will help me some tools to 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 testify as 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.750
 behind me 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.000
 They are good to start a conversation 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 also 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.530
 one million dollars 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.730
 It is a lot of fun 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.159
 we are having fun and we are 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.290
 actions on this but it does not mean that we are not taking seriously what 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.859
 we make 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.589
 Donoso with them doing something like that 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.859
 why not relax 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.859
 and said that here 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.149
 these guys do not know we're filming them 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.989
 I'm just sorry for them said today that they do answer some questions 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.379
 correctly I will make you free money and ask you questions just for 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.349
 that open 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.349
 now it's going to start with the regulars where are they from 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.569
 They said they did not want to like that in Bangladesh 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.569
 or that which is the capital of the new Indian delhi 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.359
 I'm not sure just a hundred chance 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.079
 I can give it to them all far from doing it to him, I'll tell you something 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.499
 efe jad have never thought about life after death sweat a lot in that 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.329
 those thought about it 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.259
 you have some thought of life and death so I think that I do believe 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.430
 that when someone dies when you touch you I have how much your number touches that 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.329
 it touches so much 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.799
 then that god exists 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:10.989
 no, they do not do it 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.669
 assistants adam allo and you have thought you obviously have not thought about that 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.829
 I have not thought about it and let me tell you in about 30 seconds I can check it 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.759
 that god exists easy then when you look at the barracks as you know that a 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.399
 painter 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.399
 the picture truly exists as having a painted picture 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.269
 you see what I say he's thinking about that these squares when you look at a building 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.529
 as you know how a builder the building is proof that there is a 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.540
 builder and creation proves that there are 11 to 12 and your conscience tells you 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.559
 When you do good or evil, do not go back to a good perspective 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.339
 if you said a lie that makes a liar 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.409
 have you ever stolen something yes 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.409
 and that makes you a thief an okey thief 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.979
 to one I'm asking if you believe in god of this he said that anyone looks at you 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.199
 a woman with greed is already blue but in her heart 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.689
 have you ever looked at a woman with the best mini-series covetous good though 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.709
 We've all done it. I've used the name of God in vain. 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.519
 they grow him yes what you call dir I lived I am king you know what god did for you 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.199
 so that I did not have to go to hell because I was raised by Catholics and 3 percent 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.130
 the thesis of the bible 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.299
 then what did 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.139
 died on the cross 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.430
 like you, punishment for if you were free because everything is history 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.900
 and now share the gospel once you understand that it is sin and that God and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.910
 your provision for your forgiveness then makes sense but without meaning yes yes 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:39.030
 yes I believe in that you have a bible if I have in fact I have three three types 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.499
 local powers so you think power and speed so what 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:46.150
 Queen is doing now is cheering it up her bible 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.910
 He said he noticed liquor 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.150
 min really wants me to start thinking seriously about these things because 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.440
 in that position if the word of God comes I will believe but in his next 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.190
 dissident book determined that there is no god that this follows sometimes is 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.229
 interesting to reason with people 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.599
 but surely his conscience already did 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.620
 he understands that he will need God's forgiveness on the day of judgment and has 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:08.960
 ear of the gospel and now he had hours for the holy spirit trachea 

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:11.969
 conditions your heart and what to salvation 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.620
 if you look at these guys are investing in big 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.620
 nobody has been offended 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:22.529
 that's an opportunity these devices 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.270
