curl really well and but I curled this
very<00:01:54.530> lightly<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:55.040> didn't<00:01:55.460> want<00:01:55.640> any<00:01:55.790> curls<00:01:56.150> in

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.550 
very lightly I didn't want any curls in
it<00:01:56.390> like<00:01:56.540> i<00:01:56.600> said<00:01:56.780> i<00:01:56.840> wanted<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.200> keep<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.470> a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
it like i said i wanted to keep it a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.940 
it like i said i wanted to keep it a
little<00:01:57.590> bit<00:01:57.830> more<00:01:57.950> straight<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.230> yeah<00:02:00.230> so<00:02:00.920> i

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
little bit more straight and yeah so i

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.840 
little bit more straight and yeah so i
think<00:02:01.190> that's<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.730> I<00:02:03.220> don't<00:02:04.220> really<00:02:04.370> I<00:02:04.490> don't

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
think that's it I don't really I don't

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.790 
think that's it I don't really I don't
think<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.300> can<00:02:05.510> really<00:02:05.690> say<00:02:05.960> much<00:02:05.990> an<00:02:06.380> initial

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
think I can really say much an initial
