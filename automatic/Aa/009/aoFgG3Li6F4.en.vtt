we<00:06:19.220> have<00:06:19.490> got<00:06:21.460> a<00:06:22.460> mega<00:06:23.240> I<00:06:23.450> think<00:06:23.630> that<00:06:23.720> says<00:06:23.870> I

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
we have got a mega I think that says I

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.830 
we have got a mega I think that says I
met<00:06:24.530> I<00:06:24.710> can't<00:06:24.919> even<00:06:24.950> say<00:06:25.250> it<00:06:25.280> is<00:06:26.180> it<00:06:26.330> a<00:06:26.360> megabyte
