hey<00:00:16.049> John<00:00:16.289> when<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> pitched<00:00:16.770> from<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.039> wind<00:00:17.250> up

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
hey John when I pitched from the wind up

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
hey John when I pitched from the wind up
I<00:00:17.580> feel<00:00:17.760> like<00:00:17.910> I'm<00:00:18.060> getting<00:00:18.359> more<00:00:18.539> velocity<00:00:19.170> on

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
I feel like I'm getting more velocity on

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.710 
I feel like I'm getting more velocity on
my<00:00:19.410> pitches<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.980> heavier<00:00:20.189> fast<00:00:20.550> balls<00:00:20.850> but

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
my pitches and heavier fast balls but

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.420 
my pitches and heavier fast balls but
when<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.529> stretch<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.010> feel<00:00:23.220> more

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
when I go to the stretch I feel more

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.429 
when I go to the stretch I feel more
consistent<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> tiny<00:00:24.480> bit<00:00:24.720> more<00:00:24.960> accurate

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
consistent and a tiny bit more accurate

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.230 
consistent and a tiny bit more accurate
but<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> same<00:00:26.340> time<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.820> feels<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.150> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
but at the same time it feels like I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.730 
but at the same time it feels like I
lose<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.630> bit<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.960> velocity<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.619> my

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
lose a little bit of velocity on my

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679 
lose a little bit of velocity on my
pitches<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.880> think<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.210> pitching

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
pitches what do you think about pitching

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.299 
pitches what do you think about pitching
from<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> wind<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.410> versus<00:00:31.830> pitching<00:00:32.160> from

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
from the wind up versus pitching from

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.250 
from the wind up versus pitching from
the<00:00:32.369> stretch<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.450> nobody<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:33.870> base

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the stretch when there's nobody on base

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
the stretch when there's nobody on base
thanks<00:00:34.890> well<00:00:35.640> Mitch<00:00:35.850> that's<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> great

thanks well Mitch that's a great
question<00:00:37.020> first<00:00:37.500> off<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.340> always<00:00:39.270> pitched<00:00:39.930> from

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
question first off I always pitched from

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.400 
question first off I always pitched from
the<00:00:40.530> stretch<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.340> well<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.300> always<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:42.780> in

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the stretch so well not always but in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.500 
the stretch so well not always but in
college<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> professional<00:00:44.969> baseball<00:00:45.090> house

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
college and professional baseball house

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.740 
college and professional baseball house
always<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> stress<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:48.329> are

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
always from the stress because you are

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.020 
always from the stress because you are
you<00:00:49.530> never<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.309> pitch<00:00:50.489> from<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> lineup

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you never have to pitch from the lineup

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.250 
you never have to pitch from the lineup
but<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.780> pitch<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> stretch

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
but you have to pitch from the stretch

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.500 
but you have to pitch from the stretch
when<00:00:52.620> someone's<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.039> base<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.489> my<00:00:53.969> theory<00:00:54.180> was

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
when someone's on base so my theory was

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.930 
when someone's on base so my theory was
that<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> practice<00:00:55.559> something

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
that if I'm going to practice something

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.400 
that if I'm going to practice something
why<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.120> let<00:00:57.270> me<00:00:57.360> practice<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
why not let me practice what I have to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.569 
why not let me practice what I have to
do<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:58.920> there<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.460> have

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
do when I'm out there so I can have

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.369 
do when I'm out there so I can have
something<00:00:59.850> more<00:01:00.120> consistent<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.140> can

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
something more consistent so you can

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
something more consistent so you can
take<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.800> you're<00:01:01.949> consistent<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
take what you're consistent with in

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.980 
take what you're consistent with in
control<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:05.119> accuracy<00:01:06.119> throw<00:01:06.600> more<00:01:06.810> strikes

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
control and accuracy throw more strikes

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750 
control and accuracy throw more strikes
and<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> felt<00:01:07.650> better<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.520> said

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and you felt better I think you said

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.210 
and you felt better I think you said
from<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> stress<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.680> then

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
from the stress so take of that and then

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.609 
from the stress so take of that and then
work<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.729> gaining<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> ground<00:01:13.049> force<00:01:13.409> at

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
work on gaining that ground force at

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.899 
work on gaining that ground force at
that<00:01:13.770> extra<00:01:14.189> ground<00:01:14.460> force<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> you're

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that extra ground force that you're

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.230 
that extra ground force that you're
getting<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> windup<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> practice<00:01:16.619> on

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
getting and the windup and practice on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.219 
getting and the windup and practice on
translating<00:01:18.240> once<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.689> from<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> window

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
translating once you do from the window

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.710 
translating once you do from the window
into<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> stretch<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.540> can

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
into the stretch and then see if you can

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.410 
into the stretch and then see if you can
make<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> more<00:01:22.350> consistent<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
make that more consistent from there I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.980 
make that more consistent from there I
definitely<00:01:24.840> am<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:26.040> big<00:01:26.220> stretch<00:01:26.580> guy<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.360> think

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
definitely am a big stretch guy I think

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
definitely am a big stretch guy I think
everyone's<00:01:28.350> pitched<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> from<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
everyone's pitched from the from the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600 
everyone's pitched from the from the
stretch<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.610> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
stretch and if you do that well you you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
stretch and if you do that well you you
know<00:01:32.729> you're<00:01:32.850> gonna<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.119> able<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.500> more

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.050 
know you're gonna be able to to be more
consistent<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.790> you're<00:01:35.909> not

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
consistent just because you're not

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660 
consistent just because you're not
practicing<00:01:36.299> two<00:01:36.930> different<00:01:37.259> things<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.670> try

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670

practicing two different things so try
now<00:01:38.820> hope<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.240> helps<00:01:39.479> hope<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.840> answer
