we just wrote in to the tailor for geria
and<00:00:17.990> in<00:00:18.320> our<00:00:18.440> first<00:00:18.710> snow<00:00:19.190> pet<00:00:19.430> we<00:00:19.550> found<00:00:19.789> great

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
and in our first snow pet we found great

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.439 
and in our first snow pet we found great
strong<00:00:20.810> stable<00:00:21.439> snow<00:00:21.880> but<00:00:22.880> what's<00:00:23.029> concerning

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449

me is in our second pit now in our third
pit<00:00:27.350> we<00:00:27.500> found<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.949> layer<00:00:28.130> of<00:00:28.160> surface<00:00:28.820> or

surface hores like frozen do on the
snowpack<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.570> you<00:00:32.660> can<00:00:32.780> see<00:00:33.050> it<00:00:33.140> if<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:33.320> dig

snowpack and you can see it if you dig
down<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:34.579> can<00:00:34.700> see<00:00:34.880> a<00:00:34.910> bit<00:00:34.969> of<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.300> stripe<00:00:36.260> and

down you can see a bit of a stripe and

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.920 
down you can see a bit of a stripe and
snow<00:00:37.130> pack<00:00:37.340> right<00:00:37.940> here<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:41.540> scary<00:00:41.840> thing

about<00:00:42.079> surface<00:00:42.680> whore<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:43.340> that<00:00:43.780> often<00:00:44.780> times

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
about surface whore is that often times

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.660 
about surface whore is that often times
it<00:00:45.110> will<00:00:45.170> form<00:00:45.440> everywhere<00:00:45.890> but<00:00:46.219> get<00:00:46.399> knocked

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
it will form everywhere but get knocked

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.549 
it will form everywhere but get knocked
down<00:00:46.850> by<00:00:47.210> wind<00:00:47.480> or<00:00:47.750> destroyed<00:00:48.079> by<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.289> Sun

certain<00:00:49.039> areas<00:00:49.520> that's<00:00:50.090> what<00:00:50.239> happens<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:50.809> it

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
certain areas that's what happens is it

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:03.130 
certain areas that's what happens is it
really<00:00:51.379> pocket<00:00:52.989> just<00:00:53.989> like<00:01:01.690> counting<00:01:02.690> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
really pocket just like counting the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.290 
really pocket just like counting the
swimming<00:01:03.680> thanks<00:01:03.980> from<00:01:04.100> stable<00:01:04.550> we<00:01:05.000> stopped

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
swimming thanks from stable we stopped

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.210 
swimming thanks from stable we stopped
bugging<00:01:05.600> out<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:05.899> it<00:01:06.080> I<00:01:06.290> found<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:06.830> service

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
bugging out of it I found this service

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.210 
bugging out of it I found this service
or<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:08.000> doesn't<00:01:08.210> seem<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.570> be<00:01:08.689> too<00:01:08.720> reactive

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
or it doesn't seem to be too reactive

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.530 
or it doesn't seem to be too reactive
but<00:01:10.220> definitely<00:01:10.640> something<00:01:10.970> to<00:01:11.060> be<00:01:11.090> heads<00:01:11.420> up

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
but definitely something to be heads up

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.950 
but definitely something to be heads up
about<00:01:11.710> mainly<00:01:12.710> because<00:01:13.360> it's<00:01:14.360> propagating

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
about mainly because it's propagating

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.999 
about mainly because it's propagating
across<00:01:15.409> in<00:01:15.770> our<00:01:16.130> stability<00:01:16.369> tests<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:18.009> it

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
across in our stability tests and it

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.440 
across in our stability tests and it
could<00:01:19.159> definitely<00:01:19.340> cause<00:01:19.670> an<00:01:19.880> avalanche<00:01:20.000> so

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
could definitely cause an avalanche so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.120 
could definitely cause an avalanche so
here<00:01:20.630> we'll<00:01:20.750> do<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:20.990> extend<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> colony<00:01:21.950> suit

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
here we'll do it extend a colony suit

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:34.800 
here we'll do it extend a colony suit
visitor

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.889 

they're<00:01:35.810> ats<00:01:35.990> ECT<00:01:36.770> p<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:38.090> propagate<00:01:38.689> it<00:01:38.810> all

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
they're ats ECT p to propagate it all

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:46.660 
they're ats ECT p to propagate it all
the<00:01:38.990> way<00:01:39.049> across<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:41.420> 11<00:01:44.829> so<00:01:45.829> there's<00:01:46.490> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
the way across on 11 so there's the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.630 
the way across on 11 so there's the
problem<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.770> just<00:01:48.770> be<00:01:48.890> heads<00:01:49.039> up<00:01:49.219> for<00:01:49.429> it<00:01:49.520> be

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
problem and just be heads up for it be

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.760 
problem and just be heads up for it be
looking<00:01:49.939> for<00:01:50.179> it<00:01:50.329> if<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.990> don't<00:01:51.289> find<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.709> in

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
looking for it if you don't find it in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.589 
looking for it if you don't find it in
one<00:01:51.920> location<00:01:52.250> don't<00:01:52.759> assume<00:01:52.909> that<00:01:53.329> it<00:01:53.420> won't

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
one location don't assume that it won't

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.130 
one location don't assume that it won't
exist<00:01:53.929> in<00:01:54.109> another<00:01:54.229> location<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.159> it's<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:56.140> it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
exist in another location and it's a it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.609 
exist in another location and it's a it
could<00:01:57.649> be<00:01:57.770> potentially<00:01:59.049> problematic<00:02:00.049> for

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
could be potentially problematic for

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.770 
could be potentially problematic for
snowmobiling<00:02:01.099> because<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:02.149> can<00:02:02.299> hit<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:02.689> many

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
snowmobiling because we can hit so many

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.469 
snowmobiling because we can hit so many
slopes<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:03.439> a<00:02:03.560> day<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:05.000> might<00:02:05.149> just<00:02:05.329> find

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
slopes in a day that you might just find

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.059 
slopes in a day that you might just find
that<00:02:05.719> one<00:02:05.929> spot<00:02:06.229> where<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.469> get<00:02:06.619> an<00:02:06.709> avalanche

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
that one spot where you get an avalanche

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.190 
that one spot where you get an avalanche
so<00:02:07.340> just<00:02:07.849> make<00:02:08.030> sure<00:02:08.060> you're<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.750> one<00:02:08.959> at<00:02:09.110> a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
so just make sure you're going one at a

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.800 
so just make sure you're going one at a
time<00:02:09.729> your<00:02:10.729> partners<00:02:11.120> are<00:02:11.209> watching<00:02:11.569> you<00:02:11.660> from

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
time your partners are watching you from

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.600 
time your partners are watching you from
a<00:02:11.930> safe<00:02:12.170> zone<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.620> assume<00:02:12.920> every<00:02:13.220> slope<00:02:13.459> you
