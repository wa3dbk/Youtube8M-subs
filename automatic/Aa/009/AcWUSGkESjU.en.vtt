everybody<00:00:01.740> what<00:00:02.010> we're<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.429> look<00:00:02.550> at

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
everybody what we're going to look at

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.420 
everybody what we're going to look at
this<00:00:02.850> afternoon<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.200> install<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
this afternoon is how to install the

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.230 
this afternoon is how to install the
valve<00:00:05.730> body<00:00:06.060> into<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> zenith<00:00:07.500> 5<00:00:07.799> HP<00:00:08.240> 19

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
valve body into a zenith 5 HP 19

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.169 
valve body into a zenith 5 HP 19
transmission<00:00:10.340> before<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.700> put<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.000> valve

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
transmission before you put the valve

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.669 
transmission before you put the valve
body<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.840> disassemble<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.650> whole

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
body and if you disassemble the whole

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
body and if you disassemble the whole
transmission<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:15.210> would<00:00:15.299> obviously<00:00:15.509> need<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
transmission you would obviously need to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.640 
transmission you would obviously need to
put<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.440> two<00:00:17.070> oil<00:00:17.970> pump<00:00:18.270> tubes<00:00:18.840> as<00:00:19.109> well<00:00:19.529> as

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
put in the two oil pump tubes as well as

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.490 
put in the two oil pump tubes as well as
a<00:00:19.680> spring<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.430> brass<00:00:20.730> piece<00:00:20.810> for<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a spring and this brass piece for the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.790 
a spring and this brass piece for the
pressure<00:00:23.430> control<00:00:23.730> valve<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.529> also<00:00:25.529> if

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
pressure control valve in there also if

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.849 
pressure control valve in there also if
you've<00:00:25.949> removed<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:27.289> the<00:00:28.289> input<00:00:28.619> speed

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you've removed the the input speed

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.709 
you've removed the the input speed
sensor<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.849> would<00:00:30.000> also<00:00:30.119> need<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.810> put<00:00:31.560> in

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
sensor that would also need to be put in

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
sensor that would also need to be put in
but<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.870> we're<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.649> put<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.460> valve

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
but then we're going to put in the valve

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.190 
but then we're going to put in the valve
body<00:00:38.120> when<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> put<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> valve<00:00:39.750> body<00:00:39.960> I'm

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
body when I put in the valve body I'm

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.690 
body when I put in the valve body I'm
going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> electrical

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
going to have all of the electrical

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.860 
going to have all of the electrical
connections<00:00:42.320> attached<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:47.570> when<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.600> put

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
connections attached to it when I put

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
connections attached to it when I put
the<00:00:48.960> valve<00:00:49.170> body<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.160> transmission<00:00:50.700> if

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the valve body into the transmission if

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.250 
the valve body into the transmission if
it's<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it's like this it's actually a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.010 
it's like this it's actually a
relatively<00:00:52.739> simple<00:00:53.010> task<00:00:53.510> however<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.840> it's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
relatively simple task however if it's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220 
relatively simple task however if it's
in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> car<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.300> valve<00:00:57.510> body<00:00:57.719> itself<00:00:58.079> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
in the car then the valve body itself is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.860 
in the car then the valve body itself is
actually<00:00:58.559> quite<00:00:58.829> heavy<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.309> my<00:00:59.789> suggestion<00:01:00.239> is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
actually quite heavy so my suggestion is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.680 
actually quite heavy so my suggestion is
that<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:02.010> floor<00:01:02.910> jack<00:01:03.149> sitting

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that you would have a floor jack sitting

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010 
that you would have a floor jack sitting
underneath<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.760> gently<00:01:05.760> raise<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
underneath here gently raise the the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.500 
underneath here gently raise the the
valve<00:01:07.710> body<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.400> position<00:01:08.850> whilst<00:01:09.090> lining

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
valve body into position whilst lining

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
valve body into position whilst lining
everything<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.950> damage<00:01:11.130> any<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
everything up so we don't damage any of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.969 
everything up so we don't damage any of
these<00:01:11.790> faces<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> transmission

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
these faces on here on the transmission

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.719 
these faces on here on the transmission
or<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> underside<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.570> valve<00:01:15.780> body

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
or on the underside of the valve body

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.670 
or on the underside of the valve body
when<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.759> put<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> valve<00:01:18.540> body<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.990> something

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
when we put the valve body in something

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.710 
when we put the valve body in something
that<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.890> need<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.610> ensure<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that we need to do is ensure that a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.070 
that we need to do is ensure that a
little<00:01:22.280> notch<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.240> manual<00:01:24.630> selector

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
little notch here on the manual selector

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.510 
little notch here on the manual selector
valve<00:01:25.290> AC<00:01:25.500> lines<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.670> Tang<00:01:28.520> so

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
valve AC lines up here with this Tang so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.130 
valve AC lines up here with this Tang so
what<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:31.729> gently<00:01:33.140> lower

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
what I'm going to do is gently lower

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.270 
what I'm going to do is gently lower
that<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:35.570> make<00:01:36.570> sure<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.380> may<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that down make sure that I may have to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.510 
that down make sure that I may have to
move<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.290> shaft<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.860> bit<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.340> in

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
move that shaft a little bit so it's in

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.710 
move that shaft a little bit so it's in
the<00:01:41.610> right<00:01:41.790> position<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:44.180> then<00:01:45.180> once<00:01:45.450> that's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the right position and then once that's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.830 
the right position and then once that's
slotted<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> line<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.880> holes

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
slotted I'm going to line up the holes

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.319 
slotted I'm going to line up the holes
at<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> front<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.770> make<00:01:50.729> sure<00:01:50.939> everything's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
at the front here make sure everything's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.120 
at the front here make sure everything's
in<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> right<00:01:51.600> spot<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:52.770> once<00:01:52.950> it's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
in the right spot and then once it's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.390 
in the right spot and then once it's
there<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.799> gently<00:01:55.799> push<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.130> them

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.200 

and<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.090> in<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.270> position<00:02:06.820> once<00:02:07.820> that's<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
and that's in a position once that's in

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.540 
and that's in a position once that's in
position<00:02:08.660> we<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.960> start<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.500> put<00:02:09.770> in<00:02:10.040> the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
position we can start to put in the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.960 
position we can start to put in the
bolts<00:02:14.920> won't<00:02:15.920> actually<00:02:16.160> put<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.640> whole<00:02:16.790> lot

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
bolts won't actually put in a whole lot

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
bolts won't actually put in a whole lot
of<00:02:17.000> these<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.420> don't<00:02:17.600> have<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.780> watch<00:02:17.960> me

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
of these so you don't have to watch me

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:45.330 
of these so you don't have to watch me
do<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:19.870> I'll<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.020> put<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.350> couple

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.520 

once<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:46.459> connected<00:02:46.940> now<00:02:47.330> we<00:02:47.390> can<00:02:47.810> connect

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
once that's connected now we can connect

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.290 
once that's connected now we can connect
up<00:02:48.650> all<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.160> electrical<00:02:49.670> connections<00:02:50.120> so

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
up all of the electrical connections so

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.390 
up all of the electrical connections so
the<00:02:50.450> first<00:02:50.750> thing<00:02:50.989> I'm<00:02:51.230> going<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.440> do<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.980> just

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
the first thing I'm going to do is just

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.130 
the first thing I'm going to do is just
this<00:02:52.489> one<00:02:52.550> here<00:02:52.970> which<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.180> for<00:02:53.599> that<00:02:53.840> input

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
this one here which is for that input

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.670 
this one here which is for that input
speed<00:02:54.620> sensor<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:56.330> just<00:02:56.630> gets<00:02:57.440> pushed

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
speed sensor it just gets pushed

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.589 
speed sensor it just gets pushed
straight<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:58.040> there<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.400> then<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:58.790> clipped

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
straight in there and then just clipped

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.140 
straight in there and then just clipped
onto<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.590> little<00:03:00.739> lugs<00:03:01.069> on<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.430> top<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
onto the little lugs on the top of the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.630 
onto the little lugs on the top of the
bow<00:03:02.300> body<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:03.319> next<00:03:03.590> one<00:03:03.739> is<00:03:04.010> going<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.400> be<00:03:04.520> the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
bow body the next one is going to be the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:40.620 
bow body the next one is going to be the
output<00:03:04.819> speed<00:03:05.270> sensor<00:03:05.690> which<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.470> down<00:03:06.800> here

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.390 

these<00:03:41.200> would<00:03:41.380> obviously<00:03:41.620> need<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:41.950> be<00:03:42.130> talked

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
these would obviously need to be talked

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.040 
these would obviously need to be talked
correctly<00:03:43.090> as<00:03:43.330> per<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.840> Zenith<00:03:44.110> manual<00:03:46.050> and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
correctly as per the Zenith manual and

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.230 
correctly as per the Zenith manual and
the<00:03:47.170> last<00:03:47.380> one<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.680> need<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.920> put<00:03:48.100> in<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
the last one we need to put in is the

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.330 
the last one we need to put in is the
large<00:03:49.750> illogical<00:03:50.380> plug<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.770> goes<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.220> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
large illogical plug that goes to the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.960 
large illogical plug that goes to the
outside<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:53.320> best<00:03:53.530> way<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.710> do<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:57.730> fit

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
outside the best way to do that just fit

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.600 
outside the best way to do that just fit
it<00:03:58.060> down<00:03:58.210> here<00:03:58.620> stick<00:03:59.620> your<00:04:02.370> fingers<00:04:03.370> through

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
it down here stick your fingers through

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:12.450 
it down here stick your fingers through
and<00:04:09.810> then<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:10.840> from<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.620> inside<00:04:11.920> just<00:04:12.190> push

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
and then just from the inside just push

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.550 
and then just from the inside just push
it<00:04:12.610> into<00:04:12.760> place<00:04:13.000> make<00:04:13.390> sure<00:04:13.990> you<00:04:14.110> look<00:04:14.380> down

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
it into place make sure you look down

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.140 
it into place make sure you look down
here<00:04:14.620> it's<00:04:15.100> pretty<00:04:15.280> obvious<00:04:15.670> if<00:04:15.820> it's<00:04:15.970> not

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
here it's pretty obvious if it's not

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.000 
here it's pretty obvious if it's not
flush<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:17.730> once<00:04:18.750> that's<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.989> then<00:04:20.680> we<00:04:20.860> can

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
flush and once that's in then we can

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.460 
flush and once that's in then we can
just<00:04:21.190> put<00:04:21.340> on<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.580> clip<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.990> make<00:04:23.140> sure<00:04:23.320> that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
just put on that clip to make sure that

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:32.970 
just put on that clip to make sure that
doesn't<00:04:23.770> come<00:04:23.890> out

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.690 

once<00:04:33.980> we've<00:04:34.160> done<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.310> we<00:04:34.550> can<00:04:34.580> oil<00:04:35.510> filter

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
once we've done that we can oil filter

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.190 
once we've done that we can oil filter
pretty<00:04:37.700> simple<00:04:38.060> operation<00:04:38.540> there<00:04:38.930> are<00:04:39.020> two

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
pretty simple operation there are two

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.620 
pretty simple operation there are two
bolts<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:40.670> one<00:04:40.790> at<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:40.970> back<00:04:41.120> just<00:04:41.330> leave

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
bolts the one at the back just leave

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.400 
bolts the one at the back just leave
that<00:04:41.780> loosely<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.940> one<00:04:44.090> at<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.240> front<00:04:44.410> we

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
that loosely in the one at the front we

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.730 
that loosely in the one at the front we
can<00:04:45.590> remove<00:04:49.750> I'm<00:04:50.750> just<00:04:50.870> going<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.050> slide<00:04:51.440> our

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
can remove I'm just going to slide our

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.410 
can remove I'm just going to slide our
new<00:04:51.950> filter<00:04:52.220> obviously<00:04:52.670> this<00:04:52.790> one<00:04:52.970> isn't<00:04:53.270> new

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
new filter obviously this one isn't new

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.660 
new filter obviously this one isn't new
but<00:04:53.450> you'll<00:04:53.810> put<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.020> new<00:04:54.200> filter<00:04:54.380> in<00:04:54.890> there<00:04:55.280> and

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
but you'll put a new filter in there and

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:05.180 
but you'll put a new filter in there and
then<00:04:56.570> just<00:04:57.520> push<00:04:58.520> it<00:04:58.640> in

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.460 

then<00:05:05.730> talk<00:05:06.030> both<00:05:06.270> those<00:05:06.480> bolts<00:05:06.840> may<00:05:07.110> take

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
then talk both those bolts may take

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.540 
then talk both those bolts may take
about<00:05:07.620> six<00:05:08.040> newton<00:05:08.940> meters<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:10.250> then<00:05:11.250> once

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
about six newton meters and then once

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.220 
about six newton meters and then once
we've<00:05:11.850> done<00:05:11.880> that<00:05:13.460> we<00:05:14.460> would<00:05:14.580> get<00:05:14.700> our<00:05:14.850> pan<00:05:15.230> we

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
we've done that we would get our pan we

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.810 
we've done that we would get our pan we
put<00:05:16.260> a<00:05:16.440> new<00:05:16.590> gasket<00:05:16.620> obviously<00:05:17.520> on<00:05:17.700> the

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
put a new gasket obviously on the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.790 
put a new gasket obviously on the
outside<00:05:18.180> clean<00:05:18.780> out<00:05:18.900> our<00:05:18.930> pan<00:05:19.260> make<00:05:19.530> sure<00:05:19.680> the

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
outside clean out our pan make sure the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.110 
outside clean out our pan make sure the
magnets<00:05:20.190> are<00:05:20.310> nice<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.640> clean<00:05:20.850> and<00:05:21.030> then<00:05:26.120> put

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
magnets are nice and clean and then put

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:39.080 
magnets are nice and clean and then put
it<00:05:27.210> on

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.350 

and<00:05:39.180> talk<00:05:39.930> all<00:05:40.139> those<00:05:40.290> bolts

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
and talk all those bolts

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.650 
and talk all those bolts
I<00:05:43.280> think<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.370> Bentley<00:05:44.820> manual<00:05:45.150> talks<00:05:45.360> about

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
I think the Bentley manual talks about

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.770 
I think the Bentley manual talks about
using<00:05:47.300> blue<00:05:48.300> loctite

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
using blue loctite

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.930 
using blue loctite
on<00:05:48.990> these<00:05:49.410> to<00:05:50.190> ensure<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.520> they<00:05:50.790> don't

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
on these to ensure that they don't

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.240 
on these to ensure that they don't
vibrate<00:05:51.180> loose<00:05:51.570> but<00:05:52.320> but<00:05:52.830> people<00:05:53.130> on<00:05:53.220> the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
vibrate loose but but people on the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.520 
vibrate loose but but people on the
forum<00:05:53.669> actually<00:05:53.820> saying<00:05:54.360> that<00:05:54.540> they've<00:05:54.720> had

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
forum actually saying that they've had

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.280 
forum actually saying that they've had
issues<00:05:55.680> with<00:05:56.220> this<00:05:56.460> with<00:05:56.820> leakage<00:05:57.300> after<00:05:58.080> not

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
issues with this with leakage after not

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.750 
issues with this with leakage after not
actually<00:05:58.650> having<00:05:58.949> use<00:05:59.100> a<00:05:59.130> lock<00:05:59.340> tight<00:05:59.520> so<00:05:59.669> I

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
actually having use a lock tight so I

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.780 
actually having use a lock tight so I
suggest<00:06:00.330> you<00:06:00.389> do<00:06:00.540> that<00:06:01.190> once<00:06:02.190> everything's<00:06:02.669> on

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
suggest you do that once everything's on

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.219 
suggest you do that once everything's on
there<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.030> talked<00:06:03.300> again<00:06:03.660> these<00:06:03.840> I<00:06:04.050> think

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
there and talked again these I think

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.860 
there and talked again these I think
take<00:06:04.380> six<00:06:04.680> newton-meters<00:06:05.360> then<00:06:06.360> we're<00:06:06.660> going

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
take six newton-meters then we're going

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.420 
take six newton-meters then we're going
to<00:06:06.960> obviously<00:06:07.260> have<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.979> fill<00:06:08.280> plug

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
to obviously have the fill plug

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.460 
to obviously have the fill plug
tightened<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:09.300> talked<00:06:09.540> we're<00:06:10.229> going<00:06:10.500> to<00:06:12.470> go

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
tightened and talked we're going to go

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.190 
tightened and talked we're going to go
down<00:06:13.770> to<00:06:13.919> our<00:06:17.030> fill<00:06:18.030> plug<00:06:18.240> which<00:06:18.810> is<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.080> one

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
down to our fill plug which is the one

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.070 
down to our fill plug which is the one
down<00:06:19.380> here<00:06:20.120> we're<00:06:21.120> going<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.360> use<00:06:21.479> a<00:06:21.510> pump

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
down here we're going to use a pump

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.680 
down here we're going to use a pump
inner<00:06:22.260> tube<00:06:22.530> to<00:06:22.770> fill<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.850> transmission<00:06:24.510> up

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690

inner tube to fill the transmission up
with<00:06:24.930> fluid<00:06:25.350> until<00:06:25.620> it<00:06:25.710> just<00:06:25.889> starts<00:06:26.280> to<00:06:26.430> leak

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
with fluid until it just starts to leak

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.940 
with fluid until it just starts to leak
out<00:06:26.940> of<00:06:27.000> here<00:06:27.360> then<00:06:28.139> what<00:06:28.320> you<00:06:28.410> do<00:06:28.620> is<00:06:28.740> put<00:06:28.889> that

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
out of here then what you do is put that

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.360 
out of here then what you do is put that
back<00:06:29.250> in<00:06:29.660> jump<00:06:30.660> into<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:30.900> car<00:06:31.110> start<00:06:32.070> the<00:06:32.100> car

underneath the car remove this and then
fill<00:07:01.139> it<00:07:01.260> up<00:07:01.320> so<00:07:01.470> it's<00:07:01.590> only<00:07:01.740> just<00:07:02.070> leaking

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
fill it up so it's only just leaking

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.240 
fill it up so it's only just leaking

about 40 degrees Celsius best way to

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.050 
about 40 degrees Celsius best way to
tell<00:07:12.960> that<00:07:12.990> if<00:07:13.380> you<00:07:13.590> don't<00:07:13.770> have<00:07:14.130> the

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
Diagnostics connected to your car put

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.060 
Diagnostics connected to your car put
your<00:07:17.729> hand<00:07:18.389> on<00:07:18.510> the<00:07:18.570> pan<00:07:18.870> if<00:07:19.500> it<00:07:19.680> feels<00:07:19.889> just

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
your hand on the pan if it feels just

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.770 
your hand on the pan if it feels just
gently<00:07:20.580> warm<00:07:20.849> then<00:07:21.150> that's<00:07:21.300> about<00:07:21.570> the

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
gently warm then that's about the

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.469 
gently warm then that's about the
exactly<00:07:22.050> the<00:07:22.110> right<00:07:22.289> temperature<00:07:22.800> you<00:07:23.479> should

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
exactly the right temperature you should

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.270 
exactly the right temperature you should
be<00:07:24.630> filled<00:07:25.050> so<00:07:25.169> again<00:07:25.590> it's<00:07:25.740> only<00:07:25.979> just

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
be filled so again it's only just

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.950 
be filled so again it's only just
dribbling<00:07:26.669> out<00:07:26.760> of<00:07:26.910> here<00:07:27.180> at<00:07:27.630> the<00:07:27.840> right

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
dribbling out of here at the right

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.510 
dribbling out of here at the right
temperature<00:07:28.470> then<00:07:28.770> you<00:07:28.800> can<00:07:29.010> put<00:07:29.190> that<00:07:29.310> back

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 
temperature then you can put that back

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.150 
temperature then you can put that back
in<00:07:29.729> and<00:07:29.910> then<00:07:30.419> talk<00:07:30.660> it<00:07:30.840> and<00:07:30.990> only<00:07:31.710> once<00:07:31.919> it's

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
in and then talk it and only once it's

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.339 
in and then talk it and only once it's
plugged<00:07:32.370> again<00:07:32.700> and<00:07:32.849> talk<00:07:33.090> then<00:07:33.510> go<00:07:33.750> and<00:07:33.930> turn

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:34.349 
plugged again and talk then go and turn

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:36.490 
plugged again and talk then go and turn
off<00:07:34.560> the<00:07:34.680> car<00:07:34.919> if<00:07:35.160> you<00:07:35.280> turn<00:07:35.550> off<00:07:35.760> the<00:07:35.970> car

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.500 
off the car if you turn off the car

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.839 
off the car if you turn off the car
whilst<00:07:37.500> this<00:07:37.830> is<00:07:37.889> out<00:07:38.160> a<00:07:38.400> whole<00:07:38.550> bunch<00:07:38.639> of

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:38.849 
whilst this is out a whole bunch of

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:39.590 
whilst this is out a whole bunch of
fluid<00:07:39.060> as<00:07:39.270> I<00:07:39.330> see

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.600 
fluid as I see

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.990 
fluid as I see
flow<00:07:39.840> out<00:07:40.050> so<00:07:40.230> it<00:07:40.350> needs<00:07:40.620> to<00:07:40.740> be<00:07:40.860> going<00:07:41.130> when

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 
flow out so it needs to be going when

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.310 
flow out so it needs to be going when
you<00:07:42.090> actually<00:07:42.240> talk<00:07:42.570> this<00:07:42.750> for<00:07:42.960> the<00:07:43.020> final

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.320 
you actually talk this for the final

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.970 
you actually talk this for the final
time<00:07:43.470> okay<00:07:44.400> I<00:07:44.430> hope<00:07:44.580> this<00:07:44.700> helps
