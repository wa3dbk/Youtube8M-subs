planet Earth it can be very difficult to
work<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.940> fluid<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
work with because it's so fluid and you

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.009 
work with because it's so fluid and you
never<00:01:02.010> know<00:01:02.190> where<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.550> gonna<00:01:02.719> what's<00:01:03.719> what

never know where it's gonna what's what
it's<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.580> difficult

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it's going to do and so it's difficult

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.899 
it's going to do and so it's difficult
to<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:10.049> work<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.290> it

to be myself more to come out and show
my<00:02:14.950> emotions<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.849> other<00:02:16.000> people<00:02:16.829> whatever<00:02:17.829> no

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
my emotions to other people whatever no

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.039 
my emotions to other people whatever no
but<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.269> never<00:02:19.569> thought<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.870> would<00:02:19.989> be

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
but I never thought it would be

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.809 
but I never thought it would be
something<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.439> I<00:02:20.530> would<00:02:20.709> do<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.250> even<00:02:21.640> been

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
something that I would do and even been

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.179 
something that I would do and even been
showing<00:02:22.060> into<00:02:22.299> film<00:02:22.599> or<00:02:22.989> TV<00:02:23.349> or<00:02:23.560> something<00:02:23.920> is

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
showing into film or TV or something is

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.199 
showing into film or TV or something is
even<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.670> bigger<00:02:25.150> step<00:02:25.510> but<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.879> think<00:02:27.879> it's

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
even a bigger step but I think it's

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.110 
even a bigger step but I think it's
something<00:02:28.359> that<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.870> know<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.079> feel<00:02:29.950> very

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
something that you know I feel very

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.599 
something that you know I feel very
interested<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.870> think<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.590> would<00:02:33.489> be

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
interested in that I think I would be

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.030 
interested in that I think I would be
good<00:02:33.849> at<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.840> would<00:02:35.170> enjoy<00:02:35.439> something

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040

to<00:02:38.370> contribute<00:02:39.370> more<00:02:39.579> myself<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:41.019> know<00:02:41.140> as<00:02:42.060> an

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
to contribute more myself you know as an

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.649 
to contribute more myself you know as an
artist<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.720> guess<00:02:47.430> force<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.670> would<00:02:48.819> say<00:02:49.030> that

artist I guess force I would say that
that<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:53.290> force<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.920> something<00:02:54.579> that<00:02:55.030> must<00:02:55.540> be

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
that the force is something that must be

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.490 
that the force is something that must be
reckoned<00:02:56.049> with

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
reckoned with

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.429

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
is very important to every living thing

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.789 
is very important to every living thing
on<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.419> planet<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.019> think<00:03:20.260> I'm<00:03:20.379> told<00:03:20.650> her

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
on this planet and I think I'm told her

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.220 
on this planet and I think I'm told her
I<00:03:20.829> heard<00:03:21.099> there's<00:03:21.310> only<00:03:21.459> something<00:03:21.910> like<00:03:22.230> 1/2

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
I heard there's only something like 1/2

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.259 
I heard there's only something like 1/2
of<00:03:23.500> 1%<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.840> water<00:03:26.079> on<00:03:26.290> earth<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.769> is

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
of 1% the water on earth that is

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.680 
of 1% the water on earth that is
drinkable<00:03:28.269> water<00:03:28.419> and<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.299> shame<00:03:31.510> that

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
drinkable water and it's a shame that

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.839 
drinkable water and it's a shame that
you<00:03:31.900> know<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.199> a<00:03:32.440> lot<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.799> it<00:03:32.919> gets<00:03:33.010> wasted<00:03:33.280> I

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
you know that a lot of it gets wasted I

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.750 
you know that a lot of it gets wasted I
think<00:03:34.150> it's<00:03:34.269> important<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.750> we<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.290> know

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
think it's important that we you know

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.149 
think it's important that we you know
respect<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.180> find<00:03:38.139> ways<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.919> we<00:03:38.979> will

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
respect it and find ways and we will

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.059 
respect it and find ways and we will
find<00:03:39.430> ways<00:03:39.579> innovative<00:03:40.510> ways<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:41.680> conserve

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
find ways innovative ways to to conserve

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.670 
find ways innovative ways to to conserve
the<00:03:42.310> amount<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.549> water<00:03:42.790> we<00:03:42.970> use<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:44.530> it's

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
the amount of water we use and that it's

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.960 
the amount of water we use and that it's
very<00:03:44.919> important<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.370> we<00:03:45.430> should<00:03:45.489> we<00:03:45.669> should

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
very important that we should we should

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.509 
very important that we should we should
respect<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.659> you<00:03:49.290> know<00:03:50.290> I'm<00:03:50.409> conscious<00:03:51.370> to

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
respect it you know I'm conscious to

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.210 
respect it you know I'm conscious to
wash<00:03:51.760> my<00:03:52.599> face<00:03:52.840> at<00:03:53.199> least<00:03:53.319> every<00:03:53.739> day<00:03:53.799> every

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
wash my face at least every day every

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.189 
wash my face at least every day every
day<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:55.030> moisturize<00:03:55.720> very<00:03:56.049> well

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
day and moisturize very well

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.830 
day and moisturize very well
moisturizing<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.159> I<00:03:57.400> think<00:03:57.659> the<00:03:58.659> most

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
moisturizing is I think the most

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.229 
moisturizing is I think the most
important<00:03:59.319> thing<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.650> guess<00:03:59.829> that<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.940> can<00:04:01.060> do

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
important thing I guess that you can do

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.129 
important thing I guess that you can do
and<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:03.220> I'm<00:04:03.310> always<00:04:03.579> I<00:04:04.000> do<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.750> every<00:04:04.989> day

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
and so I'm always I do that every day

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.770 
and so I'm always I do that every day
after<00:04:05.349> a<00:04:05.500> shower<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:05.919> always<00:04:06.340> moisturize<00:04:07.030> my

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
after a shower I always moisturize my

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.509 
after a shower I always moisturize my
body<00:04:08.319> and<00:04:11.699> from<00:04:12.699> time<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:13.060> time<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.959> know

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
body and from time to time you know

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.150 
body and from time to time you know
exfoliating<00:04:15.519> all<00:04:15.669> these<00:04:15.879> things
