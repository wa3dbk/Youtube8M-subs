Charmian

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.490

F money c-sharp back to the first chord

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.020 
F money c-sharp back to the first chord
and<00:02:23.769> then<00:02:24.390> we<00:02:25.390> basically<00:02:25.720> do<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.680> f-sharp

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and then we basically do the f-sharp

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.270 
and then we basically do the f-sharp
major<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.420> time<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:29.530> similar<00:02:29.920> where

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
major this time so it's similar where

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.009 
major this time so it's similar where
you<00:02:30.370> put<00:02:30.550> your<00:02:30.700> second<00:02:31.569> finger<00:02:31.599> all<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.959> way

you put your second finger all the way
down<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.500> then<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:32.980> do<00:02:33.129> 4th<00:02:33.550> fret<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
down and then we do 4th fret on the a

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.400 
down and then we do 4th fret on the a
string<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:35.050> 3rd<00:02:35.680> fret<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> g<00:02:36.849> string<00:02:37.410> so

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
string and 3rd fret on the g string so

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:47.760 
string and 3rd fret on the g string so
this<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.920> pre-course

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:57.780 

shot<00:02:48.770> seven<00:02:49.190> feet

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.520 

and<00:02:58.790> now<00:02:59.780> we're<00:03:00.020> going<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.340> this<00:03:01.340> corn<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:03.350> is

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
and now we're going to this corn this is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.030 
and now we're going to this corn this is
a<00:03:03.560> D<00:03:04.010> major<00:03:04.700> nine<00:03:05.240> so<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.230> fifth<00:03:06.500> fret<00:03:06.740> on

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
a D major nine so it is fifth fret on

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.170 
a D major nine so it is fifth fret on
the<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.700> string<00:03:07.760> fourth<00:03:08.480> fret<00:03:09.130> sixth<00:03:10.130> fret

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
the a string fourth fret sixth fret

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.710 
the a string fourth fret sixth fret
fifth<00:03:11.180> fret<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:12.730> then<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.940> brings<00:03:14.240> us<00:03:14.480> to

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
fifth fret and then this brings us to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.500 
fifth fret and then this brings us to
our<00:03:15.110> course<00:03:15.470> baby<00:03:16.160> be<00:03:16.430> my<00:03:16.960> pink

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.080 

and<00:03:21.959> that's<00:03:22.830> just<00:03:22.980> we're<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.400> riding<00:03:23.849> on

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.800 
is 2nd fret 4th fret 4th fret 4th fret
you<00:03:40.019> play<00:03:40.319> B<00:03:40.590> or<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:41.129> can<00:03:41.280> slide<00:03:41.580> up<00:03:41.819> to<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.629> G

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
you play B or you can slide up to the G

sharp<00:03:43.049> minor<00:03:43.349> 7<00:03:43.530> which<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.099> basically<00:03:44.549> just

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
sharp minor 7 which is basically just

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.300 
sharp minor 7 which is basically just
the<00:03:44.879> verse

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.930 

same<00:03:52.210> thing<00:03:52.390> we're<00:03:52.540> doing<00:03:52.720> for<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.960> worst

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.060 

and<00:03:56.120> then<00:03:56.510> all<00:03:56.630> we<00:03:56.660> have<00:03:56.780> left<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.860> bridge

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
and then all we have left is the bridge

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.630 
and then all we have left is the bridge
so<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.240> bridge<00:03:59.450> here<00:03:59.750> we<00:03:59.870> go

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
so for the bridge here we go

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.350 
so for the bridge here we go
f-sharp<00:04:01.640> minor<00:04:02.630> 9<00:04:02.990> for<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.500> first<00:04:03.740> measure

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
f-sharp minor 9 for the first measure

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.840 
f-sharp minor 9 for the first measure
then<00:04:05.360> we're<00:04:05.510> going<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:06.290> G<00:04:06.590> minor<00:04:07.010> 7<00:04:07.400> which

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
then we're going to to G minor 7 which

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.460 
then we're going to to G minor 7 which
is<00:04:08.030> basically<00:04:08.420> first<00:04:08.630> 2<00:04:08.810> chords<00:04:08.960> of<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.200> first

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
is basically first 2 chords of the first

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.770 
is basically first 2 chords of the first
in<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.740> course<00:04:09.980> like<00:04:10.190> what<00:04:10.370> we're<00:04:10.490> doing<00:04:10.780> then

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
in the course like what we're doing then

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
in the course like what we're doing then
we're<00:04:11.930> doing<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.460> major<00:04:13.460> 7<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.720> then<00:04:15.680> we're

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
we're doing a major 7 and then we're

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.690 
we're doing a major 7 and then we're
going<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:15.950> do<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.220> B<00:04:17.380> which<00:04:18.380> is<00:04:18.590> 2nd<00:04:19.070> fret<00:04:19.280> 4th

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
going to do a B which is 2nd fret 4th

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
back to the f-sharp

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.100 
back to the f-sharp
in<00:05:46.140> this<00:05:46.350> weird<00:05:46.680> chord

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110
