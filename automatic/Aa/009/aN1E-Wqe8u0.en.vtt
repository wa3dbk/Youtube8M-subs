00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.860
 to finish with paper with cardboard 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.050

 campaign level 1 way that goes like rumor 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.290
 and level 2 takes as prize and the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.280
 monsters letters the good I say the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.409
 where the crypt and dark priest 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.040
 and I work to treat this a bit 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.979
 we have the plastic and remove the cover 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.590
 here you have the trail approached a little 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.590
 so you can see the best here 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.800
 we have the four heroes ballet are worth 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.290
 wardrobe organza or house for that by 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.540
 true is not very well finished this 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.760
 miniature personally the sword is a 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.270
 little ugly did not expect a little better 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.940
 that comes out and silhouette and you have them 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.440
 all and on the other side what's left 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.590
 here in the bag 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.000
 we have the monsters 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.060
 the rest of the plastic 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.210
 with this a little 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.220
 so he taught you 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.620
 even if we have the first place and the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.870
 most striking those of labors of the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.870
 crypt and 21 in red 4 in bone 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.489

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.950
 we have three sold one in red 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.540
 and two in bone color 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.459
 quite prettier than those who 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.920
 we had in the first edition at least 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.840
 for my taste and finally we have 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.900
 four dark priests here are 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.150
 look at color bone we have three that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.920
 come with the plastic twisted and in 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.920
 red color leader we have one 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.140
 well indeed that new height some 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.590
 few letters and especially a lot of plastic 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.580
 a new expansion and I do not know how many to 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.580
 trip to the darkness
