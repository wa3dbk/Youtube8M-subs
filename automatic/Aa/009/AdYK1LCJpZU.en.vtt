00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.830
 and wants to transform his wavy hair 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.950
 in smooth and with volume and now we will see 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.620
 how to do it step by step there are two 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.360
 ways to get it one way is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.200
 use a round brush while you go 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.880
 drying the hair 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.310
 and another even better to use a brush 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.050
 flat this brush gives the hair a 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.090
 very nice shine 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.919
 We have previously washed the hair with 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.180
 the smooth silk range to bring your life and 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.460
 brightness 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.890
 very important not to divide the hair by 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.480
 parts during drying and working 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.470
 a lot with the hair we get that is 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.470
 looser and brighter 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.039
 If your curly hair you have to work on 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.039
 contrary to curls 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.470
 a trick is to keep the dryer stuck 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.570
 brush until you reach the tips if 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.590
 simply dry from above will cause 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.590
 that the hair curls 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.670
 Another important point is to continue combing 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.090
 the hair down to give it the form 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.090
 desired 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.050
 just before the hair dries 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.880
 all work the hair from left to 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.450
 right and so it will be brighter 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 i 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.640
 keep working from right to left 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.890
 great as you see is super easy to 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.890
 finish pass it again the brush 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.689
 another trick is to put the dryer to 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.400
 low hot intensity drying the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.729
 area of ​​the ray we control the hairs 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.729
 shorts 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.460
 at the end we will apply a treatment without 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.650
 Rinse is to prevent curling 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.340
 with a little on your palms and rub it with 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.120
 hands 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.390
 eye not too much 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.930
 some hairspray to hold and and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.250
 is a fantastic look smooth and with a lot 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.250
