00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
in this part of notability I'm going to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.550 
in this part of notability I'm going to
talk<00:00:04.230> about<00:00:04.470> how<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:04.920> annotate<00:00:05.700> files<00:00:06.560> so

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
talk about how to annotate files so

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.129 
talk about how to annotate files so
using<00:00:07.890> notability<00:00:08.490> what<00:00:09.389> we're<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.929> do

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
using notability what we're going to do

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.700 
using notability what we're going to do
is<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:11.219> actually<00:00:11.509> get<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.690> file<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.530> can

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
is to actually get a file that we can

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.210 
is to actually get a file that we can
annotate<00:00:14.040> which<00:00:15.030> are<00:00:15.269> currently<00:00:15.990> only<00:00:16.529> PDF

where you're studying something in

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
where you're studying something in
particular<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.170> students<00:01:16.560> might<00:01:16.740> want

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
particular and the students might want

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.530 
particular and the students might want
to<00:01:17.189> continue<00:01:17.700> adding<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.240> we're<00:01:18.390> going<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
to continue adding but we're going to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
to continue adding but we're going to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
create a new note there for starting at

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.960 
create a new note there for starting at
the<00:01:21.479> first<00:01:21.720> page<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> first<00:01:23.670> thing<00:01:23.759> I'm

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the first page so the first thing I'm

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.359 
the first page so the first thing I'm
going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> show<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.470> when<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.560> opens<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.100> are

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
going to show you when this opens up are

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.090 
going to show you when this opens up are
some<00:01:27.210> basic<00:01:27.600> features<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.770> look<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
some basic features if you look at the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
some basic features if you look at the
top<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:30.210> probably<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> most

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
top I think probably one of the most

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.730 
top I think probably one of the most
obvious<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:33.060> yellow<00:01:33.420> highlighter<00:01:34.170> now

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
obvious is this yellow highlighter now

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
obvious is this yellow highlighter now
if<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.070> click<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.759> hold<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.659> some<00:01:36.869> options

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
if I click and hold I have some options

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
if I click and hold I have some options
up<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.460> change<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> color<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
up here I can change the color of the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
up here I can change the color of the
highlighter<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.829> obviously<00:01:41.100> change

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
highlighter and I can obviously change

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.880 
highlighter and I can obviously change
the<00:01:41.729> thickness<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.930> i<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.500> scroll<00:01:43.829> through

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the thickness so i can scroll through

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.639 
the thickness so i can scroll through
and<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.820> notability<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.720> scroll<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.110> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and in notability to scroll down you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.130 
and in notability to scroll down you
always<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> use<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.640> fingers<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
always want to use two fingers if I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.730 
always want to use two fingers if I
would<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.829> finger<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.790> my<00:01:51.000> highlighter

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
would use one finger with my highlighter

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.260 
would use one finger with my highlighter
selected<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.220> highlighting<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.030> if

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
selected I would be highlighting or if

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
selected I would be highlighting or if
my<00:01:54.450> pen<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:54.990> selected<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.649> would<00:01:55.799> obviously<00:01:56.100> be

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
my pen was selected I would obviously be

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.389 
my pen was selected I would obviously be
drawing<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> probably<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
drawing so this is probably one of the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.130 
drawing so this is probably one of the
simplest<00:01:59.820> things<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.540> highlighter<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
simplest things is the highlighter and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.310 
simplest things is the highlighter and
then<00:02:01.469> also<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.130> pen<00:02:02.430> again<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.869> click<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
then also the pen again if I click and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
then also the pen again if I click and
hold<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.369> change<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.880> thickness<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
hold I can change the thickness of the

great<00:03:10.409> so<00:03:11.099> what<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.519> can<00:03:11.819> do<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.599> navigate<00:03:12.959> my

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
great so what I can do is to navigate my

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.229 
great so what I can do is to navigate my
pages<00:03:14.159> by<00:03:14.639> going<00:03:15.060> through<00:03:15.389> and<00:03:15.629> actually<00:03:16.099> I

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
pages by going through and actually I

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.909 
pages by going through and actually I
think<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.959> newer<00:03:19.139> features<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.889> that

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
think one of the newer features is that

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.759 
think one of the newer features is that
I<00:03:20.220> can<00:03:20.549> i<00:03:20.729> can<00:03:21.090> delete<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.449> page<00:03:21.780> i<00:03:22.109> can<00:03:22.590> also

I can i can delete a page i can also

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.610 
I can i can delete a page i can also
change<00:03:23.159> the<00:03:23.310> order<00:03:23.639> of<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:24.060> pages<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:25.229> i<00:03:25.259> have
