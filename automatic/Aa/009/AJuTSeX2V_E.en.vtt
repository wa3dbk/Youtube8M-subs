 was reached since 2007 so it has 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.840
 been an arduous joint effort but 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.100
 full of much satisfaction and much 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.100

 tools to be able to 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.860
 forward the country and to mark that new 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.890
 I start science students 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.570
 farmers planted a symbolic tree 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.070
 of growth in the trajectory 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.780
 academic and environmental importance 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.240
 We carry as tradition year after year 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.150
 this planting trees the week 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.710
 orientation this is to create truth 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.960
 make students aware of having 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.340
 Reforestation income this year 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.450
 we chose a canepa tree 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.620
 because we realized that the only 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.690
 place in the enclosure where there are trees 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.120
 little ones make the zamora then 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.610
 we try to plant it in this area 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.690
 where the area of ​​fruit trees as indicated by 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.520
 road field director 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.500
 nothing basically is already like a 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.600
 tradition is something that is part of 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.940
 us and we try to do it every year 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.680
 that a bit of today you were part of the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.300
 group of volunteers who were encouraged to 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.360
 participate in tree planting 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.120
 because you're encouraged to say here I'm 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.490
 I available because I think that port 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.800
 rich as such he needs more 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.690

 the trees are the answers and it is 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.620

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.440
 that at the end where you decide too 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.229
