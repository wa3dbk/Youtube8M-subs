00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hi, I'm a seventh grade student and in this video I'm going to present the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.899
 analysis of an object in this case a pencil or color 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.530
 the pencil or color has a cylindrical shape 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.759
 its function is to write or draw 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.390
 It is made of wood, a graphite mine, an eraser and aluminum 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.170
 its parts are the body the mine the tail that sometimes has a draft and 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.380
 an aluminum foil that holds the eraser to the pencil body 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.360
 the manufacturing process begins with the extraction of the graphite from the mines 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.170
 graphite is a mineral coal composed of algae deposits 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.770
 prehistoric 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.940
 the graphite is crushed and passed to a flotation chamber where a powerful 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.830
 soapy solution removes impurities subsequently stored and left 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.700
 dry after it is added Chinese clay water is mixed and subjected to heat 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.130
 to later pass it through a funnel and get its shape 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.060
 characteristic then it is baked and hardened and the mines are passed to a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.580
 fryer where they are submerged in a bath of melted wax and oil how much more 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.320
 wax will have the hardest mine 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.280
 The body of the rock is made with wooden boards of 18 centimeters 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.689
 long by 7 centimeters wide to which furrows are worked 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.560
 later they are added glue the tables are divided into two groups 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.080
 that go down to which the mines are placed and others that go 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.460
 up to forming a sandwich 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.729
 from each wooden board you can draw ten pencils then cover them with a 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.219
 non-toxic aqueous varnish of up to five tents to give it its final finish 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.320
 Pencil or color costs between 400 and 1,800 Colombian pesos 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.060
 The social impact of the pencil has been to facilitate the copying of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.170
 documents easily and quickly 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.580
 culturally the use of writing could be massified and can be used in 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.240
 different areas such as over offices colleges the industries
