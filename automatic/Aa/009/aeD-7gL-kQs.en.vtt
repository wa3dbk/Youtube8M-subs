this wire goes clear up to here up to
here<00:05:42.860> all<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:44.610> way<00:05:44.640> up<00:05:44.970> here<00:05:46.610> that's<00:05:47.610> where

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
here all the way up here that's where

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.340 
here all the way up here that's where
the<00:05:48.060> yellow<00:05:48.690> lights<00:05:48.930> come<00:05:49.230> on<00:05:50.750> anyway<00:05:51.750> wire

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
the yellow lights come on anyway wire

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.710 
the yellow lights come on anyway wire
goes<00:05:52.560> up<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.950> their<00:05:53.160> dog<00:05:54.620> around<00:05:55.620> oops<00:05:56.720> down

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
goes up to their dog around oops down

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.520 
goes up to their dog around oops down
here<00:05:58.380> yeah<00:05:59.220> it's<00:06:00.060> a<00:06:00.240> pretty<00:06:00.390> long<00:06:00.690> run<00:06:01.170> for

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
here yeah it's a pretty long run for

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.390 
here yeah it's a pretty long run for
that<00:06:01.620> wire<00:06:01.890> so<00:06:02.600> using<00:06:03.600> a<00:06:03.660> lot<00:06:03.840> of<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.400> voltage

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
that wire so using a lot of the voltage

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.040 
that wire so using a lot of the voltage
because<00:06:05.790> of<00:06:05.910> that<00:06:06.090> so<00:06:06.780> that's<00:06:06.900> why<00:06:07.020> it's

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
because of that so that's why it's

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.620 
because of that so that's why it's
little<00:06:07.320> bit<00:06:07.380> more<00:06:07.560> trickier<00:06:08.270> about<00:06:09.270> anyway

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
little bit more trickier about anyway

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.790 
little bit more trickier about anyway
