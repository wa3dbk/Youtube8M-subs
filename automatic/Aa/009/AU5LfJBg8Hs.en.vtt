so it's gonna be a fun race issue make a

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.800 
so it's gonna be a fun race issue make a
start<00:00:36.039> at<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.250> front<00:00:36.399> as<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:37.270> always<00:00:37.450> does

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
start at the front as you always does

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.740 
start at the front as you always does
because<00:00:38.110> he's<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.460> master<00:00:39.460> qualifier<00:00:40.060> and<00:00:40.300> are

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
because he's a master qualifier and are

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.590 
because he's a master qualifier and are
randomly<00:00:41.739> generated<00:00:42.040> crude<00:00:42.970> always<00:00:43.300> puts<00:00:43.510> me

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
randomly generated crude always puts me

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.360 
randomly generated crude always puts me
at<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.840> back<00:00:44.020> but<00:00:44.590> I<00:00:44.620> suppose<00:00:44.829> we<00:00:45.010> are<00:00:45.160> in<00:00:45.280> a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
at the back but I suppose we are in a

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.370 
at the back but I suppose we are in a
slowest<00:00:45.670> car<00:00:45.820> me<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.149> Prost<00:00:46.390> so<00:00:46.810> you<00:00:47.260> know

it's<00:00:47.500> very<00:00:47.560> fair<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.310> be<00:00:48.370> perfectly<00:00:48.520> honest

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
it's very fair to be perfectly honest

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.380 
it's very fair to be perfectly honest
and<00:00:49.680> away<00:00:50.680> we<00:00:50.710> go<00:00:50.920> let's<00:00:51.130> you<00:00:51.790> know<00:00:51.820> push

he's<00:01:55.079> right<00:01:55.350> behind<00:01:55.530> me<00:01:55.770> mental<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.430> front<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
he's right behind me mental in front and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.620 
he's right behind me mental in front and
I<00:01:58.189> don't<00:01:59.189> think<00:01:59.340> I've<00:01:59.399> started<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.880> above<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
I don't think I've started up above the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.480 
I don't think I've started up above the
back<00:02:00.780> row<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> grid<00:02:01.350> every<00:02:01.979> single<00:02:02.280> time

back row of the grid every single time

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.899 
back row of the grid every single time
so<00:02:02.759> far<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.990> pretty<00:02:04.170> annoying<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:04.950> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
so far so that's pretty annoying but you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.279 
so far so that's pretty annoying but you
know<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> suppose<00:02:06.360> I'm<00:02:06.600> having<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> slowest

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
know I suppose I'm having the slowest

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.889 
know I suppose I'm having the slowest
culazo<00:02:07.759> but<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.879> would<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.209> nice<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.629> sort

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
culazo but it would be nice to have sort

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.690 
culazo but it would be nice to have sort
of<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.050> random<00:02:10.229> grid<00:02:10.769> just<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.130> totally

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
of a random grid just like a totally

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.900 
of a random grid just like a totally
random<00:02:11.880> grid<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.510> classic<00:02:12.930> cars<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.910> mean

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
random grid in the classic cars I mean

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.220 
random grid in the classic cars I mean
like<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.150> think<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.510> are<00:02:15.660> supposed<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.050> be

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
like I think they are supposed to be

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.290 
like I think they are supposed to be
equal<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.400> don't<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.940> really<00:02:18.090> work

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
equal but I don't think that really work

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.860 
equal but I don't think that really work
out<00:02:18.510> without<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:19.500> they<00:02:19.620> were<00:02:19.709> trying<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.040> do

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
out without what they were trying to do

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.150 
out without what they were trying to do
I'll<00:02:21.870> tell<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.200> Matt<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.560> these<00:02:22.709> closing

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
I'll tell you what Matt to these closing

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.990 
I'll tell you what Matt to these closing
in<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.310> shoe<00:02:23.549> back<00:02:23.730> here<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.930> could<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.709> a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
in on shoe back here it could be a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.280 
in on shoe back here it could be a
last-ditch<00:02:27.000> attempt<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> championship

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
last-ditch attempt to the championship

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.920 
last-ditch attempt to the championship
by<00:02:28.440> men<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:31.940> see<00:02:32.940> what<00:02:33.060> plus<00:02:33.269> one<00:02:33.480> lap<00:02:33.690> there

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
by men to see what plus one lap there

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.180 
by men to see what plus one lap there
we'll<00:02:34.079> just<00:02:34.230> keep<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:34.500> up<00:02:34.650> for<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:34.860> meantime

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
we'll just keep that up for the meantime

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.789 
we'll just keep that up for the meantime
till<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.239> plus<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:36.720> goes<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.049> optimal<00:02:37.620> then

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
till that plus one goes to optimal then

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.400 
till that plus one goes to optimal then
we'll<00:02:37.920> switch<00:02:38.069> down<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.959> standard<00:02:39.959> fuel<00:02:40.200> mix

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
we'll switch down to standard fuel mix

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.589 
we'll switch down to standard fuel mix
but<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:41.190> last<00:02:41.430> sector<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.030> lab<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.390> tell

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
but this last sector of the lab I tell

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.930 
but this last sector of the lab I tell
you<00:02:42.660> what<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:43.019> will<00:02:43.709> with<00:02:43.950> them<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.459> not<00:02:44.640> faster

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
you what we will with them if not faster

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210 
you what we will with them if not faster
than<00:02:45.239> them<00:02:45.569> think<00:02:46.290> actually<00:02:46.410> faster<00:02:46.950> than

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
than them think actually faster than

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.479 
than them think actually faster than
through<00:02:47.549> that<00:02:47.640> last<00:02:47.849> sector<00:02:49.280> that's<00:02:50.280> pretty

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
through that last sector that's pretty

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.390 
through that last sector that's pretty
good<00:02:51.140> I'd<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.470> take<00:02:52.650> out<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.010> bowl<00:02:53.220> odds

a bit of a pain watching me drive slow
much<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.440> much<00:03:37.590> lower<00:03:37.829> down<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.099> street

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370

much so so much lower down the street
you<00:03:38.970> know<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.269> might<00:03:39.389> be<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.630> about<00:03:39.930> 20<00:03:40.380> miles

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
obviously then I would I don't think

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.490 
obviously then I would I don't think
I've<00:04:03.370> said<00:04:03.579> it<00:04:03.670> at<00:04:03.760> all<00:04:03.939> this<00:04:04.180> series<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:05.170> this

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
I've said it at all this series but this

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.849 
I've said it at all this series but this
is<00:04:05.680> all<00:04:05.829> done<00:04:06.340> with<00:04:06.519> live<00:04:06.730> commentary<00:04:07.000> and

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
is all done with live commentary and

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.959 
is all done with live commentary and
that's<00:04:08.859> where<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.189> live<00:04:09.340> reactions<00:04:09.849> and

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:09.969 
that's where you the live reactions and

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.699 
that's where you the live reactions and
everything<00:04:12.840> from<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:13.989> much<00:04:14.079> faster<00:04:14.530> through

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
everything from so much faster through

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.710 
everything from so much faster through
this<00:04:14.799> last<00:04:15.040> sector<00:04:15.370> but<00:04:15.670> I'm<00:04:15.790> just<00:04:15.879> not<00:04:16.449> fast

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
this last sector but I'm just not fast

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.210 
this last sector but I'm just not fast
enough<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.199> keep<00:04:17.350> on<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.680> record<00:04:17.949> them<00:04:18.070> but

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
enough to keep on the record them but

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.719 
enough to keep on the record them but
you<00:04:18.699> see<00:04:18.880> how<00:04:18.940> far<00:04:19.120> behind<00:04:19.329> prosti<00:04:20.199> s<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:21.639> know

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
you see how far behind prosti s you know

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.520 
you see how far behind prosti s you know
I<00:04:21.789> think<00:04:22.060> were<00:04:22.270> doing<00:04:22.600> quite<00:04:22.780> good<00:04:23.110> job<00:04:23.380> in

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
I think were doing quite good job in

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.469 
I think were doing quite good job in
this<00:04:23.650> car<00:04:23.949> if<00:04:24.460> we're<00:04:24.699> in<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.850> faster<00:04:25.240> car<00:04:25.419> I

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
this car if we're in the faster car I

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.700 
this car if we're in the faster car I
think<00:04:25.690> we're<00:04:25.810> definitely<00:04:26.050> we<00:04:26.320> had<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.500> fight

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
think we're definitely we had to fight

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.260 
think we're definitely we had to fight
for<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.949> championship<00:04:26.979> with<00:04:27.550> Schumaker<00:04:27.880> I

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
for the championship with Schumaker I

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.300 
for the championship with Schumaker I
think<00:04:28.840> any<00:04:28.990> car<00:04:29.259> but<00:04:29.289> this<00:04:29.770> one<00:04:29.979> we'd<00:04:30.190> have

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
think any car but this one we'd have

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.279 
think any car but this one we'd have
been<00:04:30.400> able<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.820> go<00:04:31.210> for<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.449> championship<00:04:31.900> but

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
been able to go for the championship but

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.839 
been able to go for the championship but
it<00:04:32.680> doesn't<00:04:33.009> matter<00:04:33.130> too<00:04:33.280> much<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.610> can't

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
it doesn't matter too much I can't

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.390 
it doesn't matter too much I can't
complain<00:04:34.030> it's<00:04:34.810> been<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> very<00:04:35.229> very<00:04:35.770> fun

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400

I<00:05:08.580> didn't<00:05:09.580> know<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:09.849> is<00:05:09.940> going<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.150> be<00:05:10.210> a

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
I didn't know this is going to be a

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.760 
I didn't know this is going to be a
night<00:05:10.479> race<00:05:10.720> actually<00:05:11.139> I<00:05:11.169> was<00:05:11.410> thinking<00:05:11.440> about

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
night race actually I was thinking about

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.580 
night race actually I was thinking about
this<00:05:12.099> when<00:05:12.280> I<00:05:12.310> was<00:05:12.840> setting<00:05:13.840> up<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.080> record<00:05:14.440> and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
this when I was setting up to record and

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.809 
this when I was setting up to record and
choosing<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.889> tractors<00:05:15.370> wondering<00:05:15.699> whether

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
choosing the tractors wondering whether

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.100 
choosing the tractors wondering whether
this<00:05:15.879> would<00:05:15.970> be<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.120> night<00:05:16.330> race<00:05:16.569> was<00:05:16.810> obviously

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
this would be a night race was obviously

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.080 
this would be a night race was obviously
just<00:05:17.259> to<00:05:17.409> dry<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:18.159> tires<00:05:18.430> actually<00:05:18.970> are

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
just to dry the tires actually are

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.430 
just to dry the tires actually are
getting<00:05:19.300> quite<00:05:19.449> a<00:05:19.479> wall<00:05:19.750> it's<00:05:19.990> hard<00:05:20.139> to<00:05:20.229> tell

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
getting quite a wall it's hard to tell

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.839 
getting quite a wall it's hard to tell
with<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.710> filter<00:05:21.159> because<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.520> was<00:05:21.610> limbs

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
with the filter because it was limbs

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.300 
with the filter because it was limbs
what<00:05:22.090> messes<00:05:22.479> up<00:05:22.599> the<00:05:22.690> whole<00:05:22.810> screen<00:05:23.129> but<00:05:24.129> i

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
what messes up the whole screen but i

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.149 
what messes up the whole screen but i
think<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.759> tires<00:05:25.060> are<00:05:25.330> getting<00:05:25.449> quite<00:05:25.750> worn

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
think the tires are getting quite worn

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.200 
think the tires are getting quite worn
then<00:05:27.159> we<00:05:27.250> have<00:05:27.370> been<00:05:27.490> sliding<00:05:27.789> out<00:05:27.940> all<00:05:28.180> over

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
then we have been sliding out all over

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.140 
then we have been sliding out all over
the<00:05:28.569> place<00:05:29.129> it's<00:05:30.129> such<00:05:30.280> power<00:05:30.669> going<00:05:30.970> through

of<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.430> mistake<00:06:06.729> either<00:06:06.940> so<00:06:07.270> I<00:06:07.509> don't<00:06:08.050> know

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
of the mistake either so I don't know

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.860 
of the mistake either so I don't know
what<00:06:08.530> I'll<00:06:08.830> keep<00:06:09.099> it<00:06:09.370> even<00:06:10.300> though<00:06:10.539> it<00:06:10.690> was<00:06:10.840> a

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
what I'll keep it even though it was a

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.080 
what I'll keep it even though it was a
bit<00:06:11.080> of<00:06:11.110> an<00:06:11.289> illegitimate<00:06:11.620> move<00:06:12.159> just<00:06:12.699> driving

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
bit of an illegitimate move just driving

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.040 
bit of an illegitimate move just driving
across<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.389> grass<00:06:13.750> after<00:06:13.990> it<00:06:14.259> spun<00:06:14.530> it<00:06:14.710> but<00:06:14.949> I

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
across the grass after it spun it but I

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.629 
across the grass after it spun it but I
think<00:06:17.050> I<00:06:17.229> rule<00:06:17.469> that<00:06:17.740> my<00:06:18.009> driving<00:06:18.310> has<00:06:18.520> not

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
think I rule that my driving has not

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.640 
think I rule that my driving has not
been<00:06:18.789> amazing<00:06:19.240> doing<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:19.990> series<00:06:20.289> but<00:06:20.409> I<00:06:20.469> just

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
been amazing doing the series but I just

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.080 
been amazing doing the series but I just
I<00:06:20.740> think<00:06:20.800> I'm<00:06:21.009> not<00:06:21.130> very<00:06:21.280> good<00:06:21.400> at<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:21.729> classic

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
I think I'm not very good at the classic

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.330 
I think I'm not very good at the classic
cars<00:06:22.300> so<00:06:22.810> it<00:06:23.529> has<00:06:23.590> pretty<00:06:23.919> much<00:06:24.069> it<00:06:24.190> for<00:06:24.250> this

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
cars so it has pretty much it for this

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.249
