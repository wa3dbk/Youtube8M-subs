00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.450
 well first of all 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.420
 by one 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.420
 and what is a 2 that is full 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.150
 otherwise we will connect what they are 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.480
 the coils in this case over here goes the 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.790
 neutral that we are going to connect it both in 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 one coil as in the other and we're going to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.870
 put directly into the thermal 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.870
 feeding the maneuver 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:04.330
 the coils can go to 220 to 24 volts 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:07.620
 to 48 to 380 depends on how we want 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.620
 make us the maneuver 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.789
 contactors are bought with 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.939
 relationship to what we have what is the 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.939
 feeding 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.040
 of neutral 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.820
 already connected that is invariable and always 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.820
 we are going to connect 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.070
 by the top that is for example 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.700
 where we will best match what 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 are the posters 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.740
 well now we have to get that 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.330
 continue with what is the maneuver in 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.380
 this case we are doing the maneuver 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:54.750
 simpler than it is with a switch 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.270
 where he has three positions 10 position 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.740
 and 2 or left to right 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.720
 and the center disconnected but I'm 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.690
 using a box 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.000
 previous I had to make a 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.430
 experiment and I'll just use what 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.420
 is 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.079
 the maneuver by the switch this 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.200
 we have here to feed what we have 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.200
 what to bring 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.280
 the wire 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.500
 to what is the common point of the two 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.120
 switches with this we have got 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.900
 that these two outputs are one or the other 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.109
 we have managed to get two 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.019
 switches we have built a 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:49.920
 switch this feed well 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.569
 we have to make the bridge as I have 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.450
 said and we have to take it 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.560
 to the part where he is with him where 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.560
 we have the food 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.480
 of what is the thermal maneuver by 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.470
 course as we are always working 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.720
 without current then these thermal 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.400
 apply that is up but now 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.880
 same I have it connected offline 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.380
 of food but thermal 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.160
 and the power always disconnected 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.670
 well we already have what is the two 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.510
 outputs that we can put another cable 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.510
 a little bit longer 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.640
 and differentiate them with colors so that they 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.640
 see 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.790
 one and another for example in this one 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.790
 we can put the color black 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.770
 and in that we are going to put the color 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.770
 Brown 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.970
 This we will do now the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.860
 try what is live 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.560
 the maneuver then a brown for 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.930
 example we can put it in this 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.930
 contact and we connect 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:28.310
 in two if this one is one this is here 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.310
 is two and in this other one here 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.800
 as the cables sometimes get in the way 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.100
 so we unplug it and put the cable 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.100
 black 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.430
 and now we put back what is the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.430
 feeding 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.520
 we have the maneuver right now what 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.889
 that is direct then it ended up plugging 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.560
 what is food 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.389
 thermal maneuver 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.680
 maneuver from left to right and stop 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.810
 and the contactors 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.230
 to work 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:26.720
 current method 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:29.020
 enter a contact I stop it and enter the 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.020
 other 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.730
 but 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:41.580
 and that's how the change of 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.300
 motor turn direction change 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.569
 well let's see the operation with the 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.840
 engine with what is the system 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:54.919
 switched 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:59.330
 we have what is the turn selector 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:02.110
 left to right and stopped at zero 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.110
 while the driver 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.650
 and the engine works to the left 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.830
 if we give it 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.790
 so that it works to the right 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.479
 we see that the engine 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.970
 works 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.970
 to the right 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:37.740
 and we can make the turn change so many 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.960
 times as we always want to go through 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:44.340
 the zero and waiting a little bit 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.340
 the engine stops 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.120
 do not 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.860
 we have your motor guard regulated in 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.940
 amperage and when there is any 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.940
 problem would jump 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.140
 and the switch prevents the 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.340
 two with tractors at the same time or that 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.760
 work 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:11.170
 one contrary to the other because each 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.330
 one selects one of those from the coil and 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.820
 very important that we have to pass 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.260
 always by zero very well then this is 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.810
 the simplest system 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.080
 thank you very much I hope you serve them and until 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.080
 the next
