00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.280
 I'm here with my friend Camilo Alfaro 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.470
 how is javier the editor and star 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.720
 main auto project dotcom no 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.279
 stop visiting him and especially with 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.080
 this driving test that we come to 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.869
 do here to san tropez a in france 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.269
 we are in the mercedes benz is the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.769
 sixties trenti of 2013 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.359
 what do you think that does not seem very 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.460
 good project is the first thing we have 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.930
 what to do is remove this hood but 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.480
 before removing the hood see this 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.890
 wonder this is called the magic sky of 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.900
 mercedes version as you figure the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.449
 impressive technology that has a 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.760
 filament between two plants of plates of 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.070
 crystal and then just touch the button and 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.170
 it is made from translucent to dark 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.760
 completely but obviously like this 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.970
 way the best is here in this 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.110
 little button 15 seconds we are going to 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.629
 topless 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.790
 well I like topless the sandro fish like 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.790
 people are the perfect combination 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 ah 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.610
 do not 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.340
 good javi we are driving it now yes 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.590
 pretty much here in this mercedes benz 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.479
 is the safety troy is here in the south 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.189
 of france in san tropez between san 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.090
 tropez and cÃ¡diz the truth that is a place 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.630
 nothing bad to get lost I'm not 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.759
 fascinated enough other clubs and if of 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.159
 You really want to lose yourself like aniseed 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.229
 and they are not excesses to finish everything 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.209
 cute as a lake that is a little bit more 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.930
 for there to the east here of san 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.120
 tropez 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.489
 well yes we had handled and he is the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.380
 fifty five ryan california makes some 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.500
 weeks and now we come until 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.390
 approve the new generation of s 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.060
 and that really surprised us 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.090
 because the difference of a lot of power 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.830
 The new engine suspension 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.380
 automatic transmission of seven changes 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.209
 with the pedals here on the steering wheel for 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.040
 to be able to do it and the sound is 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.810
 spectacular now we are with the hood 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.280
 closed and the experience is 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.340
 completely different because it 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.030
 it turns into a pretty nice coupe 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.470
 to drive to go at high speed 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.390
 talking about the high speed 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.810
 sl 63 have a 5.5-liter v8 engine 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.720
 biturbo that produces 530 horses 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.940
 force that if you do not put the performance 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.870
 backstage and with which the power 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.440
 it increases 557 horsepower and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.130
 It really is fabulous to handle it 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.470
 unfortunately, it's going to have a bit of 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.810
 traffic on the streets of france but the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.940
 experience no doubt still a few 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.900
 seconds how to accelerate that saying 0 to 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.910
 60 in 4.2 seconds really that sound 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.140
 it's really spectacular and a 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.080
 maximum speed of 186 miles per hour 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.400
 that is quite now this must be taken 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.709
 note that that's when it 's 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.840
 electronically controlled because the 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.940
 laws of security issues do not 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.220
 allow it to be more but here in the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.020
 board if you see the board we 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.590
 indicates that this car has capacity 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.750
 up to reach 320 kilometers by 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.060
 hour that equals almost 200 miles per 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.830
 hour so there we see reality for in 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.690
 the true power of this car 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.090
 so what did you think about so much water 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.870
 is the system address is everything 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.390
 well this car follows the tradition of 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.300
 the whole history of the sl class that 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.820
 originated in the year 1954 with the eccentric 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.710
 android that was manufactured to run the 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.460
 Pan-American career and it was something wind the 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.040
 of the seagull wings and then in 1957 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.680
 came out this the convertible and from 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.830
 then the philosophy of this division 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.290
 it's been super light that that's what 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.650
 mean the letters s the language of 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.600
 the generation with the architecture of 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.790
 aluminum and all the innovations that 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.800
 they have done is exactly what they have 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.080
 achieved the engineers and designers of 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.850
 the mercedes benz this car has many 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.440
 carbon fiber panels on the hood 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.840
 in the trunk in the boot lid 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.510
 the door panels with which 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.510
 between aluminum and carbon fiber 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.620
 a quantity of weight has been lost 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.340
 considerable compared to the model 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.980
 previous 275 books 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.260
 so a fabulous and good car 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.470
 soon Mercedes will take you one 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.500
 more than is the s 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.020
 which has more than 600 horsepower 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.580
 so hopefully we can come here or some 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.699
 another place to try that model way 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.830
 I hope so and I think they are 600 27 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:17.900
 horsepower that still continues with 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.580
 the v12 twin turbo engine I do not like myself 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.110
 I think I want us to come and what 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.110
 let's check well
