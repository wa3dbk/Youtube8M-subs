I do the same thing on the top and where

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.170 
I do the same thing on the top and where
your<00:01:36.590> front<00:01:36.830> would<00:01:36.980> be<00:01:37.130> again<00:01:37.730> this<00:01:37.940> knife

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
your front would be again this knife

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.690 
your front would be again this knife
would<00:01:38.360> be<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.630> front<00:01:39.340> some<00:01:40.340> would<00:01:40.490> call<00:01:40.640> it

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
would be the front some would call it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:55.560 
would be the front some would call it
actual<00:01:41.140> guard<00:01:45.970> start<00:01:46.970> up<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.210> here<00:01:48.880> okay<00:01:51.940> now

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.570 

we<00:01:56.950> can<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.130> grind<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:59.080> ourselves<00:02:00.130> if<00:02:01.130> we

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
we can just grind it ourselves if we

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.580 
we can just grind it ourselves if we
want<00:02:03.250> free<00:02:04.250> hand<00:02:04.720> but<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.960> made<00:02:06.260> this<00:02:06.410> little

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
want free hand but I made this little

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.180 
want free hand but I made this little
jig<00:02:06.890> just<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:07.850> some<00:02:08.060> people<00:02:08.360> can<00:02:08.479> see<00:02:09.160> it's<00:02:10.160> a

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
jig just so some people can see it's a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.820 
jig just so some people can see it's a
piece<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.399> angle<00:02:11.380> drilled<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.500> tapped<00:02:12.530> three

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
piece of angle drilled and tapped three

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:21.190 
piece of angle drilled and tapped three
screws<00:02:13.160> into<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.990> these<00:02:15.400> will<00:02:17.830> adjust<00:02:20.200> with

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
screws into it these will adjust with

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.870 
screws into it these will adjust with
the<00:02:21.350> wrench<00:02:22.120> they'll<00:02:23.120> adjust<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.570> angle

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
the wrench they'll adjust the angle

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.170 
the wrench they'll adjust the angle
relative<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.680> grinding<00:02:28.070> surface<00:02:31.180> put

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
relative to the grinding surface put

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.890 
relative to the grinding surface put
this<00:02:32.300> together<00:02:36.100> I'll<00:02:37.100> put<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> spine<00:02:37.900> flat

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
this together I'll put the spine flat

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.970 
this together I'll put the spine flat
because<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.410> going<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.590> be<00:02:39.680> riding

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
because this is going to be riding

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.560 
because this is going to be riding
against<00:02:40.250> my<00:02:40.370> table<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:43.330> I'll<00:02:44.330> lock<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
against my table and I'll lock the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.479 
against my table and I'll lock the
pliers<00:02:44.959> down<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:48.160> probably<00:02:49.160> go<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> little

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
pliers down on it probably go a little

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.660 
pliers down on it probably go a little
bit<00:02:49.700> tighter<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.180> that

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670

should work we might have to mess with a
little<00:05:25.900> bit<00:05:26.080> maybe<00:05:26.260> I'll<00:05:27.450> in<00:05:28.450> fact

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
little bit maybe I'll in fact

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.650 
little bit maybe I'll in fact
opportunity<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.860> see<00:05:30.330> let's<00:05:31.330> give<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:31.540> a

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
opportunity to see let's give it a

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:39.879 
opportunity to see let's give it a
little<00:05:31.810> bit<00:05:32.020> more<00:05:32.230> of<00:05:32.320> an<00:05:32.380> angle<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.740> it

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.969 

there's<00:05:40.490> that<00:05:41.499> and<00:05:42.499> then<00:05:42.710> we<00:05:42.979> just<00:05:43.009> kind<00:05:43.490> of

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
there's that and then we just kind of

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:53.559 
there's that and then we just kind of
put<00:05:45.979> the<00:05:46.129> second<00:05:46.610> leg<00:05:46.759> down

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.439 

let<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.289> third<00:05:54.499> leg<00:05:54.740> down<00:05:55.089> just<00:05:56.089> take<00:05:56.270> any

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
let the third leg down just take any

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:02.259 
let the third leg down just take any
logo<00:05:56.779> out<00:05:56.809> of<00:05:57.050> it<00:05:58.389> and<00:05:59.389> we'll<00:05:59.809> try<00:06:00.050> it<00:06:00.080> out
