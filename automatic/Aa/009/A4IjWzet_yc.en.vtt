00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:20.300
 fiat doblo fiat doblo 19 simple diesel 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:25.560
 so here we have windows 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.199
 rear fog light additional 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 lamp 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:40.739
 so abduka oven cabin 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:47.930
 from the streets and so airbag pillow 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:51.720
 security is different so glass is whole 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:57.500
 glass so 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:02.210
 Salon plastered recently 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:11.520
 recently pasted salonch clean not 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:16.110
 shabby so africa then so machine itself 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:21.410
 the plant is fine though my 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:26.540
 in the summer without problems I already got them 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:29.540
 start up like injector problems 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 works 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.649
 airports 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.649
 see so far 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.649
 turn signals 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.140
 so go outside listen motor 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:52.610
 the door closes by the way 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:57.620
 fine not a bit not alert 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.700
 so it is worth casting at 15 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.690
 no difficulties move anywhere all 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.210
 neat 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:13.510
 neatly because the earlier the back 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.510
 let's see the windows are all worth it 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.530
 so we have glass heating here 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.790
 have it turn on 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:28.480
 why, and rear rear view 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:34.060
 doors are also glued 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.910
 as you can see interior good condition so 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.130
 the light turns on 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.130
 do not answer need to turn on and off 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.240
 so this is so back door to 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:55.230
 great just great closed one 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:58.870
 hand movement do not clap not ryuko so 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.410
 the side door also closes perfectly 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.100
 generally doblo machines are good 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.250
 envisaged wide open 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.700
 beautiful 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.650
 entry exit buns 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:18.430
 what kind of plan is the head restraint he's not 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.830
 fell about a certain one under the elbow armrest 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.340
 not this way 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.340
 So there is one color potolochek 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.200
 good shelves 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.319
 everything fits our car showed 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:40.530
 yourself in operation in good quality 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:43.690
 the word chassis for Ukrainian roads 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.180
 well nursed and the door to 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.000
 lateral fine with one hand movement 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.510
 class and it is already closed not troublesome 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.120
 hatch 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:58.890
 routes a and side passenger right 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.040
 everything is fine everything works so show 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.230
 power windows everything works 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.440
 window raisers 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.350
 everything is so 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:16.180
 what we went to the motor 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.020
 so here, too, there is no roundness no problems 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.459
 no 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.729
 on the body at all 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.190
 so come to the motor motor 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.190
 running and panic then bingo 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.699
 This is how a new battery looks 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:42.460
 you change the fuel filter 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:47.110
 oil as far as timing belts and rollers 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.370
 as the wind belt amplifier zade residents 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.370
 so open 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.510
 valve cover for topping up oil and 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.510
 Look, get out, look 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.379
 works beautifully 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.760
 fencing 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.320
 right 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.139
 manifestations 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.440
 it's time to nothing 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.179
 works fine like that 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.529
 world and 5 

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:28.460
 numbers 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.800
 so that we 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:36.900
 only difficulties are no okroshka 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.240
 it is clear that they did not touch and the bolts did not 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:44.860
 unscrewed all worth native painting 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.830
 everything is beautiful work and excellent 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.430
 so here so here is a car fiat 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.580
 doblo 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.580
 and 2004 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.960
 so now close the 2004 state 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:07.020
 beautiful tact of sight 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.020
 look no damage 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:16.210
 so it works stably in winter 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:20.590
 start up as I previously repeated the car 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:24.470
 I have a half years has shown itself itself 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:29.510
 in a good word 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:33.410
 quality and so the roof does not look like me 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:37.420
 one caveat is a little dent but on 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:43.150
 principle almost imperceptible from tanks and 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:59.120
 lipstick we look at you either no 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:07:04.090
 then you can try all the state 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:11.569
 You can see on the video perfectly what questions 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:18.120
 Call and the machine is on sale 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:21.990
 good hands I will give problems will not be all 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:26.479
 finish saw so quietly and silent 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.479
 on the inside of the motor is almost inaudible 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:33.800
 what else can you say and look so 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:38.790
 from here 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:40.280
 so we have a standard radio cassette 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:45.240
 factory 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:51.300
 since I think so all the shelf 1 is 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:56.520
 other shelf moderate rear brakes 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:08:01.740
 rather the hell brake pads so that 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:09.129
 you can still say in principle work 

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:11.939
 great cars just call everyone 

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:11.939
 answer
