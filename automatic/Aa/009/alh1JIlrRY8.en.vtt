 m 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.489
 on September 3rd, the football players of the university carabins 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:16.920
 from Montreal 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.070
 we jumped on the field and with the rage to conquer 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.770
 they beat the rainmen of the midi university 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.630
 thanks to a victory of 66 to 14 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.489
 with what triumph is the fruit of a demanding mental preparation 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:32.419
 No but 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.660
 a voice we joined 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.630
 it would be wrong he is not there 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.220
 among the escapees 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.890
 the team head coach marc santerre 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.910
 put a lot on pre-match preparation he has also made a 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.800
 central element of his training me what I know pictures there I 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.270
 speaks only images of the examples of 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.690
 finally not signed his hand on things so that the data will be this 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.760
 evening once we find ourselves 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.550
 since the beginning of his career as a trainer marc santerre is making a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.010
 having to meet his players the day before the match 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010
 this arrival may be the head to the place of May 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.960
 that's where peace in the country 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.500
 I love my this issue is on the ground and his bottom hits the hole 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.370
 the two stars are shared cat passion and gdf suez 1 5% and 10% of 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.040
 players introduce themselves it's a bit like the one at Mass 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.900
 since she has as good news maybe even the unemployment scheme 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.860
 since the pre-match speeches 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.190
 just minutes before meeting the opposing team 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.140
 think about it 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.360
 we are the best 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.740
 we are the best 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.790
 in three beatings by internet 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.080
 this is the first attack 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.210

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.520
 over the country anything that may arise this contract in favor of a 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 revival by appeasement appeals it's the vuelta hit people offer themselves 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.030
 low 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.000
 for many applause sell this product more and more 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.250
 hit by the network so that's still what I think Saturday already 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.550
 in the match 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.240
 for the first time this year 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.330
 marc santerre has enlisted the services of a sports psychologist 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.529
 welcomes 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:12.899
 his own console 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.969
 proof that sport is for May 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.469
 godfather of some visualization exercises for example 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.649

 of visualization and in the landerneau brain this problem 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.369
 what I saw 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.709
 but with these backgrounds sure as a choice 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.709
 why not a common point get to it works 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.080
 I was fast and more disciplined confident 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.249
 but above all without compromise 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:44.459

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.570
