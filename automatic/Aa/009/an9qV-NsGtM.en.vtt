00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
standard fiber or water-based pomade so

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.060 
standard fiber or water-based pomade so
it<00:01:18.659> goes<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> hands<00:01:19.259> super<00:01:19.650> super<00:01:19.950> easy

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
stickiness goes in the hands pretty

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.139 
stickiness goes in the hands pretty
sticky<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:44.070> nothing<00:01:44.670> bad

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
sticky but nothing bad

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.170 
sticky but nothing bad
nothing<00:01:45.659> bad<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.930> all<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:47.670> definitely<00:01:47.880> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
nothing bad at all but definitely you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.679 
nothing bad at all but definitely you
feel<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.259> stickiness<00:01:49.799> come<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
feel that stickiness come out in the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.550 
feel that stickiness come out in the
hair<00:01:53.299> which<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.329> why<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> think<00:01:55.409> it's

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
hair which is why I think it's

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.940 
hair which is why I think it's
interesting<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:57.210> pomade<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.960> fiber

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
interesting that this pomade is a fiber

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.800 
interesting that this pomade is a fiber
pomade<00:02:00.530> because<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:02.159> has<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.030> much<00:02:03.180> stickiness

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
pomade because it has so much stickiness

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.540 
pomade because it has so much stickiness
to<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.219> actually<00:02:05.369> Styles<00:02:06.060> quite<00:02:06.420> well

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
to it and it actually Styles quite well

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.860 
to it and it actually Styles quite well
for<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.840> cleaner<00:02:10.110> kind<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.590> styles<00:02:11.009> which<00:02:11.610> is

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
for the cleaner kind of styles which is

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.560 
for the cleaner kind of styles which is
very<00:02:12.870> very<00:02:13.170> interesting

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
very very interesting

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.510 
very very interesting
considering<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> fiber<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.520> excellent

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
considering this is a fiber so excellent

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.300 
considering this is a fiber so excellent
excellent<00:02:17.880> balance<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.950> very

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
excellent balance in that it is very

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
where it doesn't stay as malleable as

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.210 
where it doesn't stay as malleable as
some<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.760> other<00:03:14.910> cool<00:03:15.090> grease<00:03:15.330> pomades

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
some of the other cool grease pomades

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.870 
some of the other cool grease pomades
because<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.400> has<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.850> stickiness<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:19.880> but

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
because it has that stickiness to it but

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.280 
because it has that stickiness to it but
it<00:03:21.000> still<00:03:21.209> stays<00:03:21.980> pretty<00:03:22.980> pliable<00:03:24.230> but<00:03:25.230> I

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
it still stays pretty pliable but I

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.390 
it still stays pretty pliable but I
wouldn't<00:03:25.680> say<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:27.200> like<00:03:28.200> still<00:03:28.470> stud<00:03:28.830> dries<00:03:29.190> up

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
wouldn't say as like still stud dries up

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.960 
wouldn't say as like still stud dries up
just<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.300> bit<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:31.440> still<00:03:31.650> stays<00:03:31.920> very<00:03:32.700> very

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
just a bit but still stays very very

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.650 
just a bit but still stays very very
malleable<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.959> very<00:03:34.200> very<00:03:34.380> nice<00:03:34.700> um<00:03:35.700> as<00:03:36.540> you

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
malleable so very very nice um as you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.430 
malleable so very very nice um as you
can<00:03:36.780> see<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.050> has<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.230> little<00:03:37.650> bit<00:03:37.739> less<00:03:38.180> than

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
can see it has a little bit less than

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.710 
can see it has a little bit less than
stellar<00:03:40.440> shine<00:03:41.090> doesn't<00:03:42.090> have<00:03:42.209> great<00:03:42.480> shine

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
stellar shine doesn't have great shine

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.250 
stellar shine doesn't have great shine
but<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.880> shine<00:03:45.090> does<00:03:45.330> go<00:03:45.510> away<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:45.780> I

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
but and the shine does go away so I

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.190 
but and the shine does go away so I
actually<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.160> say<00:03:47.239> if<00:03:48.239> you're<00:03:48.510> one<00:03:48.900> if
