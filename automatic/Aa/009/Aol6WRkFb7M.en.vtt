focus on a photograph of one specific
person<00:01:55.079> or<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.560> specific<00:01:56.040> body<00:01:56.219> type<00:01:56.490> as

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
person or one specific body type as

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
person or one specific body type as
their<00:01:56.909> inspiration<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.350> want<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
their inspiration on what they want to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.170 
their inspiration on what they want to
look<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.490> feel<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
look like and I feel like that is a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240 
look like and I feel like that is a
giant<00:02:00.479> mistake<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.439> an<00:02:01.710> incorrect

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
giant mistake because it's an incorrect

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.470 
giant mistake because it's an incorrect
representation<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:04.140> your<00:02:04.560> most<00:02:04.770> healthy

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
representation of what your most healthy

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.760 
representation of what your most healthy
so<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.020> propose<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.570> 2014<00:02:08.570> and<00:02:08.600> beyond<00:02:09.140> we

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
so I propose that in 2014 and beyond we

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.220 
so I propose that in 2014 and beyond we
all<00:02:10.010> aspire<00:02:10.370> to<00:02:10.820> be<00:02:10.910> our<00:02:11.120> most<00:02:11.690> healthy

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
all aspire to be our most healthy

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.250 
all aspire to be our most healthy
instead<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.800> aspiring<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.580> be<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.630> body<00:02:14.870> or

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
instead of aspiring to be the body or

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.400 
instead of aspiring to be the body or
the<00:02:15.460> health<00:02:16.460> level<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:17.120> somebody<00:02:17.510> else<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.170> it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the health level of somebody else and it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.260 
the health level of somebody else and it
works<00:02:18.590> both<00:02:18.770> ways<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.520> works<00:02:19.730> with<00:02:19.910> skinny

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
works both ways to it works with skinny

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.080 
works both ways to it works with skinny
and<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.630> works<00:02:20.810> with<00:02:21.020> fat<00:02:21.730> for<00:02:22.730> lack<00:02:22.850> of<00:02:22.880> better

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
and it works with fat for lack of better

and it works with fat for lack of better
terms<00:02:23.570> some<00:02:24.230> girls<00:02:24.530> are<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> little<00:02:25.310> softer<00:02:26.180> or

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
everything that they should maybe

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.900 
everything that they should maybe
they've<00:02:33.590> had<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.800> baby<00:02:34.040> or<00:02:34.370> maybe<00:02:34.550> they're<00:02:34.760> just

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
naturally a little bit on the softer

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.940 
naturally a little bit on the softer
side<00:02:36.740> or<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> bigger<00:02:37.490> side<00:02:37.580> rounder<00:02:38.330> or

heavier or more muscular or whatever it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.140 
heavier or more muscular or whatever it
may<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.410> then<00:02:42.920> some<00:02:43.160> girls<00:02:43.520> who<00:02:43.940> are

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
may be and then some girls who are

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.480 
may be and then some girls who are
naturally<00:02:44.360> thin<00:02:44.840> framed<00:02:45.110> like<00:02:45.290> me<00:02:45.470> maybe<00:02:45.860> that

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
naturally thin framed like me maybe that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.600 
naturally thin framed like me maybe that
much<00:02:46.670> weight<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.240> them<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.960> not<00:02:48.260> healthy<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.220> it

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
much weight on them is not healthy so it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.220 
much weight on them is not healthy so it
works<00:02:49.850> both<00:02:49.970> ways<00:02:50.330> with<00:02:50.600> skinny<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.020> fat<00:02:51.170> and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
works both ways with skinny and fat and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.870 
works both ways with skinny and fat and
I<00:02:51.470> don't<00:02:51.650> want<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.860> discriminate<00:02:52.250> with<00:02:52.670> either

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880
