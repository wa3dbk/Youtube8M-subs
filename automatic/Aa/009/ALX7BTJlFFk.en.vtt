00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:13.190
 I would like to check e So you the next person is hey exterior you in meeting 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:16.950
 Why Yeah right Toka one by one Anokou say light of the lens class is 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.660
 Such a place it is Toka rather it is Toka that the wound is Molly 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.660
 Well I will look around here 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.750
 That's it, scratches on the exterior body 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.720
 say big crack I can see it doing so even after though is what is related to q things 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.390
 Although there is also 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.809
 It is our prong 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.500
 It is from others from others 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.210
 With the panel behind the body 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.110
 If you look at the previous concentration in this way in the form of just a few 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.690
 It's a very small ekbo 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:00.500
 I always Because you know really but it is a state of the painting I say average also Toka after painting 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:06.900
 Once you look at the body in such a manner as seen from the jar diagonally 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:10.080
 I think it might be easy to find something small scratch marks 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.020
 That's right , it's a state guy 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.260
 A stepping stone on the windshield 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.840
 The wound is 0 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.750
 Because there is something in there 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.320
 I am watching thin uppers It is also had said so tube 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:31.600
 Or large is not of Flip jump or not smell the cracks 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.830
 I would like you to check it in two deeply in detail 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.330
 Well then it's a tire, but with me the steering wheel 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.330
 Thank you 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:53.220
 You can see their quilt base so it 's a mound of tires- 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.540
 Uyama is Well'm the form of to this is a tire You know there is no inward ze outside Ma main exchange 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.340
 Though 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.420
 Only the inner does not know and do not look at me like I is also a look at this from the outside it is a tire 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.780
 It has been reduced 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.179
 Because there are various patterns Kedomo guy is what I Ieen 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.950
 After all it is old because it is rubber even if it is effective even if there is tire groove processing temporarily 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.530
 It is said that it has become 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.060
 There have also become hard case because also was said so 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.780
 I think you can understand very well if you touch it with a psycho hand 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.530
 It is a wheel after this 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:30.590
 It says it is Toka little gabion cold in better here 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.650
 It's possible to say that it's corrosion, so these things are as beautiful as possible 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.069
 It is better to just choose the things 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.300
 I think I guess I have a dual after Sabi school when I say that I have 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.860
 Or around the bottom of the body 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:51.890
 It's because I'm getting rusty or that kind of high suspicion comes out 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:56.540
 Well from such a place you can guess various things like this, so it is thin 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.750
 I think it would be wrong if you had a look and choose the state's beautiful as possible 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.750
 I will
