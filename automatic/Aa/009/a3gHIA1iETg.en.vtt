well<00:03:52.459> there's<00:03:52.730> always<00:03:52.910> those<00:03:53.209> but<00:03:53.810> most

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
well there's always those but most

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.670 
well there's always those but most
generally<00:03:55.129> because<00:03:55.849> of<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.030> Magnum<00:03:56.680> TV

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
generally because of the Magnum TV

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.309 
generally because of the Magnum TV
series<00:03:58.099> back<00:03:58.430> in<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.700> in<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.060> 70s<00:03:59.569> so

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
series back in the in the 70s so

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.640 
series back in the in the 70s so
everybody<00:04:00.859> recognizes<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.760> car<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.620> I
