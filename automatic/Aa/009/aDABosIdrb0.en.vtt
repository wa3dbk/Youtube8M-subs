00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
well the day you too it's Michael once

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.530 
well the day you too it's Michael once
again<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.600> some<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.830> keep<00:00:05.670> asking<00:00:06.180> me<00:00:06.330> for

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
again and some of you keep asking me for

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.030 
again and some of you keep asking me for
more<00:00:06.750> videos<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:08.150> here's<00:00:09.150> one<00:00:09.389> more<00:00:10.040> well

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
more videos so here's one more well

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.360 
more videos so here's one more well
unfortunately<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.880> not<00:00:12.200> a<00:00:13.200> completely<00:00:13.710> new

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
unfortunately it's not a completely new

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.320 
unfortunately it's not a completely new
project<00:00:15.059> I'll<00:00:15.330> show<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.570> today<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:17.150> it's<00:00:18.150> one

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
project I'll show you today but it's one

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.200 
project I'll show you today but it's one
of<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> projects<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.590> proved<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.210> more

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
of the projects that proved to be more

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.840 
of the projects that proved to be more
interesting<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.369> well<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> little<00:00:23.609> major

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
interesting and well a little major

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.550 
interesting and well a little major
rewrite<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.820> well<00:00:26.820> as<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> result<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:28.260> really

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
rewrite and well as a result this really

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.970 
rewrite and well as a result this really
turned<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.580> pretty<00:00:29.910> well<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.929> i<00:00:31.500> think

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
turned out to be pretty well so i think

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.030 
turned out to be pretty well so i think
it's<00:00:32.279> worth<00:00:32.540> mentioning<00:00:33.540> again<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
it's worth mentioning again and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.560 
it's worth mentioning again and
especially<00:00:35.040> because<00:00:35.760> i'm<00:00:35.969> thinking<00:00:36.300> about

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
especially because i'm thinking about

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.770 
especially because i'm thinking about
the<00:00:36.829> publication<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> project<00:00:38.510> now<00:00:39.510> what

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the publication of the project now what

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.490 
the publication of the project now what
is<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.280> it's<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:42.530> usb-connected<00:00:43.530> censor<00:00:44.370> board

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
is it it's a usb-connected censor board

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.939 
is it it's a usb-connected censor board
so<00:00:46.850> based<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.149> an<00:00:48.480> AVR<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:50.160> ft<00:00:50.879> 232<00:00:51.420> device

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
so based on an AVR and a ft 232 device

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.790 
so based on an AVR and a ft 232 device
so<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.449> flat<00:00:54.750> cable<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.320> connected

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so here on this flat cable are connected

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.170 
so here on this flat cable are connected
to<00:00:56.610> sensors<00:00:57.289> this<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.469> dee<00:00:58.680> dee<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.980> 1621<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
to sensors this is dee dee is 1621 and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.509 
to sensors this is dee dee is 1621 and
this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.960> sh<00:01:01.500> sh<00:01:02.129> t<00:01:02.460> 11<00:01:03.799> right<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.309> little

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
this is the sh sh t 11 right this little

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.020 
this is the sh sh t 11 right this little
fellow<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.500> those<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.650> two<00:01:07.740> sensors<00:01:08.189> this

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
fellow here those are two sensors this

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.570 
fellow here those are two sensors this
one<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.360> measure<00:01:09.540> temperature<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:11.369> one

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
one can measure temperature and this one

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
one can measure temperature and this one
can<00:01:11.880> measure<00:01:12.030> temperature<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.780> relative

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
can measure temperature and relative

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.120 
can measure temperature and relative
humidity<00:01:13.760> area<00:01:14.760> midi<00:01:14.970> team<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
humidity area midi team so this is a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
humidity area midi team so this is a
very<00:01:17.280> sophisticated<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.299> very<00:01:18.509> accurate

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
very sophisticated in a very accurate

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.249 
very sophisticated in a very accurate
sensor<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> 1621<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.270> also<00:01:21.960> 0

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sensor but it is 1621 is also 0

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.550 
sensor but it is 1621 is also 0
considerable<00:01:23.150> considerably<00:01:24.150> accurate<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.920> um

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
considerable considerably accurate so um

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.480 
considerable considerably accurate so um
right<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:30.000> last<00:01:30.180> time<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:31.400> programmed<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
right now the last time I programmed the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.840 
right now the last time I programmed the
humor<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:34.200> wasn't<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:34.759> wasn't<00:01:35.759> very

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
humor of this it wasn't very wasn't very

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.060 
humor of this it wasn't very wasn't very
sophisticated<00:01:36.409> but<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.740> time<00:01:38.009> I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
sophisticated but this time I

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.240 
sophisticated but this time I
implemented<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.290> two-way<00:01:40.290> bidirectional

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
implemented a two-way bidirectional

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.850 
implemented a two-way bidirectional
communication<00:01:41.659> protocol<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.680> also

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
communication protocol it is also

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.639 
communication protocol it is also
supported<00:01:44.759> by<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:46.460> hardware<00:01:47.460> flow<00:01:47.729> control<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
supported by a hardware flow control and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.580 
supported by a hardware flow control and
searcy<00:01:49.649> 16<00:01:50.430> checksums<00:01:51.140> what<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.409> here

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
searcy 16 checksums what you see here

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.880 
searcy 16 checksums what you see here
this<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.920> an<00:01:53.159> additional<00:01:54.290> driver<00:01:55.290> had<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.710> use

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
this is an additional driver had to use

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.649 
this is an additional driver had to use
for<00:01:56.130> those<00:01:56.250> flow<00:01:56.490> control<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:58.100> pd

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
for those flow control this is the pd

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.100 
for those flow control this is the pd
cts<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> RTS<00:02:01.500> line<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.790> well<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> didn't

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
cts know the RTS line but well I didn't

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
cts know the RTS line but well I didn't
you<00:02:04.229> lay<00:02:04.469> out<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.340> includes<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:06.000> line

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you lay out so that includes this line

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.290 
you lay out so that includes this line
so<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.540> had<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:07.170> patch<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.409> up<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so I had to just patch it up this is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.350 
so I had to just patch it up this is
what<00:02:09.450> sometimes<00:02:09.899> happen<00:02:10.319> but

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
what sometimes happen but

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.750 
what sometimes happen but
yeah<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:14.150> little<00:02:16.310> usage<00:02:17.310> example<00:02:17.990> well<00:02:19.760> it's

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
yeah a little usage example well it's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.830 
yeah a little usage example well it's
already<00:02:22.640> here<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:23.940> let's<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.690> more

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
already here but let's do this one more

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.340 
already here but let's do this one more
time<00:02:25.460> using<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:27.270> three<00:02:27.540> temperature<00:02:28.050> command

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
time using the three temperature command

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.710 
time using the three temperature command
as<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.740> client<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.490> i<00:02:29.520> use<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.850> with<00:02:29.970> l<00:02:30.210> which

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
as a client so i use it with l which

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.450 
as a client so i use it with l which
means<00:02:30.960> list<00:02:31.350> all<00:02:31.620> sensors<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.370> are

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
means list all sensors that are

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.840 
means list all sensors that are
currently<00:02:32.820> connected<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:34.550> as<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.820> see

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
currently connected and as you can see

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.300 
currently connected and as you can see
it<00:02:36.180> finds<00:02:36.600> all<00:02:36.930> address<00:02:37.320> 0<00:02:37.680> which<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.040> always

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
it finds all address 0 which is always

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.970 
it finds all address 0 which is always
at<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> zero<00:02:38.820> because<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.560> only<00:02:40.590> other

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
at a zero because this is the only other

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.650 
at a zero because this is the only other
supported<00:02:41.520> by<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.670> sensor<00:02:43.430> from<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.580> sht<00:02:45.300> 11

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
supported by the sensor from the sht 11

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.380 
supported by the sensor from the sht 11
and<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:46.530> address<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.190> fine<00:02:47.550> BB<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.030> six<00:02:48.300> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and on address one fine BB is six and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.510 
and on address one fine BB is six and
twenty-one<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:49.470> can<00:02:49.650> jump<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.190> address

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
twenty-one you can jump on the address

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.790 
twenty-one you can jump on the address
here<00:02:51.920> well<00:02:52.920> let's<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.730> another<00:02:53.880> address<00:02:57.800> well

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
here well let's do another address well

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.390 
here well let's do another address well
it's<00:02:58.950> no<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.489> so<00:02:59.760> so<00:02:59.940> let's<00:03:00.090> do<00:03:00.540> another<00:03:00.660> address

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
it's no I so so let's do another address

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.240 
it's no I so so let's do another address
this<00:03:02.400> should<00:03:02.610> result<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.480> dress<00:03:03.660> three<00:03:04.250> of

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
this should result in a dress three of

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.720 
this should result in a dress three of
course<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.630> do<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.200> have<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.310> reset<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
course if I do this I have to reset the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.350 
course if I do this I have to reset the
board<00:03:10.550> yeah<00:03:12.020> so<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.610> display<00:03:14.820> now<00:03:15.239> I

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
board yeah so to be on a display now I

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.509 
board yeah so to be on a display now I
wouldn't<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> know<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:19.590> well<00:03:20.400> that

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
wouldn't you know it it's now well that

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.979 
wouldn't you know it it's now well that
is<00:03:20.670> free<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.510> up<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.880> total<00:03:23.880> number<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.570> eight

is free so up to a total number of eight

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.530 
is free so up to a total number of eight
sensors<00:03:25.709> are<00:03:25.920> supported<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.299> could

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
sensors are supported so you could

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.910 
sensors are supported so you could
connect<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.350> up<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.890> say<00:03:30.470> 8d<00:03:31.470> or<00:03:31.560> six<00:03:31.769> and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
connect that up to say 8d or six and

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.470 
connect that up to say 8d or six and
twenty-one<00:03:32.160> or<00:03:32.459> other<00:03:33.150> senses<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:36.360> you

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
twenty-one or other senses so if you

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.539 
twenty-one or other senses so if you
call<00:03:36.630> abalone<00:03:36.959> any<00:03:37.170> arguments<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.920> will<00:03:38.070> read

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
call abalone any arguments it will read

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.570 
call abalone any arguments it will read
out<00:03:38.630> temperature<00:03:39.920> readout<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.190> sensors

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
out temperature readout the sensors

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.640 
out temperature readout the sensors
which<00:03:42.450> 0<00:03:43.260> at<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.739> time<00:03:44.310> stamp<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.330> says

25 dot six degrees Celsius it has thirty

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.160 
25 dot six degrees Celsius it has thirty
six<00:03:49.680> percent<00:03:49.950> relative<00:03:50.760> humidity<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.630> this

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
six percent relative humidity and this

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.979 
six percent relative humidity and this
is<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.470> dew<00:03:52.620> point<00:03:52.920> well<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.750> sh<00:03:54.750> t

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
is the dew point well this is the sh t

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.400 
is the dew point well this is the sh t
11<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.670> year<00:03:57.120> 16<00:03:57.630> 21<00:03:58.019> which<00:03:58.200> is

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
11 and this is the year 16 21 which is

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.840 
11 and this is the year 16 21 which is
that<00:03:58.680> 25<00:03:59.370> 35<00:04:00.120> degrees<00:04:00.860> this<00:04:01.860> is<00:04:02.070> about

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
that 25 35 degrees this is about

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.440 
that 25 35 degrees this is about
accurate<00:04:03.299> down<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.049> 0<00:04:04.830> 1<00:04:05.430> degree<00:04:05.790> Celsius<00:04:05.820> and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
accurate down to 0 1 degree Celsius and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.870 
accurate down to 0 1 degree Celsius and
this<00:04:06.630> is<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.870> great<00:04:07.080> only<00:04:07.380> up<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.310> one-half

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
this is a great only up to one-half

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.600 
this is a great only up to one-half
degree<00:04:09.299> so<00:04:10.049> this<00:04:10.230> is<00:04:10.380> why<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.560> always<00:04:10.920> stop<00:04:11.250> zero

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
degree so this is why I always stop zero

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.000 
degree so this is why I always stop zero
or<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:11.970> five<00:04:12.239> will<00:04:12.450> be<00:04:12.480> showing<00:04:12.720> him<00:04:13.010> well

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
or the five will be showing him well

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.380 
or the five will be showing him well
yeah

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
yeah

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.930 
yeah
well<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.590> about<00:04:16.709> i'm<00:04:17.160> planning<00:04:17.820> on

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
well this is it about i'm planning on

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.890 
well this is it about i'm planning on
maybe<00:04:18.560> supporting<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.100> sensor<00:04:20.519> types<00:04:20.900> and

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
maybe supporting of the sensor types and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.950 
maybe supporting of the sensor types and
stuff<00:04:22.170> like<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.350> i<00:04:22.740> mean<00:04:23.420> the<00:04:24.420> more

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
stuff like that i mean the more

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.640 
stuff like that i mean the more
sophisticated<00:04:25.530> part<00:04:26.100> about<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:27.470> say<00:04:28.470> i

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
sophisticated part about is that say i

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.409 
sophisticated part about is that say i
do<00:04:28.710> something<00:04:29.190> like<00:04:29.450> unplugging<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.720> sensors

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
do something like unplugging the sensors

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.340 
do something like unplugging the sensors
yeah<00:04:33.620> one-handed<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:35.720> what<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.810> does<00:04:36.930> not<00:04:36.960> it

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
yeah one-handed so what it does not it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.650 
yeah one-handed so what it does not it
detects<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.610> conditioner<00:04:39.090> automatically

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
detects the conditioner automatically

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.780 
detects the conditioner automatically
goes<00:04:39.930> into<00:04:40.110> reset<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.910> now<00:04:41.910> if<00:04:42.419> i<00:04:42.960> do<00:04:43.140> this

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
goes into reset and now if i do this

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.100 
goes into reset and now if i do this
again<00:04:46.640> Wow<00:04:47.640> as<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.270> can<00:04:48.360> see<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.690> says<00:04:48.840> now

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
again Wow as you can see it says now

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.260 
again Wow as you can see it says now
that<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.860> command<00:04:50.220> has<00:04:50.460> failed<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:51.030> the

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that the command has failed and the

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.700 
that the command has failed and the
percents<00:04:51.630> borders<00:04:51.960> on<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.140> fatal<00:04:52.440> error<00:04:52.500> of

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
percents borders on a fatal error of

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.010 
percents borders on a fatal error of
state<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.190> even<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.330> reason<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.660> no

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
state and even the reason that no

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.980 
state and even the reason that no
sensors<00:04:55.470> were<00:04:55.590> found<00:04:56.210> so<00:04:57.210> this<00:04:57.570> is<00:04:57.600> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
sensors were found so this is the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.409 
sensors were found so this is the
command<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.590> was<00:04:58.770> sent<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.490> board<00:04:59.730> this

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
command that was sent to the board this

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.450 
command that was sent to the board this
is<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.870> response<00:05:01.260> from<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.710> board<00:05:01.950> and<00:05:02.220> this

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
is the response from the board and this

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.630 
is the response from the board and this
is<00:05:02.580> sort<00:05:02.790> of<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.000> importation<00:05:03.810> so<00:05:04.650> its<00:05:05.490> all

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
is sort of the importation so its all

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.820 
is sort of the importation so its all
checked<00:05:05.700> and<00:05:06.210> if<00:05:06.840> something<00:05:07.050> goes<00:05:07.320> wrong<00:05:07.350> here

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
checked and if something goes wrong here

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.620 
checked and if something goes wrong here
you<00:05:07.980> will<00:05:08.130> see<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.430> in<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.640> point<00:05:08.910> so<00:05:09.330> this<00:05:09.600> is

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
you will see it in the point so this is

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.450 
you will see it in the point so this is
no<00:05:09.990> more<00:05:10.169> sophisticated<00:05:10.710> part<00:05:11.010> about<00:05:11.190> what<00:05:11.430> I

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
no more sophisticated part about what I

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.860 
no more sophisticated part about what I
did<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:13.370> yeah<00:05:16.550> maybe<00:05:17.550> even<00:05:17.730> assess<00:05:18.390> if<00:05:18.630> no

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
did and yeah maybe even assess if no

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.690 
did and yeah maybe even assess if no
sensor<00:05:19.260> data<00:05:19.410> is<00:05:19.650> available<00:05:19.770> if<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.370> plug<00:05:20.580> it

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
sensor data is available if you plug it

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.590 
sensor data is available if you plug it
in<00:05:20.820> again<00:05:25.280> you<00:05:26.280> need<00:05:26.430> to<00:05:26.580> do<00:05:26.760> one<00:05:27.090> reset<00:05:27.479> of

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
in again you need to do one reset of

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.020 
in again you need to do one reset of
course<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:29.280> now<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.580> works<00:05:29.790> again

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.400 

and<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:34.440> can<00:05:34.650> do<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:35.100> reset<00:05:37.010> minus<00:05:38.010> R<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.220> think

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
and you can do a reset minus R I think

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.200 
and you can do a reset minus R I think
yeah<00:05:41.900> so<00:05:42.900> if<00:05:43.290> I<00:05:43.530> read<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.370> temperature<00:05:44.550> right

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
yeah so if I read the temperature right

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.720 
yeah so if I read the temperature right
after<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:45.960> reset<00:05:46.320> which<00:05:47.130> has<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.520> null

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
after the reset which has the null

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.330 
after the reset which has the null
sensor<00:05:48.030> data<00:05:48.120> is<00:05:48.330> available<00:05:48.450> yet<00:05:49.220> because<00:05:50.220> it

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
sensor data is available yet because it

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.460 
sensor data is available yet because it
Reese<00:05:50.490> is<00:05:50.640> only<00:05:50.790> once<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.180> second<00:05:51.540> but<00:05:52.320> now<00:05:52.440> of

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
Reese is only once a second but now of

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.960 
Reese is only once a second but now of
course<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:52.920> is<00:05:53.010> available<00:05:53.220> so<00:05:54.470> yeah<00:05:55.470> this<00:05:56.460> is

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.390 

this<00:05:59.970> is<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.480> project<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:01.350> little<00:06:01.890> bint<00:06:02.190> a

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
this is the project a little bint a

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
little glimpse on on the board because

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.180 
little glimpse on on the board because
it<00:06:07.230> is<00:06:07.350> very<00:06:07.500> simple<00:06:07.740> board<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.930> be<00:06:10.740> gutted

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
it is very simple board and be gutted

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.390 
it is very simple board and be gutted
till<00:06:11.550> we<00:06:11.910> have<00:06:12.180> this<00:06:12.480> you<00:06:13.020> temperature<00:06:13.590> use<00:06:13.980> B

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
till we have this you temperature use B

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:22.070 
till we have this you temperature use B
and<00:06:14.790> this<00:06:14.940> is<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.600> board<00:06:16.730> so<00:06:17.730> same
