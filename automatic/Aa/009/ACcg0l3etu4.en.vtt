00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 your therapist and teacher of 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.090
 skate online today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 is a work that many people have asked for and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.940
 the comments that the pop rain rains is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.660
 very similar to variable mary ann 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.840
 roberts vernes up hills suns and a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
 mouse refers to variable score but his 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.960
 book if I want to change is our language 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.490
 then it is variable 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 a long time that I have this 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.309
 Maneuver photoshop very long time 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.710
 I'll see if I can teach you today. 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.570
 first of all do a warm up 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.570
 by stretching and now will try in the ear 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.410
 one thing that will help face you already 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.840
 got to send the 180 because pop 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.780
 show is very similar 180 for you 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.629
 180 year old sidewalk to pax radio 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.269
 haiti and also go down the eye sidewalk 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.430
 and 180 in France where the backside 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.850
 difference that your body stays in the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.490
 same position the week that reached the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.350
 your body will generate 180 and remains me 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.240
 I like to practice sitting maneuvers because 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.000
 less energy is spent 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.000
 you discover the mechanics of movement 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.390
 among those that are spinning almost a flip 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.040
 to the pt position is wrong 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.590
 if you realize that those who are 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.650
 turning to see if you have to change the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.290
 position of the front and back foot in the 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.970
 position would be what I have the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.970
 front full foot written 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.070
 work alone brings today that the foot of 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.200
 back to the giraffe skateboard 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.229
 so the idea you adjust the back foot 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.060
 so that you make the reds rotate the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.060
 pop show ces in general flip 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.140
 week needed failure 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.579
 the ball 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.910
 on here 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:13.790
 I want to go back to stock because 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.880
 save the ants if you can 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.570
 this was the creation of nature gave 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.570
 function in the ecosystem 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:59.560
 Now, tomorrow, strengthening the day. 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:02.920
 more to make sure not even day 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.920
 now it 's starting 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.170
 Have you noticed so much that we have 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.760
 patient in relation to time 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.010
 how things have to be for us 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.680
 faster and faster 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:20.200
 there are things that require a certain time 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:25.490
 to make it happen 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:29.420
 if we fortify we accelerate God we 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.750
 We also accelerated the day of our departure. 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:36.410
 we can not enjoy the 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.420
 seconds what we have to 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.790
 experience this wonderful life here in 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.270
 skateboarding with those of us 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.270
 love
