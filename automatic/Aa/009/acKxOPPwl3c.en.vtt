one's<00:00:08.700> funnel<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:10.099> obviously<00:00:11.099> we're<00:00:11.280> trying

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
one's funnel so obviously we're trying

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.609 
one's funnel so obviously we're trying
to<00:00:11.610> get<00:00:12.059> much<00:00:12.539> better<00:00:12.749> on<00:00:12.900> with<00:00:13.049> water<00:00:13.259> than

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:13.619 
to get much better on with water than

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.560 
to get much better on with water than
the<00:00:13.709> dance<00:00:13.949> and<00:00:14.219> if<00:00:14.309> we're<00:00:14.429> getting<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.999> come

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the dance and if we're getting to come

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.840 
the dance and if we're getting to come
around<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.929> back<00:00:16.110> of<00:00:16.320> us<00:00:16.470> then<00:00:17.370> we<00:00:17.490> figured

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
around the back of us then we figured

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.010 
around the back of us then we figured
that<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.540> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.780> be<00:00:18.840> much<00:00:18.990> easier

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that it's going to be much easier

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.050 
that it's going to be much easier
control<00:00:19.530> it's<00:00:20.010> when<00:00:20.280> starts<00:00:20.640> getting<00:00:20.880> anxious

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
control it's when starts getting anxious

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.870 
control it's when starts getting anxious
we<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.660> get<00:00:21.810> behind<00:00:22.050> also<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:23.100> closer<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.730> us

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
we can get behind also get closer to us

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.440 
we can get behind also get closer to us
then<00:00:24.600> that's<00:00:25.020> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.350> benefit<00:00:25.710> walks<00:00:26.450> this

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
then that's going to benefit walks this

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:36.709 
then that's going to benefit walks this
is<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.860> fantasy<00:00:28.860> to<00:00:29.070> follow<00:00:29.370> sit<00:00:30.619> on<00:00:31.619> oh<00:00:35.719> good
