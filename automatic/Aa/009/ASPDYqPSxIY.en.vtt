you with your presence so you're not

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
just standing still but you're alive and

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:51.569 
just standing still but you're alive and
filling<00:00:45.859> the<00:00:46.249> room<00:00:46.609> with<00:00:46.670> your<00:00:47.659> presence<00:00:50.530> so

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
filling the room with your presence so

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.059 
filling the room with your presence so
when<00:00:52.579> you<00:00:52.760> move<00:00:53.059> through<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.510> air<00:00:53.739> you<00:00:54.739> move

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
when you move through the air you move

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:58.419 
when you move through the air you move
to<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.519> air<00:00:55.730> as<00:00:56.179> if<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.569> air<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.809> thick<00:00:57.559> as<00:00:57.980> if

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
to the air as if the air is thick as if

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.739 
to the air as if the air is thick as if
it<00:00:58.550> has<00:00:58.730> substance<00:00:59.920> as<00:01:00.920> if<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:01.850> are<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.420> same

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
it has substance as if you are the same

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.350 
it has substance as if you are the same
way<00:01:03.019> as<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.350> air<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:03.829> that<00:01:04.040> your<00:01:04.280> movement<00:01:05.030> has

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
way as the air so that your movement has

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.030 
way as the air so that your movement has
weight<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:06.320> your<00:01:06.530> movement<00:01:06.920> has

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
weight so that your movement has

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.820 
weight so that your movement has
substance<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:08.540> as<00:01:08.720> if<00:01:08.750> you're<00:01:09.050> resisting

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
substance so it's as if you're resisting

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.490 
substance so it's as if you're resisting
you're<00:01:10.040> pushing<00:01:10.400> up<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.000> air<00:01:11.180> pushing<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.260> off

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
you're pushing up the air pushing it off

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.910 
you're pushing up the air pushing it off
the<00:01:12.800> air<00:01:12.979> pushing<00:01:13.969> down<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.750> air<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.770> that

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the air pushing down the air so that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:29.350 
the air pushing down the air so that
when<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:16.189> move<00:01:16.549> through<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.000> air

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.840 

so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
so

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.330 
so
in<00:01:31.090> terms<00:01:31.360> of<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.689> quality<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.500> movement<00:01:32.890> in

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
in terms of the quality of movement in

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.450 
in terms of the quality of movement in
terms<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.990> creating<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.189> atmosphere

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
terms of of creating that atmosphere

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.590 
terms of of creating that atmosphere
around<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.500> in<00:01:39.040> terms<00:01:39.400> of<00:01:39.640> being<00:01:40.150> the

around you and in terms of being the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
around you and in terms of being the
atmosphere<00:01:41.259> becoming<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.360> atmosphere<00:01:43.360> of<00:01:43.630> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
atmosphere becoming the atmosphere of of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.080 
atmosphere becoming the atmosphere of of
allowing<00:01:46.240> your<00:01:46.750> presence<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.770> permeate<00:01:48.460> space

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
allowing your presence to permeate space

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.109 
allowing your presence to permeate space
around<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:51.119> there's<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.210> sense<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.840> always

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
around you there's a sense of always

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.420 
around you there's a sense of always
movement<00:01:55.119> inside<00:01:55.690> of<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.990> stillness<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:57.310> that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
movement inside of the stillness so that

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.940 
movement inside of the stillness so that
you're<00:01:57.549> not<00:01:57.580> just<00:01:57.700> standing<00:01:58.539> there<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.770> that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
you're not just standing there but that

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.700 
you're not just standing there but that
you're<00:02:00.100> filling<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.909> space<00:02:01.330> around<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:02.320> and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
you're filling the space around you and

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.190 
you're filling the space around you and
then<00:02:03.100> when<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.490> move<00:02:03.819> through<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.240> air<00:02:04.390> it's

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
then when you move through the air it's

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.790 
then when you move through the air it's
as<00:02:05.380> if<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.710> air<00:02:05.890> is<00:02:05.920> thick<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:07.240> as<00:02:07.360> if<00:02:07.509> you're

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
as if the air is thick it's as if you're

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.710 
as if the air is thick it's as if you're
carving<00:02:08.970> lines<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.959> space<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.120> move

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
carving lines in the space so you move

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.860 
carving lines in the space so you move
through<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.440> air<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:15.269> you're<00:02:16.269> pushing<00:02:16.510> up

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
through the air like you're pushing up

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.190 
through the air like you're pushing up
matter<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.950> you're<00:02:18.730> pushing<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.300> out<00:02:19.450> and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
matter and you're pushing it out and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.380 
matter and you're pushing it out and
you're<00:02:20.530> pushing<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.100> down<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:22.239> you're

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
you're pushing it down like you're

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.809 
you're pushing it down like you're
pushing<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:22.930> water<00:02:23.560> or<00:02:24.010> sound<00:02:25.080> pushing<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.200> out

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
pushing up water or sound pushing it out

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.729 
pushing up water or sound pushing it out
pushing<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.150> down<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.140> you're<00:02:29.319> not<00:02:29.440> just

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
pushing it down so you're not just

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.340 
pushing it down so you're not just
moving<00:02:29.920> through<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.790> nothing<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.600> so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
moving through like it's nothing and so

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.710 
moving through like it's nothing and so
your<00:02:32.890> movement<00:02:33.519> then<00:02:33.700> has<00:02:34.000> weight<00:02:34.420> and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
your movement then has weight and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.170 
your movement then has weight and
substance<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.680> has<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.220> that's<00:02:36.760> what<00:02:37.000> makes

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
substance it has and that's what makes

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.069 
substance it has and that's what makes
it<00:02:37.299> so<00:02:37.360> beautiful<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.739> think<00:02:38.980> that's<00:02:39.250> also

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
it so beautiful and I think that's also

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.110 
it so beautiful and I think that's also
paradoxically<00:02:41.079> what<00:02:41.260> makes<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.709> weightless

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
paradoxically what makes you weightless

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.789 
paradoxically what makes you weightless
because<00:02:43.120> when<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.570> move<00:02:43.900> through<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.350> air<00:02:44.560> as

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
because when you move through the air as

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.610 
because when you move through the air as
if<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.160> air<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.370> thick<00:02:45.880> then<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.049> become<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
if the air is thick then you become the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.430 
if the air is thick then you become the
same<00:02:47.859> way<00:02:48.130> as<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.489> air<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.440> therefore

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
same way as the air and therefore

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.520 
same way as the air and therefore
