00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello and welcome to china phone 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.400
 house today we will make a new 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.340
 tutorial to show you a few 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.080
 differences between a real samsung s 4 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.830
 is what we can sometimes find for 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.560
 half the price or even two to three 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 times the cheapest as a samsung s case 4 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.390
 because in general if the phone is 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.150
 two to three times cheaper is that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.900
 it's not a real samsung s 4 so here 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.690
 we have a Chinese smartphone double sim 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.870
 which on some sites and sold as a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 true samsung sk 4 in addition so he has the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 casing level look but he also has the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.440
 same look as the s4 at the level of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.750
 the user interface sees that it's 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.149
 almost the same then we'll start the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.300
 comparison here talk about the proportions 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.710
 what we see is that the s4 in all 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 case with this model that is not this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.369
 that we call a copy a port one because 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.320
 that there are goddesses four months of 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.689
 copies of s4 that are exactly the same 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.439
 but that their voices that he is a 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.939
 little bit thicker we also see that he 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.909
 is a little bit bigger 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.290
 and otherwise globally when you walk around 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.880
 on a website it's different 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.750
 it's hard to tell the difference 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.640
 because the look is like the back on 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 the side there is the slice even established which 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.940
 the button on off before it's 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.940
 exactly the same thing there are the same 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:55.750
 sounds there is the same look and feel here so 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.580
 we look at the apps it's 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.770
 exactly the same thing 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:08.020
 here we have the empty widgets throws here 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.819
 so it will be very, very difficult to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.880
 to be able to get an idea if there is the 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.660
 cannes web camera voice and 2 is doing 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.239
 it's really very very similar in 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.980
 plus it's a quad core processor like 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.080
 on samsung 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.280
 the camera in terms of definition 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.540
 is also similar 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 so it's very complicated to do the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.720
 difference 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.040
 then another way to make a difference 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.540
 between s4 and 95 01 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.880
 it's here to go into the settings 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.190
 first there it is on a black background this is 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.480
 on white background what we see is also 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:58.410
 that the menus are different there are 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.410
 a lot more details here in the s4 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.739
 we go to the temples about the phone 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.849
 also so there on the scat I scored 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.160
 it's a galaxy s 4 while there the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.750
 model number 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:25.790
 it's 0 6 v 20 in two scores etc etc 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:29.780
 so if you buy a samsung s 4 on 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.319
 internet asked to see a picture here of the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.549
 name of the device 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.790
 what we see here but it can be 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:42.310
 changed for example while on this 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.310
 model it's impossible to change it 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:51.920
 so a way also to do the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.840
 difference is that here we have the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.840
 small feature icons that are 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.930
 directly accessible like that then 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.260
 if we do that on the copy here we have 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.930
 the same notification but to have 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:11.480
 the function icons you have to press 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:14.239
 Here on this small icon so well that 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.010
 the menu is basically inspired by samsung 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.840
 s 4 it is not completely the same 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.760
 so here I hope this tutorial you 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.180
 will be useful to make a difference 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.580
 between a copy that will be two to three 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.050
 cheaper times is a real so 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.400
 look at the proportions 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.669
 because that one is a little bit more 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.230
 big and bomba is not secret if you 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.610
 have a samsung s 4 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.850
 to less than 200 euros is that it is 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.740
 necessarily a copy here I tell you to 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.740
 soon on china phone house
