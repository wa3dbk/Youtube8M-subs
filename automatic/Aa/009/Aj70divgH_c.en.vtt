talk in this area between the siding and
the<00:01:05.900> door<00:01:06.900> frame<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:09.320> we'll<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.680> into

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the door frame and we'll just get into

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:24.280 
the door frame and we'll just get into
that<00:01:11.070> now

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.270 

and<00:01:24.740> what<00:01:24.860> we<00:01:25.010> can<00:01:25.190> do<00:01:25.340> is<00:01:25.550> just<00:01:26.680> go<00:01:27.680> on<00:01:27.860> top<00:01:28.100> of

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
and what we can do is just go on top of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.709 
and what we can do is just go on top of
that<00:01:30.250> it'll<00:01:31.250> make<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.610> darker

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.190 

just<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.259> slight<00:01:35.799> bead<00:01:36.159> next<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.969> it<00:01:37.119> or<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.020> top

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
just a slight bead next to it or on top

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:54.919 
just a slight bead next to it or on top
of<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.479> this<00:01:43.780> one<00:01:44.020> will<00:01:44.200> wipe<00:01:44.469> back

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929

won't<00:02:06.609> the<00:02:07.060> white<00:02:07.270> won't<00:02:07.509> show<00:02:07.810> through<00:02:08.140> that

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:25.420 

will<00:02:11.950> be<00:02:12.250> down<00:02:12.549> beside<00:02:12.819> it

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.720

00:02:40.629 --> 00:04:44.710 

and<00:02:41.140> we<00:02:41.230> want<00:02:41.439> to<00:02:41.499> do<00:02:41.650> all<00:02:41.859> our<00:02:42.040> joints

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.990 

this<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> close-up<00:04:46.500> look<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:47.370> how<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.640> beach

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
this is a close-up look of how the beach

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.120 
this is a close-up look of how the beach
should<00:04:48.300> look<00:04:50.180> it's<00:04:51.180> raised<00:04:51.600> it's<00:04:52.140> making<00:04:52.650> the

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
should look it's raised it's making the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.740 
should look it's raised it's making the
complete<00:04:53.550> join<00:04:54.030> between<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.200> siding<00:04:56.660> or<00:04:57.660> the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
complete join between the siding or the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.300 
complete join between the siding or the
wall<00:04:57.960> finished<00:04:58.320> material<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.160> doorframe

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
wall finished material and the doorframe

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.170 
wall finished material and the doorframe
but<00:05:02.310> it's<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.640> raised<00:05:03.200> bead<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.580> water<00:05:05.820> will

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
but it's a raised bead so the water will

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.000 
but it's a raised bead so the water will
just<00:05:06.210> run<00:05:06.720> off<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:08.150> if<00:05:09.150> we<00:05:09.420> try<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.800> wipe<00:05:10.800> it

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
just run off it if we try to wipe it

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.330 
just run off it if we try to wipe it
back<00:05:11.250> we<00:05:11.760> might<00:05:11.970> create<00:05:12.560> like<00:05:13.560> a<00:05:13.590> cup<00:05:13.950> or<00:05:14.190> a

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
back we might create like a cup or a

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.640 
back we might create like a cup or a
valley<00:05:14.700> and<00:05:15.440> then<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:18.450> water<00:05:18.720> can<00:05:19.080> collect<00:05:19.290> in

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
valley and then the water can collect in

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.480 
valley and then the water can collect in
there<00:05:19.890> and<00:05:20.490> can<00:05:20.790> sneak<00:05:21.090> in<00:05:21.890> this<00:05:22.890> way<00:05:23.100> we<00:05:23.310> got<00:05:23.430> a

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
there and can sneak in this way we got a

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.120 
there and can sneak in this way we got a
proper<00:05:23.940> seal<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.660> then<00:05:25.410> when<00:05:25.560> we<00:05:25.710> paint<00:05:25.950> it

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
proper seal and then when we paint it

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.690 
proper seal and then when we paint it
and<00:05:26.430> look<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.730> lot<00:05:26.880> cleaner<00:05:28.550> that'll<00:05:29.550> be<00:05:29.670> a

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700
