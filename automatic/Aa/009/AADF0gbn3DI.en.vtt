00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
so here's the thing just got a hydraulic

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.140 
so here's the thing just got a hydraulic
system<00:00:09.580> on<00:00:09.790> both<00:00:09.940> sides<00:00:10.210> in<00:00:10.540> the<00:00:11.440> back<00:00:12.150> got

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
system on both sides in the back got

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.970 
system on both sides in the back got
battery<00:00:13.540> pack<00:00:13.750> right<00:00:13.960> here<00:00:14.170> take<00:00:14.410> six<00:00:14.740> a

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
battery pack right here take six a

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.339 
battery pack right here take six a
batteries<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:18.550> rain<00:00:18.849> over<00:00:19.119> here<00:00:19.150> with<00:00:20.110> three

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
batteries like rain over here with three

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:28.380 
batteries like rain over here with three
switches<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.919> a<00:00:25.439> winch<00:00:26.439> in<00:00:26.649> the<00:00:26.739> front<00:00:27.009> I<00:00:27.390> have

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
switches and a winch in the front I have

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.150 
switches and a winch in the front I have
it<00:00:28.509> hooked<00:00:28.660> up<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.989> this<00:00:29.140> this<00:00:29.200> is<00:00:29.560> actually<00:00:29.890> an

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
it hooked up to this this is actually an

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.280 
it hooked up to this this is actually an
apple<00:00:30.550> core<00:00:30.790> that<00:00:31.029> is<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.300> free<00:00:31.660> gift<00:00:31.840> that<00:00:32.110> came

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
apple core that is a free gift that came

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.060 
apple core that is a free gift that came
with<00:00:32.439> it<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.600> it's<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:37.719> this<00:00:37.899> thing<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.649> don't

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
with it so it's got this thing I don't

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.470 
with it so it's got this thing I don't
know<00:00:39.129> what<00:00:39.280> it's<00:00:39.399> called<00:00:39.429> but<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.969> stabilize

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
know what it's called but to stabilize

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.049 
know what it's called but to stabilize
the<00:00:40.660> thing<00:00:40.870> when<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.109> want<00:00:41.289> to<00:00:41.350> use<00:00:41.469> the<00:00:41.590> crane

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.259 

this<00:00:46.059> is<00:00:47.550> steering<00:00:48.550> mechanism<00:00:49.030> for<00:00:49.179> the

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
this is steering mechanism for the

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.829 
this is steering mechanism for the
wheels<00:00:49.480> it's<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.109> little<00:00:50.410> heavy<00:00:50.589> so<00:00:51.579> easy<00:00:52.359> ously

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
wheels it's a little heavy so easy ously

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.840 
wheels it's a little heavy so easy ously
easiest<00:00:53.649> to<00:00:53.800> turn<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.309> wheels<00:00:54.489> when<00:00:54.699> it's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
easiest to turn the wheels when it's

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.989 
easiest to turn the wheels when it's
actually<00:00:55.030> in<00:00:55.269> motion<00:00:56.519> let's<00:00:57.519> show<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:57.760> this

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
actually in motion let's show you this

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:04.560 
actually in motion let's show you this
thing<00:00:58.179> in<00:00:58.329> action

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.050 

the<00:01:05.080> controls<00:01:05.470> are<00:01:05.560> all<00:01:05.710> here<00:01:06.450> between<00:01:07.450> these

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the controls are all here between these

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.630 
the controls are all here between these
power<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.740> these<00:01:11.740> three<00:01:11.979> switches

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.550 

I<00:01:16.640> didn't<00:01:17.570> put<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.810> stickers<00:01:18.170> because<00:01:18.380> i

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
I didn't put the stickers because i

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.640 
I didn't put the stickers because i
don't<00:01:18.710> like<00:01:18.770> stickers<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.170> not<00:01:21.170> really<00:01:21.350> sure

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
don't like stickers so not really sure

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.070 
don't like stickers so not really sure
which<00:01:21.830> one<00:01:22.040> goes<00:01:22.160> what<00:01:22.600> let's<00:01:23.600> start<00:01:23.720> with<00:01:23.900> the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
which one goes what let's start with the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.060 
which one goes what let's start with the
winch<00:01:24.320> why<00:01:24.530> don't<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:24.740> come<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.979> this

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.050 

the<00:01:30.550> winch<00:01:30.760> is<00:01:30.940> slow<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:32.500> work<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:35.140> sit

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the winch is slow but work not sit

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.800 
the winch is slow but work not sit
that's<00:01:37.060> going<00:01:37.270> down<00:01:37.360> there's<00:01:37.990> coming<00:01:38.229> up<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
that's going down there's coming up so

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:51.080 
that's going down there's coming up so
they<00:01:40.960> said<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.350> winch<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.650> slow<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.560> powerful

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.779 

of<00:01:51.630> course<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.170> switch<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.890> power<00:01:53.219> to<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
of course I switch the power to the

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.749 
of course I switch the power to the
other<00:01:53.939> direction<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.840> will<00:01:54.960> lower<00:01:58.759> other

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
other direction it will lower other

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.130 
other direction it will lower other
things<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.179> I<00:02:00.359> can<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:01.670> are<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:03.359> rotate<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
things that I can do are to rotate the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.219 
things that I can do are to rotate the
crane<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:05.359> think<00:02:06.359> it's<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.719> way<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:09.660> way<00:02:09.869> yes

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
crane I think it's this way this way yes

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.990 
crane I think it's this way this way yes
rotate<00:02:11.930> counterclockwise<00:02:12.930> or<00:02:13.709> clockwise

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
rotate counterclockwise or clockwise

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.229 
rotate counterclockwise or clockwise
simply<00:02:15.000> shipping<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:19.040> that's<00:02:20.040> pretty<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
simply shipping this that's pretty and I

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.020 
simply shipping this that's pretty and I
want<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.660> use<00:02:22.019> any<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.610> effects<00:02:23.610> here<00:02:23.790> so

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
want to use any of the effects here so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.830 
want to use any of the effects here so
this<00:02:24.269> one<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:25.190> tied<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.970> pneumatic

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
this one is tied to this pneumatic

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.839 
this one is tied to this pneumatic
system<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:29.160> one<00:02:29.430> tied<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:31.250> one<00:02:32.250> over<00:02:32.489> here

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
system this one tied to one over here

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.569 
system this one tied to one over here
and<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.959> third<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.380> type<00:02:34.620> 2<00:02:34.799> bit<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.549> go

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
and the third one type 2 bit so if I go

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.920 
and the third one type 2 bit so if I go
push<00:02:36.329> it<00:02:36.480> up<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.840> should<00:02:37.019> raise<00:02:37.370> push<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.549> up

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
push it up it should raise push this up

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.539 
push it up it should raise push this up
raise<00:02:39.930> some<00:02:40.110> more<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.069> one<00:02:41.280> should

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
raise some more and this one should

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.360 
raise some more and this one should
close<00:02:42.709> if<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.890> look<00:02:44.040> closely<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.110> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
close if you look closely here this is a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.490 
close if you look closely here this is a
rubber<00:02:47.370> view<00:02:47.610> pieces<00:02:48.030> better<00:02:48.959> for<00:02:49.200> picking

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
rubber view pieces better for picking

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.819 
rubber view pieces better for picking
stuff<00:02:49.680> up<00:02:49.829> with<00:02:51.829> it's<00:02:52.829> not<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:55.440> pneumatic

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
stuff up with it's not the pneumatic

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.550 
stuff up with it's not the pneumatic
system<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.370> very<00:02:56.819> powerful<00:02:57.389> and<00:02:57.600> as<00:02:58.170> you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
system is not very powerful and as you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.259 
system is not very powerful and as you
know<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.889> pneumatic<00:02:59.250> systems<00:02:59.639> and<00:02:59.790> Lego<00:03:00.060> is

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
know the pneumatic systems and Lego is

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.410 
know the pneumatic systems and Lego is
either<00:03:00.420> pump<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.470> full<00:03:01.500> air<00:03:01.889> or<00:03:02.250> let<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.519> out<00:03:02.730> so

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
either pump it full air or let it out so

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.020 
either pump it full air or let it out so
if<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.959> let<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.739> out<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.459> kind<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.790> drops

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
if you let it out it kind of drops

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.400 
if you let it out it kind of drops
really<00:03:06.359> quickly

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.310 

it's<00:03:14.300> pretty<00:03:15.300> strong<00:03:15.660> grip<00:03:17.930> but<00:03:18.930> not<00:03:19.140> very

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
it's pretty strong grip but not very
