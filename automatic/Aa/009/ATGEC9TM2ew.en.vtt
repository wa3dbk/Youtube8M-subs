 there another way if you do not have the applicator 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.580
 what they can do is they take some 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.920
 cotton balls do the solution 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.990

 replaces astringent or tonic 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.929
 trick number two this is for when 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.670

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.380
 that and they take it 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.259
 and that mixture is very very good otherwise 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.670
 what they can do is fill a glass 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.220
 half water and half vinegar and what 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.250
 what they do is they put it on and they do it 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.980
 you gargle them and they keep it 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.280
 in his throat and then he is thrown out 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.799
 they will not take it but well it's not going 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.810
 to spend nothing if they take it but it's not 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.150
 good to take so many amounts of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.730
 vinegar then there is that was the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.720
