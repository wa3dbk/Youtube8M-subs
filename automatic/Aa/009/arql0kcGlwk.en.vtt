00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.290 

it's<00:03:20.020> going<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.260> be<00:03:20.350> released<00:03:20.770> from<00:03:21.760> what<00:03:22.150> I've

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
it's going to be released from what I've

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.130 
it's going to be released from what I've
seen<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:23.080> xbox<00:03:23.440> 360<00:03:23.980> ps3<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:25.380> pc<00:03:26.520> which<00:03:27.520> i

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
seen the xbox 360 ps3 and pc which i

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.250 
seen the xbox 360 ps3 and pc which i
think<00:03:29.140> does<00:03:29.500> those<00:03:30.069> three<00:03:30.400> if<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:31.200> ps3<00:03:32.200> I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
think does those three if not ps3 I

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.360 
think does those three if not ps3 I
don't<00:03:32.440> think<00:03:32.590> would<00:03:32.680> be<00:03:32.770> really<00:03:32.800> good<00:03:33.160> on<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
don't think would be really good on the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.240 
don't think would be really good on the
PSA<00:03:33.790> but<00:03:34.180> some<00:03:35.110> people<00:03:35.440> I've<00:03:35.530> seen<00:03:35.770> like<00:03:35.980> if<00:03:36.160> it

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
PSA but some people I've seen like if it

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.090 
PSA but some people I've seen like if it
comes<00:03:36.430> out<00:03:36.550> for<00:03:36.760> ps3<00:03:36.940> not<00:03:37.510> 360<00:03:38.050> hitter<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.530> to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
comes out for ps3 not 360 hitter of to

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.540 
comes out for ps3 not 360 hitter of to
sell<00:03:39.340> their<00:03:39.490> 360<00:03:39.970> in<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.150> heartbeat<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:41.550> here

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
sell their 360 in the heartbeat so here

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:51.380 
sell their 360 in the heartbeat so here
is<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.880> button<00:03:43.090> layout<00:03:43.980> hold<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.100> you<00:03:45.610> see

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.540 

but<00:03:51.960> I<00:03:51.990> think<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.319> one<00:03:52.590> could<00:03:52.620> be<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.069> really

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
but I think this one could be a really

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.240 
but I think this one could be a really
good<00:03:53.790> game<00:03:54.000> if<00:03:54.330> they<00:03:54.540> head<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.920> those<00:03:56.040> guys

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
good game if they head so those guys

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
good game if they head so those guys
having<00:03:56.610> bottomed<00:03:56.910> out<00:03:58.700> here's<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.850> galactic

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
having bottomed out here's a galactic

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.970 
having bottomed out here's a galactic
conquest<00:04:00.569> mode<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:03.120> lexical<00:04:03.780> Republic<00:04:04.200> it

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
conquest mode the lexical Republic it

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.680 
conquest mode the lexical Republic it
sounds<00:04:05.400> like<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.870> Republic<00:04:07.800> Republic<00:04:08.430> air

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
sounds like the Republic Republic air

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.560 
sounds like the Republic Republic air
because<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.890> Republic<00:04:11.400> weren't<00:04:12.060> called<00:04:12.420> the
