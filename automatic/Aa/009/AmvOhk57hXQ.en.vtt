gift card holder part you can see it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.350 
gift card holder part you can see it
right<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> always<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.150> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
right there and I always just like to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.330 
right there and I always just like to
flip<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.840> cardstock<00:01:10.470> over<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> make<00:01:11.130> sure

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
flip the cardstock over and make sure

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.830 
flip the cardstock over and make sure
that<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.640> cut<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> way<00:01:12.510> through

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that that's cut all the way through

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
that that's cut all the way through
before<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.619> take<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> die<00:01:14.010> off<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
before I take the die off because I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.219 
before I take the die off because I
could<00:01:14.580> always<00:01:14.700> run<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> through<00:01:15.119> again

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
could always run it through again

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.120 
could always run it through again
usually<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.409> didn't<00:01:16.650> cut<00:01:16.770> through<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
usually if it didn't cut through is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.590 
usually if it didn't cut through is
probably<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> whole<00:01:18.090> paper<00:01:18.299> piece

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
probably because the whole paper piece

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.359 
probably because the whole paper piece
I'm<00:01:18.810> about<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> pop<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:20.009> still<00:01:20.220> in

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
I'm about to pop out that was still in

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.100 
I'm about to pop out that was still in
your<00:01:20.490> die<00:01:20.640> from<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> last<00:01:21.450> time<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> cut<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
your die from the last time you cut it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
your die from the last time you cut it
so<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.950> ever<00:01:23.100> find<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> doesn't<00:01:23.880> cut

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so if you ever find that it doesn't cut

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.160 
so if you ever find that it doesn't cut
through<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.390> probably<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.869> need<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
through it's probably you just need to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440 
through it's probably you just need to
clean<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> die<00:01:25.850> now<00:01:26.850> although<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.180> may<00:01:27.390> be

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
clean the die now although you may be

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.819 
clean the die now although you may be
looking<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> shape<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
looking at the shape of this and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.770 
looking at the shape of this and
thinking<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.189> looks<00:01:29.369> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.640> space<00:01:29.909> age<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
thinking it looks kind of space age and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.569 
thinking it looks kind of space age and
you<00:01:31.409> know<00:01:31.439> complicated<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.189> really<00:01:32.250> not

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
you know complicated it's really not

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.249 
you know complicated it's really not
it's<00:01:32.850> actually<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.450> simple<00:01:33.659> box<00:01:33.930> pop-up
