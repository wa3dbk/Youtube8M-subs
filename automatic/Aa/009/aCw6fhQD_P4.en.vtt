levels and stuff that you gotta go
through<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.800> base<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> idea<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> game<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
through the base the idea the game is to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.810 
through the base the idea the game is to
jump<00:00:56.930> as<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.399> when<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> push<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
jump as you can see when you push the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.160 
jump as you can see when you push the
button<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.120> jump<00:01:00.359> once<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.870> as<00:01:01.020> well

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
button you jump once more as well

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
button you jump once more as well
obviously<00:01:01.410> he's<00:01:01.920> jumping<00:01:02.340> all<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.609> time

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
obviously he's jumping all the time

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.980 
obviously he's jumping all the time
anyway<00:01:04.970> nation<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.570> were<00:01:06.659> obviously

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
anyway nation and they were obviously

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.690 
anyway nation and they were obviously
the<00:01:07.200> idea<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> Sonic<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> collect<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the idea of Sonic is to collect the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.950 
the idea of Sonic is to collect the
Rings<00:01:09.049> kill<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.290> people<00:01:12.080> like<00:01:13.080> so

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
Rings kill the little people like so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.260 
Rings kill the little people like so
I've<00:01:15.960> got<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.220> pound<00:01:17.520> 49<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
I've got to say it's one pound 49 in the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.289 
I've got to say it's one pound 49 in the
App<00:01:18.450> Store<00:01:19.490> if<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.640> could<00:01:20.790> go<00:01:20.909> back<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:21.270> now

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
App Store if I could go back right now

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
App Store if I could go back right now
and<00:01:21.509> get<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.990> powerful<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.530> I'm
