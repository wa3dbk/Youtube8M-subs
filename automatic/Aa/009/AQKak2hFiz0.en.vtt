this is a refresher we're going to go
ahead<00:00:01.860> and<00:00:01.949> put<00:00:02.159> our<00:00:02.190> stencils<00:00:02.730> down<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.950> think

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
ahead and put our stencils down I think

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.390 
ahead and put our stencils down I think
I<00:00:05.069> want<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.540> make<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> colorful<00:00:06.930> sky<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.740> mean

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
I want to make a colorful sky I mean

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.110 
I want to make a colorful sky I mean
with<00:00:08.550> basic<00:00:09.059> since<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.510> mean<00:00:09.719> spacing<00:00:10.080> Reese<00:00:11.120> so

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
with basic since I mean spacing Reese so

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.900 
with basic since I mean spacing Reese so
let's<00:00:12.360> go<00:00:12.480> ahead<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.660> start<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.080> sky<00:00:13.380> huh

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
let's go ahead and start on that sky huh

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.770 
let's go ahead and start on that sky huh
think<00:00:14.910> i'm<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.210> add<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> little<00:00:15.450> bit<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
think i'm going to add a little bit of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:26.750 
think i'm going to add a little bit of
blue<00:00:18.410> you<00:00:19.410> know<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.740> some<00:00:20.699> green<00:00:25.580> you<00:00:26.580> guys

blue you know what some green you guys

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.019 
blue you know what some green you guys
remember<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.330> from<00:00:27.510> DVD<00:00:27.900> number<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.349> right

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
remember this from DVD number one right

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.639 
remember this from DVD number one right
is<00:00:30.029> how<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.269> create<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.840> auras<00:00:33.469> so<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
is how you create the auras so with a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.819 
is how you create the auras so with a
little<00:00:34.739> bit<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.100> orange<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:37.680> what

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
little bit of orange and you know what

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.229 
little bit of orange and you know what
I'm<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.070> provoke<00:00:38.399> brown<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.940> top<00:00:38.969> of

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I'm going to provoke brown on top of

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
I'm going to provoke brown on top of
that<00:00:41.120> it's<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:43.410> will<00:00:43.590> help<00:00:43.710> you

that it's like so this will help you
with<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> texture<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.430> go

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
with the texture and I'm going to go

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.010 
with the texture and I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> put<00:00:48.149> black<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.600> top<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
ahead and put black on top of that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.540 
ahead and put black on top of that
remember<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.680> want<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.070> more<00:00:50.340> than

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
remember you don't want to do more than

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.240 
remember you don't want to do more than
three<00:00:50.820> colors<00:00:51.590> what<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> mean<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
three colors what I mean with the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310 
three colors what I mean with the
chemical<00:00:53.670> reaction<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.420> you'll<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
chemical reaction is that you'll get a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
chemical reaction is that you'll get a
gray<00:00:55.680> pasty<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:58.550> it'll<00:00:59.550> start<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> bubble

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
gray pasty like or it'll start to bubble

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.569 
gray pasty like or it'll start to bubble
a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.050> crack<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> mean

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
a little bit in crack that's what I mean

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.719 
a little bit in crack that's what I mean
I've<00:01:02.730> had<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.420> comments<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> web

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
I've had a lot of comments on the web

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.770 
I've had a lot of comments on the web
people<00:01:05.729> thinking<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.240> meant<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.689> know

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
people thinking that I meant you know

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.320 
people thinking that I meant you know
like<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> dangerous<00:01:07.350> chemical<00:01:07.830> reaction<00:01:08.549> no<00:01:09.150> no

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
like a dangerous chemical reaction no no

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
like a dangerous chemical reaction no no
no<00:01:09.450> guys<00:01:09.630> there's<00:01:09.869> nothing<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.470> is

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
no guys there's nothing like that is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.030 
no guys there's nothing like that is
just<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.960> paint<00:01:13.229> does<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.770> small

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
just the the paint does have a small

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.499 
just the the paint does have a small
chemical<00:01:14.310> reaction<00:01:14.939> where<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
chemical reaction where it just it

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
chemical reaction where it just it
creates<00:01:15.960> different<00:01:16.290> effects<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.009> unwanted

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
creates different effects that unwanted

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.570 
creates different effects that unwanted
effects<00:01:19.220> that's<00:01:20.220> why<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> mean<00:01:20.759> by<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
effects that's why I mean by that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.649 
effects that's why I mean by that
nothing<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.909> kill<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.299> don't<00:01:24.479> think

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
nothing that can kill you I don't think

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.170 
nothing that can kill you I don't think
so<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.650> don't<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> worry<00:01:26.189> about<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.549> all

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
so you don't have to worry about it all

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.050 
so you don't have to worry about it all
right<00:01:27.270> let's<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:29.040> planet<00:01:29.460> avenue<00:01:29.790> i<00:01:29.880> want

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
right let's go this planet avenue i want

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.740 
right let's go this planet avenue i want
to<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.210> red<00:01:31.670> now<00:01:32.670> i<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.909> i'm<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.509> showing

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
to make red now i know i'm not showing

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.749 
to make red now i know i'm not showing
too<00:01:33.930> much<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.439> planet<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.340> okay

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
too much on this planet but that's okay

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
too much on this planet but that's okay
I<00:01:35.970> did<00:01:36.630> say<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> want<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> dark<00:01:37.460> planet<00:01:39.110> okay<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
I did say I want a dark planet okay I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.080 
I did say I want a dark planet okay I
went<00:01:40.530> ahead<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.740> put<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.009> orange<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.729> top<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
went ahead and put some orange on top of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.130 
went ahead and put some orange on top of
that<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.610> I<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:45.299> that'll<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.840> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that and I think that'll be it for that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.010 
that and I think that'll be it for that
I<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.320> I'll<00:01:46.590> cover<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.130> black<00:01:48.020> not

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I think I'll cover that with black not

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.679 
I think I'll cover that with black not
too<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:49.439> black<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.130> light<00:01:50.329> layer<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
too much black just a light layer of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.850 
too much black just a light layer of
black<00:01:53.420> okay<00:01:54.710> now<00:01:55.710> let's<00:01:56.040> create<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.909> texture

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
black okay now let's create that texture

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.710 
black okay now let's create that texture
just<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.310> good

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
just like so good

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.750 
just like so good
now<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.860> forget<00:02:01.980> we<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.520> add<00:02:02.640> our

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
now don't forget we have to add our

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.370 
now don't forget we have to add our
shadow<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:05.540> just<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:06.810> I'm<00:02:06.930> covering

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
shadow to it just like so I'm covering

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.440 
shadow to it just like so I'm covering
most<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> planets<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:09.060> guys<00:02:09.210> can

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
most of the planets I know you guys can

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.810 
most of the planets I know you guys can
tell<00:02:10.040> we're<00:02:11.040> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> wait<00:02:11.370> for<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.700> dry

you're<00:04:45.330> painting<00:04:45.630> dry<00:04:45.870> sand<00:04:46.169> continue

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
you're painting dry sand continue

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.580 
you're painting dry sand continue
painting<00:04:46.949> after<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:48.320> in<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.620> case<00:04:51.590> see

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
painting after that in this case see

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.150 
painting after that in this case see
we're<00:04:52.740> just<00:04:52.770> adding<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.460> texture<00:04:53.880> afterwards

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
we're just adding the texture afterwards

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.270 
we're just adding the texture afterwards
so<00:04:56.160> we're<00:04:56.340> not<00:04:56.550> we<00:04:56.729> don't<00:04:56.760> have<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.260> pre<00:04:58.280> put

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
so we're not we don't have to pre put

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.980 
so we're not we don't have to pre put
the<00:04:59.430> black<00:04:59.669> on<00:04:59.940> here<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.270> then<00:05:00.419> remove<00:05:00.780> it

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
the black on here and then remove it

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.200 
the black on here and then remove it
with<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.229> magazine<00:05:01.650> treat<00:05:01.830> we<00:05:01.919> can<00:05:02.070> actually

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
with the magazine treat we can actually

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.610 
with the magazine treat we can actually
wait<00:05:03.210> until<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.690> part<00:05:03.930> is<00:05:04.020> dry<00:05:04.229> and<00:05:04.289> then<00:05:04.500> we

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
wait until that part is dry and then we

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.010 
wait until that part is dry and then we
can<00:05:04.770> add<00:05:04.800> some<00:05:05.610> colors<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.240> this<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:06.990> a

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
can add some colors and this is a

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.430 
can add some colors and this is a
technique<00:05:07.260> I'll<00:05:07.530> get<00:05:07.740> more<00:05:07.950> into<00:05:09.380> show<00:05:10.380> you

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
technique I'll get more into show you

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.710 
technique I'll get more into show you

seeing<00:05:56.219> the<00:05:56.339> same<00:05:56.490> sense<00:05:56.759> I<00:05:56.879> also<00:05:56.969> see<00:05:57.179> blue

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.540 

and<00:06:03.110> of<00:06:04.110> course<00:06:04.139> well<00:06:04.649> because<00:06:04.979> its<00:06:05.159> water<00:06:05.369> you

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
and of course well because its water you

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.529 
and of course well because its water you
have<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.759> add<00:06:05.879> a<00:06:05.909> little<00:06:06.089> bit<00:06:06.209> more<00:06:06.389> of<00:06:06.449> that

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
have to add a little bit more of that

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.689 
have to add a little bit more of that
but<00:06:07.499> ask<00:06:07.649> to<00:06:07.709> see<00:06:07.860> green<00:06:08.099> so<00:06:08.339> make<00:06:08.490> sure<00:06:08.520> you

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
but ask to see green so make sure you

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:15.980 
but ask to see green so make sure you
get<00:06:08.789> a<00:06:08.849> little<00:06:08.969> bit<00:06:09.149> between<00:06:13.219> like<00:06:14.219> a<00:06:14.249> you<00:06:14.990> like

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
get a little bit between like a you like

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.339 
get a little bit between like a you like
so<00:06:16.199> and<00:06:16.409> then<00:06:16.439> begin<00:06:17.399> creating<00:06:17.869> the<00:06:18.869> ripples

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
so and then begin creating the ripples

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.179 
so and then begin creating the ripples
on<00:06:19.499> the<00:06:19.529> ocean<00:06:20.240> the<00:06:21.240> way<00:06:21.360> you<00:06:21.419> do<00:06:21.599> that<00:06:21.809> just

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
on the ocean the way you do that just

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:35.930 
on the ocean the way you do that just
back<00:06:23.189> and<00:06:23.369> forth<00:06:24.289> see<00:06:25.289> just<00:06:26.219> like<00:06:26.339> so

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.940 

it's<00:06:36.390> not<00:06:36.540> realistic<00:06:36.810> that<00:06:37.200> looks<00:06:37.440> looks

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
it's not realistic that looks looks

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.800 
it's not realistic that looks looks
great<00:06:38.190> doesn't<00:06:38.370> it<00:06:38.610> because<00:06:39.270> you're<00:06:39.420> mixing

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
great doesn't it because you're mixing

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.200 
great doesn't it because you're mixing
the<00:06:39.930> bottom<00:06:40.260> colors<00:06:40.620> with<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.490> top<00:06:41.790> colors

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
the bottom colors with the top colors

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.150 
the bottom colors with the top colors
and<00:06:42.390> then<00:06:42.840> you're<00:06:43.140> leaving<00:06:43.350> a<00:06:43.590> little<00:06:43.890> bit<00:06:44.040> of

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
and then you're leaving a little bit of

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.580 
and then you're leaving a little bit of
those<00:06:44.310> top<00:06:44.610> colors<00:06:45.030> which<00:06:45.870> makes<00:06:46.140> it<00:06:46.320> look

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
those top colors which makes it look

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.970 
those top colors which makes it look
like<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:47.160> sky<00:06:47.430> is<00:06:47.460> actually<00:06:48.030> reflecting<00:06:48.630> them

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
like the sky is actually reflecting them

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.250 
like the sky is actually reflecting them
on<00:06:49.980> the<00:06:50.130> waves<00:06:53.330> great<00:06:54.330> you<00:06:54.870> want<00:06:55.020> to<00:06:55.110> keep

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 
on the waves great you want to keep

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:03.540 
on the waves great you want to keep
doing

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:13.450 

let's<00:07:04.550> take<00:07:04.670> a<00:07:04.700> look<00:07:04.970> up<00:07:10.870> perfect<00:07:11.870> now<00:07:12.560> we<00:07:12.920> can

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
let's take a look up perfect now we can

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.040 
let's take a look up perfect now we can
always<00:07:13.670> cover<00:07:14.090> those<00:07:14.330> planets<00:07:14.750> up<00:07:14.900> with<00:07:15.020> a

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
always cover those planets up with a

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:22.330 
always cover those planets up with a
little<00:07:15.260> more<00:07:16.120> gray<00:07:17.120> and<00:07:18.110> white<00:07:21.040> so<00:07:22.040> it<00:07:22.070> makes

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.340 
little more gray and white so it makes

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.070 
little more gray and white so it makes
it<00:07:22.460> look<00:07:22.670> like<00:07:22.730> a<00:07:22.910> planet<00:07:23.390> it's<00:07:23.720> in<00:07:23.960> the

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
it look like a planet it's in the

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.760 
it look like a planet it's in the
background<00:07:28.720> yeah<00:07:29.720> so<00:07:30.140> we'll<00:07:30.320> do<00:07:30.500> something

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770 
background yeah so we'll do something

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:37.180 
background yeah so we'll do something
like<00:07:30.890> that<00:07:34.840> and<00:07:35.840> a<00:07:36.380> little<00:07:36.530> bit<00:07:36.830> of<00:07:36.890> white<00:07:37.160> on

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
like that and a little bit of white on

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.880 
like that and a little bit of white on
top<00:07:37.460> of<00:07:37.640> that<00:07:37.730> now<00:07:38.330> by<00:07:39.200> now<00:07:39.380> I<00:07:39.440> believe<00:07:39.650> you

top of that now by now I believe you
guys<00:07:40.010> have<00:07:40.250> better<00:07:40.400> control<00:07:40.610> of<00:07:40.790> your<00:07:40.970> spray

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240
