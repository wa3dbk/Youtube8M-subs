00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 as you could see in the title 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.870
 of this video we will talk about vpn and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.490
 I imagine that five seconds from the video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.480
 there are some who are already dumped what is this 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.340
 what is a vpn 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.870
 so this is an abbreviation that you have 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.969
 could understand it I imagine who means 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.960
 virtual private network so for 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.099
 understand that you have to understand the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.020
 principle of the ip address 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.789
 in fact every device that can 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.680
 connect to the internet your mac included 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.090
 has what's called an ip address 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.800
 I imagine that some have already heard 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.560
 talk about this thing so it's kind 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.840
 passport to go on the internet and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.189
 thanks to this ip address and ben internet 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.320
 can know a lot about you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 for example your location what 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.950
 you do and that's for example if I 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.480
 go to my location point org 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.070
 well, who can I come to 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.040
 find in brussels or not far in all 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 case and it has my ip address mama latitude 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 the longitude and these voices there it can 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.980
 to make a little flipper and that's where the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.020
 vpn then comes basic when you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.070
 connect to the internet and your computer 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.039
 connect to the internet 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.930
 no problem is internet shop wants 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.699
 very dissipated and can know a lot of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 things about you with a vpn 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.840
 it's a little different actually 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.039
 your mac will first connect to a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.329
 intermediate what's called a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.220
 server whose who is if you want a 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.900
 another computer that is at a 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.210
 other place in the world no matter 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.130
 where and that there is another ip address and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.729
 this intermediary will connect him to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.439
 Internet 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.450
 so what are they seeing 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.790
 he sees the location and ip address 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.229
 of the intermediary is not you and the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.600
 blow he can no longer follow what you 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.159
 made on the internet while services 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.810
 vpn you have it on the call there are some 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.100
 free of charge from the top performers 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.479
 ultra secure everything you want 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.829
 me in this video I simply 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.960
 show you one that has the merit of 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.610
 already work they free super 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.840
 simple to set up but if you 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.070
 have others that you know that 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.420
 find you better than this one 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.770
 do not hesitate to really leave a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.200
 little comment with a link for 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.640
 go put up this little vpn that in 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.009
 will benefit all who will watch 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.090
 this video ok it's gone then this 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.350
 we will start by doing series in 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.579
 system preferences simply 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.500
 no need to download application 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.600
 nothing at all we'll just go in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.600
 the justice network menu is there we go 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.040
 add a new vpn network 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.750
 so you see by the way that it's 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 completely legal otherwise apple does it 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.369
 would not put in osx so too 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.360
 obvious you can call it as you 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.280
 want that we do not care I want the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.990
 leave it like that l2tp or so we go 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.479
 call it rather vpn gates since it's 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.989
 the vpn service we will use 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.150
 here are epn gates and we will go on 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.349
 the site of april Mr. Gates is actually a 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.549
 service that was created by a 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.349
 japanese university 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.420
 so it's still a minimum 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.670
 seriously and we'll go if in the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.980
 column you have l2tp ip sec 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.450
 here with mac by passing from elsewhere and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.560
 iphone also by the way so if you 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.209
 want to set up this little vpn on 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.730
 your iphone just go into the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.410
 general tab settings then vpn and you 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.579
 do added a vpn and you do 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.739
 everything we will do here on your 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.690
 iphone so we'll go down until 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.280
 we have one 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.750
 here is perfect then served 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.280
 French good it will not be great for all 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.120
 those who are in France necessarily but 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.160
 I remind you that I am in 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.129
 belgium so it can be interesting 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.720
 I'm going to copy this address because 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.430
 yes the countries that you see right here in 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.079
 do it's the countries in which your 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.069
 ferrets believe that you are so me I 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.069
 so let's pretend I'm in 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.299
 France so I copy this address and I 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.709
 will paste it as addresses of 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.530
 servers and then 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.950
 here we are going to type vpn as we are going 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.540
 go to settings 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.760
 authentication we will put 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.489
 new vpn as password and 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.769
 new vpn as shared secret it's 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.900
 not ultra complicated to remember we go here 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.970
 also go ahead we'll check 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.480
 that all these boxes are ticked the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.010
 three right here we do ok we're going to display 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.540
 the vpn state in the menu bar this will be 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.549
 much simpler afterwards and 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.069
 finally we will apply like those 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.349
 here and connect and we will wait 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.329
 that he connects 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.099
 this is my little vpn is connected then 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.870
 I will be able to connect it offline 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.700
 right here in the menu bar and 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.139
 then well we'll go back on 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.459
 miles kane point org 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.380
 so you remember that I was at 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.109
 brussels we'll just reload the page 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.730
 to see what that tells us now 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.169
 and bingo I find myself supposed to 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.940
 roubaix which is in the north no 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.040
 calais in france etc 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.349
 so obviously I have not moved from my 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.239
 room but that's the principle of 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.829
 vpn and so I will be able to surf on 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.700
 internet by making believe that I 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.379
 find another place 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.950
 it can be extremely interesting 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.150
 for all that is wi fi an audience if 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.040
 you use a wifi in a 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.930
 university or a mac do or something like 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.730
 it's really interesting because 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.799
 that in fact there is way very easily 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.400
 to hack your computer via a wifi 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.410
 public so 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.759
 it's always good to know if 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.389
 you are in a country where there are 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.859
 censorship 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.239
 for example I have a few cases in Iran 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.660
 he can not use instagram this is 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.039
 censorship 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.300
 well, he'll be able 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.759
 use it by pretending they are 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.990
 find in roubaix for example 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.610
 that's it for this video so for info 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.860
 the type of vpn that we used in 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.240
 this video is called the l2tp it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.560
 requires no apps like you 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.020
 have been able to see it there is another 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.880
 system that is open vpn that is 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.080
 really safer if you want 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.310
 that I make a video do not hesitate to 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.600
 leave a little comment and then I 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.090
 remember that if you have other 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.289
 vpn systems that are better in your opinion 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.030
 do not hesitate to leave them in 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.840
 comment on this month I tell you to 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.610
