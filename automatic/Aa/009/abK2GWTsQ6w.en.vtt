00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.680 
of the things I've noticed about all the
electric<00:01:42.220> bike<00:01:42.400> riders<00:01:42.759> particularly<00:01:43.299> pedigo

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
electric bike riders particularly pedigo

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.749 
electric bike riders particularly pedigo
people<00:01:44.140> there<00:01:44.650> are<00:01:44.680> all<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.950> nicest<00:01:45.460> people

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
people there are all the nicest people

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.010 
people there are all the nicest people
in<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.850> world<00:01:45.909> we<00:01:46.240> don't<00:01:46.420> we've<00:01:46.570> never<00:01:46.750> had<00:01:46.960> a

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
in the world we don't we've never had a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.600 
in the world we don't we've never had a
customer<00:01:47.259> that<00:01:47.470> wasn't<00:01:47.860> just<00:01:48.009> super<00:01:48.250> nice<00:01:48.399> I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
customer that wasn't just super nice I

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.340 
customer that wasn't just super nice I
think<00:01:48.909> we<00:01:49.090> got<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.390> potential<00:01:49.720> here<00:01:50.020> with<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
think we got the potential here with the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.109 
think we got the potential here with the
first<00:01:50.590> group<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.190> pedigo<00:01:51.580> owners<00:01:51.850> group<00:01:52.030> I

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
first group of the pedigo owners group I

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.029 
first group of the pedigo owners group I
think<00:01:52.149> we<00:01:52.390> can<00:01:52.540> see<00:01:52.690> these<00:01:52.810> clubs<00:01:53.110> opening<00:01:53.920> all

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039
