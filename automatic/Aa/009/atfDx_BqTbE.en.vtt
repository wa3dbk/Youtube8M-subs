here I'm using a needle and thread to
secure<00:01:57.250> parts<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.789> braided<00:01:58.119> cord<00:01:58.330> that

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
secure parts of the braided cord that

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:59.820 
secure parts of the braided cord that
might<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.869> been<00:01:58.929> loose<00:01:59.170> or<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.560> look<00:01:59.740> a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
might have been loose or that look a

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.889 
might have been loose or that look a
little<00:01:59.920> compromised<00:02:00.690> technically<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:01.780> could

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
little compromised technically you could

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.690 
little compromised technically you could
easily<00:02:02.140> do<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:02.619> with<00:02:02.679> a<00:02:02.860> fabric<00:02:03.159> or<00:02:03.459> hot<00:02:03.670> glue

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
easily do this with a fabric or hot glue

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.190 
easily do this with a fabric or hot glue
but<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.209> prefer<00:02:04.569> to<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:06.030> once<00:02:07.030> that's<00:02:07.270> done<00:02:07.600> use

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
but I prefer to so once that's done use

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.229 
but I prefer to so once that's done use
some<00:02:08.440> pins<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.950> temporarily<00:02:09.489> secure<00:02:09.880> your

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
some pins to temporarily secure your

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.789 
some pins to temporarily secure your
embroidered<00:02:10.750> ribbon<00:02:11.019> around<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.440> braided

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
embroidered ribbon around the braided

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.520 
embroidered ribbon around the braided
edge<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.310> liked<00:02:12.970> my<00:02:13.150> ribbon<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.690> much<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.140> decided

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
edge I liked my ribbon so much I decided

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.620 
edge I liked my ribbon so much I decided
to<00:02:14.739> use<00:02:14.890> my<00:02:15.099> glue<00:02:15.310> gun<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.580> secure<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.239> onto<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
to use my glue gun to secure it onto the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.720 
to use my glue gun to secure it onto the
snood<00:02:16.930> because<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:17.680> didn't<00:02:17.980> want<00:02:18.160> my<00:02:18.280> clumsy

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
snood because I didn't want my clumsy

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.640 
snood because I didn't want my clumsy
sewing<00:02:19.090> stitches<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.900> detract<00:02:20.260> from<00:02:20.410> its

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
sewing stitches to detract from its

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.910 
sewing stitches to detract from its
pretty<00:02:20.920> pattern<00:02:25.049> again<00:02:26.049> I<00:02:26.290> use<00:02:26.470> my<00:02:26.500> glue<00:02:26.890> gun

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
pretty pattern again I use my glue gun

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.559 
pretty pattern again I use my glue gun
when<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.370> came<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.700> attaching<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.269> pearls

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
when it came to attaching the pearls

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.750 
when it came to attaching the pearls
sewing<00:02:29.470> them<00:02:29.620> on<00:02:29.739> would<00:02:29.920> probably<00:02:30.430> be<00:02:30.549> more

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
sewing them on would probably be more

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.580 
sewing them on would probably be more
secure<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.480> chose<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.810> cheat<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.350> do<00:02:32.470> it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
secure but I chose to cheat and do it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.970 
secure but I chose to cheat and do it
the<00:02:32.680> fast<00:02:32.920> way

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.590 

lastly<00:02:38.980> attach<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.700> combs<00:02:39.910> with<00:02:40.180> some<00:02:40.390> hot

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
lastly attach the combs with some hot

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.960 
lastly attach the combs with some hot
glue<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.080> inside<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.740> snood<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.220> chose

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
glue on the inside of the snood I chose

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.760 
glue on the inside of the snood I chose
to<00:02:43.150> use<00:02:43.270> only<00:02:43.480> three<00:02:43.900> but<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.440> use<00:02:44.620> as

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
to use only three but you can use as

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.210 
to use only three but you can use as
many<00:02:44.920> as<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.190> like<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.590> end<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:48.010> should

many as you like in the end it should

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.050 
many as you like in the end it should
look<00:02:48.430> something<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:50.400> now<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.460> emulate
