better work rate at the high-low

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.080 
better work rate at the high-low
probably<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.470> better<00:05:28.650> finisher<00:05:29.190> Pasha<00:05:29.820> has<00:05:29.970> got

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
probably a better finisher Pasha has got

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.909 
probably a better finisher Pasha has got
a<00:05:30.120> little<00:05:30.330> bit<00:05:30.540> more<00:05:30.690> pace<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:31.530> i<00:05:31.620> would<00:05:31.770> say

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
a little bit more pace and i would say

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.550 
a little bit more pace and i would say
slightly<00:05:32.690> more<00:05:33.690> there<00:05:33.870> will<00:05:33.900> fret<00:05:34.320> so<00:05:34.500> you

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
slightly more there will fret so you

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.200 
slightly more there will fret so you
know<00:05:34.740> whether<00:05:35.039> you<00:05:35.190> prefer<00:05:35.250> this<00:05:35.789> carrera

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
know whether you prefer this carrera

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.850 
know whether you prefer this carrera
though<00:05:36.450> look<00:05:36.810> at<00:05:36.930> this<00:05:37.020> he<00:05:37.169> just<00:05:37.380> all<00:05:37.590> over<00:05:37.620> the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
though look at this he just all over the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.860 
though look at this he just all over the
place<00:05:37.890> he's<00:05:38.250> so<00:05:38.669> hard<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.120> defend<00:05:39.390> against

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
place he's so hard to defend against

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.930 
place he's so hard to defend against
really<00:05:40.560> good<00:05:40.710> shot<00:05:40.890> as<00:05:40.979> well<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.669> squad<00:05:41.880> is

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
really good shot as well the squad is

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.779 
really good shot as well the squad is
very<00:05:42.270> very<00:05:42.360> good<00:05:42.479> very<00:05:43.320> solid<00:05:43.620> in<00:05:43.710> defence<00:05:43.789> the

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
very very good very solid in defence the

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.520 
very very good very solid in defence the
midfield<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.360> absolutely<00:05:45.900> amazing<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.410> the

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
midfield is absolutely amazing and the

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.230 
midfield is absolutely amazing and the
strike<00:05:46.830> was<00:05:47.039> very<00:05:47.400> very<00:05:47.490> good<00:05:47.610> as<00:05:47.729> well<00:05:47.820> the

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
strike was very very good as well the

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.180 
strike was very very good as well the
only<00:05:48.870> problem<00:05:49.110> I<00:05:49.229> have<00:05:49.440> is<00:05:49.650> probably<00:05:50.039> the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
only problem I have is probably the

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.310 
only problem I have is probably the
strikers<00:05:50.640> can<00:05:50.940> be<00:05:51.090> a<00:05:51.120> tad<00:05:51.390> week<00:05:51.690> as<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:52.020> said<00:05:52.169> a

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
strikers can be a tad week as I said a

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.110 
strikers can be a tad week as I said a
lot<00:05:52.470> of<00:05:52.560> onion<00:05:52.860> tin<00:05:53.039> Ian's<00:05:53.250> are<00:05:53.430> usually<00:05:54.090> very

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
lot of onion tin Ian's are usually very

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.940 
lot of onion tin Ian's are usually very
fairly<00:05:54.600> smaller<00:05:54.990> to<00:05:55.200> the<00:05:55.260> average<00:05:55.530> height<00:05:55.740> all

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
fairly smaller to the average height all

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.440 
fairly smaller to the average height all
this<00:05:56.010> team<00:05:56.639> is<00:05:56.789> probably<00:05:57.030> only<00:05:57.120> around<00:05:57.300> about

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
this team is probably only around about

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.520 
this team is probably only around about
58<00:05:57.900> 59<00:05:58.520> so<00:05:59.520> they<00:05:59.700> can<00:05:59.970> be<00:06:00.120> weak<00:06:00.330> but<00:06:00.600> if<00:06:01.169> you<00:06:01.380> can

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
58 59 so they can be weak but if you can

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.900 
58 59 so they can be weak but if you can
just<00:06:01.560> place<00:06:01.889> around<00:06:02.160> them<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.639> can<00:06:02.760> sort

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
just place around them and you can sort

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.550 
just place around them and you can sort
of<00:06:03.030> leave<00:06:03.270> a<00:06:03.300> big<00:06:03.630> gap<00:06:03.870> between<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.350> and<00:06:04.380> an

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
of leave a big gap between you and an

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.500 
of leave a big gap between you and an
offender<00:06:04.919> like<00:06:05.370> I<00:06:05.400> did<00:06:05.610> in<00:06:05.700> this<00:06:05.789> clip<00:06:06.060> then

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
offender like I did in this clip then

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.450 
offender like I did in this clip then
you'll<00:06:06.660> be<00:06:06.810> absolutely<00:06:07.050> fine<00:06:07.500> beating<00:06:08.340> most

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
you'll be absolutely fine beating most

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.460 
you'll be absolutely fine beating most
teams<00:06:08.789> now<00:06:09.510> I<00:06:09.539> say<00:06:09.720> this<00:06:09.900> team<00:06:10.110> comes<00:06:10.289> out<00:06:10.440> very

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
teams now I say this team comes out very

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.980 
teams now I say this team comes out very
well<00:06:10.800> against<00:06:11.010> a<00:06:11.190> maybe<00:06:11.490> 200<00:06:11.910> k<00:06:12.030> BPL<00:06:12.510> it<00:06:12.720> does

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
well against a maybe 200 k BPL it does

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.080 
well against a maybe 200 k BPL it does
struggle<00:06:13.320> against<00:06:13.650> them<00:06:13.889> top<00:06:14.400> top<00:06:14.729> teams

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
struggle against them top top teams

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.870 
struggle against them top top teams
maybe<00:06:15.660> the<00:06:15.870> Aguero's<00:06:16.460> because<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.550> defense

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
maybe the Aguero's because the defense

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.659 
maybe the Aguero's because the defense
is<00:06:18.030> good<00:06:18.270> but<00:06:18.510> it<00:06:18.630> is<00:06:18.660> a<00:06:18.750> little<00:06:19.080> bit<00:06:19.260> fragile

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
is good but it is a little bit fragile
