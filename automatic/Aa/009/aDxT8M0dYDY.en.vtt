00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.710
 I want to write a song 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.710

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.380
 my help has been and forever I will sing 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.140
 I will walk and through the valley of the shadow I will not fear 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.420

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.560
 I will walk, and through the valley of the shadow I will not fear 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.680

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.700
 I will shine 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.880
 I will walk, and through the valley of the shadow I will not fear 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.460
