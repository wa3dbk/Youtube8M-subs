Stravinsky and Mozart the Beethoven is
an<00:00:30.380> extraordinary<00:00:30.830> work<00:00:31.250> because<00:00:31.699> it<00:00:31.820> starts

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
an extraordinary work because it starts

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.030 
an extraordinary work because it starts
out<00:00:32.360> really<00:00:32.690> like<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:32.870> piano<00:00:33.230> concerto

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
out really like a piano concerto

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.580 
out really like a piano concerto
but<00:00:34.580> Beethoven<00:00:35.180> decides<00:00:35.900> that<00:00:36.140> well<00:00:36.350> what<00:00:36.500> he

but Beethoven decides that well what he

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.950 
but Beethoven decides that well what he
really<00:00:36.860> like<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.160> do<00:00:37.309> is<00:00:37.760> end<00:00:38.030> up<00:00:38.180> with<00:00:38.330> voices

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
really like to do is end up with voices

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.799 
really like to do is end up with voices
in<00:00:39.290> that<00:00:39.620> sense<00:00:40.010> it's<00:00:40.370> very<00:00:40.699> like<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.540> ninth

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
in that sense it's very like the ninth

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.320 
in that sense it's very like the ninth
symphony<00:00:42.409> where<00:00:43.339> you<00:00:43.430> have<00:00:43.640> three<00:00:44.120> movements

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
symphony where you have three movements

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.590 
symphony where you have three movements
and<00:00:44.720> then<00:00:44.839> suddenly<00:00:45.140> he<00:00:45.739> bursts<00:00:46.159> into<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:47.150> whole

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
and then suddenly he bursts into a whole

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.229 
and then suddenly he bursts into a whole
new<00:00:48.050> sound<00:00:48.559> world<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.190> with<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.120> other

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
new sound world and with the other

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.540 
new sound world and with the other
similar<00:00:50.989> thing<00:00:51.170> about<00:00:51.350> this<00:00:51.589> piece<00:00:51.920> with<00:00:52.460> the

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
similar thing about this piece with the

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.219 
similar thing about this piece with the
ninth<00:00:52.760> symphony<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.629> in<00:00:53.870> fact<00:00:54.080> they're<00:00:54.199> very

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
ninth symphony is in fact they're very

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.009 
ninth symphony is in fact they're very
tuned<00:00:54.739> he<00:00:55.400> chooses<00:00:56.180> for<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.449> final<00:00:56.809> section

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
tuned he chooses for the final section

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.320

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
which if I play you'll hear the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:12.550 
which if I play you'll hear the
