00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.580 

so<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.300> chapter<00:00:12.330> one<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.960> talked<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
so in chapter one we talked about the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.760 
so in chapter one we talked about the
evolution<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.429> NFC<00:00:15.210> technologies<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.109> now<00:00:16.500> in

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
evolution of NFC technologies and now in

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.290 
evolution of NFC technologies and now in
Chapter<00:00:17.190> two<00:00:17.430> we're<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> talk<00:00:18.119> about

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
Chapter two we're going to talk about

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.269 
Chapter two we're going to talk about
two<00:00:18.840> types<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.289> technology<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> secure

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
two types of technology the secure

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.420 
two types of technology the secure
element<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.880> host<00:00:21.449> card<00:00:21.840> emulation<00:00:22.369> okay<00:00:23.369> so

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
element and host card emulation okay so

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.990 
element and host card emulation okay so
herve<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.449> secure<00:00:25.260> element<00:00:25.529> SE<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.369> host

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
herve we have secure element SE and host

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.320 
herve we have secure element SE and host
card<00:00:27.300> emulation<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:28.880> briefly<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.269> you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
card emulation so briefly can you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
card emulation so briefly can you
explain<00:00:30.689> what's<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.500> difference<00:00:31.890> between

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
explain what's the difference between

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.860 
explain what's the difference between
the<00:00:32.669> two<00:00:35.930> first<00:00:37.309> let's<00:00:38.309> start<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.850> dia<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the two first let's start by dia the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
the two first let's start by dia the
secure<00:00:40.230> element<00:00:41.059> secure<00:00:42.059> element<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:43.590> fact

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
secure element secure element is in fact

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.010 
secure element secure element is in fact
a<00:00:44.780> combination<00:00:45.780> between<00:00:46.460> software<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
a combination between software and a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.770 
a combination between software and a
dedicated<00:00:49.680> our<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.520> meaning<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.180> it's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
dedicated our way so meaning that it's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.400 
dedicated our way so meaning that it's
relying<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.399> extremely

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
relying on the on the very extremely

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.920 
relying on the on the very extremely
secure<00:00:55.730> components<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.879> tamper<00:00:57.390> resistant

element<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.650> only<00:01:05.119> let<00:01:06.119> say<00:01:06.330> this

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
element is not only let say this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.370

combination<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> software<00:01:08.909> Nala<00:01:09.240> where<00:01:09.510> there

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
combination of software Nala where there

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.289 
combination of software Nala where there
is<00:01:10.530> also<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:11.400> associated<00:01:12.270> infrastructure<00:01:13.250> so

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
is also an associated infrastructure so

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.450 
is also an associated infrastructure so
in<00:01:15.299> fact<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.960> gives<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> possibility<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
in fact that gives the possibility to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.560 
in fact that gives the possibility to
manage<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> deployment<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> an<00:01:20.939> application

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
manage the deployment of an application

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.620 
manage the deployment of an application
the<00:01:22.380> transaction<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.540> also<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:26.630> application

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the transaction and also the application

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.249 
the transaction and also the application
lifecycle<00:01:30.290> for<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.500> Aichi<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.299> very

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
lifecycle for the Aichi it's a very

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.370 
lifecycle for the Aichi it's a very
different<00:01:34.740> approach<00:01:35.450> because<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.079> pure

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
different approach because it's a pure

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.130 
different approach because it's a pure
software<00:01:39.650> solution<00:01:40.650> option<00:01:41.240> then<00:01:42.240> instead<00:01:42.930> of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
software solution option then instead of

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.149 
software solution option then instead of
having<00:01:43.939> something<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.509> secure<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.009> are

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
having something that is secure you are

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
having something that is secure you are
using<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
using the the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.010 
using the the
the<00:01:50.210> open<00:01:51.979> operating<00:01:52.979> system<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.539> device

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the open operating system of the device

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.090 
the open operating system of the device
so<00:01:55.469> one<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.579> soft<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.960> based<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.679> software

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so one it's soft it's based on software

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.020 
so one it's soft it's based on software
and<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.939> grounded<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.750> quite<00:02:01.229> letter<00:02:02.030> opener

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and so grounded it's quite letter opener

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.669 
and so grounded it's quite letter opener
at<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.689> end<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.319> no<00:02:05.299> security

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
at the end there is no security

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.270 
at the end there is no security
mechanism<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:07.910> energy<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.269> that's<00:02:09.799> a<00:02:10.799> huge

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
mechanism in energy so that's a huge

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.180 
mechanism in energy so that's a huge
difference<00:02:12.170> nevertheless<00:02:13.170> there<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
difference nevertheless there is the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.509 
difference nevertheless there is the
possibility<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.819> secure<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.959> chi<00:02:16.620> with<00:02:17.400> some

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
possibility to secure a chi with some

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.660 
possibility to secure a chi with some
mechanism<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.670> saw<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.360> cloud<00:02:21.599> or<00:02:22.340> local<00:02:23.340> so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
mechanism I saw in the cloud or local so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.569 
mechanism I saw in the cloud or local so
using<00:02:24.239> phones<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.900> secure<00:02:25.769> element<00:02:25.860> what

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
using phones on the secure element what

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.780 
using phones on the secure element what
we<00:02:26.730> call<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.750> believe<00:02:28.680> solution<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:29.489> will

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
we call I believe solution and we will

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.559 
we call I believe solution and we will
probably<00:02:30.209> come<00:02:30.420> back<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:30.750> here<00:02:30.959> on<00:02:31.200> this

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
probably come back on here on this

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.720 
probably come back on here on this
so-called<00:02:33.680> difference<00:02:34.680> between<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.220> two<00:02:35.459> is

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
so-called difference between the two is

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.699 
so-called difference between the two is
the<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:37.069> maturity<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.190> product<00:02:38.700> because

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
the the maturity of the product because

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.900 
the the maturity of the product because
we<00:02:40.709> have<00:02:40.829> started<00:02:41.370> with<00:02:41.640> same<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.900> then

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
we have started with same and then

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.210 
we have started with same and then
embedded<00:02:44.910> secure<00:02:45.299> element<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:46.230> long<00:02:46.739> time<00:02:47.040> ago

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
embedded secure element a long time ago

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.759 
embedded secure element a long time ago
so<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.390> meant<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.170> we<00:02:50.160> we<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.769> standardized

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
so it meant that we we have standardized

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.009 
so it meant that we we have standardized
ecosystem<00:02:53.579> we<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.630> test<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.739> solution<00:02:57.019> we

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
ecosystem we have test the solution we

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.099 
ecosystem we have test the solution we
have<00:02:58.230> some<00:02:59.030> certification<00:03:00.030> schemes<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.959> are

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
have some certification schemes that are

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.330 
have some certification schemes that are
already<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:02.010> place<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.930> all<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.200> these<00:03:04.380> are

already in place and all of these are

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.710 
already in place and all of these are
still<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.180> be<00:03:06.209> done<00:03:06.540> with<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.709> chi<00:03:08.489> sao<00:03:09.000> in

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
still to be done with a chi sao in

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.039 
still to be done with a chi sao in
question<00:03:10.139> of<00:03:10.290> maturity<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.060> mature<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
question of maturity one is mature the

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.910 
question of maturity one is mature the
saw<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.709> other<00:03:14.310> world<00:03:14.639> is<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.630> starting<00:03:16.590> so

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.190 
saw the other world is just starting so
when<00:03:17.099> HC<00:03:17.579> came<00:03:18.150> out<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.359> lot<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.810> people<00:03:19.109> were

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
when HC came out a lot of people were

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.440 
when HC came out a lot of people were
very<00:03:19.230> excited<00:03:19.829> about<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:20.970> think

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
very excited about this do you think

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.530 
very excited about this do you think
that<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.049> benefits<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.799> HTE<00:03:23.220> were

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
that the benefits of HTE were

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.420 
that the benefits of HTE were
exaggerated<00:03:29.150> yes<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.329> no<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.139> would<00:03:31.829> say<00:03:32.040> no

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
exaggerated yes and no so I would say no

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.349 
exaggerated yes and no so I would say no
first<00:03:33.030> because<00:03:34.370> it's<00:03:35.370> true<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.709> 'he

definitely<00:03:39.359> simplify<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:41.010> development<00:03:41.669> and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
definitely simplify the development and

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.349 
definitely simplify the development and
the<00:03:42.359> deployment<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.109> application<00:03:43.910> but<00:03:44.910> only

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
the deployment of application but only

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.140 
the deployment of application but only
if<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.840> don't<00:03:46.290> require<00:03:46.859> any<00:03:47.250> level<00:03:48.030> of

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
if you don't require any level of

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.229 
if you don't require any level of
security<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:49.069> in<00:03:50.069> other<00:03:50.220> world<00:03:50.519> it's<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.910> very

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
security so in other world it's a very

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.990 
security so in other world it's a very
good<00:03:51.329> news<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.769> be<00:03:53.010> independent<00:03:53.489> and

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
good news you can be independent and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.659 
good news you can be independent and
launch<00:03:54.299> your<00:03:54.419> application<00:03:55.669> independently

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
launch your application independently

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.930 
launch your application independently
from<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
from the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.710 
from the

amor mobile network operators so
definitely<00:04:06.070> it's<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.370> good<00:04:06.550> new<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.880> little<00:04:07.360> bit

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
definitely it's a good new a little bit

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.820 
definitely it's a good new a little bit
exaggerated<00:04:08.860> as<00:04:09.640> soon<00:04:10.000> as<00:04:10.240> you<00:04:10.630> need<00:04:10.930> let's

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
exaggerated as soon as you need let's

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:19.860 
exaggerated as soon as you need let's
say<00:04:12.360> some<00:04:14.670> security<00:04:16.350> mechanism<00:04:17.350> because<00:04:18.870> you

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
say some security mechanism because you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.560 
say some security mechanism because you
will<00:04:20.110> have<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.620> put<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.280> place<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:22.300> same

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
will have to put in place the same

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.680 
will have to put in place the same
infrastructure<00:04:22.960> out<00:04:23.740> what<00:04:24.160> we<00:04:24.310> did<00:04:24.550> with<00:04:24.880> with

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
infrastructure out what we did with with

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.550 
infrastructure out what we did with with
the<00:04:25.960> Sakura<00:04:26.560> lament<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.190> at<00:04:27.430> some<00:04:27.700> point<00:04:28.560> you

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
the Sakura lament so at some point you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.890 
the Sakura lament so at some point you
will<00:04:29.590> have<00:04:29.920> to<00:04:30.250> face<00:04:30.490> some<00:04:30.850> constraint<00:04:31.570> you

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
will have to face some constraint you

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.840 
will have to face some constraint you
will<00:04:32.080> have<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.440> face<00:04:32.650> some<00:04:33.010> costs<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.730> I

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
will have to face some costs and I

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.840 
will have to face some costs and I
believe<00:04:36.850> that<00:04:36.880> it<00:04:37.600> could<00:04:37.960> be<00:04:38.800> more<00:04:39.130> complex

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
believe that it could be more complex

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.520 
believe that it could be more complex
than<00:04:40.360> what<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.290> we<00:04:41.890> we<00:04:42.760> had<00:04:43.000> with<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.990> secure

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
than what we we we had with the secure

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.370 
than what we we we had with the secure
element<00:04:44.620> okay<00:04:45.400> so<00:04:45.460> in<00:04:45.820> what<00:04:46.030> sense<00:04:46.270> other<00:04:46.660> two

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
element okay so in what sense other two

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.530 
element okay so in what sense other two
technologies<00:04:47.760> complementary<00:04:48.760> mean<00:04:48.910> are<00:04:49.180> you

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
technologies complementary mean are you

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.650 
technologies complementary mean are you
expecting<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.050> see<00:04:50.670> hybrid<00:04:52.680> versions<00:04:53.680> it's

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
expecting to see hybrid versions it's

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.450 
expecting to see hybrid versions it's
it's<00:04:56.040> as<00:04:57.040> I<00:04:57.280> said<00:04:57.690> as<00:04:58.690> it<00:04:58.990> is<00:04:59.170> of<00:04:59.380> good<00:04:59.530> news<00:04:59.830> we

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
it's as I said as it is of good news we

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.490 
it's as I said as it is of good news we
will<00:05:00.640> probably<00:05:00.850> see<00:05:01.500> some<00:05:02.500> that<00:05:03.370> say

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
will probably see some that say

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.730 
will probably see some that say
developers<00:05:05.500> being<00:05:06.190> for<00:05:07.060> bank<00:05:07.840> application<00:05:08.530> or

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
developers being for bank application or

developers being for bank application or
other<00:05:09.010> that<00:05:09.370> will<00:05:09.550> develop<00:05:09.870> an<00:05:10.870> FCP

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
other that will develop an FCP

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.830 
other that will develop an FCP
application<00:05:12.040> because<00:05:12.520> they<00:05:12.730> they<00:05:13.510> have<00:05:13.660> the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
application because they they have the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.530 
application because they they have the
impression<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:15.280> blockers<00:05:16.090> have<00:05:16.300> been

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
impression that the blockers have been

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.980 
impression that the blockers have been
removed<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:17.290> then<00:05:18.010> when<00:05:18.700> they<00:05:18.910> will<00:05:19.210> face<00:05:19.630> the

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
removed and then when they will face the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.960 
removed and then when they will face the
issue<00:05:20.260> of<00:05:20.800> putting<00:05:21.550> some<00:05:22.050> security<00:05:23.050> mechanism

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
issue of putting some security mechanism

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.920 
issue of putting some security mechanism
then<00:05:26.340> while<00:05:27.340> considering<00:05:27.850> the<00:05:28.570> secure

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
then while considering the secure

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.240 
then while considering the secure
element<00:05:29.130> could<00:05:30.130> be<00:05:30.510> let's<00:05:31.510> say<00:05:31.800> an<00:05:32.800> approach

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
element could be let's say an approach

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.330 
element could be let's say an approach
and<00:05:33.520> this<00:05:33.910> is<00:05:34.090> why<00:05:34.330> we<00:05:34.870> could<00:05:35.560> have<00:05:35.770> some<00:05:36.130> I

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
and this is why we could have some I

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.970 
and this is why we could have some I

for<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.669> low<00:05:40.540> value<00:05:40.870> payment<00:05:41.260> then<00:05:41.950> you<00:05:42.490> can

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
for the low value payment then you can

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.500 
for the low value payment then you can
you<00:05:43.210> can<00:05:43.419> use<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:44.020> chi<00:05:44.740> because<00:05:45.220> it's<00:05:45.730> quite

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
you can use a chi because it's quite

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.760 
you can use a chi because it's quite
simple<00:05:46.840> but<00:05:47.640> as<00:05:48.640> soon<00:05:49.000> as<00:05:49.270> you<00:05:49.540> will<00:05:49.780> need<00:05:50.530> to

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
simple but as soon as you will need to

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.060 
simple but as soon as you will need to
be<00:05:50.800> strongly<00:05:51.750> authenticated<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:53.070> download

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
be strongly authenticated to download

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.850 
be strongly authenticated to download
the<00:05:54.340> token<00:05:54.730> then<00:05:55.419> using<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:56.230> secure<00:05:56.470> element

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
the token then using a secure element

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.530 
the token then using a secure element
could<00:05:57.610> be<00:05:58.050> appropriate<00:05:59.050> so<00:06:00.060> this<00:06:01.060> is<00:06:01.300> an

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
could be appropriate so this is an

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.910 
could be appropriate so this is an
example<00:06:01.720> of<00:06:02.169> the<00:06:02.650> I<00:06:02.680> roid<00:06:03.130> approach
