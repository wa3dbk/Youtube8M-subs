00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.910 
with these health 60 model trucks 57 360
and<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.500> may<00:00:16.619> even<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:17.180> more<00:00:18.529> more<00:00:19.529> than<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.890> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
and it may even be more more than that I

and it may even be more more than that I
don't<00:00:20.160> know<00:00:20.250> what<00:00:20.369> your<00:00:20.490> models<00:00:20.850> had<00:00:21.779> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
don't know what your models had a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.380 
don't know what your models had a
similar<00:00:22.199> construction<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> cab

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
similar construction on this but the cab

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.720 
similar construction on this but the cab
corner<00:00:24.779> which<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.380> kind<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> bad<00:00:26.070> stamp<00:00:26.490> for

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
corner which is kind of a bad stamp for

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.820 
corner which is kind of a bad stamp for
replacement<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.470> usable<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:31.590> cab

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
replacement but it's it's usable the cab

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.940 
replacement but it's it's usable the cab
corner<00:00:33.500> extra<00:00:34.500> hand<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:35.690> sits<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.739> like

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
corner extra hand here sits in just like

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.630 
corner extra hand here sits in just like
so<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:40.309> then<00:00:42.140> originally<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> great

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
so and then originally there was a great

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.060 
so and then originally there was a great
big<00:00:44.940> inner<00:00:45.930> cap<00:00:47.030> came<00:00:48.030> down<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:49.070> all

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
big inner cap came down from here all

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.279 
big inner cap came down from here all
the<00:00:50.129> way<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:52.160> came<00:00:53.160> around<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:54.930> up

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the way down and came around and back up

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.610 
the way down and came around and back up
and<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:57.590> don't<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:59.100> why<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.579> there

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
and I don't really know why it was there

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
and I don't really know why it was there
if<00:01:01.620> you've<00:01:01.920> got<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> these<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.539> odds<00:01:03.690> are

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
if you've got one of these the odds are

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.450 
if you've got one of these the odds are
pretty<00:01:04.080> high<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> big

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
pretty high that's going to have a big

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.039 
pretty high that's going to have a big
old<00:01:05.670> rust<00:01:05.909> hole<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.330> down<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:06.750> where<00:01:06.930> all

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
old rust hole right down there where all

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.080 
old rust hole right down there where all
that<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.580> right<00:01:08.580> down<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.820> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that was right down you know in this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.149 
that was right down you know in this
area<00:01:12.479> there'll<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> big<00:01:13.560> rust<00:01:13.770> hole<00:01:13.979> where

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
area there'll be a big rust hole where

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.620 
area there'll be a big rust hole where
the<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.430> met<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the two met because all it was was a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.130 
the two met because all it was was a
flat<00:01:15.930> piece<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.140> metal<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:17.250> laid<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.140> on

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140

the inside of that outer cab corner well
I<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:22.320> need<00:01:22.470> more<00:01:22.710> rust<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.610> don't<00:01:23.850> need

I don't need more rust and I don't need

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.840 
I don't need more rust and I don't need
it<00:01:24.409> resting<00:01:25.409> out<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.710> ten<00:01:25.950> years<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.430> so

it resting out in ten years or so so
what<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.330> done<00:01:29.119> was<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.479> cut<00:01:30.780> out<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
what I have done was to cut out the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.080 
what I have done was to cut out the
inner<00:01:31.290> cab<00:01:31.590> corner<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.220> make<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> am

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
inner cab corner and make what I am

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.840 
inner cab corner and make what I am
affectionately<00:01:33.659> calling<00:01:33.930> an<00:01:34.640> inter<00:01:35.640> cab

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
affectionately calling an inter cab

affectionately calling an inter cab
corner<00:01:36.210> eliminator<00:01:37.070> because<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> inside

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
corner eliminator because on the inside

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.969 
corner eliminator because on the inside
of<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.720> cab<00:01:40.670> this<00:01:41.670> went<00:01:41.909> straight<00:01:42.240> down<00:01:42.979> on

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
of your cab this went straight down on

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
of your cab this went straight down on
that<00:01:44.189> inner<00:01:44.369> cab<00:01:44.670> corner<00:01:45.090> went<00:01:45.270> straight<00:01:45.570> down

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that inner cab corner went straight down

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.760 
that inner cab corner went straight down
and<00:01:46.140> made<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> pocket<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.600> hollow<00:01:48.899> from<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and made a pocket it was hollow from the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.450 
and made a pocket it was hollow from the
inner<00:01:49.920> cab<00:01:50.189> corner<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.729> way<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
inner cab corner all the way up to the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
inner cab corner all the way up to the
to<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.490> inside<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> cab<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> built<00:01:55.619> this

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to the inside the cab so I built this

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.850 
to the inside the cab so I built this
and<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:59.420> may<00:02:00.420> put<00:02:00.600> some<00:02:00.869> measurements<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:01.619> later

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and I may put some measurements up later

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.069 
and I may put some measurements up later
if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.189> want<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> build<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.149> you're

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
if you want to build one if you're

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.790 
if you want to build one if you're
working<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.469> something<00:02:04.799> like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
working on something like

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.190 
working on something like
it's<00:02:06.640> really<00:02:06.790> not<00:02:07.030> too<00:02:07.780> hard<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.020> do

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
it's really not too hard to do

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.440 
it's really not too hard to do
surprisingly<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.150> piece<00:02:10.420> that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
surprisingly and this is a piece that

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.980 
surprisingly and this is a piece that
goes<00:02:10.660> over<00:02:11.200> because<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:13.270> needs<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.630> come<00:02:13.780> all

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
goes over because it needs to come all

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.120 
goes over because it needs to come all
the<00:02:14.110> way<00:02:14.140> over<00:02:14.230> see<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:16.620> almost<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.860> frame

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
the way over see the almost to the frame

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.060 
the way over see the almost to the frame
rail<00:02:18.960> where<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.050> can<00:02:20.200> then<00:02:20.380> lay<00:02:20.590> flat<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
rail where it can then lay flat and you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.760 
rail where it can then lay flat and you
can<00:02:24.070> weld<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.970> then<00:02:25.000> whatever<00:02:25.770> gap

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
can weld that in and then whatever gap

can weld that in and then whatever gap
is<00:02:26.980> left<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.850> can<00:02:28.000> seem<00:02:28.270> seal<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.960> have<00:02:29.470> a

sealed-up<00:02:32.560> CAD<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.160> suppose<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:33.940> there's<00:02:34.330> a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
sealed-up CAD I suppose that there's a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.030 
sealed-up CAD I suppose that there's a
little<00:02:34.630> bit<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.930> strength<00:02:35.320> with<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.830> original

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
little bit of strength with the original

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.460 
little bit of strength with the original
shape<00:02:36.490> of<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.730> cab<00:02:36.910> corner<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.290> inner

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
shape of the cab corner of that inner

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.880 
shape of the cab corner of that inner
cap<00:02:38.710> corner<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.870> difference<00:02:41.290> between<00:02:41.440> that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
cap corner the difference between that

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.980

and<00:02:41.950> what<00:02:42.340> I've<00:02:42.640> got<00:02:42.850> going<00:02:42.880> on<00:02:43.240> here<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.780> going

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
and what I've got going on here is going

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.600 
and what I've got going on here is going
to<00:02:44.050> be<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.410> minor<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.310> won't<00:02:45.490> be

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
to be so minor that it won't be

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.330

noticeable and honestly I'm not sure

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.850

that<00:02:48.460> mine<00:02:48.700> won't<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:49.000> stronger<00:02:49.450> because<00:02:49.860> mine

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
that mine won't be stronger because mine

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.320 
that mine won't be stronger because mine
won't<00:02:51.070> have<00:02:51.190> as<00:02:51.310> much<00:02:51.400> leverage<00:02:51.670> against<00:02:52.210> it

won't have as much leverage against it

where it's going to show because i don't

middle from welding a bead but it's
going<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.140> definitely<00:03:11.290> be<00:03:11.560> welded<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:13.270> I

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
going to definitely be welded and I I

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.630 
going to definitely be welded and I I
think<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.560> it'll<00:03:15.160> work<00:03:15.310> just<00:03:15.340> great

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.100 
think that that it'll work just great

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
and then I won't have to worry about

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.670 
and then I won't have to worry about

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
still is going to get condensation if

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.570 
still is going to get condensation if
you<00:04:17.289> know<00:04:17.380> if<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.590> if<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:17.979> was<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.220> leave<00:04:18.400> that

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
you know if I if I was to leave that

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.140 
you know if I if I was to leave that
there<00:04:18.760> it's<00:04:18.910> going<00:04:19.000> to

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
there it's going to

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.300 
there it's going to
get<00:04:19.269> moisture<00:04:19.540> it's<00:04:20.500> right<00:04:20.709> down<00:04:20.769> in<00:04:21.040> front<00:04:21.100> of

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
get moisture it's right down in front of

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.740 
get moisture it's right down in front of
the<00:04:21.370> rear<00:04:21.519> tire<00:04:21.850> it's<00:04:22.180> going<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.389> have<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:22.660> get

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
the rear tire it's going to have to get

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.939 
the rear tire it's going to have to get
some<00:04:22.810> moisture<00:04:23.290> because<00:04:23.410> we<00:04:23.560> get<00:04:23.680> splashed

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
some moisture because we get splashed

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.320 
some moisture because we get splashed
all<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.280> time<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.759> heat<00:04:24.940> difference

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
all the time and the heat difference

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.230 
all the time and the heat difference
from<00:04:25.449> inside<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.870> outside<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:27.850> just<00:04:28.030> can't

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
from inside to outside it just can't

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.719 
from inside to outside it just can't
possibly<00:04:28.690> be<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> good<00:04:29.680> idea<00:04:29.919> i<00:04:30.190> don't<00:04:30.400> know<00:04:30.520> why

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
possibly be a good idea i don't know why

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.790 
possibly be a good idea i don't know why
i<00:04:31.090> don't<00:04:31.690> know<00:04:31.720> why<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:31.960> was<00:04:32.169> never<00:04:32.380> built<00:04:32.590> that

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
i don't know why it was never built that

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.820 
i don't know why it was never built that
way<00:04:33.009> i<00:04:33.690> understand<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.870> white<00:04:35.050> cab<00:04:35.350> corners

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
way i understand the white cab corners

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.240 
way i understand the white cab corners
because<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:37.270> big<00:04:37.479> cab<00:04:37.750> corner<00:04:38.169> here<00:04:41.250> the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
because that big cab corner here the

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.100 
because that big cab corner here the
stepside<00:04:42.699> was<00:04:42.880> still<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> real<00:04:43.300> popular<00:04:43.539> option

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
stepside was still a real popular option

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.439 
stepside was still a real popular option
at<00:04:44.199> the<00:04:44.289> time<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:45.490> they<00:04:45.639> built<00:04:45.759> this<00:04:45.940> wide<00:04:46.180> cab

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
at the time so they built this wide cab

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:47.640 
at the time so they built this wide cab
corner<00:04:46.810> so<00:04:46.900> they<00:04:46.990> didn't<00:04:47.139> have<00:04:47.259> to<00:04:47.320> build<00:04:47.500> two

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
corner so they didn't have to build two

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.629 
corner so they didn't have to build two
calves<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:49.840> know<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.050> stepside<00:04:50.500> would<00:04:51.490> have

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
calves you know the stepside would have

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.400 
calves you know the stepside would have
instead<00:04:52.300> of<00:04:52.360> coming<00:04:52.660> out<00:04:52.750> flush<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.260> edge

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
instead of coming out flush to the edge

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.900 
instead of coming out flush to the edge
of<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.620> bed<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:54.039> would<00:04:54.190> have<00:04:54.280> sat<00:04:54.490> right<00:04:54.669> about

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
of the bed it would have sat right about

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.939 
of the bed it would have sat right about
there<00:04:55.180> with<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.810> edge<00:04:55.930> with<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.680> edge<00:04:56.770> of<00:04:56.800> the

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
there with the edge with the edge of the

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.740 
there with the edge with the edge of the
cab<00:04:57.160> rather<00:04:57.340> but<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.180> edge<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.449> bed<00:04:58.600> would

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
cab rather but the edge of the bed would

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.050 
cab rather but the edge of the bed would
have<00:04:58.840> sat<00:04:58.960> right<00:04:59.080> about<00:04:59.320> there<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.060> that

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
have sat right about there and and that

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.150 
have sat right about there and and that
way<00:05:01.240> they<00:05:01.690> had<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:01.990> whole<00:05:02.260> big<00:05:02.500> gap<00:05:02.800> there

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
way they had that whole big gap there

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.890 
way they had that whole big gap there
that<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.520> stepside<00:05:03.940> would<00:05:04.150> have<00:05:04.300> had<00:05:04.690> that

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
that the stepside would have had that

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.879 
that the stepside would have had that
the<00:05:05.080> fleetside<00:05:05.979> wouldn't<00:05:06.340> have<00:05:06.460> filled<00:05:07.000> it

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
the fleetside wouldn't have filled it

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.029 
the fleetside wouldn't have filled it
but<00:05:08.889> I<00:05:09.130> don't<00:05:09.760> have<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:09.940> stepside<00:05:10.570> I<00:05:11.260> do<00:05:11.770> kind<00:05:12.010> of

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
but I don't have a stepside I do kind of

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.170 
but I don't have a stepside I do kind of
like<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.280> big<00:05:12.430> cat<00:05:12.639> horn<00:05:12.849> though<00:05:12.970> it's<00:05:13.060> just

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
like the big cat horn though it's just

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.700 
like the big cat horn though it's just
