yeah<00:00:58.109> money<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.609> what's<00:01:00.449> up

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
yeah money will do that so what's up

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.630

next<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.230> obviously<00:01:02.160> you're<00:01:02.280> gonna<00:01:02.370> take

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
next for you obviously you're gonna take

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.609 
next for you obviously you're gonna take
a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:02.910> away<00:01:02.940> from<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.570> experience<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.320> what

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
a lot away from this experience but what

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.370 
a lot away from this experience but what
is<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.030> nearest<00:01:06.270> future

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
is in the nearest future

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
is in the nearest future
I<00:01:07.439> guess<00:01:07.979> I'll<00:01:08.130> probably<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:08.430> play<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.180> in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I guess I'll probably go play the one in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.700 
I guess I'll probably go play the one in
Europe<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> World<00:01:10.170> Series<00:01:10.260> over<00:01:10.439> there
