 chose the white red 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.909
 if we see things more fruity we 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.250
 can leave be revealed the loire thing 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.729
 more creamy a little burgundy in

 Bordeaux wines can also be tempted 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.890
 languedoc 1 in these houses there 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.100
 not hesitated and at the level of quality 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.899
 price we will probably be much better 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.420
 positioned that going on big 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.799
 burgundy classified grand cru 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.090
 bourgogne who are very good but who 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.829
 are expensive so you have to know so you have to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.970
 just get an idea of ​​his budget 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.689
 initially if we do not know how 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.040
 get advice 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.040
 we simply call on the summit on 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.240
 said here I am the sleeve may have 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.829
 looking for something that would be in this 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.810
 style there in that spirit and we go up 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.070
 of 3 ranges which are at the same price 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.049
 sleep is a month price and we do not have to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.430
 say prices ahead of us 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.640
 invite what would be my faith enough 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.660
 inelegant so well let's be crazy I 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.030
 will you take 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.630
 a corbières sir domain of the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.980
 noise then by car 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.570
 so here we relax and not 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.430
 problem we ordered we did the most 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.200
 hard 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.180
 it will just have to taste it but 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.440
 there is no problem 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.210
 perfect parts thank you so there we 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.190
 just check that the label and 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.930
 well what we ordered in general at 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.940
 less than sommelier purpose more than 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.680
 you there will be no problem is 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.210
 sir in attack 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.190
 so that's the idea it's really it 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.440
 must play down as much as possible 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.900
 experience that comes with a whole whole 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.980
 decorum all a splendor here we are 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.290
 first of all to have a good time 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.450
 with his guests and not that wine is 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:01.410
 anxiety factor care 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:03.330
 go go car thank you sir 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.100
 the idea is that there we are released we are 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.360
 serve a little bit of wine just for 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.800
 check who has no problem who has not 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.840
 of default technically with wine 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.310
 the idea is not to say no to 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.760
 raspberries me I am rather to 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.890
 strawberries 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.810
 you must not go on 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.620
 notions of aromas like that it's rather 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.940
 to see if we have a guy who is 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.340
 corked if we have a voice that is going to be 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.700
 oxidized which will be pulled a little bit towards the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.310
 vinegar 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.110
 so we can just feel it 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.550
 then we can the income is a small 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.890
 little to really redo out all 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.209
 its aromas have no problem we have 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.840
 tasted to make sure no problem if 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.790
 we have a little doubt 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.160
 we can go on the retro-olfaction 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.660
 discreetly brings in some air 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.880
 in the mouth to really do 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.010
 bring out all there all the potential 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.080
 of wine simply I show you so he 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.380
 this is the discrete not to make any one 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.380
 tintouin 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.450
 that's good there no problem we go there so 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.770
 we never have a problem simply 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.750
 the idea is to do that with 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.100
 discretion elegance we always have a 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.320
 little satisfaction when we spotted a 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.790
 mac is corked which is a problem 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.160
 so there's no room for 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.170
 discussion because otherwise it's there 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.730
 it's the beginning of the end so simply 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.400
 we come closer I think the wine a 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.849
 problem thank you 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.769
 busy and this is the person from 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.820
 bring another bottle here do not have 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.820
 problem the pibal thanks sir 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.720
 this is happiness this noise so all that 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.410
 we still have to do it's finally 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.900
 had a good time 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.200
 our friends with our colleagues our there 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.270
 but there is no problem I want 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.550
 toast your health 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.010
 hoping that this little clip with 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.400
 actors again not piqued 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.360
 chafer will have allowed you to 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.890
 dramatize this experience a little bit 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.390
 which is primarily intended to be a great 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.790
 pleasure 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.640
 I wish a very beautiful day I 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.350
 tell you very soon about the castle 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:02.570
 points like bone like olive tree was pulling 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:02.570
 castle points like happiness or
