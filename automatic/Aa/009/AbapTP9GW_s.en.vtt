00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.390
 Hello everyone, how are you doing? 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.790
 you go Well first of all wanted 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.960
 pose a small question is something 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.850
 what I've wanted to do in the past 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.830
 videos but always week finished 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.840
 forgetting the topic is that we are 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.580
 quickly approaching 2,000 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.170
 subscribers and I do not want to go back to 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.970
 repeat what we did for the thousand 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.160
 subscribers because I think that the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.740
 specials have to be done when 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.410
 round figures with 5,000 thousand 10,000 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.330
 subscribers in addition if there are many 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.340
 special followed the word itself 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.050
 loses the meaning so there was 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.539
 thought of something different something 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.309
 different a questions and answers already 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.829
 that every time we play together every time 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.600
 or games you either on twitter or 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.889
 for youtube private messages or 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.350
 comments you have always made me 

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:47.030
 many questions so here is 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.889
 your opportunity to do all the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.690
 questions that you want in the section of 

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:52.909
 comments please if someone does not 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.649
 can you ask me the questions in the 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.449
 comments section then the other 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.670
 option would be twitter but honestly 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.619
 I prefer that all the questions 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.239
 do in this video in the section of 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.850
 comments that you are prepared for it 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.370
 and if there are enough questions the follow 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.650
 accumulating and when the 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.530
 of the 2000 I do not think it's inside 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.880
 of many take the video and nothing 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.460
 you will know a little bit more about 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.630
 say it so I'm looking from behind 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.900
 percent before I forget 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.810
 this is an app in 120 seconds in two 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.760
 exact minutes of rubén I do not know if what 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.620
 you know or not because there are many balloons there 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.020
 new people every day 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.700
 rubén is the second person is the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.250
 person with whom I started this channel 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.260
 the one that formed this channel but for reasons 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.260
 of work had to be absent and 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.300
 let's say that from the beginning 90% 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.860
 of the canal hurts I have taken it but of 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.470
 once in a while you watch videos of rubén 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.360
 many clips because there are so many clips 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.550
 of the series this is not a montage that 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.560
 they are rubén and it is what he likes the most 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.230
 portal to provide forgiveness what most 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.120
 like are the assemblies and also from time 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.070
 in when as I said I bring you mobs 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.610
 of rubén even though I carry the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.870
 channel almost 90% from time to time 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.020
 you have a ruben change that implies 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.119
 It's leds like mine but how's it going 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.710
 saying also I already know that the weapon that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.530
 is using rubén is a pretty weapon 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.520
 good but you can not deny me that a 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.250
 time 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.740
 in two minutes on such a big map and 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.710
 as open as this one does not have a big 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.350
 merit true but good as it was 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.880
 saying if you want to ask questions this 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.500
 is your opportunity I will answer 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.540
 all those that I think have to 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.520
 answer I know and nothing I hope that I have 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.960
 liked the video the comment and we 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.080
 we see the next video a greeting up 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.080
 then
