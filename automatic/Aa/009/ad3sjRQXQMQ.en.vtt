00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
does it work well for people who have

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.560 
does it work well for people who have
had<00:01:19.140> coach<00:01:19.560> training<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.210> field

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
had coach training and are in that field

had coach training and are in that field
this<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:23.400> more<00:01:23.759> advanced<00:01:24.210> skills<00:01:24.979> it's

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this will be more advanced skills it's

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
this will be more advanced skills it's
more<00:01:26.250> rigorous<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.030> standards<00:01:27.479> are<00:01:27.540> higher

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
more rigorous the standards are higher

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.200 
more rigorous the standards are higher
and<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.460> take<00:01:29.729> their<00:01:29.939> skills

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and so it will really take their skills

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.819 
and so it will really take their skills
to<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> next<00:01:30.420> level<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.079> there's<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to the next level and there's this

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.850 
to the next level and there's this
design<00:01:32.509> in<00:01:33.509> medical<00:01:34.049> Qing<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.650> very

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
design in medical Qing we are very

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.679 
design in medical Qing we are very
inclusive<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.420> not<00:01:37.759> spend<00:01:38.759> time<00:01:39.000> trying<00:01:39.540> to

inclusive we do not spend time trying to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
inclusive we do not spend time trying to
exclude<00:01:40.079> or<00:01:40.470> make<00:01:40.680> ourselves<00:01:40.829> better<00:01:41.130> than

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
exclude or make ourselves better than

exclude or make ourselves better than
other<00:01:42.240> coach<00:01:42.780> trainings<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
other coach trainings we have a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.010 
other coach trainings we have a
different<00:01:44.670> methodology<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.840> more

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
different methodology and it is more

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.999 
different methodology and it is more
rigorous<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.850> we<00:01:47.850> did<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.180> by<00:01:48.450> design<00:01:49.009> so

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
rigorous and we did that by design so

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.310 
rigorous and we did that by design so
coaches<00:01:50.850> who<00:01:51.060> already<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.899> good

coaches who already have a good
foundation<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.119> next<00:01:54.360> step

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
foundation this would be the next step

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.039 
foundation this would be the next step
for<00:01:54.890> people<00:01:55.890> who<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.210> coaches<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.960> they
