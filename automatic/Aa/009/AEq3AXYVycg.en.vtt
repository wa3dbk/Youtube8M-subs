from<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.599> square<00:00:00.900> piece<00:00:01.170> of<00:00:01.199> paper<00:00:01.380> you<00:00:02.070> can

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
from a square piece of paper you can

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.090 
from a square piece of paper you can
fold<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.820> fairly<00:00:03.510> regular<00:00:03.929> pentagon

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
fold a fairly regular pentagon

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.670 
fold a fairly regular pentagon
this<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.850> how<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.060> go<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.480> take<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> square

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
this is how you go about take a square

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.270 
this is how you go about take a square
piece<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:08.040> paper<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.639> pen<00:00:08.880> first<00:00:10.190> fold<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
piece of paper and a pen first fold the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.860 
piece of paper and a pen first fold the
mid<00:00:11.519> line<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.630> paper<00:00:12.950> call<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.660> mark<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
mid line of the paper call this mark the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.680 
mid line of the paper call this mark the
mid<00:00:16.020> line<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.640> value<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.210> mid<00:00:18.449> line

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
mid line and the value of this mid line

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.040 
mid line and the value of this mid line
is<00:00:18.900> 32<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.250> bottom<00:00:20.550> point<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.000> 0<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
is 32 so the bottom point is 0 and the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.980 
is 32 so the bottom point is 0 and the
top<00:00:22.260> point<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.710> 32<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.359> fold<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.810> into

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
top point is 32 if you fold this into

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.890 
top point is 32 if you fold this into
half<00:00:25.369> then<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> midpoint<00:00:27.180> which

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
half then you get the midpoint which

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.110 
half then you get the midpoint which
will<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.199> 16<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:29.039> 32<00:00:32.239> fold<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.570> 1/4<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
will be 16 by 32 fold it in 1/4 and you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
will be 16 by 32 fold it in 1/4 and you
will<00:00:36.270> get<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> quarter<00:00:36.809> point<00:00:37.250> which<00:00:38.250> will<00:00:38.460> be

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
will get the quarter point which will be

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.560 
will get the quarter point which will be
8<00:00:38.940> by<00:00:39.390> 32<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:41.219> bring<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.850> top<00:00:41.879> point<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
8 by 32 and then bring the top point to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.090 
8 by 32 and then bring the top point to
the<00:00:42.719> eighth<00:00:42.870> point<00:00:44.480> subtract<00:00:45.480> 12<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the eighth point subtract 12 and you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
the eighth point subtract 12 and you
would<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.930> 20<00:00:48.930> by<00:00:49.110> 30<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:51.320> bring<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> top

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
would get 20 by 30 to bring the top

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.910 
would get 20 by 30 to bring the top
point<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> 20<00:00:53.699> point<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.129> get

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
point to the 20 point and you would get

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.139 
point to the 20 point and you would get
26<00:00:58.920> by<00:00:59.190> 32<00:00:59.809> once<00:01:00.809> again<00:01:01.140> bring<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.820> 32<00:01:02.820> point

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
26 by 32 once again bring that 32 point

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.929 
26 by 32 once again bring that 32 point
top<00:01:03.449> point<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> 26<00:01:04.559> point<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.610> you'd<00:01:05.760> get

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
top point to the 26 point and you'd get

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.210 
top point to the 26 point and you'd get
the<00:01:06.000> midpoint<00:01:06.540> which<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> 29<00:01:08.220> by<00:01:08.520> 32<00:01:10.220> once

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the midpoint which is 29 by 32 once

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.870 
the midpoint which is 29 by 32 once
again<00:01:11.580> bring<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> top<00:01:12.180> point<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.810> 29

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
again bring the top point would be 29

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.530 
again bring the top point would be 29
and<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.689> point<00:01:17.840> P<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:20.100> value

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
and you would get a point P the value

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.850 
and you would get a point P the value
and<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:22.439> height<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.350> 3<00:01:25.350> by<00:01:25.670> 64<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.860> we

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and this height would be 3 by 64 and we

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.580 
and this height would be 3 by 64 and we
call<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.790> point<00:01:30.210> P<00:01:32.150> now<00:01:33.150> similarly<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.290> base
