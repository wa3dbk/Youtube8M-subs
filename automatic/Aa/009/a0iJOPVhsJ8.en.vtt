00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.290
 I'm fine today 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:11.600
 The day before the Battlefield Hardline tournament 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.969
 Chen Ming that I was winning that prize But I'm just now is a member of the I d-off configuration 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.340
 It is a new team that said 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.090
 But Members for the first time by members of when they become Asia ranked first in the hobby three people that do 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.530
 Is called 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.100
 So it's a pretty luxurious piece, isn't it? 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:29.820
 I'm planning to raise the video of the game , so please watch it 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.930
 Because I won with the guy I was playing with my sister 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.770
 I'm doing a good sport every night every night, so I have to retire. 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.900
 Speaking of which, the guy who cares for Killle was a delicious salmon 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.340
 20 ze cut Rodez 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.490
 Take a good look 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 Battlefield 4 was also won the tournament hall that contains the table 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.230
 Also Battlefield hard line was the first time large is won Battlefield also from this 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.130
 Hard line 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.130
 I now Zassuge over over 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:02.050
 The best game in the look I want to is not'm a good waste Toka fighting during the game I will ally 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.810
 I want you to listen carefully to the words 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:11.549
 If you show the image of the person who is doing fps 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.610
 You are of Ne-yan Why Ome is I'm often not least this say impression Naa and was defeated by last name 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.600
 But I must not blame the absolute point of view 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 During the game I am so impatient and I can not see the surroundings 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.830
 In particular , if you are new to the game, you will not feel at home 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.430
 But there is a scene that I made a mistake during the game 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:37.900
 4 even become the air that would forgive because they become the air say so heal if deep breath once 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:41.650
 It will be easier to do because it will be an air to do together . Pf 4 Best in Asia 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:46.820
 Because I thought that it became the first place in the first Japanese tournament of Battlefield Hardline 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:52.220
 I think it is the most important mental Aim and allies before being fried 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.720
 How conscious to Fu say that I think is better to give to show the Rutteyuu concern raised with care 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.340
 Toka or whether you m to Fu say you 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.090
 Well I watched the video of Mr. Jero Kita Wow 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.690
 I also calm down first, I hope also to Tteyuu want to be in this kind of wind is better to play 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.410
 I want to put out a good score in the field and give a good score 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.610
 If you want to contribute, I think you should settle down first 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.600
 I'm running roughly me when What 's or bad 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.440
 Please pay attention to such places and enjoy the battle feel and call after 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.460
 Duty also 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.410
 I look at this from the play videos was Do Well okay I do not come out to the tournament 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.010

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.660
 If it is interesting from Yamaji, I would appreciate your favor when it is interesting 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.660
