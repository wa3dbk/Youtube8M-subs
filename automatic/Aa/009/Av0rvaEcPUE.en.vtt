00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.650 
because this folds down like this like
so<00:02:13.550> okay<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.740> then<00:02:16.740> somehow<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.850> attaches<00:02:18.420> to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
so okay and then somehow it attaches to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.250 
so okay and then somehow it attaches to
this<00:02:18.930> box<00:02:19.200> here<00:02:19.640> see<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:21.120> don't<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.660> how<00:02:22.020> right

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
this box here see I don't see how right

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.840 
this box here see I don't see how right
now

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.910 

goes<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.470> well<00:02:29.060> okay<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.830> let<00:02:31.830> me

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
goes in like that well okay so let me

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.410 
goes in like that well okay so let me
zoom<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.730> get<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> good<00:02:33.150> shot

zoom out a little so you get a good shot
of<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.660> or<00:02:34.410> zoom<00:02:34.980> up<00:02:35.130> there<00:02:35.340> we<00:02:35.459> go

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
of that or zoom up there we go

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.240 
of that or zoom up there we go
let's<00:02:36.870> see<00:02:36.959> here<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> box<00:02:37.890> like<00:02:38.130> you
