all in this blank review of systems I

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.410 
all in this blank review of systems I

will<00:01:38.579> go<00:01:38.670> blank<00:01:38.909> again<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.290> will<00:01:40.409> just

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
will go blank again and it will just

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.800 
will go blank again and it will just
cycle<00:01:40.979> through<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.720> this

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
cycle through just like this so in this

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
cycle through just like this so in this
manner<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.530> function<00:01:43.950> somewhat<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
manner this can function somewhat like a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.330 
manner this can function somewhat like a
pick<00:01:45.420> list<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.649> rapidly<00:01:47.189> go

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
pick list so that you can rapidly go

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.109 
pick list so that you can rapidly go
down<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.939> check<00:01:48.509> some<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> ones<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
down and check some of the ones that you

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.639 
down and check some of the ones that you
wanted<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.689> either<00:01:51.840> indicate<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.500> they

when I close the review of systems it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.520 
when I close the review of systems it's
going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.270> update<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.720> least<00:02:12.870> those<00:02:13.020> two<00:02:13.080> sex

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
going to update at least those two sex

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.380 
going to update at least those two sex
and<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.030> things<00:02:15.270> they

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and you can see it here the things they

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.120

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.240 
allergy symptoms which I would normally
go<00:03:53.400> edit<00:03:54.359> as<00:03:54.650> appropriate<00:03:55.650> for<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.890> patient

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
go edit as appropriate for the patient

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.849 
go edit as appropriate for the patient
but<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.489> this<00:03:56.579> case<00:03:56.820> notice<00:03:57.720> there<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.109> this

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
but in this case notice there is this

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.830 
but in this case notice there is this
review<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.280> systems<00:03:59.459> I've<00:04:00.150> already<00:04:00.570> created

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
review of systems I've already created

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.470 
review of systems I've already created
it<00:04:01.260> in<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.799> specific<00:04:02.040> for<00:04:02.640> what<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.329> would

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
it in a specific for what you would

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.849 
it in a specific for what you would
typically<00:04:03.870> see<00:04:04.019> with<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:07.049> review<00:04:07.290> systems<00:04:07.709> in

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
typically see with the review systems in

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.110 
typically see with the review systems in
a<00:04:08.250> patient<00:04:08.760> with<00:04:10.220> seasonal<00:04:11.220> allergies<00:04:11.640> now

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
a patient with seasonal allergies now

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.240 
a patient with seasonal allergies now
let<00:04:12.660> us<00:04:12.780> suppose<00:04:13.049> this<00:04:13.320> patient<00:04:13.709> also<00:04:13.859> had

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
let us suppose this patient also had

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.890 
let us suppose this patient also had
wheezing<00:04:14.820> because<00:04:15.090> they<00:04:15.209> have<00:04:15.329> some<00:04:15.480> asthma

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
wheezing because they have some asthma

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.750 
wheezing because they have some asthma
and<00:04:16.200> their<00:04:16.500> allergies<00:04:16.979> are<00:04:17.130> kicking<00:04:17.579> off

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
and their allergies are kicking off

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.090 
and their allergies are kicking off
their<00:04:17.970> asthma<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.169> case<00:04:19.440> I'm

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
their asthma so in this case I'm

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.649 
their asthma so in this case I'm
actually<00:04:20.250> going<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.609> click<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:20.970> respiratory

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
actually going to click on respiratory

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.010 
actually going to click on respiratory
it<00:04:22.109> brings<00:04:22.470> me<00:04:22.650> here<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.130> can<00:04:23.970> either<00:04:24.270> go<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:24.840> and

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
it brings me here I can either go in and

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.470 
it brings me here I can either go in and
change<00:04:25.349> this<00:04:25.650> and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
change this and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.200 
change this and
Letha<00:04:26.780> wheezing<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.380> add<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.070> here<00:04:28.100> or<00:04:28.730> I'm

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
Letha wheezing and add it here or I'm

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.860 
Letha wheezing and add it here or I'm
just<00:04:29.420> going<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.660> click<00:04:31.000> click<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.420> here<00:04:32.720> to

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
they have a cough in this particular

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.420 
they have a cough in this particular
patient<00:04:50.050> notice<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.170> now<00:04:51.380> have<00:04:51.650> what<00:04:52.280> looks

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
patient notice I now have what looks

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.840 
patient notice I now have what looks
like<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.640> reasonable<00:04:53.060> review<00:04:53.780> of<00:04:53.930> systems<00:04:54.290> for

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
like a reasonable review of systems for

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.520 
like a reasonable review of systems for
allergies<00:04:55.850> if<00:04:56.360> they<00:04:56.600> had<00:04:56.750> some<00:04:56.900> eczema<00:04:57.320> I'd

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
allergies if they had some eczema I'd

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.080 
allergies if they had some eczema I'd
probably<00:04:57.740> go<00:04:57.950> change<00:04:58.190> this<00:04:58.430> right<00:04:58.670> here<00:04:58.970> as

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
probably go change this right here as

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.830 
probably go change this right here as
well<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.860> those<00:05:01.010> are<00:05:01.220> three<00:05:01.520> quick<00:05:01.850> ways<00:05:02.090> that

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
well so those are three quick ways that

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.990 
well so those are three quick ways that
you<00:05:02.930> can<00:05:03.110> document<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:04.130> review<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.520> systems

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
you can document the review of systems

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.990 
you can document the review of systems
you<00:05:05.270> might<00:05:05.960> want<00:05:06.170> to<00:05:06.230> consider<00:05:06.760> making<00:05:07.760> a

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
you might want to consider making a

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.420 
you might want to consider making a
