00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello everyone my name is denis protoss and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.940
 Today we will talk about how to achieve 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.890
 best results when shooting video on 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.880
 camera using style settings 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.880
 Images 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.029
 shoot a video clip each of us wants 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.099
 get the highest quality 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.990
 result but if most people 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.060
 photograph prefers raw format 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.070
 knowing that on the post processing he will give them 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.739
 more flexible exposure control 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.480
 shadows and lights when videotaping 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.140
 we unfortunately have no such opportunity 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.280
 because we are dealing with h264 codec 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.399
 as I said in previous issues 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.500
 h264 codec is quite compensated 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.809
 something similar to the jpeg format for 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.350
 photographers duck here for filming this 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.330
 means that using the h264 codec you 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.620
 write less information on your 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.840
 map than you would like 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.850
 in other words, shooting video on the figure 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.620
 SLR you have to think about in advance 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.370
 volume what result you want to get 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.800
 since codec 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.420
 does not give you creative freedom to fast 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.269
 processing of course you can fix 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.070
 white balance or color your videos in 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.740
 some more pretty colors but 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.600
 increase or decrease the detail and 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.549
 control dynamic range 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.200
 You almost did not work and so 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.270
 what tools can it be 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.399
 control while shooting of course 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.259
 same image styles or how else 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.000
 called in the English menu picture 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.740
 profiles specifically to you 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.210
 could see how each of the settings 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.009
 image style will affect 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.509
 we called the result 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.390
 beautiful Lena and she with pleasure 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.250
 agreed to help us start from the very 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.170
 important point from point of sharpness 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.300
 the sharpness sounds pretty cool but on 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.610
 in fact it is not by 2 here 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.350
 is as follows as inside 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.360
 camera there is such a thing as 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.280
 processor sharpness setting in style 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.020
 image is wound up with this 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.819
 processor after he's already 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.159
 got the image from the matrix that is 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.039
 actually sharpen in style settings 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.420
 images are not uncommon this 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.640
 artificial improvement 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.380
 image clarity enhanced micro 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.030
 contrasts so essentially digital 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.830
 Sharpness inside the camera only 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.320
 worsens the picture and you are now in it 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.479
 make sure and so try to raise 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.940
 the sharpness value for this we go on 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.910
 building style image set 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.800
 maximum allowable value plus 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.780
 how do you see the images in the frame 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.230
 became not detailed rather section 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.690
 and 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.790
 and artifacts appeared and in general she 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.990
 looks extremely strange so if you 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.050
 need to get the most 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.010
 detailed image on your 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.440
 SLR or mirrorless cameras 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.480
 I recommend setting the sharpness value. 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.410
 minimal case like that you can 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.630
 see the image is obtained 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.190
 really detailed well in 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.860
 if you do not have enough sharpness you 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.540
 can add on mounting added 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.940
 Sharpen the editing process 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.040
 much nicer than the sharpness obtained 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.700
 software gain inside 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.410
 cameras 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.790
 go to contrast settings on 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.800
 what are they going to influence 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.510
 Contrast settings will affect 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.590
 image dynamic range 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.360
 which you will receive 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.660
 try to put the maximum 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.800
 contrast value of those allowable 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.540
 which we have as you see 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.910
 images look even too 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.680
 contrasting and probably this is suitable for 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.750
 shooting aggressive scenes where it is 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.670
 fits the idea but in fact it 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.400
 looks like a complete loss of information 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.790
 both in the shadows and in the colors we put 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.019
 minimum contrast value as 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.019
 see the image is obtained 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.820
 sophisticated plastic and neat 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.560
 go to saturation settings on 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.640
 that they will influence they will influence 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.650
 directly 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.390
 emotional color you get 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.190
 images try to put 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.680
 the saturation is a little bit higher but they 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.480
 as different as possible 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.739
 picture rip out your eyes as you can see 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.870
 the image is good 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.760
 rich and quite cheerful 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.549
 now try to reduce a little 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.170
 set saturation value for example 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.820
 yes we will remove them absolutely we will look that at 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.400
 get us and so as you can see 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.340
 in the image frame it becomes not so 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.380
 saturated and more suitable for shooting 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.269
 any or cinematic plots 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.140
 either to give a feeling 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.060
 detachment 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.100
 and sadness and go to the most interesting 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.739
 settings about which are increasingly 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.540
 forget the color tone setting for what 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.829
 she answers 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.940
 directly for how it will be 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.720
 skin displayed 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.190
 try to put your hero in the frame 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.110
 value as much as possible plus 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.290
 as you can see the image becomes more 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:26.170
 yellow and it is suitable for people with more 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.540
 pale skin if for example in the frame 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.000
 you man with skin pain yellow shade 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.800
 Feel free to set this setting to 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.840
 minimum then the image is obtained 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.660
 more red but since our model 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.700
 skin is fine and better set to 0 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.170
 as you can see with this setting her color 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.120
 skin displayed to the maximum 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.160
 naturally natural and beautiful now 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.420
 you know exactly how to get the most 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.100
 quality result with 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.900
 image style settings and the thing 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.820
 cool that you will only do it 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.740
 I change the settings inside the camera 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.260
 and it will save you some time on installation and 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.970
 nerves at the time material to the customer I 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.770
 name is deniz protasov see my video 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.770
 study and shoot
