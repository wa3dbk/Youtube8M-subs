00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.679
 Hello 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.310
 and so here we are with the recipe of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.990
 cous cous which is not made with cous 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.710
 cous that was not done in a manner 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.250
 in short, traditional steaming 23 times 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.830
 it is done as wrong as possible 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.439
 so in the most useless way and I could 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.489
 I only do it then the couscous 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.770
 that okay has a secular tradition e 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.149
 obviously it is a typical food of the north 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 africa but also of sicily 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.530
 western is constituted by gods 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 agglomerates or grains of 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.300
 semolina that are cooked in the steam amon 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.250
 very small diameter the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.899
 traditionally the couscous came 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.980
 prepared precisely that semolina of wheat 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.680
 hard is that grainy flour that is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.210
 can produce with a grind 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.520
 coarse using primitive millstones 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.320
 oh well but now the preparations 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 are different are used 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.229
 grains of or germs that there is a whole 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.150
 history a philosophy and should be cooked in 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.580
 naturally traditional way 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.140
 I am very attached to the cous cous because 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.140
 I even made my first and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.930
 unique encounter with coffee water during 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.610
 the Turin book fair I did 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.619
 a version of mine or that of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.150
 norm 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.240
 let us say that at least no one has perished 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.070
 that I know but it goes well I actually have 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 put only the sauce and ricotta 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.909
 salt so I did not do the cous 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.259
 cous which was very good precisely because 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.659
 cooked by two copies but routine is 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.340
 Very good 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.259
 and I had the great honor and pleasure of 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 see them at work 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.469
 not that I learned anything 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.859
 because I'm just a fool though 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.979
 something I understood then 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:53.450
 I will prepare in other versions and of course 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.250
 also the couscous in a manner 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.289
 traditional so I get caught up in 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.299
 around the net as it should be 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.789
 and we'll do it later instead 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.890
 this time it is a couscous 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.359
 how do you see beautiful balled up because 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.039
 it's very cleverly I used one 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.739
 too small pot thanks to heaven 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.989
 however the couscous with the cous cous non 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.879
 you are wrong as you could do with the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.379
 pasta in fact my dilemma or with the 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.049
 rice that is overcooked with couscous 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.840
 thank goodness you don't overdo it though 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.160
 obviously these are formed 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.829
 these little noises in these 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.079
 guru bini is that they can be anyway 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.970
 thank goodness you shit so you with 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.799
 the hands also with the addition of oil 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.459
 I still leave the link to the video 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.230
 below where I prepare the 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.790
 cus I do n't say anything clever but 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.760
 I leave you the link because to what 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.290
 apparently it does this but it is said I leave you the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.019
 link and then I leave the link 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.790
 I prepared this at last 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.829
 I suppose I spoke of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.349
 I suppose on the blog I leave you and oh well 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.230
 aridaje and I leave you again also 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.269
 super bock link and a local 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.370
 cute in turin that I love and prepare 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.019
 this very simple couscous with del 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.680
 carrots olives maize 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.540
 tomato 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.639
 nothing crazy nothing crazy 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.859
 but really yummy and tasty 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.560
 especially not too cheerful and is a 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.930
 very light dish I generally do not 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.549
 I almost never eat out of 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.790
 this guy this is the only thing 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.349
 I send out because there is no oil 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.160
 very much and therefore not 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.430
 disgusting that seems to me to be an adjective 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.079
 office was more wrong but I felt like it 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.910
 to use them and then the dop was 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.389
 practically after having revealed the cus 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.840
 race because couscous is also one 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.489
 what a food that becomes a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.349
 trusted friend in the kitchen as he can 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.239
 be kept for several days in 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.000
 fridge and so you can do different 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.280
 variations always cracks well if yes 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.590
 want to add more oil s 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.390
 right of salt because the car is not enough 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.920
 during preparation, that is, it could be 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.600
 doing nothing happens but the corsair 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.670
 so then I'd like to salt it first because 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.280
 it is important not to follow my advice 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.200
 okay and then they all jump down 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.819
 how many ingredients 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.610
 I learned this he taught me 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.709
 the smooth coca malchina among other things 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.690
 beautiful and very good anyway 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.970
 should prepare everything with your hands 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.430
 that is absolutely the couscous grapes 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.519
 there is this seasoned elaborate hands 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.459
 use of hands obviously both in the north 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.910
 Africa that in Africa itself indeed 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.859
 there are not 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.960
 in some areas even the cutlery is not 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.370
 this is the case in africa however 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.410
 this uses a lot of processing 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.090
 also with the hands of cooking 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.830
 very much with your hands so it would go 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.830
 made me right, for a matter 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.970
 let's say one because I'm just a bass 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:45.200
 intuited and then because I don't like it so much 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:48.110
 I tried but I turned to mine 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.360
 wooden ladle however you stain to whom 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.300
 like it could also try this year 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.430
 but innovation and preparation even if 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.680
 add another bit of oil in the case 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.229
 precisely where it turned out to be too dry e 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.450
 this the result is very simple 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.419
 preparation can be stored at 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.130
 long is stupid because it could 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.960
 look like a rice salad and 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.850
 actually it is not so then among other things the 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.430
 couscous is also very light 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.830
 very few fats do really well 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.229
 in short, why not abandon yourself among the 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.479
 arms of the couscous and that's it 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.870
 finished rattling I always thank you 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.120
 always always always a kiss and that's it 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.510
 I finished it I finished thankfully 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.510
 Hello
