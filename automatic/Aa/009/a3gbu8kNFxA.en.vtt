00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.360 
all right and most of these aren't
really<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.940> big<00:03:12.360> I'm<00:03:13.319> not<00:03:13.470> exactly<00:03:13.980> sure<00:03:14.129> on

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
really that big I'm not exactly sure on

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.750 
really that big I'm not exactly sure on
this<00:03:14.610> file<00:03:14.910> size<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.420> all<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.810> these<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:17.459> this

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
this file size of all of these but this

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:27.699 
this file size of all of these but this
one<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.060> particular<00:03:18.150> isn't<00:03:18.780> exactly<00:03:22.190> bagels

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.009 

and<00:03:28.709> by<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.700> way<00:03:29.910> these<00:03:30.150> are<00:03:30.209> going<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.599> be<00:03:30.660> zip

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
and by the way these are going to be zip

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.780 
and by the way these are going to be zip
files<00:03:31.349> so<00:03:32.010> you're<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.489> need<00:03:32.700> an
