right<00:00:35.060> now<00:00:35.300> take<00:00:36.230> our<00:00:36.470> thermal<00:00:37.100> paste<00:00:37.340> there

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
right now take our thermal paste there

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.780 
right now take our thermal paste there
which<00:00:38.360> you<00:00:38.420> can<00:00:38.510> write<00:00:38.690> off<00:00:38.960> ebay<00:00:39.260> but<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.160> put

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
on each on each on each the CP on the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.520 
on each on each on each the CP on the
GPU<00:00:54.220> right<00:00:55.220> enough<00:00:56.030> something<00:00:56.780> like<00:00:56.900> a<00:00:56.930> piece

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
GPU right enough something like a piece

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.110 
GPU right enough something like a piece
of<00:00:57.559> card<00:00:57.980> to<00:00:58.670> spread<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.059> around<00:01:00.160> okay<00:01:01.160> these

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
of card to spread it around okay these

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:25.340 
of card to spread it around okay these
guys<00:01:06.369> okay<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.990> got<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.290> be<00:01:12.380> very<00:01:12.410> careful

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:36.930 

small<00:01:26.350> cap<00:01:26.650> on<00:01:34.200> small<00:01:35.200> double<00:01:35.590> nice<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:36.520> one<00:01:36.820> of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
small cap on small double nice is one of

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:48.209 
small cap on small double nice is one of
them

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.620 

and<00:01:49.219> then<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.609> what<00:01:49.700> we<00:01:49.759> need<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.030> do<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:50.329> spread

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
and then I what we need to do is spread

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.740 
and then I what we need to do is spread
it<00:01:50.780> about<00:01:50.869> evenly

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.070 

ok

okay<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:07.080> spread<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.970> piece<00:02:10.570> of<00:02:10.780> card

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.610 

make<00:02:15.190> sure<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.520> nice<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.790> even<00:02:16.300> oh<00:02:19.290> right<00:02:20.290> so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
make sure it's nice and even oh right so

make sure it's nice and even oh right so
as<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.280> spread<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:22.680> thumb<00:02:23.680> paste<00:02:24.010> evenly

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
as you spread the thumb paste evenly

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.570 
as you spread the thumb paste evenly
under<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> CP<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> GPU<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.830> need<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
under the CP on the GPU I need to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.940 
under the CP on the GPU I need to
prepare<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:29.790> heatsinks<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:32.050> only<00:02:32.440> today<00:02:32.800> for

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
prepare the heatsinks so only today for

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.740 
prepare the heatsinks so only today for
art<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.220> take<00:02:33.580> some<00:02:34.120> players<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.610> take<00:02:37.240> these

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
art is take some players and take these

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.480 
art is take some players and take these
screws<00:02:38.560> out<00:02:38.860> what's<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.870> okay<00:02:41.250> now<00:02:42.250> some<00:02:42.460> of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
screws out what's up okay now some of

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.490 
screws out what's up okay now some of
them<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.850> be<00:02:43.000> quite<00:02:43.240> awkward<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.110> got<00:02:44.320> to

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
them can be quite awkward so it's got to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.730 
them can be quite awkward so it's got to
be<00:02:45.310> patient<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:49.140> they<00:02:50.140> sure<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.500> I'm<00:02:50.560> screw

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
be patient and they sure that I'm screw

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.600 
be patient and they sure that I'm screw
eventually<00:02:52.260> there's<00:02:53.260> one<00:02:53.290> now<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.340> don't

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
eventually there's one now you don't

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
eventually there's one now you don't
need<00:02:54.670> these<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.450> these<00:02:55.690> can<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:55.990> Chuck's<00:02:56.459> or

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
need these so these can be Chuck's or

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.060 
need these so these can be Chuck's or
throwing<00:02:58.630> it's<00:02:58.810> immoral<00:02:59.110> someone<00:02:59.920> or

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
throwing it's immoral someone or

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:28.110 
throwing it's immoral someone or
whatever<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.490> want<00:03:02.730> yeah<00:03:03.730> yeah

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.789 

it's<00:03:29.120> just<00:03:29.330> not<00:03:29.540> quite<00:03:29.890> competitor<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.680> that's

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
it's just not quite competitor so that's

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.600 
it's just not quite competitor so that's
one<00:03:33.980> done<00:03:34.220> now<00:03:34.790> for<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.060> next<00:03:35.209> one<00:03:36.340> now<00:03:37.340> your

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
one done now for the next one now your

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.910 
one done now for the next one now your
heating<00:03:38.450> may<00:03:38.780> look<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.049> bit<00:03:39.080> if<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.500> might<00:03:39.680> not

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
heating may look a bit if it might not

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.619 
heating may look a bit if it might not
have<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:40.370> but<00:03:40.580> this<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:40.970> one<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.450> newer

paste on the bottom of the heating's
some<00:04:26.330> teachers<00:04:26.780> pay<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.169> take<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.620> off<00:04:27.710> but

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
some teachers pay to take it off but

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.430 
some teachers pay to take it off but
it's<00:04:28.070> not<00:04:28.250> really<00:04:28.759> necessary<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:30.080> just<00:04:30.259> leave

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440

holes in place don't take them all the
way<00:07:08.100> all<00:07:08.580> at<00:07:08.790> once<00:07:17.750> okay

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.290

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
bit it does has the screws and then

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.980 
bit it does has the screws and then
schedule<00:07:36.460> instead<00:07:36.850> of<00:07:37.120> screwing<00:07:37.450> them<00:07:37.690> hard

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
schedule instead of screwing them hard

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.720 
schedule instead of screwing them hard
straight<00:07:38.470> away<00:07:39.060> all<00:07:40.060> you<00:07:40.300> have<00:07:40.450> to<00:07:40.660> do<00:07:40.810> is<00:07:41.080> to

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:41.730 
straight away all you have to do is to

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:48.320 
straight away all you have to do is to
gently<00:07:42.730> screw<00:07:43.420> them<00:07:43.630> like<00:07:44.050> this<00:07:46.710> do<00:07:47.710> them<00:07:47.950> a

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330 
gently screw them like this do them a

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.730 
gently screw them like this do them a
tiny<00:07:49.330> bit<00:07:49.600> at<00:07:49.810> a<00:07:49.930> time<00:07:50.160> because<00:07:51.160> if<00:07:51.580> if<00:07:52.060> them<00:07:52.870> it

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.740 
tiny bit at a time because if if them it

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.800 
tiny bit at a time because if if them it
might<00:07:53.980> get<00:07:54.160> a<00:07:54.220> bit<00:07:54.280> too<00:07:54.550> tight<00:07:54.580> if<00:07:56.610> if<00:07:57.810> you

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810 
might get a bit too tight if if you

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:07.050 
might get a bit too tight if if you
screw<00:07:59.440> them<00:07:59.590> all<00:07:59.680> at<00:07:59.800> 110<00:08:00.760> lat<00:08:01.180> ones<00:08:06.000> okay<00:08:07.000> so

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.060 
screw them all at 110 lat ones okay so

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.380 
screw them all at 110 lat ones okay so
do<00:08:07.510> it<00:08:07.540> really<00:08:08.050> gently
