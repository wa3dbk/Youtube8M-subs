00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.910
 contains information 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.910

 po the waterfall window option shows a drawing in front of another 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.550

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.690
 the anmat window maximizes sernac that at all times the drawing that is how 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.230

 if what is is the maximized drawing 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.910
