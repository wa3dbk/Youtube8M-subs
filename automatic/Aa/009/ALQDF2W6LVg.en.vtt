00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:44.620 
go on to say what when when it comes to
when<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.569> get<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> look<00:03:34.170> at<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:37.590> think

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.910 

so<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.900> don't<00:03:46.290> know<00:03:46.349> whether<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.590> picked<00:03:46.800> the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
so I don't know whether you picked the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.410 
so I don't know whether you picked the
fault<00:03:47.130> obviously<00:03:47.550> Brett<00:03:48.060> didn't<00:03:48.300> have<00:03:48.390> a

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
fault obviously Brett didn't have a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.240 
fault obviously Brett didn't have a
chance<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:48.959> fault<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.980> was

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
chance to you know fault but it was

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.130 
chance to you know fault but it was
indeed<00:03:50.760> they'll<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.450> another<00:03:51.660> look<00:03:51.930> at<00:03:52.050> it

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
indeed they'll have another look at it

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.960 
indeed they'll have another look at it
but<00:03:52.290> keep<00:03:52.470> an<00:03:52.590> eye<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:53.069> not<00:03:53.220> hard<00:03:53.459> keep<00:03:53.850> an

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
but keep an eye it's not hard keep an

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.340 
but keep an eye it's not hard keep an
eye<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.090> Harrison's<00:03:54.720> chest

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
eye on Harrison's chest

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.440 
eye on Harrison's chest
he's<00:03:55.739> an<00:03:55.890> easy<00:03:56.040> person<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.489> look<00:03:56.670> at<00:03:56.850> your<00:03:57.330> eyes

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
he's an easy person to look at your eyes

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.190 
he's an easy person to look at your eyes

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
should be no area yeah what it is indeed

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.509 
should be no area yeah what it is indeed
it's<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.470> reflection<00:04:01.830> isn't<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
it's the reflection isn't it the

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.100 
it's the reflection isn't it the
reflection<00:04:03.000> here<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> piece<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.810> glass

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110

yeah you can say the reflection of this
night<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.069> glass<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.430> can<00:04:11.549> even<00:04:11.700> say<00:04:11.910> it's

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
night in the glass you can even say it's

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.349 
night in the glass you can even say it's
I<00:04:13.849> see<00:04:14.849> that
