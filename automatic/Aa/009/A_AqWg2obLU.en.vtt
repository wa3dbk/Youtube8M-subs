the scale so you remember how to make

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.440 
the scale so you remember how to make
chords<00:02:17.620> using<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.130> simple<00:02:18.519> formula<00:02:19.000> so

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
chords using that simple formula so

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.020 
chords using that simple formula so
you're<00:02:19.570> going<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.840> make<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> C<00:02:20.380> chord<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.030> F

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
you're going to make a C chord and F

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.190 
you're going to make a C chord and F
chord<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.890> G<00:02:24.070> chord<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.870> those<00:02:25.870> three
