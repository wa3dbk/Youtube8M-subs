00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.980 
that fits on to the end of a ratchet so
anyways<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.030> did<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> torques<00:01:51.840> but

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
anyways I did it with the torques but

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.510 
anyways I did it with the torques but
actually<00:01:52.320> they're<00:01:52.619> also<00:01:52.770> ten<00:01:53.070> millimeters

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
actually they're also ten millimeters

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.950 
actually they're also ten millimeters
almost<00:01:53.790> everything<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> RAM

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
almost everything on that's on the RAM

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.469 
almost everything on that's on the RAM
is<00:01:55.110> ten<00:01:55.320> millimeters<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.909> took<00:01:57.119> those<00:01:57.270> off

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
is ten millimeters and I took those off

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.980 
is ten millimeters and I took those off
and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.560> there's<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.159> more<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.750> he's<00:02:00.750> kind

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and then there's one more and he's kind

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.679 
and then there's one more and he's kind
