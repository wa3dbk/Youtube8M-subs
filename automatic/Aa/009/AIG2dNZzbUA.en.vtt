00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
strong it is how fast it is so let's so

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.250 
strong it is how fast it is so let's so
it<00:03:48.419> is<00:03:48.510> now<00:03:48.630> verifying<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.440> update<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:51.540> it

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.540 
we're at the apple logo black screen
that's<00:04:19.109> normal<00:04:21.229> but<00:04:22.229> let's<00:04:22.740> see<00:04:23.010> if<00:04:23.250> I'll<00:04:23.520> be

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
that's normal but let's see if I'll be

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.659 
that's normal but let's see if I'll be
able<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.090> get<00:04:24.210> this<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.510> work<00:04:24.540> here<00:04:24.990> all<00:04:25.680> right

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
able to get this to work here all right

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.550 
able to get this to work here all right
so<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:26.970> looks<00:04:27.060> like<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.660> are<00:04:27.690> doing<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.169> software

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
so it looks like we are doing a software

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.560 
so it looks like we are doing a software
update<00:04:28.680> via<00:04:28.979> iTunes<00:04:29.340> but<00:04:29.940> in<00:04:30.090> fact<00:04:30.240> we<00:04:30.540> are

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
update via iTunes but in fact we are

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.860 
update via iTunes but in fact we are
doing<00:04:30.960> this<00:04:31.199> via<00:04:31.740> our<00:04:31.949> ipod<00:04:32.400> touch<00:04:32.669> here<00:04:32.970> so

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
doing this via our ipod touch here so

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.120 
doing this via our ipod touch here so
well<00:04:34.260> it's<00:04:34.380> like<00:04:34.500> things<00:04:34.830> are<00:04:34.949> going<00:04:35.039> pretty

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
well it's like things are going pretty

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.340 
well it's like things are going pretty
smoothly<00:04:35.520> here<00:04:35.870> so<00:04:36.870> this<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.080> what<00:04:37.229> you

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
smoothly here so this is what you

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.320 
smoothly here so this is what you
basically<00:04:37.530> see<00:04:37.919> when<00:04:38.070> you<00:04:38.130> do<00:04:38.250> an<00:04:38.340> update<00:04:39.000> via

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
basically see when you do an update via

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.590 
basically see when you do an update via
iTunes<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.190> very<00:04:41.190> cool<00:04:41.729> so<00:04:41.970> they<00:04:42.090> kept<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
iTunes so very cool so they kept the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.020 
iTunes so very cool so they kept the
default<00:04:42.960> screen<00:04:43.820> for<00:04:44.820> everything<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.880> it

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
default screen for everything so it

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.950 
default screen for everything so it
looks<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.210> it's<00:04:48.389> going<00:04:48.539> to<00:04:48.630> go<00:04:48.690> through<00:04:48.840> some

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
looks like it's going to go through some

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.290 
looks like it's going to go through some

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
rebooted here and a one thing I know is

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.200 
rebooted here and a one thing I know is
we're<00:05:07.710> off<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.919> bat<00:05:08.130> it<00:05:08.340> seems<00:05:08.580> like<00:05:08.760> just<00:05:08.940> a

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
we're off the bat it seems like just a

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.029 
we're off the bat it seems like just a
little<00:05:09.539> bit<00:05:09.660> smoother<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.169> me<00:05:10.260> just<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.560> tiny

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
little bit smoother to me just a tiny

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.969 
little bit smoother to me just a tiny
bit<00:05:11.220> smoother<00:05:12.110> might<00:05:13.110> now<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:13.590> might<00:05:13.770> just

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
bit smoother might now that might just

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.110 
bit smoother might now that might just
me<00:05:14.160> but<00:05:14.400> it<00:05:14.520> does<00:05:14.669> seem<00:05:14.789> a<00:05:14.880> little<00:05:14.970> bit

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
me but it does seem a little bit

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.850 
me but it does seem a little bit
smoother<00:05:15.360> just<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.050> prove<00:05:16.200> that<00:05:16.260> I'm<00:05:16.470> on<00:05:16.560> iOS

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
smoother just to prove that I'm on iOS
