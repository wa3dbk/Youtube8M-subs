00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.800 
lines and I decided on Shiseido white
Lucent<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.120> I've<00:02:36.240> mentioned<00:02:36.450> it

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
Lucent and I think I've mentioned it

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.360 
Lucent and I think I've mentioned it
before<00:02:36.960> but<00:02:37.740> all<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> did<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.700> buy<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.390> trial

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
before but all I did was buy a trial

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.760 
before but all I did was buy a trial
someone<00:02:41.370> had<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.690> their<00:02:43.050> little<00:02:43.230> bonus

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
someone had you know their little bonus

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.270 
someone had you know their little bonus
gift<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.720> Shiseido<00:02:46.170> whitening<00:02:46.710> line<00:02:46.950> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
gift of the Shiseido whitening line and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.100 
gift of the Shiseido whitening line and
that<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.820> just<00:02:48.120> bought<00:02:48.300> all<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.840> try<00:02:49.050> it

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
that so I just bought all this to try it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.190 
that so I just bought all this to try it
because<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.680> tube<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.640> full<00:02:51.480> size<00:02:51.720> is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
because a tube like this full size is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.220 
because a tube like this full size is
like<00:02:52.640> 120<00:02:53.640> dollars<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.360> there's<00:02:54.900> no<00:02:55.050> way<00:02:55.200> I

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
like 120 dollars so there's no way I

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.990 
like 120 dollars so there's no way I
could<00:02:55.530> afford<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.160> not<00:02:56.370> knowing<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:56.880> it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
could afford it and not knowing if it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.340 
could afford it and not knowing if it
worked<00:02:57.240> or<00:02:57.480> not<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.410> I've<00:02:59.420> been<00:03:00.420> using<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.050> for

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
worked or not so I've been using it for

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.830 
worked or not so I've been using it for
