00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
after running a very stuck car my turret

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.000 
after running a very stuck car my turret
get<00:03:35.030> jammed<00:03:35.930> up<00:03:36.260> it's<00:03:37.250> hard<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.490> steer<00:03:39.010> this

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
get jammed up it's hard to steer this

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.100 
get jammed up it's hard to steer this
piece<00:03:40.310> here<00:03:40.550> I've<00:03:40.670> already<00:03:40.790> cut<00:03:41.030> off<00:03:41.180> goes<00:03:41.930> up

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
piece here I've already cut off goes up

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.550 
piece here I've already cut off goes up
in<00:03:42.230> here<00:03:43.990> like<00:03:44.990> so

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
in here like so

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.670 
in here like so
and<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:46.400> piece<00:03:47.030> there<00:03:47.210> my<00:03:48.050> finger<00:03:48.350> was<00:03:48.470> stuck

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
and that piece there my finger was stuck

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.840 
and that piece there my finger was stuck
so<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:48.860> had<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.010> cut<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.250> video<00:03:49.460> off<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.640> saws

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
the fire well wheel well in and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.210 
the fire well wheel well in and
the<00:04:25.360> full<00:04:25.569> defender<00:04:25.990> over<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.860> I'm<00:04:27.099> gonna

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
the full defender over and I'm gonna

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.330 
the full defender over and I'm gonna
take<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.400> run<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.669> carriage<00:04:28.030> bolt<00:04:28.270> up<00:04:29.169> through

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
take a run a carriage bolt up through

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.890 
take a run a carriage bolt up through
inside<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.490> car<00:04:30.729> it's<00:04:31.389> just<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.599> hold<00:04:31.720> in

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
inside the car it's just to hold in

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.080 
inside the car it's just to hold in
place<00:04:32.169> I<00:04:32.440> might<00:04:33.280> weld<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.639> but<00:04:33.759> I<00:04:33.819> think<00:04:33.880> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
place I might weld it but I think the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.089 
place I might weld it but I think the
carriage<00:04:34.360> bold<00:04:34.599> idea<00:04:34.870> but<00:04:35.080> just<00:04:35.259> worked<00:04:35.500> fine

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
carriage bold idea but just worked fine

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.700 
carriage bold idea but just worked fine
I<00:04:36.810> mean<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.139> beat<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.500> with<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.620> hammer

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
I mean you can beat it with a hammer

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.430 
I mean you can beat it with a hammer
hope<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.340> stays<00:04:39.580> but<00:04:40.020> one<00:04:41.020> bolt<00:04:41.289> would

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
hope it stays but one bolt would

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.230 
hope it stays but one bolt would
probably<00:04:41.770> hold<00:04:41.889> it<00:04:42.130> or<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.340> couple<00:04:42.729> tack<00:04:42.970> walls

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
probably hold it or a couple tack walls

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.719 
probably hold it or a couple tack walls
you<00:04:43.360> can<00:04:43.419> get<00:04:43.630> while<00:04:43.780> they're<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.020> there

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729

tore<00:05:02.919> through<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.210> had<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.389> three<00:05:04.569> point

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.969 
tore through and I had a three point
wrench<00:05:04.900> bullet<00:05:05.289> going<00:05:05.470> down<00:05:05.680> through<00:05:05.800> the

wrench bullet going down through the

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.950

frame<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:07.000> bolts<00:05:07.270> only<00:05:07.360> about<00:05:07.569> four<00:05:07.780> inches

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
frame that bolts only about four inches

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.120 
frame that bolts only about four inches
long<00:05:08.169> so<00:05:08.409> it's<00:05:08.530> not<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:08.860> long<00:05:09.840> so<00:05:10.979> and<00:05:11.979> then

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
long so it's not that long so and then

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.890 
long so it's not that long so and then
like<00:05:12.340> I<00:05:12.430> said<00:05:12.639> that<00:05:12.759> helps<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.060> lot<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.270> think<00:05:13.479> I

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
like I said that helps a lot I think I

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.680 
like I said that helps a lot I think I
personally<00:05:14.139> think<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:15.210> just<00:05:16.210> humps<00:05:16.539> from

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
personally think it just humps from

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.510 
personally think it just humps from
blowing<00:05:16.960> out<00:05:17.050> a<00:05:17.080> little<00:05:17.380> bit<00:05:17.530> I<00:05:17.830> think<00:05:18.430> it

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
blowing out a little bit I think it

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.890 
blowing out a little bit I think it
keeps<00:05:18.699> all<00:05:18.909> this<00:05:19.060> middle<00:05:19.300> of<00:05:19.330> nice<00:05:19.509> and<00:05:19.690> tight

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
keeps all this middle of nice and tight

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.029 
keeps all this middle of nice and tight
because<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.139> got<00:05:20.289> it<00:05:20.380> bolted<00:05:20.500> right<00:05:20.650> here

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
because you got it bolted right here

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.279 
because you got it bolted right here
bolted<00:05:21.729> right<00:05:21.759> here<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.509> bolted<00:05:22.870> right<00:05:22.900> there

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
bolted right here and bolted right there

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.320 
bolted right here and bolted right there
so<00:05:24.190> now<00:05:24.340> for<00:05:24.430> those<00:05:24.580> homes<00:05:24.849> to<00:05:24.940> blow<00:05:25.120> out

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
so now for those homes to blow out

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.790 
so now for those homes to blow out
they're<00:05:25.930> gonna<00:05:26.020> have<00:05:26.139> to<00:05:26.199> bend<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.680> whole

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
they're gonna have to bend the whole

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.640 
they're gonna have to bend the whole
body<00:05:27.009> as<00:05:27.639> to<00:05:27.940> before<00:05:28.389> if<00:05:29.020> you<00:05:29.139> got<00:05:29.289> too<00:05:29.500> much

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
body as to before if you got too much

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.520 
body as to before if you got too much
loose<00:05:30.009> you<00:05:31.000> know<00:05:31.090> rubbery<00:05:31.419> mounts<00:05:31.780> in<00:05:31.870> it<00:05:32.020> the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
loose you know rubbery mounts in it the

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.080 
loose you know rubbery mounts in it the
Frank<00:05:32.800> can<00:05:32.949> come<00:05:33.130> down<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.490> potty<00:05:33.729> can<00:05:33.940> all

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
Frank can come down the potty can all

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.070 
Frank can come down the potty can all
stay<00:05:34.360> up<00:05:34.570> or<00:05:36.210> that'll<00:05:37.210> come<00:05:37.360> down<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.840> that'll

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
stay up or that'll come down and that'll

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.379 
stay up or that'll come down and that'll
go<00:05:38.199> up<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:39.370> you're<00:05:39.520> going<00:05:39.669> officer<00:05:40.000> Russian

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
go up and you're going officer Russian

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.629 
go up and you're going officer Russian
you'll<00:05:40.659> blow<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.080> home<00:05:41.289> so<00:05:41.530> I<00:05:41.949> think<00:05:42.430> that

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
you'll blow the home so I think that

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.370 
you'll blow the home so I think that
makes<00:05:42.789> up<00:05:42.909> it<00:05:43.509> only<00:05:43.690> makes<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:43.990> little<00:05:44.139> bit<00:05:44.289> of

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
makes up it only makes a little bit of

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.959 
makes up it only makes a little bit of
difference<00:05:44.680> but<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:45.250> little<00:05:45.610> bit<00:05:45.729> here<00:05:45.880> and

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969 
difference but a little bit here and

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:46.320 
difference but a little bit here and
there

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
there

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330 
there
it's<00:05:46.930> a<00:05:46.990> good<00:05:47.139> good<00:05:47.650> way<00:05:47.710> to<00:05:47.860> make<00:05:48.009> your<00:05:48.130> car

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
it's a good good way to make your car

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.680 
it's a good good way to make your car
strong<00:05:48.699> if<00:05:48.880> you<00:05:48.969> can<00:05:49.090> do<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.210> little<00:05:49.330> bit<00:05:49.449> here<00:05:49.659> a

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
strong if you can do a little bit here a

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.540 
strong if you can do a little bit here a
little<00:05:49.780> bit<00:05:50.050> there<00:05:50.280> it<00:05:51.280> adds<00:05:51.460> all<00:05:51.669> adds<00:05:51.909> up<00:05:52.120> but

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
little bit there it adds all adds up but

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.070 
little bit there it adds all adds up but
I<00:05:54.550> thought<00:05:54.789> of<00:05:54.880> going<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:55.150> real<00:05:55.300> quick<00:05:55.539> which

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
I thought of going that real quick which

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.779 
I thought of going that real quick which
scene<00:05:56.680> it's<00:05:56.919> almost<00:05:57.159> six<00:05:57.340> minutes<00:05:57.639> so<00:05:57.729> it

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
scene it's almost six minutes so it

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.909 
scene it's almost six minutes so it
wasn't<00:05:58.030> that<00:05:58.120> quick<00:05:58.360> but<00:05:59.319> it<00:05:59.409> wasn't<00:05:59.680> as<00:05:59.740> bad

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
wasn't that quick but it wasn't as bad

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.270 
wasn't that quick but it wasn't as bad
as<00:06:00.069> my<00:06:00.190> 15<00:06:00.639> minute<00:06:00.940> video<00:06:01.060> last<00:06:01.750> so<00:06:02.190> see<00:06:03.190> you

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280
