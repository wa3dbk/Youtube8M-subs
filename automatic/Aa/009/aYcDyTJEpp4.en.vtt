00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.379
 the authorities of a Ukrainian city 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.090
 They decided to free the streets of the 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.620
 stray dogs burning the in 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.080
 crematoriums as part of the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.490
 preparations for eurocopa-2012 a 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.470
 despite the strong opposition of the 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.599
 animal advocates authorities 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.880
 justify their actions for reasons of 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.859
 security as they fight against these 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.170
 such atrocious measures that we have in 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.600
 our report 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.029
 a mobile crematorium to kill the 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.529
 problem of stray dogs the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.869
 small town administration 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.100
 Ukrainian has assured that the artifact 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.390
 It is very useful and its use is fully 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.420
 justified due to the risk that 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.820
 represent the street animals the 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.820
 measure is part of the preparation that 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.530
 carries out the country on the eve of the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.900
 eurocopa-2012 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.660
 we put this mobile crematorium and now 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.610
 we are able to cover long areas and 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.350
 even neighboring cities there has been 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.089
 some opposition but it never came to 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.979
 more we fight against the 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.680
 bites of stray dogs and the 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.659
 infection spread the machine will 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.030
 cost about $ 20,000 at 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.400
 authorities but failed to resolve the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.710
 problem because it generated a whole wave of 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.210
 indignation of the local population and 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.540
 defense organizations of the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.460
 animals have published a petition and 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.100
 More than 200,000 people have already signed 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.330
 the text placed on the internet but not 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.799
 they manage to change the government's position 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.750
 the local inhabitants believe that the 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.530
 dogs are still alive when they put them 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.090
 crematorium 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.190
 and we do not have any evidence 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.710
 of the poison that would be used to 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.570
 sacrifice the truth is that the only 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.450
 efficient way to regulate the number of 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.100
 these animals is sterilization and 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.770
 we will continue to advocate for this method 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.500
 that already proved its effectiveness in europe 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.899
 meanwhile michel platini president 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.390
 of the ufa visit to ukraine for 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.670
 inspect the sports stadiums the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.710
 animal advocates have begun 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.649
 to ask him to collaborate to stop the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.149
 killing dogs or even nullifying 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.670
 the competitions the request of 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.520
 cancel the euro-2012 is not surprising 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.459
 in 2010 we sent a letter to different 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.470
 people and michel platini himself 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.900
 asked to advise Prime Minister Kollasnikov 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.450
 stop this atrocity with animals 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.390
 a year has passed and we have not seen any 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.790
 result to catch the cup uefa is a 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.069
 great honor for any country looking for 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.480
 raise the prestige of ukraine and 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.670
 guarantee the safety of 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.860
 championship participants 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.050
 authorities go to all kinds of 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.030
 measurements 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.100
 but it is not yet clear what is more 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.380
 important for the Ukrainian government 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.960
 success in building and 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.960
 organization of euro-2012 or the 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.430
 respect for the rights of animals 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.430
