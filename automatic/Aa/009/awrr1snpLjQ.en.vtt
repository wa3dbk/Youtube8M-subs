thing<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.980> always<00:00:08.069> do<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.269> keep<00:00:09.480> my

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
thing that I always do is that I keep my

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.480 
thing that I always do is that I keep my
left<00:00:09.900> hand<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.410> close<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> fret<00:00:11.130> board<00:00:11.190> as

left hand as close to the fret board as

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.459 
left hand as close to the fret board as
possible<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.540> eliminates<00:00:12.990> any<00:00:13.170> big

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
possible that eliminates any big

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.670 
possible that eliminates any big
distances<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.250> my<00:00:14.400> fingers<00:00:14.820> have<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.210> travel

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
distances that my fingers have to travel

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.939 
distances that my fingers have to travel
also<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.710> keep<00:00:17.039> my<00:00:17.190> right<00:00:17.400> hand<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:18.289> a<00:00:19.289> constant

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
also I keep my right hand in a constant

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.720 
also I keep my right hand in a constant
form<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.400> don't<00:00:20.670> strum<00:00:21.769> and<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.010> don't<00:00:23.279> make<00:00:23.430> any

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
form I don't strum and I don't make any

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.429 
form I don't strum and I don't make any
other<00:00:23.939> movement<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.689> sort<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.109> keep<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
other movement with it I sort of keep it

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.240 
other movement with it I sort of keep it
the<00:00:25.800> same<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.970> same<00:00:27.000> form<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.980> just

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the same the same form and then I just

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
the same the same form and then I just
move<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.609> arm<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.150> down<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.380> makes

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
move my arm up and down and that makes

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.790 
move my arm up and down and that makes
the<00:00:31.890> sweep<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.750> lot<00:00:33.750> more<00:00:33.899> fluent<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> lot

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the sweep a lot more fluent and a lot

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.700 
the sweep a lot more fluent and a lot
more<00:00:34.980> smooth<00:00:35.719> also<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> believe<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.110> tension

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
more smooth also I believe that tension

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
more smooth also I believe that tension
can<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:38.129> hinder<00:00:38.250> your<00:00:38.489> playing<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.540> make

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
can really hinder your playing so make

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
can really hinder your playing so make

picking hands sort of loose you don't

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.200 
picking hands sort of loose you don't
want<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.770> digging<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.149> strings<00:00:59.210> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
want to be digging into the strings but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
want to be digging into the strings but
you<00:01:00.390> want<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> keep<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.960> hands<00:01:01.260> sort<00:01:01.649> of
