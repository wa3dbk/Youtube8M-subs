00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
against creating separate youtube

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
against creating separate youtube
channels<00:01:41.250> because<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.630> opinion<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.380> do

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
channels because in my opinion if you do

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.139 
channels because in my opinion if you do
that<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.009> usually<00:01:44.189> forget<00:01:44.670> about<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:45.030> other

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that you usually forget about your other

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.999 
that you usually forget about your other
account<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.439> put<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.680> much

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
account because you put so much

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
account because you put so much
attention<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.270> account<00:01:48.479> than<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> other

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
attention on one account than the other

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.539 
attention on one account than the other
you're<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.320> oh<00:01:49.530> wait<00:01:49.740> i<00:01:49.770> haven't<00:01:50.159> uploaded<00:01:50.310> a
