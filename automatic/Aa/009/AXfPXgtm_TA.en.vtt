00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
back to work as much as it's about

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.130 
back to work as much as it's about
having<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.610> healthy<00:02:29.730> environment<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.630> when<00:02:31.050> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
having a healthy environment so when you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.960 
having a healthy environment so when you

in<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.300> kind<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.540> situation<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.380> we're

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
in this kind of situation so we're

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.990 
in this kind of situation so we're
exciting<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.670> when<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.850> see

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
exciting but I think when you see

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.460 
exciting but I think when you see
facilities<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.750> Oh<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.290> big

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
facilities like this Oh in the big

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.050 
facilities like this Oh in the big
picture<00:02:37.650> you're<00:02:38.340> gonna<00:02:38.430> see<00:02:38.700> people<00:02:38.970> from

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
picture you're gonna see people from

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.580 
picture you're gonna see people from
other<00:02:39.270> states<00:02:39.600> coming<00:02:40.020> here<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> see<00:02:40.440> how<00:02:40.560> we

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
other states coming here to see how we

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.970 
other states coming here to see how we
do<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.610> us<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.239> come<00:02:42.780> up<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:43.230> 15<00:02:43.739> million

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
do it for us to come up with 15 million

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
frankly we probably would have not been

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.600 
frankly we probably would have not been
