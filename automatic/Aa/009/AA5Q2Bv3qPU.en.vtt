00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
water in the bags was 92 degrees so that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.210 
water in the bags was 92 degrees so that
was<00:00:41.480> pretty<00:00:41.600> toasty<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:42.350> little<00:00:42.860> worried<00:00:43.130> about

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
was pretty toasty a little worried about

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.250 
was pretty toasty a little worried about
that<00:00:43.370> only<00:00:43.820> one<00:00:44.120> bag<00:00:44.420> looked<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.810> little<00:00:44.930> gross

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
that only one bag looked a little gross

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.980 
that only one bag looked a little gross
the<00:00:45.470> other<00:00:45.560> ones<00:00:45.770> looked<00:00:45.950> okay<00:00:46.720> reads<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:47.870> go

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
the other ones looked okay reads to go

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.900 
the other ones looked okay reads to go
included<00:00:48.560> a<00:00:48.680> piece<00:00:48.860> of<00:00:48.890> tubing<00:00:49.310> just<00:00:49.610> for<00:00:49.760> drip

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
included a piece of tubing just for drip

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.400 
included a piece of tubing just for drip
acclamation<00:00:50.450> so<00:00:50.600> I'm<00:00:50.690> stealing<00:00:51.050> some<00:00:51.200> water

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
acclamation so I'm stealing some water

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.380 
acclamation so I'm stealing some water
for<00:00:51.560> my<00:00:51.650> frag<00:00:51.890> tank<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:53.090> can<00:00:53.210> see<00:00:53.329> I'm

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
for my frag tank and you can see I'm

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.940 
for my frag tank and you can see I'm
just<00:00:53.570> dripping<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:53.900> in<00:00:53.990> here<00:00:54.170> one<00:00:54.320> by<00:00:54.500> one<00:00:54.710> and

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
just dripping it in here one by one and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.160 
just dripping it in here one by one and
I'm<00:00:55.820> allowing<00:00:56.060> all<00:00:56.300> these<00:00:56.420> snails<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:56.930> stuff

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
I'm allowing all these snails and stuff

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.290 
I'm allowing all these snails and stuff
to<00:00:57.260> get<00:00:57.350> used<00:00:57.560> to<00:00:57.800> my<00:00:58.160> salinity<00:00:58.700> which<00:00:59.090> is

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
to get used to my salinity which is

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.630 
to get used to my salinity which is
around<00:00:59.510> 1<00:00:59.720> point<00:00:59.960> 0<00:01:00.020> to<00:01:00.079> 3<00:01:00.470> currently<00:01:00.950> the

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
around 1 point 0 to 3 currently the

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.899 
around 1 point 0 to 3 currently the
water<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:02.000> their<00:01:02.120> bags<00:01:02.300> is<00:01:02.540> one<00:01:02.750> point<00:01:03.129> 019<00:01:04.129> so

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
water in their bags is one point 019 so

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.370 
water in their bags is one point 019 so
it<00:01:05.089> was<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.239> little<00:01:05.329> bit<00:01:05.509> lower<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:06.020> won't<00:01:06.200> take

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
it was a little bit lower it won't take

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.230 
it was a little bit lower it won't take
much<00:01:06.560> but<00:01:07.159> really<00:01:07.399> getting<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.729> from<00:01:07.820> 92

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
much but really getting it from 92

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.609 
much but really getting it from 92
degrees<00:01:08.570> down<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.110> something<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.500> little

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
degrees down to something a little

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.100 
degrees down to something a little
closer<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.130> my<00:01:10.280> tank<00:01:10.579> which<00:01:10.820> is<00:01:10.939> around<00:01:11.120> 78.7

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
closer to my tank which is around 78.7

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.469 
closer to my tank which is around 78.7
look<00:01:12.860> at<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:13.070> pH<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.729> temperature<00:01:13.790> of<00:01:14.270> match

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
look at that pH and temperature of match

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.080 
look at that pH and temperature of match
craziness<00:01:15.340> anyway<00:01:16.340> I'm<00:01:16.610> thinking<00:01:16.970> these<00:01:17.030> guys

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
craziness anyway I'm thinking these guys

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.790 
craziness anyway I'm thinking these guys
will<00:01:17.390> be<00:01:17.479> okay<00:01:17.750> we'll<00:01:17.990> see<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.229> might<00:01:18.530> have<00:01:18.650> one

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
will be okay we'll see I might have one

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.250 
will be okay we'll see I might have one
or<00:01:18.830> two<00:01:19.040> losses<00:01:19.479> there<00:01:20.479> was<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.600> large<00:01:20.810> cereth

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
or two losses there was a large cereth

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.539 
or two losses there was a large cereth
in<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.470> bag<00:01:21.620> with<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.860> small<00:01:22.130> ones<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.400> that
