00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.300 
people that have a older system and they
don't<00:01:53.140> want<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.409> take<00:01:53.560> as<00:01:53.710> much<00:01:53.859> system

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
don't want to take as much system

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.249 
don't want to take as much system
resources<00:01:54.850> up<00:01:54.999> may<00:01:55.450> turn<00:01:55.719> down<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:55.990> polling

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
resources up may turn down the polling

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.050 
resources up may turn down the polling
rate<00:01:56.439> slightly<00:01:56.710> yeah<00:01:57.249> and<00:01:57.429> then<00:01:57.549> when<00:01:57.789> you<00:01:57.909> go

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
rate slightly yeah and then when you go

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.849 
rate slightly yeah and then when you go
to<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.270> BIOS<00:01:58.600> mode<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:59.319> will<00:01:59.530> give<00:01:59.770> you

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
to the BIOS mode it will give you

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:03.090 
to the BIOS mode it will give you
compatibility<00:02:00.759> with<00:02:01.060> some<00:02:01.929> popular<00:02:02.499> KVM

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
compatibility with some popular KVM

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.550 
compatibility with some popular KVM
switches<00:02:03.429> out<00:02:03.670> there<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.420> not<00:02:04.600> only<00:02:04.749> working

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
switches out there so not only working

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.770 
switches out there so not only working
with<00:02:05.770> motherboards<00:02:06.490> but<00:02:06.700> also<00:02:06.850> KVM<00:02:07.450> switches

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
with motherboards but also KVM switches

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.740 
with motherboards but also KVM switches
so<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.650> again<00:02:09.040> that<00:02:09.220> added

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
so just again that added

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.600 
so just again that added
ability<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.009> able<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> operate<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
ability to be able to operate the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850 
ability to be able to operate the
keyboard<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.300> any<00:02:12.630> kind<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> environment<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
keyboard in any kind of environment the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.890 
keyboard in any kind of environment the
other<00:02:14.450> improvement<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.570> we've<00:02:15.690> made<00:02:15.870> here

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
other improvement that we've made here

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.920 
other improvement that we've made here
is<00:02:16.260> there's<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.250> way<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
is there's actually a way to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.870 
is there's actually a way to
individually<00:02:18.930> program<00:02:19.440> how<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.770> have<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
individually program how you have the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.260 
individually program how you have the
keyboard<00:02:21.300> light<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.880> don't<00:02:23.970> even<00:02:24.120> need

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
keyboard light up so you don't even need

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.440 
keyboard light up so you don't even need
any<00:02:24.480> software<00:02:25.220> hold<00:02:26.220> down<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.760> button<00:02:26.940> here

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
any software hold down the button here

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.780 
any software hold down the button here
for<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> couple<00:02:28.050> seconds<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.490> go<00:02:29.610> so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
for a couple seconds so here you go so

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.370 
for a couple seconds so here you go so
you<00:02:29.820> can<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.660> here's<00:02:31.050> your<00:02:31.170> typical

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
you can if you have here's your typical

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.130 
you can if you have here's your typical
kind<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.950> that's<00:02:32.850> pretty<00:02:33.150> ridiculous<00:02:33.510> yeah

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
kind of that's pretty ridiculous yeah

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140 
kind of that's pretty ridiculous yeah
yeah<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.650> got<00:02:34.800> your<00:02:34.950> typical<00:02:35.130> FPS<00:02:35.459> keys

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
yeah so you got your typical FPS keys

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.699 
yeah so you got your typical FPS keys
lit<00:02:36.450> up<00:02:36.570> here<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.870> mean<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.290> customize

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
lit up here I mean you can customize

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.460 
lit up here I mean you can customize
this<00:02:37.950> requires<00:02:38.400> no<00:02:38.640> software<00:02:39.260> using<00:02:40.260> all<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
this requires no software using all the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.340 
this requires no software using all the
hardware<00:02:40.800> buttons<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.520> keyboard<00:02:42.350> and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
you've got multiple brightness levels

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.830 
you've got multiple brightness levels
just<00:02:46.709> like<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> previous<00:02:47.070> keyboards

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
just like the previous keyboards

just like the previous keyboards
everything<00:02:48.840> else<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.170> pretty<00:02:49.590> much<00:02:49.709> brought

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
typing mode so by hitting a combination

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.509 
typing mode so by hitting a combination
of<00:03:39.209> keys<00:03:39.450> which<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.870> control<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.040> program

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
of keys which is control and the program

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.880 
of keys which is control and the program
button<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.570> will<00:03:42.720> set<00:03:42.930> up<00:03:43.019> reactive<00:03:43.470> typing

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
button that will set up reactive typing

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.819 
button that will set up reactive typing
so<00:03:44.370> whenever<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.910> press<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> key<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.829> release

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
so whenever you press a key and release

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.790 
so whenever you press a key and release
it<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.280> will<00:03:47.489> light<00:03:47.640> up

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.730 

now<00:03:51.760> what<00:03:51.970> kind<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.150> materials<00:03:52.570> we<00:03:52.720> have<00:03:52.840> going

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
now what kind of materials we have going

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.200 
now what kind of materials we have going
into<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.220> what's<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.790> frame<00:03:54.970> matter

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
into this like what's the frame matter

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.350 
into this like what's the frame matter
now<00:03:55.630> so<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.960> frame<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.730> 100%<00:03:57.730> brushed

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
now so the frame is 100% brushed

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.960 
now so the frame is 100% brushed
aluminum<00:03:59.130> actually<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.310> black<00:04:00.610> ones<00:04:00.850> are

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
aluminum actually the black ones are

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.680 
aluminum actually the black ones are
anodized<00:04:02.520> but<00:04:03.520> it's<00:04:03.640> very<00:04:03.850> solid<00:04:04.090> keyboard<00:04:04.570> I

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
anodized but it's very solid keyboard I

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.090 
anodized but it's very solid keyboard I
mean<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.110> this<00:04:05.320> is<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.470> keyboard<00:04:05.800> that<00:04:05.920> if

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
mean this is this is a keyboard that if

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.070 
mean this is this is a keyboard that if
you<00:04:06.190> drop<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.460> it's<00:04:07.330> not<00:04:07.480> going<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.690> break<00:04:07.840> I

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
you drop it it's not going to break I

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.600 
you drop it it's not going to break I
mean<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.290> might<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.440> get<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.680> key<00:04:08.890> pop<00:04:09.190> off<00:04:09.400> if

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
mean you might I get a key pop off if

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.430 
mean you might I get a key pop off if
you<00:04:09.730> drop<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.060> hard<00:04:10.240> enough<00:04:10.330> but<00:04:10.690> put<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.320> right

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
you drop it hard enough but put it right

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.290 
you drop it hard enough but put it right
back<00:04:11.560> together<00:04:11.770> so<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.670> got<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.850> back<00:04:12.970> pretty

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
back together so you got the back pretty

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.720 
back together so you got the back pretty
