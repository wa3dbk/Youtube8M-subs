today now you can learn a lot about

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.289 
today now you can learn a lot about
animals<00:01:37.020> by<00:01:37.470> looking<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> footprints<00:01:38.670> of

animals by looking at the footprints of

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.520 
animals by looking at the footprints of
course<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.350> tell<00:01:40.500> us

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
course one thing that you can tell us

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.679 
course one thing that you can tell us
how<00:01:40.860> big<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.460> animal<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:43.970> but<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.270> know

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
how big the animal was but if you know

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.020 
how big the animal was but if you know
how<00:01:45.960> big<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> animal<00:01:46.409> was<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.880> can

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
how big the animal was and then you can

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
how big the animal was and then you can
learn<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> lot<00:01:48.479> more<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.259> trackways<00:01:49.770> if

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
learn a lot more from the trackways if

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.219 
learn a lot more from the trackways if
you<00:01:50.220> measure<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.759> distance<00:01:51.240> between<00:01:51.450> each<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you measure the distance between each of

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.749 
you measure the distance between each of
the<00:01:52.439> prints<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.729> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the prints like from that one to that
