00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:17.679 
using seven more Swift look you see the
trigger<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.689> it<00:03:15.909> the<00:03:16.909> MOSFET<00:03:17.419> has<00:03:17.629> a

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
trigger is it the MOSFET has a

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:47.890 
trigger is it the MOSFET has a
pre-programmed<00:03:38.409> full<00:03:39.409> auto<00:03:46.900> initial

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
pre-programmed full auto initial

00:03:47.900 --> 00:04:08.039 
pre-programmed full auto initial

I<00:04:37.250> mean<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:38.000> MOSFET<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.960> electronic<00:04:39.530> trigger

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
I mean the MOSFET the electronic trigger

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.879 
I mean the MOSFET the electronic trigger
it's<00:04:40.370> easy<00:04:40.849> because<00:04:41.479> we<00:04:41.900> will<00:04:42.169> develop<00:04:42.620> and
