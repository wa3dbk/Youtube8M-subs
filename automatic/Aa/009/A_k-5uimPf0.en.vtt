00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
 Friends, what do I want you to see this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.650
 cabinet 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.310
 in this cabinet that we are seeing 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.910
 right now 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.660
 It turns out that the lady told me 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.119
 like five months without cleaning it look there 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.119
 we see all the dirt 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.320
 that have come together let's pass him the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.580
 finger so you can see look 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.140
 look 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.369
 the woman who has 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.000
 in five months 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.059
 this is what can not be what they see this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.820
 it can not be because because the dust 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.480
 many people say not that dust is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.960
 good for cabinets or the cpu not 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.940
 sir the dust can come to a moment 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.360
 that I can give you a short the plate and the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.850
 plate goes off because it produces 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.539
 a short 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.290
 and that's why look at the dirt in there 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.050
 order if they realize 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.720
 and you know that every two months they have to 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.590
 clean open the cabinet or the cpu like 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.590
 you want to name it 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.270
 you have to open it and clean it 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.270
 come 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.869
 if you want to use for example a 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.929
 You can make a dryer from a distance 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.030
 hair dryer but always 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:34.950
 from far away from here never approach it because 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.740
 static charge is understood 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.049
 and if it's with better pressure air and if 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.539
 get a bottle of compressed air 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.119
 that are sold in stores 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.119
 computer electronic stores 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.159
 much better to take out all this kind of 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.850
 grime dust they see it fix the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.819
 difference here and clear here 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.640
 how is the cooler of the 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.880
 processor 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.140
 There will come a time and the source will also 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.229
 it's super dirty they see it 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.959
 that is, what can not be left 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.400
 do in our cabinet or cpu because 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.280
 comes the load that can give us a 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.990
 short look at the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.990
 the dirt that this science has 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.159
 of 5 months I gave the lady I think 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:30.209
 that two months is the most that 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:32.310
 you should wait maybe a month and a half and 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.980
 take a look to see how it is and never 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.900
 leave so much time the cpu or the cabinet 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.909
 that grabs you so much dust and ready 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.730
 and this is what I had to tell you 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.890
 to you because it is very important 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.189
 to keep in mind so that we are not 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.760
 damage the components that we have inside 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:59.260
 of the cpu or the cabinet and remember 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.830
 air bottle compressor dryer 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.150
 far never close to not magnetize 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.130
 what is the plates that are here 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.480
 Yes, it can be an air bottle 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.290
 much better than sold in stores 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.410
 electronic as I told you and ready not 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.190
 there is nothing more to scratch as is the saying 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.160
 and there I leave you an overview 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.290
 from dirt or dust , dirt like you 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.720
 you want to call him he has this cpu of 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.870
 these ladies this amazing 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.879
 Wow 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.080
 as always friends thank you for being 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.080
 there cordial greetings
