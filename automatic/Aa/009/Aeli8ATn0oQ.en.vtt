100 inside this category and the only

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.380 
100 inside this category and the only
thing<00:00:15.500> really<00:00:15.920> to<00:00:16.100> compete<00:00:16.609> with<00:00:16.640> it<00:00:16.939> that<00:00:17.119> the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
thing really to compete with it that the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.540 
thing really to compete with it that the
canon<00:00:17.840> has<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.530> 60d<00:00:19.040> has<00:00:19.160> been<00:00:19.280> heavily

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
canon has the 60d has been heavily

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.850 
canon has the 60d has been heavily
discounted<00:00:20.210> is<00:00:20.330> really<00:00:20.690> not<00:00:20.930> in<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.350> range<00:00:21.620> of

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
discounted is really not in the range of

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.600 
discounted is really not in the range of
what<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.130> d<00:00:22.300> 7100<00:00:23.300> offers<00:00:24.289> cannon<00:00:25.220> does<00:00:25.400> have

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
what the d 7100 offers cannon does have

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.550 
what the d 7100 offers cannon does have
the<00:00:25.760> 70s<00:00:26.330> still<00:00:26.600> lying<00:00:26.869> around<00:00:27.140> we'll<00:00:27.380> take<00:00:27.530> a

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
the 70s still lying around we'll take a

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.220 
the 70s still lying around we'll take a
look<00:00:27.770> at<00:00:27.949> how<00:00:28.070> this<00:00:28.310> compares<00:00:28.580> to<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.150> 70d<00:00:29.750> but

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
look at how this compares to the 70d but

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.750 
look at how this compares to the 70d but
now<00:00:30.380> we<00:00:30.440> finally<00:00:30.860> have<00:00:31.010> a<00:00:31.160> brand-new<00:00:31.490> camera

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
now we finally have a brand-new camera

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.880 
now we finally have a brand-new camera
from<00:00:32.149> Canon<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:32.930> we'll<00:00:33.440> see<00:00:33.590> what<00:00:33.739> they<00:00:33.859> offer

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
from Canon and we'll see what they offer

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.979 
from Canon and we'll see what they offer
in<00:00:34.399> this<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:34.760> basically<00:00:35.539> canon<00:00:35.899> has

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
in this so basically canon has

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.989 
in this so basically canon has
introduced<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.649> brand<00:00:36.859> new<00:00:37.219> sensor<00:00:37.699> in<00:00:37.850> this

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:37.999 
introduced a brand new sensor in this

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.450 
introduced a brand new sensor in this
it's<00:00:38.210> still<00:00:38.480> an<00:00:38.629> aps-c<00:00:39.079> sensor<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:40.010> going<00:00:40.399> to

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
it's still an aps-c sensor it's going to

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.090 
it's still an aps-c sensor it's going to
be<00:00:40.579> upgraded<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.089> 20<00:00:41.479> megapixels<00:00:42.109> from<00:00:42.499> the<00:00:42.679> 18

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
be upgraded to 20 megapixels from the 18

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.200 
be upgraded to 20 megapixels from the 18
megapixels<00:00:43.850> it's<00:00:44.359> a<00:00:44.539> dual<00:00:45.079> pixel<00:00:45.769> CMOS<00:00:46.210> sensor

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
megapixels it's a dual pixel CMOS sensor

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.610 
megapixels it's a dual pixel CMOS sensor
so<00:00:47.359> what<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:47.539> means<00:00:47.839> is<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.019> on<00:00:48.260> every

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
so what that means is that on every

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.309 
so what that means is that on every
pixel<00:00:49.010> canon<00:00:49.729> has<00:00:49.819> split<00:00:50.269> it<00:00:50.420> into<00:00:50.600> two<00:00:51.019> bar

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
pixel canon has split it into two bar

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.829 
pixel canon has split it into two bar
two<00:00:51.829> parts<00:00:52.249> and<00:00:52.429> they're<00:00:52.879> able<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.210> do<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.449> phase

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
two parts and they're able to do a phase

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.559 
two parts and they're able to do a phase
detection<00:00:54.289> autofocus<00:00:54.710> on<00:00:55.489> each<00:00:55.969> of<00:00:56.179> those<00:00:56.329> so

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
detection autofocus on each of those so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:57.669 
detection autofocus on each of those so
what<00:00:56.719> that's<00:00:56.899> going<00:00:57.049> to<00:00:57.109> mean<00:00:57.170> is<00:00:57.440> we're<00:00:57.589> going

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
what that's going to mean is we're going

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.819 
what that's going to mean is we're going
to<00:00:57.739> have<00:00:57.949> very<00:00:58.609> nice<00:00:58.909> auto<00:00:59.539> focus<00:01:00.199> in<00:01:00.379> Live

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
to have very nice auto focus in Live

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.229 
to have very nice auto focus in Live
View<00:01:00.859> and<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:01.429> movie<00:01:01.789> mode<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.089> that's

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
View and in movie mode so that's

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.539 
View and in movie mode so that's
something<00:01:02.449> new<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:02.989> Canon<00:01:03.409> really<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.400> truly

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
something new to Canon really and truly

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.999 
something new to Canon really and truly
cannas<00:01:05.120> autofocus<00:01:05.780> has<00:01:06.020> really<00:01:06.619> been<00:01:06.740> pretty

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
cannas autofocus has really been pretty

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.410 
cannas autofocus has really been pretty
poor<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:07.640> most<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:07.969> their<00:01:08.060> cameras<00:01:08.390> and

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
poor and most of their cameras and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.660 
poor and most of their cameras and
cameras<00:01:08.810> like<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:08.960> 70<00:01:09.500> actually<00:01:10.280> don't<00:01:10.520> have

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
cameras like the 70 actually don't have

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.010 
cameras like the 70 actually don't have
any<00:01:10.850> kind<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.149> auto<00:01:11.299> focus<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:11.780> I'm<00:01:11.840> really

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
any kind of auto focus so I'm really

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.410 
any kind of auto focus so I'm really
looking<00:01:12.409> forward<00:01:12.439> to<00:01:12.950> seeing<00:01:13.549> what<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.090> 7th

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
looking forward to seeing what the 7th

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
compare that to the 7d and maybe some of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.889 
compare that to the 7d and maybe some of
the<00:01:30.619> Nikon<00:01:31.009> images<00:01:31.460> as<00:01:31.609> well<00:01:31.640> just<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.570> see<00:01:32.780> how

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.690 
when that video comes out for the full
review<00:01:39.469> of<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.590> 70<00:01:39.979> when<00:01:40.159> it<00:01:40.280> comes<00:01:40.490> out

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
review of the 70 when it comes out

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.029 
review of the 70 when it comes out
either<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.420> late<00:01:41.630> august<00:01:42.079> or<00:01:42.200> early<00:01:42.350> September

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
either in late august or early September

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.370 
either in late august or early September
is<00:01:43.159> what<00:01:43.310> we're<00:01:43.429> thinking<00:01:43.609> on<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:44.420> we'll

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
is what we're thinking on that and we'll

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.620 
is what we're thinking on that and we'll
definitely<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.189> camera<00:01:46.609> and<00:01:46.999> do<00:01:47.600> a

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
definitely have that camera and do a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.480 
definitely have that camera and do a
full<00:01:47.929> review<00:01:48.140> on<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.770> but<00:01:48.950> let's<00:01:49.310> take<00:01:49.460> a

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
full review on that so but let's take a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.709 
full review on that so but let's take a
look<00:01:49.700> at<00:01:49.759> some<00:01:49.939> of<00:01:49.999> the<00:01:50.119> specs<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.600> we're

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
look at some of the specs that we're

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.529 
look at some of the specs that we're
going<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.899> see<00:01:51.170> from<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.859> new<00:01:52.130> camera<00:01:52.640> now

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
going to see from that new camera now

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.090 
going to see from that new camera now
Canon<00:01:54.020> claims<00:01:54.289> that<00:01:54.499> they've<00:01:54.679> increased

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
Canon claims that they've increased

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.809 
Canon claims that they've increased
their<00:01:55.479> iso<00:01:56.479> their<00:01:56.840> low<00:01:57.009> ISO<00:01:58.009> ability<00:01:58.549> so

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
their iso their low ISO ability so

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.989 
their iso their low ISO ability so
they're<00:01:58.999> claiming<00:01:59.859> 12,800<00:02:00.859> ISO<00:02:01.009> looks<00:02:01.729> good

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
they're claiming 12,800 ISO looks good

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.899 
they're claiming 12,800 ISO looks good
on<00:02:02.149> this<00:02:02.329> camera<00:02:02.659> much<00:02:03.409> better<00:02:03.649> at<00:02:03.799> 6,400<00:02:04.399> they

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
on this camera much better at 6,400 they

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.929 
on this camera much better at 6,400 they
say<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.840> canon<00:02:06.439> is<00:02:06.530> claiming<00:02:07.039> that<00:02:07.609> we<00:02:07.759> should

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
say so canon is claiming that we should

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.639 
say so canon is claiming that we should
get<00:02:08.060> just<00:02:08.300> about<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.569> stop<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.050> low<00:02:09.410> light

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
get just about a stop of low light

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.770 
get just about a stop of low light
improvement<00:02:10.370> now<00:02:10.460> sometimes<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.390> really

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
improvement now sometimes that really

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.510 
improvement now sometimes that really
just<00:02:12.020> means<00:02:12.290> jpeg<00:02:12.890> because<00:02:13.250> they<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:13.460> a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
just means jpeg because they have a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.050 
just means jpeg because they have a
better<00:02:13.730> processor<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.720> better

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
better processor and better

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.089 
better processor and better
techniques<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.959> be<00:02:15.989> able<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.319> process<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
techniques to be able to process the

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.120 
techniques to be able to process the
high<00:02:17.400> ISO<00:02:17.940> images<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:19.440> maybe<00:02:19.620> we're<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:19.980> to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
high ISO images but maybe we're going to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.500 
high ISO images but maybe we're going to
see<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.610> raw<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.060> we'll<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.480> see

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
see that in raw so we'll have to see

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.380 
see that in raw so we'll have to see
exactly<00:02:22.050> how<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.860> translates<00:02:23.459> into<00:02:23.730> our<00:02:24.180> raw

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
exactly how that translates into our raw

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.839 
exactly how that translates into our raw
images<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.770> also<00:02:26.370> um<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:27.989> 20<00:02:28.319> megapixel

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
images so also um this is a 20 megapixel

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.010 
images so also um this is a 20 megapixel
sensor<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.000> I'm<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.180> happy<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.690> Canon

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
sensor and I'm really happy the Canon

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.080 
sensor and I'm really happy the Canon
chose<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.319> go<00:02:31.440> with<00:02:31.470> 20<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.130> didn't<00:02:32.610> really

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
chose to go with 20 and didn't really

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.059 
chose to go with 20 and didn't really
try<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.390> win<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> mega<00:02:34.050> pixel<00:02:34.440> war<00:02:34.620> nikon<00:02:35.040> has

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
try to win the mega pixel war nikon has

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.790 
try to win the mega pixel war nikon has
the<00:02:35.580> 24<00:02:36.120> megapixel<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.470> know<00:02:37.590> more

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
the 24 megapixel and you know more

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.470 
the 24 megapixel and you know more
sounds<00:02:38.160> better<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.459> obviously<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.209> that

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
sounds better but obviously that that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.780 
sounds better but obviously that that
does<00:02:39.660> hit<00:02:39.989> too<00:02:40.470> low<00:02:40.739> light<00:02:40.950> performance<00:02:40.980> it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
does hit too low light performance it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.870 
does hit too low light performance it
does<00:02:41.940> hit<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.450> speed<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.440> nikon<00:02:44.340> has<00:02:44.370> taken<00:02:44.819> a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
does hit to speed and nikon has taken a

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.970 
does hit to speed and nikon has taken a
beating<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.510> little<00:02:46.080> bit<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.380> speed<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
beating a little bit with speed in the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.059 
beating a little bit with speed in the
d70<00:02:47.519> 100<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.269> slow<00:02:48.600> buffer<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.890> so

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
d70 100 and the slow buffer on that so

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.800 
d70 100 and the slow buffer on that so
canon<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> be<00:02:51.150> doing<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.450> little<00:02:51.690> bit

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
canon is going to be doing a little bit

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.320 
canon is going to be doing a little bit
better<00:02:51.930> 20<00:02:52.410> megapixels<00:02:53.040> plenty<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.150> side

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
better 20 megapixels plenty on the side

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.509 
better 20 megapixels plenty on the side
of<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> megapixels<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.950> we'll<00:02:56.069> have<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.340> see

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
of the megapixels so we'll have to see

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.520 
of the megapixels so we'll have to see
how<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.850> goes<00:02:56.880> now<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.660> new<00:02:57.870> autofocus

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
how that goes now the new autofocus

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.589 
how that goes now the new autofocus
system<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.980> really<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.549> bread<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
system is really the the bread and

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.120 
system is really the the bread and
butter<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.080> new<00:03:01.290> camera<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:01.980> what

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
butter of this new camera this is what

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.670 
butter of this new camera this is what
canon<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.730> really<00:03:03.180> pushing<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.170> does

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
canon is really pushing on that it does

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.610 
canon is really pushing on that it does
be<00:03:05.430> able<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.239> able<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.569> autofocus<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.319> phase

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
be able it is able to autofocus in phase

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.070 
be able it is able to autofocus in phase
detection<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.459> f/11<00:03:08.819> using<00:03:09.810> eighty

percent<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.739> frame<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.250> almost<00:03:11.670> every

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
percent of the frame so almost every

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.610 
percent of the frame so almost every
pixel<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:12.900> eighty<00:03:13.080> percent<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
pixel and it's eighty percent of the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.860 
pixel and it's eighty percent of the
pixels<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.370> are<00:03:14.549> able<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.150> be<00:03:15.269> used<00:03:15.510> for

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
pixels on this are able to be used for

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.320 
pixels on this are able to be used for
auto<00:03:16.110> focus<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.799> live<00:03:16.980> view<00:03:17.220> definitely<00:03:18.090> huge

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
auto focus and live view definitely huge

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.599 
auto focus and live view definitely huge
from<00:03:18.510> Canon<00:03:18.930> looking<00:03:19.769> forward<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.220> really

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
from Canon looking forward to really

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.130 
from Canon looking forward to really
testing<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.269> seeing<00:03:21.480> what<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:22.109> for

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
testing it and seeing what I can do for

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.610 
testing it and seeing what I can do for
video<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.720> other<00:03:24.900> big<00:03:25.109> thing<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.530> we're

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
video the other big thing that we're

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.449 
video the other big thing that we're
going<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.769> see<00:03:26.010> from<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:27.480> new

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
going to see from that is a new

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.039 
going to see from that is a new
autofocus<00:03:29.459> system<00:03:29.489> basically<00:03:30.299> cannon<00:03:30.930> is

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
autofocus system basically cannon is

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.990 
autofocus system basically cannon is
borrowing<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.650> autofocus<00:03:32.010> system<00:03:32.190> from<00:03:32.819> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
borrowing the autofocus system from the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.140 
borrowing the autofocus system from the
70<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.049> 19-point<00:03:34.920> Crocs<00:03:35.280> type<00:03:35.609> with<00:03:36.120> a

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
70 it is a 19-point Crocs type with a

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.750 
70 it is a 19-point Crocs type with a
dual<00:03:36.600> cross<00:03:36.870> type<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.470> center<00:03:37.799> it's<00:03:38.400> very

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
dual cross type in the center it's very

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.460 
dual cross type in the center it's very
similar<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.180> what<00:03:39.390> we're<00:03:39.510> seeing<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.989> 7d

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
similar to what we're seeing on the 7d

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.650 
similar to what we're seeing on the 7d
we<00:03:40.920> might<00:03:41.160> have<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.340> few<00:03:41.640> less<00:03:41.880> options<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.540> when

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
we might have a few less options of when

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.390 
we might have a few less options of when
we've<00:03:42.810> seen<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.230> 7d<00:03:43.680> but<00:03:43.829> overall<00:03:44.160> it

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
we've seen on the 7d but overall it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.490 
we've seen on the 7d but overall it
looks<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.730> be<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.850> very<00:03:45.239> nice<00:03:45.569> AF<00:03:45.930> system<00:03:46.109> I'm

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
looks to be a very nice AF system I'm

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.559 
looks to be a very nice AF system I'm
glad<00:03:46.709> Canon<00:03:47.280> chose<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.639> do<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:48.000> they<00:03:48.540> took

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
glad Canon chose to do this they took

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.050 
glad Canon chose to do this they took
some<00:03:48.930> heat<00:03:49.139> for<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.470> 60<00:03:49.889> I<00:03:50.100> didn't<00:03:50.760> like<00:03:50.910> that

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
some heat for the 60 I didn't like that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.030 
some heat for the 60 I didn't like that
they<00:03:51.180> put<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.389> nine-point<00:03:51.959> AF<00:03:52.290> system<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.799> that

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
they put a nine-point AF system on that

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.430 
they put a nine-point AF system on that
and<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.910> was<00:03:54.060> really<00:03:54.450> weak<00:03:54.630> when<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.840> tested<00:03:55.350> it

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
and it was really weak when I tested it

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.620 
and it was really weak when I tested it
I<00:03:55.680> mean<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.340> was<00:03:56.430> good<00:03:56.609> in<00:03:56.730> low<00:03:56.850> light<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.359> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
I mean it was good in low light and the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.539 
I mean it was good in low light and the
points<00:03:57.959> worked<00:03:58.170> well<00:03:58.350> but<00:03:58.560> nine<00:03:59.010> points<00:03:59.430> on<00:03:59.519> a

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
points worked well but nine points on a

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.759 
points worked well but nine points on a
full-frame<00:03:59.910> camera<00:04:00.049> really<00:04:01.049> does<00:04:01.200> not<00:04:01.530> cover

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
full-frame camera really does not cover

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.069 
full-frame camera really does not cover
even<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.250> portion<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:02.940> frame<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.359> 19<00:04:03.780> on<00:04:03.959> an

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
even a portion of the frame so 19 on an

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.780 
even a portion of the frame so 19 on an
aps-c<00:04:04.470> cameras<00:04:05.069> should<00:04:05.160> give<00:04:05.340> us<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.579> little

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
aps-c cameras should give us a little

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.879 
aps-c cameras should give us a little
bit<00:04:05.970> better<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.450> also<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.410> screen<00:04:07.739> is

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
bit better on that also the screen is

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.569 
bit better on that also the screen is
brand<00:04:08.160> new<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:09.600> does<00:04:10.049> increase<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> million

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
brand new it does increase to a million

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.490 
brand new it does increase to a million
pixels<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> be<00:04:12.989> an<00:04:13.200> entire

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
pixels it is going to be an entire

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.680 
pixels it is going to be an entire
articulating<00:04:14.489> screen<00:04:14.609> so<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.000> will<00:04:15.180> flip<00:04:15.510> out

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
articulating screen so it will flip out

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.870 
articulating screen so it will flip out
and<00:04:15.989> move<00:04:16.620> around<00:04:16.799> for<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:17.609> really

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
and move around for you that's really

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.460 
and move around for you that's really
similar<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.389> what<00:04:18.600> we've<00:04:18.750> seen<00:04:18.930> on<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.229> past

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
similar to what we've seen on the past

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.370 
similar to what we've seen on the past
60<00:04:20.070> d<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.609> not<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.299> 3.2<00:04:21.930> inch<00:04:22.139> that<00:04:22.260> we've

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
60 d it's not the 3.2 inch that we've

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.839 
60 d it's not the 3.2 inch that we've
seen<00:04:22.590> on<00:04:22.710> some<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.039> newer<00:04:23.190> cameras<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:23.760> you

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
seen on some of the newer cameras so you

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.510 
seen on some of the newer cameras so you
are<00:04:24.000> stuck<00:04:24.270> at<00:04:24.300> three<00:04:24.690> inches<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.520> some

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
are stuck at three inches on that some

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.610 
are stuck at three inches on that some
of<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.700> newer<00:04:26.880> features<00:04:27.360> as<00:04:27.599> well

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
of the newer features as well

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.980 
of the newer features as well
is<00:04:28.740> there<00:04:29.699> going<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.000> have<00:04:30.389> built-in<00:04:30.780> Wi-Fi

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
is there going to have built-in Wi-Fi

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.080 
is there going to have built-in Wi-Fi
now<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:31.740> something<00:04:31.919> we<00:04:32.100> saw<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.460> 60

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
now this is something we saw in the 60

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.629 
now this is something we saw in the 60
they<00:04:33.660> also<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.990> GPS<00:04:34.470> in<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.680> 60<00:04:35.040> we're<00:04:35.250> missing

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
they also a GPS in the 60 we're missing

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.990 
they also a GPS in the 60 we're missing
that<00:04:35.669> on<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.300> 7th<00:04:36.990> ed<00:04:37.260> but<00:04:38.070> I'm<00:04:38.220> not<00:04:38.520> afraid<00:04:38.910> of

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
that on the 7th ed but I'm not afraid of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.969 
that on the 7th ed but I'm not afraid of
that<00:04:39.210> at<00:04:39.360> all<00:04:39.449> i<00:04:39.510> really<00:04:39.780> didn't<00:04:40.110> use<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.290> gps<00:04:40.830> at

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
that at all i really didn't use a gps at

ability love having that also the 70s a
lot<00:04:54.000> faster<00:04:54.449> we<00:04:54.570> got<00:04:54.720> seven<00:04:54.960> frames<00:04:55.229> a<00:04:55.440> second

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
lot faster we got seven frames a second

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.520 
lot faster we got seven frames a second
shooting<00:04:56.190> with<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.669> buffer<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.240> 16<00:04:57.840> images<00:04:58.410> at

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
shooting with a buffer of 16 images at

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.230 
shooting with a buffer of 16 images at
that<00:04:58.860> speed<00:04:59.190> that's<00:04:59.370> way<00:04:59.669> better<00:04:59.850> than<00:05:00.090> what

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
that speed that's way better than what

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.779 
that speed that's way better than what
we're<00:05:00.360> seeing<00:05:00.389> on<00:05:00.720> Nikon<00:05:01.320> which<00:05:01.919> only<00:05:02.190> lasted

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
we're seeing on Nikon which only lasted

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.150 
we're seeing on Nikon which only lasted
six<00:05:02.820> images<00:05:03.389> at<00:05:03.780> six<00:05:03.960> frames<00:05:04.169> a<00:05:04.380> second<00:05:04.710> you're

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
six images at six frames a second you're

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.080 
six images at six frames a second you're
going<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.370> notice<00:05:05.520> that<00:05:05.729> if<00:05:05.880> you're<00:05:05.970> shooting

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
going to notice that if you're shooting

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.270 
going to notice that if you're shooting
any<00:05:06.419> kind<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.780> sports<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.590> minute<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:07.949> try<00:05:08.220> to

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
any kind of sports the minute you try to

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.830 
any kind of sports the minute you try to
burst<00:05:08.610> mode<00:05:08.850> on<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.150> it's<00:05:09.300> going<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.479> be<00:05:09.600> much

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
burst mode on that it's going to be much

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.719 
burst mode on that it's going to be much
better<00:05:10.050> viewfinder<00:05:10.860> coverage<00:05:11.520> also

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
better viewfinder coverage also

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.840 
better viewfinder coverage also
increased<00:05:12.300> ninety-eight<00:05:12.840> percent<00:05:13.070> it<00:05:14.070> that's

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
increased ninety-eight percent it that's

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.430 
increased ninety-eight percent it that's
nice<00:05:15.210> it's<00:05:15.479> more<00:05:15.750> than<00:05:15.870> enough<00:05:16.080> for<00:05:16.199> anything

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
nice it's more than enough for anything

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.140 
nice it's more than enough for anything
on<00:05:16.740> that<00:05:16.919> one<00:05:17.130> so<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.610> camera<00:05:17.910> is<00:05:17.940> still

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
on that one so the camera is still

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.879 
on that one so the camera is still
mostly<00:05:18.330> plastic<00:05:18.990> but<00:05:19.139> it's<00:05:19.260> been<00:05:19.380> outfitted

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
mostly plastic but it's been outfitted

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.500 
mostly plastic but it's been outfitted
with<00:05:19.979> some<00:05:20.190> seals<00:05:20.520> some<00:05:20.850> weather<00:05:21.060> sealing

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
with some seals some weather sealing

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.090 
with some seals some weather sealing
just<00:05:21.810> some<00:05:21.900> basic<00:05:22.320> weather<00:05:22.530> sealing<00:05:22.860> so

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
just some basic weather sealing so

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.260 
just some basic weather sealing so
you're<00:05:23.220> going<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.400> get<00:05:23.550> really<00:05:24.000> good<00:05:24.210> results

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
you're going to get really good results

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.000 
you're going to get really good results
the<00:05:24.750> initial<00:05:25.169> previews<00:05:25.590> they've<00:05:25.800> been<00:05:25.889> then

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
the initial previews they've been then

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.740 
the initial previews they've been then
it's<00:05:26.160> a<00:05:26.250> very<00:05:26.460> sturdy<00:05:26.789> camera<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.539> know<00:05:27.570> it's

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
it's a very sturdy camera you know it's

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.420 
it's a very sturdy camera you know it's
not<00:05:27.810> going<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.050> be<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.139> magnesium<00:05:28.560> alloy<00:05:29.100> build

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
not going to be a magnesium alloy build

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.100 
not going to be a magnesium alloy build
such<00:05:29.729> as<00:05:29.880> this<00:05:30.060> but<00:05:30.539> you're<00:05:30.720> going<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:30.930> get

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
such as this but you're going to get

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.170 
such as this but you're going to get
very<00:05:31.320> steady<00:05:32.039> recording<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:32.940> you're<00:05:33.030> going<00:05:33.120> to

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
very steady recording so you're going to

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.850 
very steady recording so you're going to
have<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.330> microphone<00:05:33.630> input<00:05:34.139> manual<00:05:34.590> audio

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
have a microphone input manual audio

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.620 
have a microphone input manual audio
controls<00:05:35.310> which<00:05:35.520> is<00:05:35.669> nice<00:05:35.849> very<00:05:36.030> video

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
controls which is nice very video

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.589

compression<00:05:45.030> mode<00:05:45.389> similar<00:05:45.810> to<00:05:45.930> what<00:05:46.020> we've

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
compression mode similar to what we've

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.409 
compression mode similar to what we've
seen<00:05:46.320> on<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.590> 5d<00:05:47.160> that's<00:05:47.610> going<00:05:47.820> to<00:05:47.880> allow<00:05:48.000> for

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
seen on the 5d that's going to allow for

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.870 
seen on the 5d that's going to allow for
a<00:05:48.450> lower<00:05:48.930> compression<00:05:49.440> version<00:05:50.130> which<00:05:50.610> should

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
a lower compression version which should

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.670 
a lower compression version which should
give<00:05:51.030> us<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.330> little<00:05:51.510> bit<00:05:51.690> better<00:05:51.900> results<00:05:52.560> on

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
give us a little bit better results on

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.529 
give us a little bit better results on
the<00:05:52.889> quality<00:05:53.400> although<00:05:53.970> it's<00:05:54.120> going<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.300> use

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
the quality although it's going to use

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.070 
the quality although it's going to use
up<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.900> lot<00:05:54.930> more<00:05:55.520> space<00:05:56.520> on<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:57.870> now<00:05:58.050> have

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
up a lot more space on that you now have

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.140 
up a lot more space on that you now have
auto<00:05:58.500> exposure<00:05:58.889> bracketing<00:05:59.099> for<00:05:59.699> the<00:05:59.760> HDR

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
auto exposure bracketing for the HDR

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.689 
auto exposure bracketing for the HDR
enthusiasts<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:01.080> seven<00:06:01.560> frames<00:06:01.919> which<00:06:02.550> is

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
enthusiasts to seven frames which is

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.279 
enthusiasts to seven frames which is
very<00:06:02.880> nice<00:06:03.090> that's<00:06:03.300> what<00:06:03.449> we<00:06:03.570> seen<00:06:03.750> on<00:06:03.900> cameras

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
very nice that's what we seen on cameras

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.650 
very nice that's what we seen on cameras
like<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.440> 5d<00:06:05.010> gone<00:06:05.789> from<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.180> three<00:06:06.389> frames

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
like the 5d gone from the three frames

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.450 
like the 5d gone from the three frames
that<00:06:06.810> we've<00:06:06.960> seen<00:06:07.199> on<00:06:07.320> cameras<00:06:07.740> like<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.889> 70

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
that we've seen on cameras like the 70

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.939 
that we've seen on cameras like the 70
so<00:06:08.910> really<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.539> only<00:06:09.690> major<00:06:09.990> downside<00:06:10.590> I<00:06:10.620> see

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
so really the only major downside I see

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.010 
so really the only major downside I see
on<00:06:11.130> this<00:06:11.250> camera<00:06:11.550> is<00:06:11.699> that<00:06:11.789> it<00:06:12.090> only<00:06:12.330> has<00:06:12.660> one

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
on this camera is that it only has one

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.230 
on this camera is that it only has one
SD<00:06:13.410> card<00:06:13.650> slot<00:06:13.919> I<00:06:14.130> really<00:06:14.729> wish<00:06:14.849> they'd<00:06:15.030> gone

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
SD card slot I really wish they'd gone

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.450 
SD card slot I really wish they'd gone
with<00:06:15.449> two<00:06:15.660> I<00:06:15.690> love<00:06:16.110> having<00:06:16.289> backups<00:06:16.860> of<00:06:16.979> all<00:06:17.160> of

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
with two I love having backups of all of

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.589 
with two I love having backups of all of
my<00:06:17.550> images<00:06:17.930> really<00:06:18.930> a<00:06:19.080> feature<00:06:19.530> that<00:06:19.680> I<00:06:20.599> highly

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
my images really a feature that I highly

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.110 
my images really a feature that I highly
recommend<00:06:21.960> having<00:06:22.560> and<00:06:22.889> I'm<00:06:23.370> really<00:06:23.820> sad<00:06:24.000> to

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
recommend having and I'm really sad to

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.689 
recommend having and I'm really sad to
see<00:06:24.300> it<00:06:24.330> go<00:06:24.830> having<00:06:25.830> Wi-Fi<00:06:26.010> built<00:06:26.460> in<00:06:26.610> the

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
see it go having Wi-Fi built in the

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.670 
see it go having Wi-Fi built in the
camera<00:06:27.030> will<00:06:27.180> help<00:06:27.479> ease<00:06:27.660> that<00:06:27.990> a<00:06:28.020> little<00:06:28.500> bit

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
camera will help ease that a little bit

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.770 
camera will help ease that a little bit
as<00:06:28.860> you<00:06:29.520> don't<00:06:29.699> need<00:06:29.820> a<00:06:29.849> second<00:06:30.210> card<00:06:30.389> slot<00:06:30.630> to

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
as you don't need a second card slot to

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.140 
as you don't need a second card slot to
put<00:06:30.930> in<00:06:31.020> an<00:06:31.110> eye-fi<00:06:31.380> card<00:06:31.800> for<00:06:32.039> example<00:06:32.490> but<00:06:33.090> I

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
put in an eye-fi card for example but I

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.270 
put in an eye-fi card for example but I
really<00:06:33.599> wish<00:06:33.810> they<00:06:33.990> had<00:06:34.260> that<00:06:34.289> that's<00:06:35.130> the

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
really wish they had that that's the

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.399 
really wish they had that that's the
only<00:06:35.639> really<00:06:36.150> downside<00:06:36.659> to<00:06:36.900> that<00:06:36.930> now<00:06:37.200> a

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
only really downside to that now a

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.679 
only really downside to that now a
comparison<00:06:38.310> to<00:06:38.340> the<00:06:38.520> 70<00:06:38.969> you're<00:06:39.360> going<00:06:39.570> to

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:39.689 
comparison to the 70 you're going to

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:43.070 
comparison to the 70 you're going to
lose<00:06:40.080> basically<00:06:40.949> this<00:06:41.099> job<00:06:41.399> on<00:06:41.729> this<00:06:42.479> jog<00:06:42.779> dial

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
lose basically this job on this jog dial

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.689 
lose basically this job on this jog dial
that<00:06:43.349> they<00:06:43.529> do<00:06:43.589> have<00:06:43.979> and<00:06:44.189> everything's<00:06:44.549> going

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
that they do have and everything's going

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.519 
that they do have and everything's going
to<00:06:44.759> be<00:06:44.879> integrated<00:06:45.509> into<00:06:45.659> this<00:06:45.839> wheel<00:06:46.110> similar

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:46.529 
to be integrated into this wheel similar

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.049 
to be integrated into this wheel similar
to<00:06:46.649> what<00:06:46.769> we've<00:06:46.919> seen<00:06:47.069> on<00:06:47.279> the<00:06:47.369> 60d<00:06:47.849> in<00:06:47.969> the

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:48.059 
to what we've seen on the 60d in the

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:49.850 
to what we've seen on the 60d in the
past<00:06:48.299> it's<00:06:48.629> going<00:06:49.049> to<00:06:49.110> look<00:06:49.259> really<00:06:49.289> similar

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
past it's going to look really similar

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.549 
past it's going to look really similar
on<00:06:50.159> the<00:06:50.249> outside<00:06:50.759> and<00:06:51.299> most<00:06:52.259> of<00:06:52.349> the<00:06:52.409> changes

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:52.559 
on the outside and most of the changes

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.649 
on the outside and most of the changes
is<00:06:52.829> going<00:06:52.979> to<00:06:53.039> be<00:06:53.159> internal<00:06:53.789> so<00:06:54.179> you<00:06:54.539> know

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:54.659 
is going to be internal so you know

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:56.479 
is going to be internal so you know
overall<00:06:54.959> I'm<00:06:55.229> excited<00:06:55.529> about<00:06:55.709> this<00:06:55.919> camera<00:06:56.339> it

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:56.489 
overall I'm excited about this camera it

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:59.089 
overall I'm excited about this camera it
looks<00:06:56.819> very<00:06:56.909> nice<00:06:57.629> I'm<00:06:57.929> happy<00:06:58.259> to<00:06:58.439> see<00:06:58.649> can<00:06:58.919> and

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099 
looks very nice I'm happy to see can and

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.100 
looks very nice I'm happy to see can and
finally<00:06:59.489> improving<00:07:00.029> some<00:07:00.449> of<00:07:00.539> the<00:07:00.629> sensors

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
finally improving some of the sensors

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.899 
finally improving some of the sensors
and<00:07:01.439> some<00:07:01.619> of<00:07:01.709> the<00:07:01.799> results<00:07:02.009> and<00:07:02.459> really

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:02.909 
and some of the results and really

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:04.819 
and some of the results and really
looking<00:07:03.209> like<00:07:03.389> they're<00:07:03.539> moving<00:07:03.869> into<00:07:04.679> a<00:07:04.709> new

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:04.829 
looking like they're moving into a new

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:07.489 
looking like they're moving into a new
segment<00:07:05.339> and<00:07:05.729> pushing<00:07:06.149> the<00:07:06.239> bar<00:07:06.479> on<00:07:06.749> their<00:07:07.199> AF

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:07.499 
segment and pushing the bar on their AF

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:09.199 
segment and pushing the bar on their AF
technology<00:07:08.159> especially<00:07:08.459> because<00:07:09.059> they've

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:09.209 
technology especially because they've

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:11.209 
technology especially because they've
fallen<00:07:09.419> behind<00:07:09.749> on<00:07:10.110> that<00:07:10.319> so<00:07:10.769> we'll<00:07:10.919> see<00:07:11.099> what

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:11.219 
fallen behind on that so we'll see what

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:13.159 
fallen behind on that so we'll see what
they<00:07:11.339> can<00:07:11.399> do<00:07:11.669> on<00:07:11.879> once<00:07:12.269> again<00:07:12.389> subscribe<00:07:12.959> and

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
they can do on once again subscribe and

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.569 
they can do on once again subscribe and
we'll<00:07:13.229> have<00:07:13.379> this<00:07:13.499> camera<00:07:13.889> coming<00:07:14.189> in<00:07:14.309> as<00:07:14.429> soon
