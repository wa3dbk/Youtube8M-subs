00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.350
 hello very good this budget in 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.420
 this case we are doing the version of 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.450
 this processor that just came out does 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.340
 two days is the new one at 1070 that 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.990
 we thought that having 250 k could not 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.730
 To be stopped , the laws have exceeded 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.890
 mdm likes is very surprised what 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.590
 what are you doing with md shampoo 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.950
 in this case we are going to have an improvement of 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.660
 about 0.2 gigahertz per core and what 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.910
 important is going to be the processor worth 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.489
 the graphics processor is going to have a 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.140
 improvement from 720 to 866 megahertz are 146 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.969
 megahertz more than is a good 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.499
 difference and we will do for example 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:51.199
 operate the lyon laws at 98 fps is a 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.149
 good wonder you are watching over here 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.090
 the comparison so that you see it in the 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.430
 I will leave a while and leave in the description 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.240
 this processor is supported only by 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:07.250
 very few plates as you can see the the 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.930
 88 x 78 8 ha 58 and it is important that it be 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.970
 fm2 plus voucher 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.140
 in this case you are seeing us we have the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.640
 base that is made with which no 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.900
 we have no problem 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.250
 this is the plate we need to 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.630
 run this processor must 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.510
 take it into account you also only have one 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.430
 extra but good graphic now no 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.170
 we care a lot because with 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.400
 processors we have no surplus we have 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.090
 basic connectors 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:34.250
 vd and as dÃ©bedas tv and vga hdmi 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.310
 23.04 2.0 enough connections for 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.350
 everything we want to connect is a very 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.960
 good messi plate but I liked it 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.030
 in plan of plates design design 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.550
 socialized but without more we have two modes 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.960
 of rank you can see here that they are going to 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.500
 connect here ok let's analyze 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.410
 these 8 gigas two modules from 4gb to 2102 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.070
 of 3 and with 9 latency is 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.170
 important that is this 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.900
 configuration I do not care which brand is 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.020
 but they have to be 2,133 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.970
 and from 2 to 4 right now I do not know but 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.660
 I will put here a comparison of how 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.390
 scale the graph as the difference 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.670
 Gameplay depending on what 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.530
 is what ram speed does it have if 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.090
 you have 2600 1866 and 2,133 what would the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.730
 left and you will be watching it while 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.780
 while I talk about those for production in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.670
 the future will 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.650
 As a hard drive, I will not always 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.569
 lose you and therefore one of 500gb and more 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.910
 cheap if there is one you use 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.530
 no more here you do not waste time as 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.150
 so good box a box with source 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.280
 integrated feeding is important the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.920
 country use 500 watts integrated into the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 source in the this one comes with it no longer 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.520
 come fans and catch you more 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.950
 late is worth the connections that come in 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.350
 the box are enough to connect 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 our app and it works without any 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.860
 problem and as not something of Carlos 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.280
 grenada then on the front for example 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.110
 we can put this fan is worth the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.970
 maximum that it admits are three fans 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.290
 120 in the back is 80 that what 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.019
 I recommend that you do not put it anymore 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.250
 expensive make more noise but in almost him or 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.560
 be that if you want to put all your 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.810
 fans put one of 120 here 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.700
 another 120 here the recent here and more 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.380
 that enough comes with the network and 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.610
 julieta good ya look at it but what 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.220
 important is the monster that you are going to 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.100
 carry within the total price you are 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.319
 seeing here are 170 euros almost but 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.910
 good 170 euros is once is a 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.920
 increment a little bit the process is a 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.750
 little more expensive but the benefits with 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.610
 nothing 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.920
 wonder I hope you liked me 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.900
 leave this in the description subscribe 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.860
 for much more more information more 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.660
 technology 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.069
 here what we have and we see ourselves in the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.069
 next video up
