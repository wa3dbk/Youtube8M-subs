minecraft details so I'm over here where

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.310 
minecraft details so I'm over here where
we<00:00:17.580> had<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.180> previous<00:00:18.779> episodes<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.890> my<00:00:21.320> low

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
we had the previous episodes in my low

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.980 
we had the previous episodes in my low
power<00:00:22.560> lines<00:00:22.859> gone<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.400> OA<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.539> episode

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
power lines gone but OA in this episode

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.529 
power lines gone but OA in this episode
we're<00:00:25.170> gonna<00:00:25.320> go<00:00:25.500> over<00:00:25.890> how<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.430> achieve

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
we're gonna go over how we can achieve

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.330 
we're gonna go over how we can achieve
artificial<00:00:27.539> lighting<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.230> shading<00:00:28.650> using

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
artificial lighting and shading using

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.790 
artificial lighting and shading using
the<00:00:29.760> different<00:00:30.060> colored<00:00:30.449> wool<00:00:30.900> or<00:00:31.230> carpet<00:00:31.710> so

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the different colored wool or carpet so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.020 
the different colored wool or carpet so
I'm<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> demonstrate<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.579> carpets

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
I'm going to demonstrate with carpets

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.569 
I'm going to demonstrate with carpets
because<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.570> bit<00:00:33.660> easier<00:00:34.579> but

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
because it's a little bit easier but

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.930 
because it's a little bit easier but
just<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> show<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:36.809> I'm<00:00:36.899> talking<00:00:36.960> about

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
just to show you what I'm talking about

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
just to show you what I'm talking about
some<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> colors<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:40.050> three<00:00:40.770> different

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
some of the colors have three different

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.229 
some of the colors have three different
shading<00:00:41.610> variations<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.210> blue<00:00:42.739> gray<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
shading variations like blue gray and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.560 
shading variations like blue gray and
magenta<00:00:45.239> those<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.260> our<00:00:46.350> base<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.770> well<00:00:46.890> cyan

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
magenta those are our base as well cyan

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.850 
magenta those are our base as well cyan
so<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> demonstrate<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.649> with

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
so to demonstrate what we can do with

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.600 
so to demonstrate what we can do with
that<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.780> make<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.610> square

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that I'm going to make a little square

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.240 
that I'm going to make a little square
here<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> cyan<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.280> then<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> grab

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
here of cyan and then I'm going to grab

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.470 
here of cyan and then I'm going to grab
C<00:00:59.690> let's<00:01:00.690> say<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:01.020> had<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.500> table<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.239> make<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
C let's say we had a table so to make a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
C let's say we had a table so to make a
table<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.680> usually<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.189> put<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:05.549> like

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
table you usually just put down like

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.719 
table you usually just put down like
vents<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:06.860> pressure<00:01:07.860> plate<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.340> top

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.280 

like<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.020> now<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.340> achieve

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
like that now what we can do to achieve

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.999 
like that now what we can do to achieve
shading<00:01:16.290> under<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.770> table<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:18.450> use<00:01:19.009> blue

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
shading under that table is to use blue

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.679 
shading under that table is to use blue
wool<00:01:20.220> which<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.759> shade<00:01:21.030> darker<00:01:21.060> than<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
wool which is one shade darker than the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.859 
wool which is one shade darker than the
cyan<00:01:22.250> we<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.369> place<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> under<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:23.970> table<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
cyan we can place it under the table and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.070 
cyan we can place it under the table and
I<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.259> we've<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.189> shading<00:01:26.840> but<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:27.990> if

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
I can see we've got shading but what if

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.590 
I can see we've got shading but what if
we<00:01:28.170> wanted<00:01:28.470> lighting<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.369> let's<00:01:29.909> say<00:01:30.299> we've

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
we wanted lighting so let's say we've

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.020 
we wanted lighting so let's say we've
got<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:31.700> wall<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:34.100> I'll<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.220> put<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.909> up

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
got a wall here I'll just put one up

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.890 
got a wall here I'll just put one up
really<00:01:36.390> quick

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
really quick

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.420 
really quick
and<00:01:38.150> then<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.509> course<00:01:39.570> we've<00:01:39.960> got<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.650> window

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and then of course we've got a window

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.370 
and then of course we've got a window
and<00:01:42.409> we<00:01:43.409> wanted<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.689> achieve<00:01:45.689> an<00:01:46.020> effect<00:01:46.290> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and we wanted to achieve an effect that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.700 
and we wanted to achieve an effect that
appeared<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:48.140> light<00:01:49.140> coming<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.680> through

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
appeared to be light coming in through

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.740 
appeared to be light coming in through
the<00:01:49.890> window<00:01:50.130> well<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.579> use<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> next<00:01:51.060> lighter

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the window well we use the next lighter

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.530 
the window well we use the next lighter
shade<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.149> then<00:01:54.149> once<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
shade just like that and then once you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.649 
shade just like that and then once you
switch<00:01:54.750> back<00:01:55.219> on<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.430> other<00:01:56.579> side<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.600> can

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
switch back on the other side you can

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.789 
switch back on the other side you can
see<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.170> looks<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:59.090> strip<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> light<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
see it looks like a strip of light and

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.959 
see it looks like a strip of light and
that<00:02:01.799> looks<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.360> shading<00:02:05.030> all<00:02:06.030> right

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
that looks like shading all right

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.630 
that looks like shading all right
and<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:09.200> works<00:02:09.470> with<00:02:09.709> multiple<00:02:10.129> different

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
and this works with multiple different

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.750 
and this works with multiple different
colors<00:02:12.489> so<00:02:13.489> we've<00:02:13.790> got<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.239> example<00:02:14.560> gray

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
colors so we've got for example gray

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.789 
colors so we've got for example gray
black<00:02:16.760> would<00:02:16.970> be<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.180> shading<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:17.799> light

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
black would be the shading and light

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.320 
black would be the shading and light
gray<00:02:19.040> would<00:02:19.819> be<00:02:20.000> your<00:02:20.830> lighting<00:02:22.120> works<00:02:23.120> with

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
gray would be your lighting works with

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.720 
gray would be your lighting works with
purple<00:02:23.810> use<00:02:24.080> magenta<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:24.739> your<00:02:24.830> base<00:02:25.040> purple

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
purple use magenta for your base purple

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.789 
purple use magenta for your base purple
for<00:02:25.849> your<00:02:26.000> shading<00:02:26.450> pink<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.349> your<00:02:27.440> lighting

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
for your shading pink for your lighting

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.490 
for your shading pink for your lighting
and<00:02:28.030> if<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.150> only<00:02:29.299> have<00:02:29.390> two<00:02:30.080> colors

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
and if you only have two colors

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.589 
and if you only have two colors
available<00:02:30.709> which<00:02:31.400> pretty<00:02:31.970> much<00:02:32.120> applies<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
available which pretty much applies to

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.990 
available which pretty much applies to
the<00:02:32.720> rest<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.080> these<00:02:33.230> colors<00:02:33.590> here<00:02:34.000> for

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
the rest of these colors here for
