00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 Now it is Wakenan that produce a dedicated suspension 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.150
 Eh what kind of Tika ano owner ate a 25 years sot and large crowded 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.379
 Why is I Oh really go 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.450
 Shows accurate responsiveness to steering operation 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.380
 Patty 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.600
 That kind of meaning that I said to change the direction with the coming master 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.339
 Sporty good 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:56.880
 Excess and qualities, such as it can be said also for the sedan dare maybe 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:01:01.480
 Such as ahead in the I'm do you think high feeling I have for a rather car riot 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.180
 Is not it such a suspension setting? 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.120
 then 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:13.030
 It is also good to suppress the roll of the body during cornering 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:18.460
 A pretty tight impression 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:23.440
 I 'm getting a suspension setting that I can get, but I don't feel like I was stuck in high school 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.770
 Even if the road surface is rough during cornering, it will roll properly 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.150
 It likes can absorb there's the road surface smoothly 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.540
 In such a setting 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:37.080
 I am 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:40.290
 Mark x has high potential to be a sporty sedan in the first place 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:46.230
 As the reason for that, it is true that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.320
 The front tire is I think whether there is to say that have adopted the r attached to the drive system 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.560
 Than not take a big burden 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.740
 I respect and feel 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.550
 The rear tire is 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.620
 Because of the role for driving 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.890
 You can affirm that 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:10.500
 The role assignments of each of the four wheels are optimized. 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:17.630
 The balance of weight distribution is also very good 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:21.170
 By the way, I have been praying for the metropolitan expressway now, but what kind of run will you show 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:27.920
 It is immediately, but this road surface seam yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:35.810
 It is because it is an attribute, how to handle the impact of such a joint 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:37.650
 It is very smooth and good, and this is equipped with 19-inch tires and wheels as standard. 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.720
 I'm not sure 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:51.000
 The hardness of the feeling of the ground brought about by the feeling of the ground doesn't bother you. 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:55.260
 And wings so still have wheels can be very lightweight and has become a forging also because 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.340
 It is also true that it is not feeling like Dota or heavy 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.180
 I think that is the reason for a good ride 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:11.379
 It is an after engine but mark x 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:12.580
 Potentially sporty-a great reason for being able to be evaluated as a star cluster 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.890
 You are 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:23.110
 This car is equipped with a 3.5-liter v-type six-cylinder engine 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.670
 It's a combination of the ad 4 s direct injection system. 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.550
 Speaking of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.600
 It is not just a mere kun but actually the port injection is also combined 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.950
 Or a lot of power in a high speed range 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.880
 It is good when you want to live, but to supplement the car for 3 minutes 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:47.690
 Direct injection, ie directly into the name room 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:52.590
 Not only does it inject gasoline , but the rod also injects a hobby into the intake port, causing pathology at a high speed range 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.210
 Why is it set to enjoy purple engine characteristics 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.150
 Hmm 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.150
 You are about 4,000 revolutions now 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.860
 Big 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:10.340
 I could hear the noise now 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:14.780
 Right now I am writing about 4,000 rpm to 6,500 in engine speed 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:20.260
 I have done a number of times but I feel so many 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.820
 It blows up and there is also no head strike feeling in the high speed range 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.100
 6,000 yen 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.440
 That's right , the Reb limiter is activated at around 700 times, but that also 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.780
 Go until just before to a straight line 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.009
 Sluggish regret of quite high chest such as blowing up 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.330
 The good characteristics 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.330
 I was able to enjoy 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.289
 I wonder if this was the mark xg here 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.649
 As expected 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.550
 I as a sporty sedan that mark x has 

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:57.669
 You are very good at your potential 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:03.930
 I think it might have been pulled out 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:07.280
 a For those who choose this, you are satisfied that you have chosen a special one. 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:12.990
 In terms of sporty enough 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:17.790
 I think that you will be consistent, and not only that, it is the body rigidity 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.210
 I improve it by hitting spot 4 section from the stage of the white body etc. 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.900
 Are 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.500
 About this area , the superior quality as riding quality 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.300
 Be able to gain confidence in a very solid car 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.110
 Large actual 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:37.400
 Very high in the sense that it was realized 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.400
 I think it seems that it was an excellent model for total balance.
