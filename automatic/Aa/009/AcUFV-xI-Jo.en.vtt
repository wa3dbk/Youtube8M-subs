the<00:00:08.240> hand<00:00:08.450> roll<00:00:08.660> is<00:00:08.750> a<00:00:08.840> rule<00:00:09.050> that<00:00:09.080> you<00:00:09.260> do

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
the hand roll is a rule that you do

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.230 
the hand roll is a rule that you do
without<00:00:09.620> a<00:00:09.770> paddle<00:00:10.040> and<00:00:10.309> a<00:00:10.370> fun<00:00:10.700> skill<00:00:11.090> to

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
without a paddle and a fun skill to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.180 
without a paddle and a fun skill to
learn<00:00:11.420> even<00:00:12.230> if<00:00:12.350> it<00:00:12.469> isn't<00:00:12.620> something<00:00:13.010> that

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
learn even if it isn't something that

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.529 
learn even if it isn't something that
you'll<00:00:13.400> ever<00:00:13.580> need<00:00:13.910> to<00:00:13.969> use<00:00:14.119> in<00:00:14.330> a<00:00:14.389> real

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
you'll ever need to use in a real

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.750 
you'll ever need to use in a real
situation<00:00:15.010> we're<00:00:16.010> gonna<00:00:16.070> take<00:00:16.369> a<00:00:16.400> look<00:00:16.550> at<00:00:16.670> the

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
situation we're gonna take a look at the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.250 
situation we're gonna take a look at the
hand<00:00:16.970> roll<00:00:17.180> with<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.449> assumption<00:00:17.900> that<00:00:17.930> you

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
hand roll with the assumption that you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.740 
hand roll with the assumption that you
already<00:00:18.500> have<00:00:19.010> a<00:00:19.039> reliable<00:00:19.369> rule<00:00:19.789> so<00:00:20.570> let's

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
already have a reliable rule so let's

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.939 
already have a reliable rule so let's
take<00:00:20.960> a<00:00:20.990> look<00:00:21.140> at<00:00:21.259> the<00:00:21.349> three<00:00:21.589> key<00:00:21.919> elements

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
take a look at the three key elements

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.560 
take a look at the three key elements
the<00:00:22.880> setup<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:24.140> catch<00:00:24.380> and<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.039> recovery<00:00:25.570> the

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
idea behind the hand roll setup is the

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.249 
idea behind the hand roll setup is the
same<00:00:28.609> as<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.089> one<00:00:29.210> for<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.449> CVC<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:29.929> sweep

a two-handed catch or a double pump
technique<00:01:12.969> these<00:01:13.969> two<00:01:14.210> techniques<00:01:14.600> differ<00:01:14.960> in

technique these two techniques differ in

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.020 
technique these two techniques differ in
the<00:01:15.259> same<00:01:15.469> way<00:01:15.649> that<00:01:15.859> the<00:01:16.009> c2c<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:16.759> sweep

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
the same way that the c2c and sweep

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.450 
the same way that the c2c and sweep
rolls<00:01:17.329> do<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.320> two-handed<00:01:18.829> roll<00:01:19.039> is<00:01:19.159> like<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
rolls do the two-handed roll is like the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.849 
rolls do the two-handed roll is like the
c2c<00:01:19.939> rule<00:01:20.179> because<00:01:20.810> you'll<00:01:20.990> use<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.229> single

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
c2c rule because you'll use a single

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.309 
c2c rule because you'll use a single
quick<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.399> powerful<00:01:22.670> brace<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.899> gain<00:01:24.140> the

quick and powerful brace to gain the

support your hip snap needs the double

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.590 
support your hip snap needs the double
pump<00:01:27.289> technique<00:01:27.710> uses<00:01:28.369> one<00:01:28.700> arm<00:01:28.939> at<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.149> time<00:01:29.390> in

pump technique uses one arm at a time in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.319 
pump technique uses one arm at a time in
a<00:01:29.689> two-step<00:01:30.259> motion<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:31.219> provides<00:01:31.609> longer

a two-step motion that provides longer
bracing<00:01:32.780> support<00:01:33.229> just<00:01:33.770> like<00:01:33.889> the<00:01:34.039> sweep<00:01:34.280> roll

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
bracing support just like the sweep roll

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.609 
bracing support just like the sweep roll
does<00:01:37.210> for<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.299> double<00:01:38.539> pump<00:01:38.749> start<00:01:39.530> by

does for the double pump start by

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.319 
does for the double pump start by

as soon as the left hand begins losing
its<00:01:44.060> effectiveness<00:01:44.590> reach<00:01:45.590> out<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:45.950> push
