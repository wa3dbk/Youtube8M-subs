00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.870
 today I'm going to make a chickpea stew and 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.710
 to start we will have about 50 grams of 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.870
 chickpeas 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.060
 a slice of thin pumpkin 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:20.280
 a potato 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:24.360
 a little tomato onion pepper and 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:28.430
 the spinach the salt 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.430
 and the oil are not going to start 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.760
 for putting the oil in the pan that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.250
 It will be the little one we have to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.910
 accustom since we are alone to have 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.380
 to do the little ones because that's not the way 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.380
 whether or not the recipe is made 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.269
 and let's take engraftment 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.470
 let it be done in the meantime 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.470
 keep cutting in the potato 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.329
 to slices 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.329
 to tacos 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 when I'm in fact everything is forgotten 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.600
 we cut the climbing to the pumpkin 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.320
 it is very easy to have a foot 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.909
 quietly 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.409
 nothing happens and we call them little girls 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.829
 so that you 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.009
 do well we do not want it to be a city 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.009
 entire 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.600
 that's OK 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.310
 we keep it with all the legs already 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.310
 I'm in the legs of the carare right away 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.880
 normally the onion is thrown the same 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.880
 time that the pepper what happens that 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.130
 I'm going to you is tender and the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.130
 knowledge will be made too 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.220
 with the work that is going on 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.530
 and her 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.530
 the pumpkin 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.700
 so that it is done 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.610
 it does not interest him to go out a bit to 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.610
 that will come out more more tender juicier 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 doing it 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.850
 I add the tomato 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.300
 even if it is done 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.579
 and the area 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:12.300
 cookies because if we do many 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.300
 you always have to improve after 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.500
 that is done well of alternating 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.920
 Now that is the tomato is almost that 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.920
 I add a little paprika 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.130
 a little bit because we do not need to have 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.130
 too many touches 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.200
 we add the potatoes 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.680
 let's also put the two meters or 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.870
 the amounts are as pine or whether 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.939
 can go directly to the pot not 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.750
 we have to wait four hours 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.750
 to be done 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.930
 we will add a little water 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.569
 and the spinach the spinach 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.639
 here come very little 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.939
 because we do not want everything to be 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.900
 spinach and so whole and are well 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:41.680
 we are going to throw them whole 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.840
 and let it be done 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.780
 now in 20 minutes we will see how 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.409
 it's so good because this computer already 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.929
 are now going to go to the plate 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:59.099
 quietly here as you see will not know 

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:59.099
 each and don makes a dish a person 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.250
 good spinach that have stayed in 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.250
 nothing 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.490
 but I adjust
