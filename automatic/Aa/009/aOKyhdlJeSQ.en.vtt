I<00:03:31.310> just<00:03:32.150> don't<00:03:32.329> see<00:03:32.479> how<00:03:32.510> that's<00:03:32.780> fun<00:03:33.250> but

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
I just don't see how that's fun but

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.830 
I just don't see how that's fun but
that's<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.579> primary<00:03:34.790> reason<00:03:35.060> right<00:03:35.419> there<00:03:35.449> is

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
that's the primary reason right there is

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.189 
that's the primary reason right there is
is<00:03:36.579> why<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.639> game<00:03:38.269> type<00:03:38.510> is<00:03:38.659> not<00:03:38.810> fun<00:03:38.989> for<00:03:39.019> me

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
is why the game type is not fun for me

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.009 
is why the game type is not fun for me
but<00:03:39.470> like<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.489> said<00:03:40.549> they<00:03:41.269> they<00:03:41.629> need<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.900> do<00:03:41.989> a

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
but like I said they they need to do a

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.740 
but like I said they they need to do a
better<00:03:42.229> job<00:03:42.349> of<00:03:42.650> picking<00:03:43.639> naps<00:03:44.000> for<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.540> game

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
better job of picking naps for this game

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.050 
better job of picking naps for this game

for<00:05:19.699> rushing<00:05:20.060> I<00:05:20.210> mean<00:05:20.389> this<00:05:20.629> I<00:05:20.900> find<00:05:21.500> this<00:05:21.620> gun

beating<00:05:22.129> out<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.279> famas<00:05:22.699> sometimes<00:05:23.150> at<00:05:23.330> close

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:23.719 
beating out the famas sometimes at close

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:26.050 
beating out the famas sometimes at close
range<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.310> if<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.460> combine<00:05:25.759> it<00:05:25.789> with<00:05:25.909> the

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
range and if you combine it with the

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.249 
range and if you combine it with the
classic<00:05:26.389> controller<00:05:26.449> obviously<00:05:27.139> you're

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
classic controller obviously you're

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.219 
classic controller obviously you're
going<00:05:27.379> to<00:05:27.439> be<00:05:27.529> in<00:05:27.560> at<00:05:27.889> an<00:05:28.279> advantage<00:05:28.639> and

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
going to be in at an advantage and

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.180 
going to be in at an advantage and
that's<00:05:30.229> what<00:05:30.319> I<00:05:30.409> forgot<00:05:30.529> to<00:05:30.770> say<00:05:30.949> i've<00:05:31.039> been

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
that's what I forgot to say i've been

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.800 
that's what I forgot to say i've been
using<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.550> classic<00:05:31.879> controller<00:05:31.940> a<00:05:32.479> little

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
using the classic controller a little

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.350 
using the classic controller a little
bit<00:05:32.930> more<00:05:33.080> recently<00:05:33.590> and<00:05:33.860> here's<00:05:34.430> why<00:05:34.639> if

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
bit more recently and here's why if

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.050 
bit more recently and here's why if
obviously<00:05:35.870> modern<00:05:36.440> warfare<00:05:36.560> 3<00:05:36.759> does<00:05:37.759> come<00:05:37.969> out

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
obviously modern warfare 3 does come out

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.089 
obviously modern warfare 3 does come out
for<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.240> wii<00:05:38.560> it's<00:05:39.560> probably<00:05:39.889> going<00:05:40.039> to

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
for the wii it's probably going to

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.769 
for the wii it's probably going to
support<00:05:40.669> classic<00:05:41.090> controller<00:05:41.449> and<00:05:41.690> it's

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:41.779 
support classic controller and it's

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.360 
support classic controller and it's
probably<00:05:41.960> going<00:05:42.199> to<00:05:42.259> have<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.620> same<00:05:42.830> benefits

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
probably going to have the same benefits

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.909 
probably going to have the same benefits
that<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:43.610> does<00:05:43.819> in<00:05:43.940> black<00:05:44.120> ops<00:05:44.330> so<00:05:45.110> instead<00:05:45.860> of

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
that it does in black ops so instead of

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.950 
that it does in black ops so instead of
you<00:05:46.219> know<00:05:46.250> being<00:05:46.520> adamant<00:05:47.000> and<00:05:47.180> just<00:05:47.479> you<00:05:47.839> know

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
you know being adamant and just you know

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.200 
you know being adamant and just you know
being<00:05:48.680> mad<00:05:48.979> at<00:05:49.009> the<00:05:49.190> classic<00:05:49.580> controller<00:05:49.699> and

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
being mad at the classic controller and

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.360 
being mad at the classic controller and
using<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.569> wiimote<00:05:50.930> i'm<00:05:51.889> just<00:05:52.190> going<00:05:52.339> to

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
using the wiimote i'm just going to

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.829 
using the wiimote i'm just going to
practice<00:05:52.819> the<00:05:52.940> classic<00:05:53.330> controller<00:05:53.389> get

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:53.839 
practice the classic controller get

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.339 
practice the classic controller get
better<00:05:54.050> at<00:05:54.259> it<00:05:54.289> and<00:05:55.389> no<00:05:56.389> you<00:05:56.629> know<00:05:56.750> it's<00:05:57.110> always

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
better at it and no you know it's always

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.649 
better at it and no you know it's always
good<00:05:57.529> to<00:05:57.560> be<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:58.699> be<00:05:58.849> good<00:05:59.060> with<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.300> classic

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
good to be to be good with the classic

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.930 
good to be to be good with the classic
controller<00:05:59.719> because<00:06:00.139> it<00:06:00.560> has<00:06:00.889> its<00:06:01.219> it<00:06:01.520> has<00:06:01.699> its

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
controller because it has its it has its
