00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.410
 of 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:18.930
 You do 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:30.870
 You a thing about Hello everyone this guitar course it is a little the Gitarere 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 I would like to talk to you If you can be a guitar if its delayed 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:39.360
 It will feel like the ukulele of the 6th string of the meeting but 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.800
 If you're playing guitar , I think you're in the form of being late 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.240
 If you think going to start from now Though 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.380
 Had 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:51.180
 If it comes to you, it will be that guitar and it will consist of four things. 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:57.480
 Of course the way of tuning is different The way of tuning is also different and 4 cases 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.120
 Of course the behavior of the rabbit is different and that of the code 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.469
 The variation is also 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.469
 Of course it has decreased but is not not about the type of the code guitar 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.760
 Such people of in one series a give me of doing was saying this person in that say I like that in 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.479
 The guitare 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.150
 Though we recommend six strings late 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:23.630
 a First, tune it 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.710
 How different from or say seen in this way from the 6-string the case of the guitar it is and likely Shimi' 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.870
 I mean it has become the wind 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.550
 It is this familiar natural tuning though 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.140
 For example guitar ukulele it is in the case of that guitar is 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:40.800
 It is why has the wind say from the direction of 6 yen Naa'd Tsu Sodomira 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.050
 In other words, it is the same as the sound of the 5th fret of the heater written at the bottom 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.720
 It is why such 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.520
 The Chords of uc this way tuned to the so-called guitar in Gitarere 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 The sound is f 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.930
 It will be said that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:04.740
 But that Well Jitsukata is it is different not from its holding hand in it guitar folds 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:09.570
 But it is very useful in that the flag is the same, but in that sense the guitar and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.100
 If you want to do both ukulele, it's also an ant to try that guitar 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.880
 I guess it's not like that 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:21.040
 Iwano a after that is when exactly I How to sleep 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.010
 If you want to play a little grayish with a guitar because it is different, hey 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.879
 Videos that you might find helpful 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.879
 You will see 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.770
 Now I will talk about using a guitar, but this common classic guitar 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:38.090
 It is good color game 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.210
 Everyone years grass tuning As I earlier 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.210
 Four 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.580
 The sound is lower than it is safely compared to the group that delays 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.190
 Also 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.520
 As I mentioned earlier, I will use the stock for a while 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.170
 It is not a big deal with the commentary, but 5 fret people 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.130
 This is that guitare 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.300
 But it is not be in this position of that open strings Then 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:11.370
 It is so with bullets 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.800
 It becomes a form, and it will tune like this in the case of giza 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.690
 In fact 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:22.860
 So we have or cheap no Rogen di was such that street matter is used 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.260
 But it is is easy to do If you are familiar with the forehead So Holding the c 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.670
 So real noise is f 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.670
 Though it will be Kobe 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.160
