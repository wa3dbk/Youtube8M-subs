00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 you know when you see these abandoned 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.519
 you feel some kind of weird 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.950
 feeling admiration bewilderment and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.250
 awkwardness 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.529
 there are abandoned temples like 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.330
 bloodied torn giants they 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.210
 live out their last 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.550
 not a decade has passed since 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.830
 since the Russian Orthodox Church 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.829
 returned from nothingness restoring their 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.590
 ownership rights because money is in cities and 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.079
 new temples are being built lush rich 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.079
 here on the restoration of old unfortunately 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.820
 ROC can not on these funds today we 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.100
 will visit three villages of Chelyabinsk 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.200
 areas where it is best preserved 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.930
 buildings of pre-revolutionary Russia 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.970
 1831 the villagers of Bolzi received 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.390
 about the diocese building permits 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.240
 the temple 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.030
 the same on a high hill above the river senor 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.680
 and laid the first stone 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.140
 decades later, highlighted the main 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.189
 limit and then another 40 years completed 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.200
 the temple must be said that the temple was built 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.270
 only at the expense of villagers 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.550
 at that time there was no big village 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.040
 the rich 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.060
 there were 800 courtyards and almost 5 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.730
 thousand inhabitants 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.250
 so the church turned out rather big 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.920
 nice decorated with frescoes and expensive 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.650
 icons a total of half a century on 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.840
 the church spent over 36 thousand 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.050
 rubles for this money could be 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.370
 buy over 500 horses 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.520
 after the temple closed in the thirties 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.850
 began his looting language did 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.500
 the barrels of the bell melted in casles 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.940
 the spark we made at the beginning of the granary 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.640
 later workshop 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.100
 roof railing broke down the floor as early as 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.970
 the seventies at the moment the temple 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.890
 trying to restore the village is a bug number 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.060
 one of the first Russian settlements on 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.990
 territory of the region 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.190
 It was founded in 1688 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.250
 this village was once one of 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.960
 the largest and richest villages in the district here 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.540
 here we have found the most unusual 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.220
 building for a russian village like 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.170
 there are no buildings even in big cities 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.240
 so she has undeniable 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.310
 historical value 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.980
 in the highest visible place of the village 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.490
 not a temple was erected but a state 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.380
 peasant bank at the moment from 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.210
 it left a majestic two-story 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.220
 red brick ruins 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.460
 the view from the bank window was opened 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.990
 amazing open spaces and fields 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.450
 wriggling testicle cocked over it 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.090
 drink arched bridge in front of the building 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.630
 forged graceful fence now here 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.030
 emptiness 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.670
 only cascade walks in the desert 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.530
 the rooms of the former bank are incredible 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.510
 beauty is exactly the mentality of the house outside 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.080
 and the neglect of the stench within such 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.970
 buildings 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.580
 of historical importance in this 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.370
 the village is estimated by archivists about 100 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.320
 many retained only the outline of the attack 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.990
 it is in a perfectly fit condition 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.000
 another interesting pre-revolutionary 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.380
 the building is weakly burning this church 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.020
 the ascension of the Lord 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.270
 the little chapel is quite small for such 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.010
 rich power I dare to suggest that 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.620
 secular sentiment here was much 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.100
 more than a religious church was 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.230
 founded in 1818 on sundays 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.170
 and to holidays it seemed that the bells were beating 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.090
 especially celebrations all the power was going to 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.130
 churches here baptized newborn 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.470
 were obtained 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.680
 burial service for the deceased here life cycle 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.810
 person was associated with the church and in 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.000
 thirties of the twentieth century and i 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.670
 waited the same fate as the rest 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.380
 religious buildings at the moment 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.320
 the church is in a dilapidated 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.340
 state of demons without doors with 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.250
 failed roof 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.920
 ancient frescoes are appreciated on the walls 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.460
 they say that there are secret networks in the church 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.100
 moves 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.280
 we managed to find the entrance leading under the ground 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.660
 but he was bombarded 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.210
 old-timers suggest that somewhere here 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.360
 tucked away from the supreme treasure so one or 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.090
 no unknown and one more amazing 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.580
 a church in the area just a few 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.220
 minutes from the village will burn is 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.580
 village fire and sights 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.140
 the village is the church of ilya the prophet 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.989
 Perhaps this is the only temple that 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.360
 saved the cross crowning spire say 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.580
 what did you try to shoot in different years 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.370
 so we were able to get every attempt 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.130
 is over 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.050
 this temple was opened in 1827 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.870
 construction money was raised 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.720
 religious clerics were people 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.729
 business why the temple flourished church 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.130
 belonged to alabaster code which 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.919
 earned income later with the keep 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.689
 credit partnership established 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.669
 butter making and cheese-making for 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.830
 from whom there may be special murals 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.409
 they are much better preserved from the rails 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.659
 other parishes say that when creating 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.150
 paints were used the best products 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:00.490
 and the secret of freesk descriptions brought from 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.469
 the capital itself in the thirties church 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.349
 turned into a granary 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:07.569
 and later completely abandoned and worth it 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:12.430
 she is lonely in her crumbling beauty 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:14.740
 who knows how much I know and we want 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.870
