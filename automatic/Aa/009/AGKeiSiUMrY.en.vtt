00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello youtube friends here again with 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 you on this occasion I come to you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.090
 make a comparison about which emulator 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.920
 it's better in this new space that I've 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.660
 started my channel I will show you 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.059
 comparatives of emulators and their 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 recommendations for your pc in addition to 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.400
 leave links to download them good not 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.400
 let's wait more and start this video 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 to release this section we will begin 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.720
 with the emulators that have had 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 conflicts over time over 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.040
 who is better than the other 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.260
 and finally I have the answer first 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.660
 I'll put a megaman 8 demo on the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.170
 x emulator that end and then the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.170
 excel 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.430
 well we can see that at the beginning 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.690
 with pauses in the screen of 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.690
 presentation of capcom 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.280
 although in the animation if it looks fluid 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.200
 and the start screen appears normal 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.200
 with a few pauses 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:44.180
 well at least if the game is curable 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.600
 although you think that I lack memory in the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.220
 pc actually have 4 gigs of ram 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.100
 united the hard drive plus the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.930
 ipc is new the reason why it goes like this 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.479
 I'll give it to you until the end of the video 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.100
 well I think it's time to see the 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.100
 emulators are running 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.469
 good the capcom screen passes clean 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.510
 the animation is the same 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.470
 I do not remember rays how this is removed 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.599
 now it's going to change 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 this keyboard does not help me in anything anymore 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.920
 I pressed all the keys that I put to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.019
 all the emulators that I use I remember 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.780
 of that because I try to play a game 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.239
 that I needed the analog sticks and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.250
 If they ask I did not, I lost a whole 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.049
 late trying to download that for 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.180
 Realize that you can not play 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.480
 without analog control 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.140
 wait I think I already found the way to 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.140
 remove this 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.670
 play 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.430
 I can not believe that this will happen good yet 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.010
 this test is not over, something curious is 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.420
 that the first time that happened to me that I felt 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.420
 that I had stuck the emulator 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.610
 d 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.680
 good though it's hard to believe if it grabs 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.750
 well the game until I can compete in 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.750
 who finishes the game in less time 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.079
 well after seeing this let's go to the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.079
 conclusions 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.340
 well the reason I told them that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.170
 will wait is that the ps x fin emulator goes 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.330
 slow because it has a filter 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.250
 special that carries the playstation that 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.380
 makes square graphics are not 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.630
 making visible the system will 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.730
 it costs more work to run the game a 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.190
 good side but bad for another is that 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.020
 there does not have that filter doing 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.030
 that the graphics look more square 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.370
 causing it to be easier to 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.310
 process but visually doing less 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.650
 complex to the good game after doing 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.739
 the explanation is time to say the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.560
 advantages and disadvantages of emulators 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.320
 well let's start with ps x film the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.570
 advantages are 1 the emulator can 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.410
 produce good graphics on any pc 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.830
 2 can be set easy and fast 3 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.020
 can read more formats of games 4 no 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.960
 is locked in no game now the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.300
 disadvantages 1 it is not possible to do more 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.570
 fast the emulator since it does not have 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.660
 More options 2 does not detect accurately 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.060
 some controls that are not play station 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.000
 is does not have a crowd that is for 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.020
 play a four well now let's go with 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.140
 x the advantages are 1 the emulator can 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.260
 run on any pc 2 can detect 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.050
 almost any pc 3 control can be 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.330
 use multi touch 4 has more 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.390
 options to change now the 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.660
 disadvantages 1 is locked in many games 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.210
 2 does not grab all game formats 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.000
 3 the graphics are still seeing 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.610
 squares although they improve good I think 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.890
 that are already all seeing which is the best 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:28.210
 Well, if it's nothing more and nothing less than x 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.390
 congratulations to the winner and that he receives 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.550
 much public future good although ps x 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.740
 end has not won does not mean 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.140
 which is bad if you want you can also 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.120
 try and give your opinion about the 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.130
 links I leave in the description for 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.250
 download them plus a page of 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.950
 games well up here comes the video if 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.690
 you wish you can leave the video but if 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.060
 they want to hear the announcement that I'm going to 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.670
 give then wait while those who are 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.010
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.010
 and see you in another video bye bye 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.660
 the reason why I have not gone up 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.880
 videos after my video analysis and 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.319
 criticism is because I finally managed to get 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.690
 they will punish me and that led to 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.150
 consequence that I no longer use my PC 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.880
 a good time I still do not follow but not for 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.860
 a long time so do not despair if 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.389
 they want me to do another tutorial because 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.729
 I will keep coming and more in the 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.699
 vacation if I'm not going bad and I'm still 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.889
 well in the classes subscribe and comment 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.300
 so that I try to improve comment 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.220
 if you saw it is a problem with the 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.560
 program or that the grabber does not work 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.710
 so I can put it if I do it in 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:44.479
 another video I say goodbye I'm mister ramen and 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.479
 see you in another video bye bye
