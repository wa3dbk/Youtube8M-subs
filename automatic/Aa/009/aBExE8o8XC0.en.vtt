00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.819
 by argentina de pelo her line of 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.610
 global products that will present 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.200
 during 2013 we were there and 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.389
 we chat with ricardo flaminio 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.849
 director of marketing and sales that we 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.619
 He gave all the details we wanted a 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.080
 little ahead of the amount of 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.380
 what's going to be in June 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.830
 next in the living room of buenos aires and 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.510
 the idea was that you can see and 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.760
 through you clients 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.960
 Argentines the news that Ford has 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.750
 and that will be in the dealers 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.030
 sometimes in cars or in classrooms 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.380
 present and present also many 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.150
 products that later do not see the light but 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.180
 what did we say good to see 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.770
 let's take a moment before so that 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.050
 the press is a strain and can communicate 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.670
 what are the news ford that very 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.310
 soon up on the street as are the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.490
 new party the new focus and the new 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.590
 Cuba 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.700
 from the party to tell us briefly 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.020
 how good the truth that first of all 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.460
 talk about a very successful brand in 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.079
 argentina from the kinetic party 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 design 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.180
 the design of the car the truth that has 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.350
 revolutionized the segment and allowed 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.320
 to fort enter a range of 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.939
 let's say of price where in stop the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.250
 segment b was not participating and 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.500
 now that he has done it with great success 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.619
 auto is a winner and this car comes to 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.140
 with some aesthetic changes and some 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.140
 changes and new technology offers 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.390
 comes to let's say replace that success that 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.149
 I just told you the truth 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.610
 that the greatest novelty the car is going through 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.990
 his trunk and also because he's going to have the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.549
 Sequential automatic box of six 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.590
 marches what allows you also 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.429
 access an audience that looks for that type 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.899
 of transmission in the case of focus is 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.450
 a car that does not have a single piece of 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.369
 his predecessor or the car that is seen today in 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.140
 the street was third generation of spotlights 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.000
 that we sell in Argentina and the truth 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.649
 which is a car that will call the 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.830
 attention mainly for its level 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.530
 technological a car that will compete in 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.110
 very different price ranges and with 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.549
 that will also allow customers to 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.220
 today maybe they do not see in current football 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.560
 an alternative they will surely see 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.140
 in this new car and finally the kuga 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.640
 a car that really ayub and that we 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.200
 surprised everyone about the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.989
 audience response 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.300
 and almost three times the volume 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.739
 that we had estimated and that because 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.390
 let's be conservative but really 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.310
 the given segment appears at the level of 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.239
 volume and self-work clients of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.800
 every side luckily this version 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.830
 exceeds the previous one in terms of size 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.720
 it's a longer vehicle that allows you 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.730
 have greater interior capacity and a 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.980
 greater trunk capacity in turn also 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.780
 just as the focus will surprise you by 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.569
 your level of security technology what 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.680
 the focus represents as to what is the 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.700
 car that we are going to produce in argentina 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.200
 gives you a plus with respect to the rest or 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.180
 be that along with the ryder is the car 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.490
 that we are very proud to manufacture 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.650
 we do it very well and the truth is that 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.690
 it generates a certain level of commitment 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.940
 emotionally different since having it has 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.310
 produced in our pacheco plant 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.490
 makes the car say 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.050
 work it in another way too 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.510
 just the success of this car is 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.710
 guaranteed the truth that we have 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.110
 been very successful in terms of 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.940
 production and the quality of this fire 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.770
 I was going and this new 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.870
 surely it is more than the height of the 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.220
 previous and good since we are in the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.750
 imminent report in the hall of the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.760
 automobile these three cars are going to be 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.400
 in the living room and surely a novelty 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.840
 extra if there's going to be more things going to be 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.270
 some more version of these cars that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.890
 we are seeing here and the idea is that the 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.480
 People who go to the people's car 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.710
 that they go to the car I turn to 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.700
 surprising as they do every year 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.700
 with the line of form
