 links because it approaches one of the most 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.619
 important videogame conventions 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.660
 the e3 let's start with the first the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.369
 first it is a very important company 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.800
 of video games and already made a movie 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.410
 we talk about the ego because it's going to get the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.760
 new lego cures and leather obviously by 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.090
 the next premiere of his movie 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.770
 jurassic word this adaptation like all 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.899
 the adaptations he has had 'jurassic 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.879
 park ' I think it will be amazing to us 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.370
 they promise because they will be three 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.100
 movies included in 20 levels each 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 one of the movies this game comes out the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.020
 June 12 the next game is pay 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 day 20 had already left but now 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.460
 we talk about pay day 2 that also already 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.090
 had left in 2013 in fact but what 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.590
 that excites us too much is what 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.570
 and is that they are going to get an edition 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.330
 special called crime wave edition 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.610
 this edition apart from including the pay 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.470
 day 2 which is located in washington a 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.420
 difference of the pay day 1 that is 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.000
 located around the world 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.280
 apart it will include a full year of dlcs 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.340
 and an extension that excites us 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 quite and also an extra character the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.770
 first delinquent woman yes yes this 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.290
 gang of delinquent clowns and 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.119
 traffickers will now apparently be 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.850
 directed by a woman 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.649
 claver claver will be the new delinquent 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.899
 Well for all the fans of this game 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.119
 now you can have all the dlcs 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.550
 they say that for free but really not 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.649
 you have to buy the new delivery for 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.450
 to be able to have all of those of him that's the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.000
 next game maybe many do not 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.460
 have heard it's called the black the black 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.649
 cloud is a game that was developed and 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.080
 I was for the news that I am going to give you 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.360
 It was developed by the ex 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.580
 version developers this game 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.230
 that we all took one scare 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.600
 but also visually it was very cute 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.070
 and very father and I think even something 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.740
 credible was inhabited by beings 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.320
 too weird the truth we could not 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.880
 see a lot because he was a hipster and 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.710
 that's precisely why we can no longer 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.180
 they have them in our hands 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.430
 they mentioned that the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.470
 project because there were no longer funds 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.960
 and then there was not much desire to 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.670
 work because they conquered you do not have 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.830
 more than the first income and despite 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.900
 have exceeded the money they had at 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.700
 they could not do it well 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.080
 we are with a game that is going to be one of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.000
 my favorites and we also carry 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.070
 waiting a long time for so many times 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.410
 that has been postponed talked about batman 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.300
 arkham light had already told us that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.050
 we could be able to play with a 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.180
 more character 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.920
 apart from the classic batman and that too 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.350
 is prevented from stealing bing but now already 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.330
 we know we can play fights but 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.880
 We all wondered how old I think 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.300
 that is going to be going to be almost base does not fill 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.400
 to be a barbarian, yes, apparently all 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.260
 we were right we thought that because of the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.810
 next movie that will come out of Switzerland 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.180
 squad would have to be barbarous rush 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.760
 derrick said he's going to be barbaric and that's why 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.380
 has clarified many many many doubts 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.200
 that we the fans had 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.520
 like because it comes out now with in the trailer 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.980
 now we know 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.290
 apparently suites quad airs and batman 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.360
 arkham light the video game will be very 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.520
 related due to a comic the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.830
 killing that all of you must already 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.450
 know now let's talk about some things the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.840
 really not so nice 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.760
 konami konami ship that company that we 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.520
 delivered so many games that we enjoyed 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.710
 so much was not delivered perhaps rock not 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.930
 delivered I went a sun and handed us 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.150
 silent hill because a week ago 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.280
 they gave the news that konami no longer 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.160
 is developing silent hill and also 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.820
 God is no longer the father of all 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.280
 games 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.740
 hideo kojima and with this came many 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.020
 news what's going to happen with konami that 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.030
 it happens to me then after having 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.910
 withdrawn all your accounts from the stock market 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.800
 of the USA has stated that now it 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.770
 will dedicate a little more to the games 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.520
 mobile that we do not like much but 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.580
 says he does it because of several successes 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.460
 what has he had in these 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.650
 types or this game platform because 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.720
 really the mobile games they say 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.700
 what is the future and maybe it is but 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.450
 not in that way looking to send so 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.460
 radical your company to make games that 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.740
 they have marked time to make games for 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.750
 mobiles even mentioned that maybe 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.060
 they would take some of their franchises to 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.970
 this platform now talking about 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.850
 macabre companies we have there seen and 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.170
 ubisoft has created many many games 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.710
 that everyone has called our attention 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.430
 but now he mentioned that he is 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.400
 dedicating to 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.740
 well, we talk about reality 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.690
 virtual and augmented reality the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.270
 virtual reality is where you are 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.790
 centering and ubis and is it saying that such 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.220
 is likely to carry some of your 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.010
 very famous games to this kind of 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.740
 platforms or rather adapt them to this 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.620
 type of technologies is now also 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.250
 developing games that can take the 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.040
 100% of this technology the truth is that 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.010
 between promises and warnings has always 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.410
 given as disappointments between a 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.320
 game between the dlcs between finishing 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.610
 our money precisely a game of 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.440
 ubisoft 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.600
 Assassin's Creed has given a lot of what 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.640
 talk because your last game until you 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.580
 they instruct you it was not the best we had 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.130
 the truth many were left wanting 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.600
 of improving the game many said that 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.050
 they lost their money 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.480
