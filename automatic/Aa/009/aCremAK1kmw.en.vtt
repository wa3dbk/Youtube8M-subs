you're gonna do that it cannot go over
half<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:04.140> instead<00:01:05.140> of<00:01:05.289> just<00:01:05.469> having<00:01:05.740> the

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
half of that instead of just having the

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.459 
half of that instead of just having the
wheel<00:01:06.130> flat<00:01:06.520> like<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.240> hitting<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:08.320> it

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
wheel flat like this and hitting it it

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:14.130 
wheel flat like this and hitting it it
could<00:01:08.649> go<00:01:08.829> over<00:01:09.520> like<00:01:10.360> that<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.810> it's<00:01:13.990> not

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
could go over like that but it's not

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.039 
could go over like that but it's not
that<00:01:14.200> big<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:15.310> only<00:01:15.570> has<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.600> little<00:01:16.930> bit

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
that big so it only has a little bit

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.910 
that big so it only has a little bit
maybe<00:01:17.649> something<00:01:18.130> like<00:01:18.310> uh<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:19.229> brick<00:01:20.229> maybe

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
maybe something like uh a brick maybe

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.520 
maybe something like uh a brick maybe
that'll<00:01:21.340> do<00:01:22.829> that<00:01:23.829> suspension<00:01:24.430> hold<00:01:25.030> up<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
that'll do that suspension hold up this

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.050 
that'll do that suspension hold up this
is<00:01:26.590> great<00:01:27.070> for<00:01:27.250> stop-motion<00:01:27.490> though<00:01:27.939> I<00:01:27.969> do

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
is great for stop-motion though I do

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.760 
is great for stop-motion though I do
have<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.359> say<00:01:29.490> yep<00:01:30.490> but<00:01:31.119> it<00:01:31.509> could<00:01:31.719> uh<00:01:31.770> there

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
have to say yep but it could uh there

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.830 
have to say yep but it could uh there
you<00:01:32.859> go

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you go

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.289 
you go
so

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.800 

that's<00:01:39.110> pretty<00:01:39.380> great<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:40.810> stretches

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
that's pretty great and it stretches

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.460 
that's pretty great and it stretches
around<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:44.000> wheel<00:01:44.240> bends<00:01:45.049> like<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:47.470> that's

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
around the wheel bends like that that's

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.969 
around the wheel bends like that that's
great

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
great

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.190 
great
and<00:01:50.830> um<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.520> believe<00:01:52.909> 44<00:01:53.509> pieces<00:01:56.200> it's

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
and um is I believe 44 pieces it's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.919 
and um is I believe 44 pieces it's
really<00:01:57.740> really<00:01:58.009> nice

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.010
