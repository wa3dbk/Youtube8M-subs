00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and the idea behind this map hmm if I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.890 
and the idea behind this map hmm if I
throw<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.229> thumb<00:01:08.119> you<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.270> sent<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> hell

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
throw this thumb you get sent to hell

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.310 
throw this thumb you get sent to hell
well<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.380> you've<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.710> heaven<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.220> hell

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
well so you've got like heaven and hell

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.620 
well so you've got like heaven and hell
as<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.130> obviously<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.150> can't<00:01:15.450> get

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
as you can see so obviously I can't get

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
as you can see so obviously I can't get
across<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.799> hell<00:01:19.220> we<00:01:20.220> can

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
across here so if I go to hell we can

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.020 
across here so if I go to hell we can
cross<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> bridge<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> let's<00:01:23.610> put<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.909> back

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
cross the bridge so let's put it back

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.370 
cross the bridge so let's put it back
down<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.450> go<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> heaven<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.080> there's<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
down you go to heaven and there's the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
down you go to heaven and there's the
bridge<00:01:25.530> gone<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:25.920> you're<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.159> other<00:01:26.280> side

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
bridge gone but you're on the other side

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
bridge gone but you're on the other side
that's<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.270> basic<00:01:27.659> concept<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> map<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that's the basic concept of the map you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080 
that's the basic concept of the map you
have<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> switch<00:01:29.070> between<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.520> worlds<00:01:29.909> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
have to switch between the worlds in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.190 
have to switch between the worlds in
order<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.200> around<00:01:31.850> now<00:01:32.850> i'm<00:01:33.720> only<00:01:33.960> going

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
order to get around now i'm only going

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
order to get around now i'm only going

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.369 

mmm<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.510> actually<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> bit<00:03:36.049> worried<00:03:36.230> in

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
mmm this is actually a bit worried in

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.949 
mmm this is actually a bit worried in
this<00:03:36.530> one<00:03:37.359> because<00:03:38.359> I<00:03:38.480> don't<00:03:38.659> know<00:03:38.720> where<00:03:38.840> the

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
this one because I don't know where the

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.690 
this one because I don't know where the
drop<00:03:39.169> is<00:03:39.200> in<00:03:39.620> hell<00:03:39.859> world<00:03:40.099> so<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.400> might<00:03:40.549> just

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
drop is in hell world so I might just

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.440 
drop is in hell world so I might just
drop<00:03:41.000> down<00:03:42.340> all<00:03:43.340> right<00:03:43.459> let's<00:03:43.669> say<00:03:43.879> go<00:03:44.180> back<00:03:44.329> to

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
drop down all right let's say go back to

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.000 
drop down all right let's say go back to
hell<00:03:44.599> way<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:44.930> we<00:03:45.139> can<00:03:45.169> go<00:03:45.319> straight<00:03:45.349> up<00:03:45.829> here

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
hell way so we can go straight up here

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.130 
hell way so we can go straight up here
switch<00:03:46.609> it<00:03:46.760> back

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.110 

so<00:03:53.920> we<00:03:54.040> need<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.310> get<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.610> key

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.940 

let's<00:04:01.930> try<00:04:02.080> by<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.349> cat<00:04:02.560> there's<00:04:02.739> gotta<00:04:02.890> be

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
far out that chasm actually is right now

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.240 
far out that chasm actually is right now
so<00:04:37.810> let's<00:04:38.020> see<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.169> drop<00:04:38.470> over<00:04:38.740> there<00:04:38.919> what

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
so let's see a drop over there what

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.879 
so let's see a drop over there what
we're<00:04:39.370> gonna<00:04:39.460> do<00:04:39.669> is<00:04:39.850> I<00:04:40.470> know<00:04:41.470> how<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.650> do<00:04:41.800> it

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
we're gonna do is I know how to do it

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:48.810 
we're gonna do is I know how to do it
now<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:44.070> think<00:04:46.949> actually<00:04:47.949> I<00:04:48.130> don't<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.669> thought

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
now I think actually I don't I thought

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.250 
now I think actually I don't I thought
there<00:04:49.030> was<00:04:49.120> some<00:04:49.330> sort<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.690> drop<00:04:49.990> you're<00:04:50.169> not

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
there was some sort of drop you're not

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.409 
there was some sort of drop you're not
allowed<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.470> break<00:04:50.770> blocks<00:04:51.039> by<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.370> way<00:04:51.550> so<00:04:52.389> i

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
allowed to break blocks by the way so i

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.590 
allowed to break blocks by the way so i
basically<00:04:52.630> need<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.260> work<00:04:53.440> out<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:55.090> amount<00:04:55.360> of

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
basically need to work out the amount of

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.719 
basically need to work out the amount of
oh<00:04:57.789> nope<00:04:59.340> thought<00:05:00.340> that<00:05:00.490> was<00:05:00.580> going<00:05:00.669> to

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729
