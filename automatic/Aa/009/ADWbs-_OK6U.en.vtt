for<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.250> galaxy<00:00:51.699> note<00:00:51.820> 2<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.270> then<00:00:52.660> also<00:00:52.899> just

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
for the galaxy note 2 and then also just

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.549 
for the galaxy note 2 and then also just
kind<00:00:53.590> of<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.800> cheaper<00:00:54.809> transparent<00:00:55.809> case<00:00:56.079> for

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
kind of a cheaper transparent case for

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.770 
kind of a cheaper transparent case for
the<00:00:56.710> galaxy<00:00:56.860> note<00:00:57.219> 2<00:00:57.399> so<00:00:57.609> I<00:00:58.180> realize<00:00:58.690> the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
the galaxy note 2 so I realize the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.750 
the galaxy note 2 so I realize the
galaxy<00:00:59.109> note<00:00:59.260> 2<00:00:59.379> isn't<00:00:59.829> obviously<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.520> latest

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
galaxy note 2 isn't obviously the latest

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.459 
galaxy note 2 isn't obviously the latest
technology<00:01:01.270> in<00:01:01.420> fact<00:01:01.449> it's<00:01:01.809> almost<00:01:01.960> 2<00:01:02.260> years

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
technology in fact it's almost 2 years

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:03.990 
technology in fact it's almost 2 years
old<00:01:02.649> or<00:01:02.890> been<00:01:03.039> on<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.219> market<00:01:03.520> for<00:01:03.550> two<00:01:03.760> years

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
old or been on the market for two years

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.730 
old or been on the market for two years
but<00:01:04.690> it's<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.930> phone<00:01:05.080> that<00:01:05.259> I<00:01:05.289> have<00:01:05.500> right<00:01:05.649> now

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
but it's the phone that I have right now

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.160 
but it's the phone that I have right now
so<00:01:06.420> most<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.479> these<00:01:07.570> products<00:01:07.990> are

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
so most of these products are

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.749 
so most of these products are
specifically<00:01:08.770> tailored<00:01:09.009> for<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.460> specific

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
specifically tailored for a specific

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.700 
specifically tailored for a specific
device<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.600> feature<00:01:10.869> on<00:01:11.050> my<00:01:11.140> channel<00:01:11.530> are

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
device that I feature on my channel are

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.919 
device that I feature on my channel are
also<00:01:12.250> available<00:01:12.610> for<00:01:13.030> other<00:01:13.240> mobile<00:01:13.660> devices

also available for other mobile devices

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.830

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
it a step further of course there is no

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
optical zoom on the camera as if you do

optical zoom on the camera as if you do
want<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.930> zoom<00:02:50.109> it's<00:02:50.319> just<00:02:50.470> digital<00:02:50.859> zoom<00:02:51.099> and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370

want to zoom it's just digital zoom and
even<00:02:52.299> though<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.569> is<00:02:52.599> 8<00:02:53.109> megapixels<00:02:53.829> which<00:02:54.069> is

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
even though it is 8 megapixels which is

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.160 
even though it is 8 megapixels which is
decent<00:02:54.489> obviously<00:02:54.879> not<00:02:55.359> the<00:02:55.480> best<00:02:55.510> nowadays

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
decent obviously not the best nowadays

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.559 
decent obviously not the best nowadays
we<00:02:56.379> have<00:02:56.470> phones<00:02:56.709> with<00:02:56.920> much<00:02:57.129> higher

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
we have phones with much higher

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.479 
we have phones with much higher
megapixel<00:02:58.569> count<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.220> know<00:03:00.310> it's

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
megapixel count but it you know it's

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.940 
megapixel count but it you know it's
just<00:03:00.609> not<00:03:01.049> comparable<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.349> what<00:03:02.500> you'd<00:03:02.650> find

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
just not comparable to what you'd find

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.509 
just not comparable to what you'd find
on<00:03:03.459> an<00:03:03.819> optical<00:03:04.540> zoom<00:03:04.569> lens<00:03:05.040> now<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.220> course

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
on an optical zoom lens now of course

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.430 
on an optical zoom lens now of course
obviously<00:03:07.239> it's<00:03:07.450> not<00:03:07.569> gonna<00:03:07.690> be<00:03:07.900> nearly<00:03:08.139> as

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
obviously it's not gonna be nearly as

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.610 
obviously it's not gonna be nearly as
good<00:03:08.680> as<00:03:09.389> yost<00:03:10.389> lens<00:03:10.750> or<00:03:10.989> something<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.470> put

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
good as yost lens or something you put

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.149 
good as yost lens or something you put
on<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.769> canon<00:03:12.250> camera<00:03:12.670> or<00:03:12.940> any<00:03:13.239> other<00:03:13.450> DSLR<00:03:14.170> but

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
on a canon camera or any other DSLR but

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.940 
on a canon camera or any other DSLR but
considering<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> size<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.500> portability

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
considering the size and the portability

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.059 
considering the size and the portability
aspect<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:19.720> will<00:03:19.959> be<00:03:20.109> probably<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:20.889> nice

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
aspect this will be probably a nice

then<00:03:42.760> along<00:03:43.000> with<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:43.449> is<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.959> lens<00:03:44.169> itself

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
then along with that is the lens itself

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.089 
then along with that is the lens itself
the<00:03:45.010> 12<00:03:45.280> time<00:03:45.459> optical<00:03:45.910> zoom<00:03:46.060> lens<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.590> as<00:03:47.949> you

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
the 12 time optical zoom lens so as you

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.189 
the 12 time optical zoom lens so as you
can<00:03:48.160> see<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.459> nice<00:03:48.609> metal<00:03:49.359> material<00:03:49.900> here

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
can see it's a nice metal material here

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.830 
can see it's a nice metal material here
then<00:03:51.129> we<00:03:51.340> have<00:03:51.489> another<00:03:51.639> bracket<00:03:52.090> I'm<00:03:52.510> not

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
then we have another bracket I'm not

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.360 
then we have another bracket I'm not
sure<00:03:53.139> what<00:03:53.290> all<00:03:53.379> these<00:03:53.560> do<00:03:53.829> but<00:03:54.129> I'm<00:03:54.250> gonna

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
sure what all these do but I'm gonna

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.399 
sure what all these do but I'm gonna
eventually<00:03:54.790> assemble<00:03:55.419> this<00:03:55.540> for<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.139> review

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
eventually assemble this for the review

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.680 
eventually assemble this for the review
of<00:03:56.530> course<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.069> then<00:03:57.819> there<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> tripod

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
of course and then there is a tripod

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.140 
of course and then there is a tripod
type<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.079> thing<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.470> actually<00:04:00.280> supports<00:04:00.849> the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
type of thing that actually supports the

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.530 
type of thing that actually supports the
lens<00:04:01.389> because<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:02.049> lens<00:04:02.229> is<00:04:02.470> quite<00:04:02.829> heavy<00:04:03.220> and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
lens because the lens is quite heavy and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.699 
lens because the lens is quite heavy and
definitely<00:04:04.540> way<00:04:04.690> heavier<00:04:05.079> than<00:04:05.319> anything

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
definitely way heavier than anything

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.219 
definitely way heavier than anything
that<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:07.000> could<00:04:07.180> just<00:04:07.299> support<00:04:07.750> with<00:04:08.079> the

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
that you could just support with the

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.559 
that you could just support with the
camera<00:04:08.560> itself<00:04:08.799> by<00:04:09.069> itself<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.639> then<00:04:10.299> here's

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
camera itself by itself and then here's

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.449 
camera itself by itself and then here's
a<00:04:10.659> little<00:04:10.810> booklet<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:11.799> kind<00:04:12.159> of<00:04:12.220> shows<00:04:12.430> a

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
a little booklet that kind of shows a

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.449 
a little booklet that kind of shows a
diagram<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.329> how<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.780> actual<00:04:14.290> unit<00:04:14.650> sets<00:04:15.220> up

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
diagram of how the actual unit sets up

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.580 
diagram of how the actual unit sets up
and<00:04:15.729> connects<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.090> your<00:04:16.209> device<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.900> then
