whatever size of bait you have will work

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.670 
whatever size of bait you have will work
for<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.630> then<00:00:35.780> on<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.080> lot<00:00:36.290> of<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.470> baits

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
for you and then on a lot of the baits

for you and then on a lot of the baits
they<00:00:36.890> have<00:00:37.070> a<00:00:37.100> lateral<00:00:37.430> line<00:00:37.760> kind<00:00:38.330> of<00:00:38.480> running

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
they have a lateral line kind of running

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.570 
they have a lateral line kind of running
through<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:38.990> middle<00:00:39.110> of<00:00:39.350> them<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:39.620> just<00:00:40.370> kind

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
through the middle of them and just kind

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.790 
through the middle of them and just kind
of<00:00:40.760> reference<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:41.960> up<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.380> down<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.770> know

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
of reference for up and down you know

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.530 
of reference for up and down you know
wherever<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:43.370> want<00:00:43.580> your<00:00:43.730> bait<00:00:43.910> if<00:00:44.120> or<00:00:44.510> the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
wherever you want your bait if or the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.950 
wherever you want your bait if or the
kill<00:00:45.140> dot<00:00:45.350> on<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.680> bait<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:46.780> sometimes<00:00:47.780> that

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
kill dot on the bait is sometimes that

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.360 
kill dot on the bait is sometimes that
lateral<00:00:48.230> line<00:00:48.470> will<00:00:48.620> make<00:00:48.710> a<00:00:48.770> good<00:00:49.010> reference

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
lateral line will make a good reference

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.240 
lateral line will make a good reference
so<00:00:49.690> just<00:00:50.690> put<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.530> tape<00:00:51.770> on<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.160> then

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
so just put the the tape on and then

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.920 
so just put the the tape on and then
we'll<00:00:52.400> spray<00:00:52.700> that<00:00:52.910> well<00:00:53.150> get<00:00:53.630> one<00:00:53.750> on<00:00:53.840> the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
we'll spray that well get one on the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.380 
we'll spray that well get one on the
other<00:00:54.020> side<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.410> then<00:00:54.500> we'll<00:00:54.590> spray<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:55.390> okay

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
other side and then we'll spray it okay

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.110 
other side and then we'll spray it okay
so<00:00:56.480> I<00:00:56.690> got<00:00:56.900> both<00:00:57.170> sides<00:00:57.410> done<00:00:58.370> here<00:00:58.670> now<00:00:58.820> and

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
so I got both sides done here now and

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.990 
so I got both sides done here now and
it's<00:01:00.050> nice<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.980> nice<00:01:01.190> thing<00:01:01.400> about<00:01:01.460> using<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's nice the nice thing about using the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.420 
it's nice the nice thing about using the
tape<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.870> that<00:01:02.899> if<00:01:03.230> you<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.890> know<00:01:04.009> you<00:01:04.040> kind<00:01:04.369> of

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
tape is that if you you know you kind of

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.580 
tape is that if you you know you kind of
want<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.729> make<00:01:05.509> sure<00:01:05.570> it's<00:01:05.899> centered<00:01:06.110> on<00:01:06.380> both

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
want to make sure it's centered on both

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.190 
want to make sure it's centered on both
sides<00:01:06.890> on<00:01:07.549> both<00:01:07.939> directions<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:08.720> in<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.020> way

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
sides on both directions so in that way

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.350 
sides on both directions so in that way
if<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:10.159> can<00:01:10.310> put<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.610> tape<00:01:10.790> on<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.270> then

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
if you you can put the tape on and then

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.000 
if you you can put the tape on and then
kind<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.750> look<00:01:11.870> and<00:01:11.990> see<00:01:12.080> oh<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:12.380> got<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.770> move<00:01:12.890> it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
kind of look and see oh I got to move it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.600 
kind of look and see oh I got to move it
this<00:01:13.159> way<00:01:13.430> or<00:01:13.580> that<00:01:13.729> way<00:01:13.790> type<00:01:14.659> of<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.900> deal<00:01:15.080> but

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
this way or that way type of a deal but

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.710 
this way or that way type of a deal but
that's<00:01:16.610> that's<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.090> reason<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:17.420> like<00:01:17.570> using

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
that's that's the reason I like using

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.950 
that's that's the reason I like using
the<00:01:17.900> tape<00:01:18.110> but<00:01:18.790> so<00:01:19.790> then<00:01:20.060> basically<00:01:20.510> we'll

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
the tape but so then basically we'll

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.280 
the tape but so then basically we'll
just<00:01:21.170> go<00:01:21.320> in<00:01:21.850> for<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.940> kill<00:01:23.180> dot<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:23.780> we'll<00:01:24.110> go

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
just go in for the kill dot so we'll go

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:35.840 
just go in for the kill dot so we'll go
in<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.620> just<00:01:29.140> on<00:01:30.140> both<00:01:30.350> sides

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.580 

and<00:01:36.850> there<00:01:37.149> we<00:01:37.299> go<00:01:37.600> we'll<00:01:37.899> pull<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.170> tape<00:01:38.380> off

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
and there we go we'll pull the tape off

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.669 
and there we go we'll pull the tape off
and<00:01:38.859> we'll<00:01:38.950> be<00:01:39.069> left<00:01:39.249> with<00:01:40.530> there's<00:01:41.530> one<00:01:42.039> side

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
and we'll be left with there's one side

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.590 
and we'll be left with there's one side
and<00:01:44.679> there's<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.399> other<00:01:45.429> just<00:01:46.090> ready<00:01:46.359> for<00:01:46.420> a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
and there's the other just ready for a

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.980 
and there's the other just ready for a
clear<00:01:46.840> coat<00:01:47.109> now<00:01:47.319> and<00:01:48.509> that's<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.689> easy<00:01:49.810> way

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
clear coat now and that's the easy way

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.630 
clear coat now and that's the easy way
to<00:01:50.049> do<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.409> and<00:01:50.530> like<00:01:50.799> I<00:01:50.950> said<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.310> can<00:01:51.459> use

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
to do it and like I said you can use

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.029 
to do it and like I said you can use
different<00:01:51.850> size<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.509> punches<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.259> get<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
different size of punches to get the

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.550 
different size of punches to get the
desired<00:01:54.399> hole<00:01:54.969> size<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:55.479> want<00:01:55.689> but<00:01:56.020> kill

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
desired hole size you want but kill

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.319
