00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 or the waters and compass and welcome to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.569
 another new video as they saw it in the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.450
 title new details of the dlc of 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.070
 Christmas in big cars 511 then 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.300
 let's start with today's video that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.250
 I've wanted for a while 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.080
 talk a little more about all this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.750
 that has been demarcated and has been discovered 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.880
 in the game good recently the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.100
 user already known from the video of 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.750
 yesterday neither the former mods had neglect everything 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.340
 some codes which gave the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.359
 possibility to be included 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.219
 some things of the day Tuesday 23 of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.920
 December for all of this what is going to 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.420
 be Christmas but aitor inside everything 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.100
 this have been discovered some new 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.989
 little things but in the same way I will be 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.399
 leaving in the description the link to 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.530
 that you can read it for your 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.379
 own eyes ok here I just simply 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.050
 I will teach the things I most 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.700
 they liked me or liked me more and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.440
 things that seemed most important to me 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.210
 speak to them since yesterday they 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 I had made an appointment and I'm waiting for the day of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.949
 today I have seen that there are even more details ok 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.739
 the first thing that is going to be apartment 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.449
 Christmas will be a new apartment 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.640
 high- end in the game that will be 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.360
 permanent but from 25 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.090
 December 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.160
 until 7 January there will be support for 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.620
 limited time in the apartment tree 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.050
 of life with wine and lights decorating and 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.850
 some similar present textures 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.160
 under the tree that could be like 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.380
 gifts or some little thing so do not imagine 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.210
 you that you give away to seal good if 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.770
 it is of such a point that they have come down from the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.170
 tree come an ace that is me some gifts 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 that are shaped like this rex is 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.650
 other video games and that like you 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.040
 they are giving away but the truth would remain 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.979
 quite well not apart from this the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 illuminated tree you want to implement what 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.570
 that is making a fireplace with the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.570
 stockings put to the front this is not believed 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.180
 that rockstar added it and design and I think 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.979
 last minute since they did not have it 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.509
 planned to hoist and there are several 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.850
 decorations with festive themes 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.500
 distributed throughout the interior there is no 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.170
 confirmed price for this apartment 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.030
 about this moment but already if there is 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.540
 a little bit of time the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.729
 price what do I know 800 thousand dollars 500 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.640
 thousand 400 thousand trial the day is followed 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.840
 saying no for Christmas clothes this and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.400
 only had talked 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.349
 but anyway I turn them to 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.480
 repeat this will be all the elements 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.760
 that we saw last year in the last 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.860
 generation but this time is not four 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.500
 new articles these are still in 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.440
 very identifiable format but the day 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.190
 that you have the dlc because you know what 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.860
 is all this does not lights of life this is 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.590
 something that I had not seen you 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.720
 they knew that in the east of the past does a 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.209
 year of Christmas in big point 5 of 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.090
 Playstation3 and Xbox 360 had been added 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.280
 the cloud I say snow but this is something 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.170
 totally different christmas lights 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.510
 since the source code has been 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.660
 found fragments of references to 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.180
 the street like the christmas lights has 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.250
 been able to find or textures 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.069
 of these lights so it can be 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.650
 withdrawal at the last moment but it 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.569
 found the following files not 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.519
 some codes were found which 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:15.299
 it tells us x + srt central x + srt 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.829
 downtown and x + srt county not this me 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.569
 I think it can mean like from 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.120
 central where we find 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.890
 our 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.720
 apartments and where are all 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.549
 the houses that the whole street is 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.560
 illuminated with little and that the houses 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.049
 are a bit decorated with either 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.330
 minimal light textures or little things 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.790
 otherwise, downtown would be like 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.110
 center what we know as the center 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.480
 of the saints that you know that in 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.370
 the center of the dens we find what 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.870
 that is doing the same although all 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.030
 these things may the buildings 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.400
 they are a bit decorated and even they 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.290
 add some more details and county 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.810
 It refers mostly to county blend 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.790
 not the part as desert of what is 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.349
 the city of saints that is the part 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.420
 from above maybe here I will see 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.000
 some little things but what is not 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.920
 I understood very well is the part of apt I think 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.930
 which means apartments and I'm not 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.940
 wrong but there can be many 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.440
 things more anyway these codes 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.750
 I think it's pretty good because 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.959
 as they see it if we summarize what is going 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.780
 making the code x s rtr serial 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.329
 it would mean like christmas street 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.850
 central christmas street downtown 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.489
 christmas street country and gray more 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.289
 street apt whatever apartment 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.490
 then you tell me what you think of this 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.600
 I would like to see the city 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.780
 decorated more what 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.730
 USA from the headquarters of the countries that 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.770
 more celebrate things by telling 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.330
 some way uses more decora in the houses 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.720
 and more everything and this the truth that I would give 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.280
 a better touch of reality to the game not 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.410
 Modifications of Christmas vehicles 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.740
 if as well as you hear it modifications 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.360
 in the Christmas vehicles we have 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.090
 found an audio regarding the 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.100
 Christmas horns of the season and 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.350
 hallway cover this I do not know 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.080
 how that would mean but each horn 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.510
 it will last like 7 seconds not then here 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.350
 as they see it, maybe they will include us 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.910
 some klaxons like what do I know as 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.560
 these little groups that sing outside the 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.910
 houses that if I'm not wrong I do not 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.860
 agreement how are they called if anyone knows 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.690
 tell me in the comments or such 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.400
 time they include us some horns that 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.650
 we can put them to the most vehicles 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.690
 some Christmas colors or even 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.760
 some modifications apart not that the 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.320
 I really wanted to be pretty good 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.270
 but to me what I would most like to do 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.650
 was to include what is going 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.990
 doing 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.590
 the claxons that we have the action 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.169
 as from you you you you you you you you you you you 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.270
 and things like that would not be too much 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.030
 effective and would give a very good touch to 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.430
 game not good we went with the next 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.070
 weapons a new weapon that is believed to 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.900
 is related to the rocket launcher of 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.669
 fireworks game 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.970
 the name is currently found with 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.970
 a tag called hacks but it does not 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.460
 believe that textures can mean 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.340
 indicate that it is an action game 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.130
 related to the ball ball who who 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.780
 you know what this means but if you tried 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.180
 analyze the largest amount that is 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.490
 possible but a lot of this was missing and still 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.560
 is not prepared can not grow that 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.139
 they are still saying it but it can be 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.000
 simply that they will include us 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.620
 fireworks some little things more 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.849
 that the truth would be pretty good, 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.979
 take into account that today we have 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.470
 the rocket launcher but we can not buy 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.880
 the ammunition so for being Christmas and 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.949
 there are quite a lot of rockets because the truth 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.780
 it would be something that would look pretty good and 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.110
 the last and the last point that I want 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.370
 attack is the bonus points 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.680
 you will receive points 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.870
 location for visiting big car 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.669
 online on Christmas day but I do not know 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.860
 has information about the content not 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.150
 I know if they are going to give double x but 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.650
 any of these things that is the most 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.650
 possible not because as you will know 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.139
 whenever there is an event of lights like 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.000
 be the hurt standing i'm not a 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.490
 esther rock day and all these things 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.560
 they always add something double 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.389
 reputation or any of those things from 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.919
 all forms was a simple video that 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.660
 I wanted to make them to be a 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.220
 little informed but remember that 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.080
 this is filtered information and you may 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.020
 any of the things that have been said 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.060
 may not come, there's no rockstar 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.620
 you can remove something from the last moment but 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.000
 the truth I hope you liked this 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.430
 video you tell me what do you think of everything 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.370
 this do not forget to leave your like and without more 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.370
 I say goodbye goodbye
