00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
in the new one is actually gonna cost

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.660 
in the new one is actually gonna cost
you<00:02:15.989> just<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.769> case<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.129> want<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.400> take<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
stats off them that is a bit of a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.229 
stats off them that is a bit of a
letdown<00:02:22.700> say<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.870> doesn't<00:02:25.410> look<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:26.239> needs

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
letdown say it doesn't look like needs

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.920 
letdown say it doesn't look like needs
anything<00:02:27.870> other<00:02:28.470> than<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:29.180> there<00:02:30.180> was<00:02:30.360> one

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
anything other than that there was one

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.660 
anything other than that there was one
wanted<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.530> try<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:33.890> can't<00:02:34.890> remember<00:02:35.099> what<00:02:35.430> her

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
wanted to try I can't remember what her

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.820 
wanted to try I can't remember what her
arc<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:36.299> was<00:02:39.049> let's<00:02:40.049> see<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.319> lets<00:02:40.500> wear

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
arc in one was let's see it lets wear

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.960 
arc in one was let's see it lets wear
that<00:02:41.040> one<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.370> an<00:02:41.610> example<00:02:46.610> yep<00:02:47.640> and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
that one this is an example yep and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.170 
that one this is an example yep and
there<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.660> literally<00:02:49.260> takes<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
there it is it literally takes just the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.650 
there it is it literally takes just the
helmet<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.160> instant<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.150> costs

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
helmet and it is instant and costs

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.210 
helmet and it is instant and costs
nothing<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.769> do<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:58.769> literally<00:02:59.099> a

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
nothing to do this so it's literally a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.160 
nothing to do this so it's literally a
thousand<00:02:59.849> credits<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.360> buy<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.540> blueprint

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
thousand credits to buy the blueprint

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.140 
thousand credits to buy the blueprint
and<00:03:01.349> you<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.069> take<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.400> abilities<00:03:02.970> off

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and you can now take the abilities off

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.490 
and you can now take the abilities off
helmets<00:03:04.400> as<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.459> damn<00:03:06.390> shame<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.319> be<00:03:07.410> honest<00:03:07.680> I

everybody is going to be curious about
the<00:03:47.400> same<00:03:47.609> thing<00:03:48.440> we<00:03:49.440> get<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.739> see<00:03:49.919> how<00:03:50.069> much

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
the same thing we get to see how much

the same thing we get to see how much
these<00:03:50.430> people<00:03:50.609> have<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.430> course<00:03:53.700> there<00:03:54.450> is

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
these people have and of course there is

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.420 
these people have and of course there is
the<00:03:54.810> biggie

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
the biggie

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.750 
the biggie
training<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.669> the<00:03:57.450> helmets<00:03:57.840> now<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:59.190> problem

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
training of the helmets now the problem

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.420 
training of the helmets now the problem
here<00:03:59.790> isn't<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.260> fact<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.799> can<00:04:01.980> now<00:04:02.130> trade

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
here isn't the fact you can now trade

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.059 
here isn't the fact you can now trade
helmets<00:04:02.880> it's<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.630> fact<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:04.200> only<00:04:04.470> trade

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
helmets it's the fact you can only trade

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.080 
helmets it's the fact you can only trade
built<00:04:05.760> ones<00:04:07.010> say<00:04:08.010> these<00:04:08.280> are<00:04:08.459> built<00:04:08.669> ones<00:04:08.910> and

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
built ones say these are built ones and

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.520 
built ones say these are built ones and
obviously<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.660> would<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:09.900> only<00:04:09.989> built<00:04:10.440> one

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
obviously you would have only built one

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.210 
obviously you would have only built one
of<00:04:10.859> each<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:13.169> course<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.620> can't<00:04:13.829> build

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
of each and of course you can't build

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.640 
of each and of course you can't build
them<00:04:14.400> now<00:04:14.639> because<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.239> don't<00:04:15.480> pop<00:04:15.780> up<00:04:15.959> in<00:04:16.200> the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
them now because the don't pop up in the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.459 
them now because the don't pop up in the
foundry<00:04:18.799> so<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.729> foundry<00:04:21.539> on<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
foundry so this is the foundry on the

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:23.879 
foundry so this is the foundry on the
skins

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
skins

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.679 
skins
actually<00:04:24.219> appearance<00:04:24.789> but<00:04:24.999> this<00:04:25.419> is<00:04:25.539> where

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:25.689 
actually appearance but this is where

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:27.089 
actually appearance but this is where
they<00:04:25.780> used<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:26.020> pop<00:04:26.169> up<00:04:26.319> and<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:26.800> not<00:04:26.949> there

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
they used to pop up and it's not there

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.959 
they used to pop up and it's not there
anymore<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:29.710> even<00:04:30.129> though<00:04:30.249> the<00:04:30.430> blueprints

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
anymore so even though the blueprints

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.850 
anymore so even though the blueprints
are<00:04:31.150> still<00:04:31.389> there<00:04:31.629> they've<00:04:32.319> given<00:04:32.650> us<00:04:32.830> the

are still there they've given us the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.730 
are still there they've given us the
chance<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.400> be<00:04:34.210> able<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:35.020> take<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.289> abilities
