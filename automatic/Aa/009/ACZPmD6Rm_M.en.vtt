flange<00:02:30.099> like<00:02:31.099> so<00:02:34.209> notice<00:02:35.209> because<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:36.680> built

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
flange like so notice because it's built

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.580 
flange like so notice because it's built
bigger<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:38.120> end<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.599> smaller<00:02:39.049> on<00:02:39.349> this

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
bigger on this end and smaller on this

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.190 
bigger on this end and smaller on this
end<00:02:39.860> they're<00:02:40.790> going<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.120> wing<00:02:41.360> smaller<00:02:41.750> then

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
end they're going this wing smaller then

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.350 
end they're going this wing smaller then
you<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:43.010> go<00:02:43.129> in<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.610> out<00:02:46.780> any<00:02:47.780> other<00:02:48.049> built
