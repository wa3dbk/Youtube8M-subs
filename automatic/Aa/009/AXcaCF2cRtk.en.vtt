00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
at it and it's distracting at the same

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.990 
at it and it's distracting at the same
time<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:16.560> am<00:01:16.799> curious<00:01:17.490> on

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
time so I'm really really am curious on

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
time so I'm really really am curious on
how<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> strategies<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> can

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
how you what kind of strategies you can

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.429 
how you what kind of strategies you can
really<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.299> am<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.930> maybe<00:01:22.110> see

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
really use for this am I can maybe see

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.480 
really use for this am I can maybe see
being<00:01:22.770> used<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.490> instead<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:25.100> heavy<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
being used and instead of our heavy a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.179 
being used and instead of our heavy a
heavy<00:01:27.479> warrior<00:01:28.020> tackling<00:01:28.470> some<00:01:28.680> people<00:01:28.920> use

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
heavy warrior tackling some people use

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.749 
heavy warrior tackling some people use
i'm<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.479> warrior<00:01:30.869> rush<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
i'm in a warrior rush they would get the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.140 
i'm in a warrior rush they would get the
Warriors<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.880> heavies<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
Warriors up and you use the heavies to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
Warriors up and you use the heavies to
distract<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> last<00:01:36.990> second<00:01:37.560> okay<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> can

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
distract the last second okay so it can

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.880 
distract the last second okay so it can
be<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:38.700> good<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> strategy<00:01:40.500> fuse

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
be very good with the strategy fuse

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.710 
be very good with the strategy fuse
critters<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.790> i'm<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.030> sure<00:01:42.240> what

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
critters but i'm not really sure what

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.149 
critters but i'm not really sure what
the<00:01:42.810> radius<00:01:43.170> there<00:01:43.350> might<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.590> separate<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the radius there might be a separate you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.490 
the radius there might be a separate you
can<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.509> build<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.869> door<00:01:46.140> thing<00:01:46.380> you'll

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
can you will build a door thing you'll

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
can you will build a door thing you'll
be<00:01:46.530> allowed<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.920> put<00:01:46.950> craters<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.820> top<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
be allowed to put craters on top of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
be allowed to put craters on top of
buildings<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.950> might<00:01:50.189> encourage<00:01:50.670> people

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
buildings so this might encourage people

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
buildings so this might encourage people
to<00:01:51.210> make<00:01:51.509> sort<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.939> bases<00:01:53.939> where

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to make sort of more like bases where

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480 
to make sort of more like bases where
they're<00:01:54.570> more<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.960> closer<00:01:55.320> together<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.340> in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
they're more like closer together so in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
they're more like closer together so in
encourages<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.450> makes<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.719> very<00:01:57.840> harder<00:01:58.170> for

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
encourages it makes a very harder for

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.889 
encourages it makes a very harder for
