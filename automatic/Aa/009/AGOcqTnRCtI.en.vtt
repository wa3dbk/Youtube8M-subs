00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500

tubing<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.010> just<00:03:57.190> had<00:03:57.340> this<00:03:57.610> tubing<00:03:58.150> attached

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
tubing I just had this tubing attached

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.900 
tubing I just had this tubing attached
to<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.470> throttle<00:03:59.650> body<00:03:59.950> by<00:04:00.250> itself<00:04:00.610> with<00:04:00.880> a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
to the throttle body by itself with a

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.320 
to the throttle body by itself with a
hose<00:04:01.660> clamp<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.950> kept<00:04:03.700> having<00:04:03.820> problems

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
hose clamp and I kept having problems

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.460 
hose clamp and I kept having problems
with<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.600> popping<00:04:05.200> off<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:06.930> my<00:04:07.930> map<00:04:08.140> sensor

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
with it popping off and my map sensor

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.710 
with it popping off and my map sensor
has<00:04:08.710> gone<00:04:08.890> bad<00:04:09.190> and<00:04:09.460> I<00:04:10.000> believe<00:04:10.300> that's<00:04:10.510> what

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
has gone bad and I believe that's what

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.310 
has gone bad and I believe that's what
did<00:04:10.960> it

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
did it

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.260 
did it
you<00:04:12.310> know<00:04:12.430> sucking<00:04:12.760> in<00:04:13.030> dirty<00:04:13.390> air<00:04:13.420> something

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
you know sucking in dirty air something

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.660 
you know sucking in dirty air something
but<00:04:16.270> I<00:04:16.299> have<00:04:16.450> since<00:04:16.660> gone<00:04:16.870> from<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.520> you<00:04:18.520> know<00:04:18.580> a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
but I have since gone from a you know a

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.230 
but I have since gone from a you know a
three<00:04:19.180> by<00:04:19.540> four<00:04:19.600> inch<00:04:20.200> rubber<00:04:20.799> furnco<00:04:21.790> coupler

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
three by four inch rubber furnco coupler

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.350 
three by four inch rubber furnco coupler
and<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:24.370> know<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:24.640> still<00:04:24.850> just<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.150> fender

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
and you know it's still just a fender

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.390 
and you know it's still just a fender
well<00:04:25.600> intake<00:04:25.990> but<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.650> definitely<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.250> not

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
well intake but it definitely is not

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.770 
well intake but it definitely is not
going<00:04:27.670> anywhere<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.060> it's<00:04:28.240> staying<00:04:28.480> on<00:04:28.600> there

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
going anywhere and it's staying on there

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.750 
going anywhere and it's staying on there
much<00:04:28.960> better<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:30.010> actually<00:04:30.250> think<00:04:30.580> it

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
much better and I actually think it

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.400 
much better and I actually think it
sounds<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.210> little<00:04:31.300> better<00:04:31.540> the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
sounds a little better the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.410 
sounds a little better the
characteristics<00:04:33.130> in<00:04:33.280> here<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.940> know<00:04:34.090> are

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
characteristics in here you know are

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.780 
characteristics in here you know are
they<00:04:35.230> flow<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.620> little<00:04:35.800> better<00:04:36.070> there's<00:04:36.400> not<00:04:36.580> so

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
they flow a little better there's not so

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.750 
they flow a little better there's not so
abrupt<00:04:37.270> on<00:04:37.480> this<00:04:37.690> throttle<00:04:38.320> body<00:04:38.620> lip<00:04:41.760> but

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
abrupt on this throttle body lip but

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.310 
abrupt on this throttle body lip but
yeah<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:42.910> like<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:44.130> had<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.160> heads<00:04:45.490> rebuilt<00:04:46.320> for

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
yeah I like it had the heads rebuilt for

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.560 
yeah I like it had the heads rebuilt for
when<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.500> did<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.830> swap<00:04:49.860> new<00:04:50.860> seals<00:04:51.220> new<00:04:51.610> valves

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
when I did the swap new seals new valves

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.730 
when I did the swap new seals new valves
I<00:04:52.750> had<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.230> decked<00:04:53.590> cleaned<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:55.750> did<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.470> had<00:04:56.710> a

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
I had it decked cleaned I did I had a

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.100 
I had it decked cleaned I did I had a
valve<00:04:57.070> job<00:04:57.220> done<00:04:57.730> like<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.270> five<00:04:58.540> angle<00:04:58.930> valve

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110

valve job done like a five angle valve
job<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.710> got<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.610> really<00:05:00.850> good<00:05:01.060> deal<00:05:01.330> on<00:05:01.360> it

Poole<00:05:16.980> is<00:05:17.100> really<00:05:17.340> good<00:05:18.740> but<00:05:19.740> other<00:05:19.890> than<00:05:20.040> that

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
Poole is really good but other than that

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.250 
Poole is really good but other than that
everything<00:05:21.390> is<00:05:21.480> pretty<00:05:21.630> much<00:05:21.750> stayed<00:05:22.140> the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
everything is pretty much stayed the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.730 
everything is pretty much stayed the
same<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:24.540> transmission<00:05:25.200> is<00:05:25.290> still<00:05:25.500> stock<00:05:27.740> it

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
same the transmission is still stock it

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.550 
same the transmission is still stock it
didn't<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.370> didn't<00:05:30.120> act<00:05:30.270> up<00:05:30.480> at<00:05:30.630> all<00:05:30.780> after<00:05:31.260> the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
didn't it didn't act up at all after the

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.160 
didn't it didn't act up at all after the
swap<00:05:31.830> handling<00:05:32.520> just<00:05:32.760> fine<00:05:32.940> no<00:05:33.180> slip<00:05:33.510> you<00:05:34.080> know

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170

I<00:05:34.200> got<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:36.660> x5<00:05:37.170> in<00:05:37.380> it<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:37.740> I<00:05:39.620> liked<00:05:40.620> it

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
I got the the x5 in it and I liked it

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.830 
I got the the x5 in it and I liked it
you<00:05:42.390> know<00:05:42.420> it<00:05:42.600> doesn't<00:05:42.780> match<00:05:43.110> my<00:05:44.330> car<00:05:45.330> as<00:05:45.630> far

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
you know it doesn't match my car as far

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.750 
you know it doesn't match my car as far
as<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.140> gold<00:05:46.500> color<00:05:46.830> goes<00:05:47.130> exactly<00:05:48.980> but<00:05:49.980> who

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
as the gold color goes exactly but who

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.440 
as the gold color goes exactly but who
else<00:05:50.910> has<00:05:51.120> a<00:05:51.150> gold<00:05:51.390> floor<00:05:51.660> I<00:05:53.000> think<00:05:54.000> it's<00:05:54.240> close

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
else has a gold floor I think it's close

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.470 
else has a gold floor I think it's close
enough<00:05:55.430> one<00:05:56.430> thing<00:05:56.610> I<00:05:56.700> am<00:05:56.820> gonna<00:05:56.940> do<00:05:57.180> soon
