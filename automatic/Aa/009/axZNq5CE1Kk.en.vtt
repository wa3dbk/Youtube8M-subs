00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
weightless - pretty simple I'm not sure

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.870 
weightless - pretty simple I'm not sure
you<00:03:57.530> guys<00:03:57.680> hear<00:03:57.920> what<00:03:58.100> you're<00:03:58.550> going<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.700> want

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
to do two ways you can fish it one way

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.910 
to do two ways you can fish it one way
like<00:04:02.870> I've<00:04:02.990> been<00:04:03.140> showing<00:04:03.320> you<00:04:03.410> throw<00:04:03.770> it<00:04:03.860> on

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
like I've been showing you throw it on

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.260 
like I've been showing you throw it on
top<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.280> flop<00:04:04.520> get<00:04:04.790> them<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:04.940> come<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.090> the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
top of the flop get them to come to the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.150 
top of the flop get them to come to the
slots<00:04:05.540> to<00:04:05.660> bite<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.960> but<00:04:06.620> probably<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.130> most

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
slots to bite it but probably the most

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.000 
slots to bite it but probably the most
common<00:04:07.850> with<00:04:08.030> fish<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:08.870> throw<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.320> out<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.650> I

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
common with fish is I throw it out and I

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.470 
common with fish is I throw it out and I
just<00:04:10.250> let<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.460> sit<00:04:10.790> like<00:04:10.970> this<00:04:11.030> I'm<00:04:11.360> just

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
just let it sit like this I'm just

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.990 
just let it sit like this I'm just
letting<00:04:11.750> it<00:04:11.780> sit<00:04:12.100> I'll<00:04:13.100> give<00:04:13.310> my<00:04:13.430> lines<00:04:13.700> couple

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
letting it sit I'll give my lines couple

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.720 
letting it sit I'll give my lines couple
twitches<00:04:14.330> let<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.690> sit<00:04:14.960> just<00:04:15.400> give<00:04:16.400> my<00:04:16.520> line<00:04:16.700> a

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
twitches let it sit just give my line a

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.340 
twitches let it sit just give my line a
couple<00:04:16.910> twitches<00:04:17.359> let<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.660> sit<00:04:17.870> that's<00:04:18.020> pretty

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
couple twitches let it sit that's pretty

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.830 
couple twitches let it sit that's pretty
much<00:04:18.410> all<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.620> do<00:04:18.770> at<00:04:18.859> that<00:04:18.980> base<00:04:19.190> just<00:04:19.840> just

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
much all I do at that base just just

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.210 
much all I do at that base just just
doing<00:04:20.960> that<00:04:21.170> the<00:04:21.530> way<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:21.710> tell<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:21.980> bite

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
doing that the way you tell a bite

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.110 
doing that the way you tell a bite
usually<00:04:22.430> when<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:22.700> pick<00:04:22.820> up<00:04:22.910> your<00:04:23.000> slack

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
usually when you pick up your slack

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.470 
usually when you pick up your slack
you'll<00:04:23.510> feel<00:04:23.810> something<00:04:24.770> on<00:04:25.040> there

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
you'll feel something on there

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.740 
you'll feel something on there
and<00:04:26.480> you<00:04:26.630> set<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.990> hook<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:28.700> got<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.850> fish<00:04:29.060> that

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
and you set the hook you got a fish that

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.960 
and you set the hook you got a fish that
will<00:04:29.810> have<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:29.990> fit<00:04:30.140> on<00:04:30.290> any<00:04:31.190> summer<00:04:31.490> time<00:04:31.700> if<00:04:31.820> I

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
will have a fit on any summer time if I

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.400 
will have a fit on any summer time if I
just<00:04:32.150> said<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.990> know<00:04:33.020> if<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.200> just<00:04:33.320> got

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
just said you know if I just got

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.540 
just said you know if I just got
finished<00:04:33.590> doing<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:33.950> and<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.160> want<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.430> say

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
finished doing that and I want to say

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.800 
finished doing that and I want to say

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
literally right below the surface so I

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.770 
literally right below the surface so I
always<00:05:17.280> try<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.610> fish<00:05:17.880> whether<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:18.660> be<00:05:18.750> a

a lot of answer I look for clues as to
where<00:05:44.040> in<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.190> fish<00:05:44.340> are<00:05:44.490> you<00:05:44.610> see<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:44.850> ripple

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
where in the fish are you see a ripple

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.150 
where in the fish are you see a ripple
you<00:05:45.600> see<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:45.780> little<00:05:46.050> streak<00:05:46.350> long<00:05:46.800> as<00:05:46.950> I'll<00:05:47.040> see

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
ripples over there something moving

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.920 
ripples over there something moving
around<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.370> water<00:05:50.550> those<00:05:50.790> all<00:05:51.000> tell<00:05:51.240> me<00:05:51.390> yeah

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930

there's probably something out of the
one<00:05:53.190> that's<00:05:53.400> what<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.520> look<00:05:53.760> for<00:05:53.970> a<00:05:54.000> lot<00:05:54.210> of

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
one that's what I look for a lot of

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.850 
one that's what I look for a lot of
times<00:05:54.540> when<00:05:54.750> I'm<00:05:54.840> out<00:05:54.960> look<00:05:55.290> out<00:05:55.440> in<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.680> body
