 It is a great invention of Apollo It is about the same soft pedal as the grand piano It is usually left 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.940
 Yes when you step on the pedal 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:39.220
 This movement is, for example, speaking of this atlas piano 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.940
 Step on Hirai's pedal, the whole farmer goes ahead and the energy gets smaller 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.370
 Because 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.340
 It seems that the auto becomes soft, but this time you're going to step on the leftmost pedal with Apollo . 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.110
 Is Please look Yoii 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.200

 Do What Do Do failure whether you try or look 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.970
 You can see this hammer from now on, by stepping on this 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.930
 I always hit here I always hit here 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.729
 The position where you hit will change when you step on this 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.960
 It's always hit, so there's a ditch, so it's always hit where it's not hit 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:32.619
 The sound is soft 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.840
 This is the structure of a grand piano , it is the first invention in the world to realize this with upright 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.130
 The 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:42.649
 It is a brand called Apollo, which is a kind of Toyo piano manufacturer 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.840
 However Well Apollo's but is the array When you say these is when the publicity is not anymore one good 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:50.569
 I do not know or say 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.079
 For example, if Mr. Yamaha is promoting it, it is probably amazing to invent it if it was invented in the world 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.830
 Ne 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:57.630
 I think that it was widespread 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:01.050
 With the scale of the third largest at that time in the Well Japan to ne Well world I'd technology 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.840
 Apollo's you I'd think I it's this great gathering 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.619

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.420
 Equipped with foreign matter of this technology 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:18.569
 Apollo 6 o 9 p Wait for a low priced piano so this is not the case 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:22.650
 It is close to such Well wine red system brown vacated is that this 3 s system this 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.830
 There is a large luxury Kiara 132cm there 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.210
 It's a piano like this 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.880
 But it will have trickle down and scratches on the explanation was longer cover this neighborhood 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:35.890
 It looks like a dm with this 3 s attached, as it will be repairable. 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.150
 So it's a hand with dm 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.220
 It will be the one with the serial number 13 1334 89 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.610

 I'm too crazy, so I 'll leave it this much 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.980
 I thought that I was tuned when I arrived, but I wanted to 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.700
 In terms of whether you can enjoy this live feeling again 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.910
 Apollo's other top technology crystals 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:42.300
