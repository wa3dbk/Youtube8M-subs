00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
though all of the armour bits are soft

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.930 
though all of the armour bits are soft
the<00:02:51.380> Cape<00:02:51.680> leg<00:02:51.920> pieces<00:02:52.160> are<00:02:52.430> made<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.730> very

the Cape leg pieces are made of a very
stiff<00:02:53.390> thin<00:02:53.960> pieces<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.010> plastic<00:03:05.110> now<00:03:06.110> his

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
stiff thin pieces of plastic now his

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.710 
stiff thin pieces of plastic now his
legs<00:03:06.590> are<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.950> little<00:03:07.190> odd<00:03:07.580> what<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.300> mean<00:03:08.540> by

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
legs are a little odd what I mean by

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.930 
legs are a little odd what I mean by
that<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.200> there<00:03:09.620> are<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> bit<00:03:10.100> skinny<00:03:10.730> in

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
that is that there are a bit skinny in

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.350 
that is that there are a bit skinny in
comparison<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.720> his<00:03:11.870> upper<00:03:12.140> body<00:03:13.360> that

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
comparison to his upper body that

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.600 
comparison to his upper body that
combined<00:03:14.959> with<00:03:15.170> those<00:03:15.290> rigid<00:03:15.830> plastic<00:03:16.370> cape

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
combined with those rigid plastic cape

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.210 
combined with those rigid plastic cape
pieces<00:03:17.060> causes<00:03:17.930> him<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.200> be<00:03:18.320> just<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.830> little

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
pieces causes him to be just a little

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.810 
pieces causes him to be just a little
top-heavy<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:21.709> if<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.860> have<00:03:21.950> one<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.190> those<00:03:22.310> DC
