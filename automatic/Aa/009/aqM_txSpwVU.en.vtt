everyone its EJ from I design comm here

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.250 
everyone its EJ from I design comm here
with<00:00:07.680> another<00:00:07.919> super<00:00:08.309> quick<00:00:08.820> tip<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:10.110> this

the specular off don't need that and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.570 
the specular off don't need that and
we'll<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.350> our<00:01:13.470> color<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.070> under

effects and go to our little friend that
is<00:01:21.360> alone<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.320> no<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.340> ever<00:01:23.460> pays<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.850> any

is alone and no one ever pays them any

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.560 
is alone and no one ever pays them any
attention<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.890> spline<00:01:26.310> shader<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
attention is the spline shader and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.450 
attention is the spline shader and
you'll<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.320> apply<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.680> spline<00:01:29.159> shader

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you'll see if I apply this spline shader

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.719 
you'll see if I apply this spline shader
you'll<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.630> an<00:01:30.869> A<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.530> B<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:32.220> our

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you'll see we have an A and a B in our

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.550 
you'll see we have an A and a B in our
little<00:01:33.030> preview<00:01:33.540> window<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.380> can

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
little preview window here we can

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.580 
little preview window here we can
actually<00:01:34.710> change<00:01:35.220> our<00:01:35.840> preview<00:01:36.840> view<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.560> here

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
actually change our preview view up here

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.890 
actually change our preview view up here
and<00:01:38.130> change<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.090> plane<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.750> see

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and change it to a plane you can see

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.499 
and change it to a plane you can see
that<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.259> an<00:01:40.409> A<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> B<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.119> go

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that that's an A and a B and if we go

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.520 
that that's an A and a B and if we go
into<00:01:42.750> our<00:01:42.899> spline<00:01:43.770> shader<00:01:44.070> options<00:01:45.229> we<00:01:46.229> have

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
into our spline shader options we have

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
into our spline shader options we have
this<00:01:47.100> text<00:01:47.520> field<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.689> these<00:01:48.899> other

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
this text field and all these other

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.710 
this text field and all these other
options<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> spline

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
options here so this what the spline

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.920 
options here so this what the spline
shader<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.079> doing<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.829> applies<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.930> allows

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
shader is doing is it applies and allows

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.800 
shader is doing is it applies and allows
you<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.350> choose<00:01:55.979> text<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.790> apply<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you to choose text and apply as a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
you to choose text and apply as a
material<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> change

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
material so if I go in here and change

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.850 
material so if I go in here and change
it<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.390> ABC<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.340> say<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.549> design<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.860> that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it from ABC to say I design and that

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.290 
it from ABC to say I design and that
will<00:02:05.009> update<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:07.489> that<00:02:08.489> text<00:02:08.789> field<00:02:09.000> there

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
will update that that text field there

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.839 
will update that that text field there
so<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.619> I'm<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.489> change

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
so what I'm going to do is just change

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.100 
so what I'm going to do is just change
this<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.180> Center<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.569> we're<00:02:12.690> going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.870> bring

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
this to Center and we're going to bring

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.490 
this to Center and we're going to bring
down<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.560> high

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
down the high

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:27.010 
down the high
here<00:02:19.040> say<00:02:20.040> 60<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:24.600> don't<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.200> outlines<00:02:25.800> I

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
here say 60 and we don't want outlines I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.490 
here say 60 and we don't want outlines I
don't<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:30.240> what<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.350> going

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
don't you can like it but what we going

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.650 
don't you can like it but what we going
to<00:02:31.560> do<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.220> get<00:02:32.370> rid<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.910> line<00:02:33.390> width

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
to do is to get rid of the line width

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.270 
to do is to get rid of the line width
I'm<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.110> going<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.290> bring<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:34.890> all<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.190> way

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
I'm just going to bring that all the way

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.690 
I'm just going to bring that all the way
down<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.850> I'm<00:02:36.450> going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.040> use<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.340> fill

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
down and I'm going to use this fill

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.490 
down and I'm going to use this fill
color<00:02:38.970> option<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.570> what<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.020> does<00:02:40.320> is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
color option and what that does is

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.800 
color option and what that does is
allows<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.950> allows<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:42.740> you<00:02:43.740> define<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
allows you allows you to you define a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.170 
allows you allows you to you define a
fill<00:02:45.810> color<00:02:46.020> with<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.740> fill<00:02:47.040> texture<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:48.120> I'm

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
fill color with this fill texture so I'm

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.699 
fill color with this fill texture so I'm
going<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.450> go<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.720> fill<00:02:48.959> texture<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
going to go to this fill texture and

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.670 
going to go to this fill texture and
just<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.610> color<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:52.140> fills<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.650> with

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
just go to color and that fills it with

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
just go to color and that fills it with
whatever<00:02:53.130> color<00:02:53.670> which<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.390> white<00:02:54.750> by<00:02:55.140> default

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
whatever color which is white by default

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.860 
whatever color which is white by default
in<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:59.550> fill<00:02:59.790> texture<00:03:00.239> field<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.690> whites

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
in that fill texture field so whites

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.130 
in that fill texture field so whites
fine<00:03:03.410> next<00:03:04.410> thing<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.830> can<00:03:04.860> do<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.900> first<00:03:06.900> we

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
fine next thing we can do is first we

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.050 
fine next thing we can do is first we
need<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.410> actually<00:03:07.560> apply<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.070> sucker<00:03:08.459> on<00:03:08.760> to

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
need to actually apply this sucker on to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.620 
need to actually apply this sucker on to
our<00:03:09.980> onto<00:03:10.980> our<00:03:11.100> ribbon<00:03:11.430> here<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.239> let's<00:03:12.420> go

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
our onto our ribbon here so let's go

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.090 
our onto our ribbon here so let's go
ahead<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.959> apply<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.680> material<00:03:15.140> onto<00:03:16.140> here

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
ahead and apply this material onto here

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.270 
ahead and apply this material onto here
and<00:03:17.220> you'll<00:03:18.060> see<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.660> we<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:20.160> all

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
and you'll see that we have it all

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.940 
and you'll see that we have it all
stretched<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.239> all<00:03:21.390> crazy<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:22.769> one

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
stretched out and it's all crazy the one

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.350 
stretched out and it's all crazy the one
thing<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.340> get<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> little<00:03:23.970> bit<00:03:24.180> more

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
thing to get this a little bit more

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.270 
thing to get this a little bit more
centered<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.170> just<00:03:25.380> change<00:03:25.739> all<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.070> these

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
centered is to just change all of these

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.380 
centered is to just change all of these
values<00:03:26.670> here<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:28.440> 50<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.220> that'll<00:03:30.030> kinda<00:03:30.269> you

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
values here to 50 and that'll kinda you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.180 
values here to 50 and that'll kinda you
can<00:03:30.510> see<00:03:30.660> how<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.840> centers<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.680> even<00:03:32.040> on<00:03:32.160> our

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
can see how the centers that even on our

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.490 
can see how the centers that even on our
preview<00:03:32.670> window<00:03:32.989> still<00:03:33.989> doesn't<00:03:34.260> help<00:03:34.320> us

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
preview window still doesn't help us

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.850 
preview window still doesn't help us
very<00:03:34.560> much<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:35.160> our<00:03:35.640> viewport<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:36.620> but<00:03:37.620> one

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
very much in our viewport here but one

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.860 
very much in our viewport here but one
thing<00:03:38.100> we<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.400> do<00:03:38.580> now<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.150> we<00:03:39.269> can<00:03:39.299> close<00:03:39.660> out

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
thing we can do now is we can close out

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.960 
thing we can do now is we can close out
of<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.410> we<00:03:40.980> can<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.310> go<00:03:41.519> ahead<00:03:41.640> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
of this and we can just go ahead and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.660 
of this and we can just go ahead and
start<00:03:42.269> manipulating<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.680> offset<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.280> length

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
start manipulating the offset and length

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.320 
start manipulating the offset and length
values<00:03:45.150> here<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:46.320> get<00:03:46.560> our<00:03:47.060> texture<00:03:48.060> here

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
values here to get our texture here

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.660 
values here to get our texture here
applied<00:03:48.900> correctly<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:51.230> let's<00:03:52.230> use<00:03:52.530> 75<00:03:53.459> for

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
applied correctly so let's use 75 for

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.759 
applied correctly so let's use 75 for
offset<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.830> for<00:03:55.850> offset<00:03:56.850> V<00:03:57.150> will<00:03:57.690> use<00:03:57.959> 225

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
offset you and for offset V will use 225

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.690 
offset you and for offset V will use 225
and<00:04:00.650> let's<00:04:01.650> see<00:04:01.890> for<00:04:02.190> length

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
and let's see for length

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.270 
and let's see for length
let's<00:04:03.180> try<00:04:04.130> 50<00:04:05.690> lengths<00:04:06.690> let's<00:04:07.410> do<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.739> negative

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
let's try 50 lengths let's do a negative

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.000 
let's try 50 lengths let's do a negative
for<00:04:08.910> 70<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.170> actually<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.680> should<00:04:10.739> be<00:04:10.980> a

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
for 70 and actually this should be a

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.490 
for 70 and actually this should be a
negative<00:04:11.310> 50<00:04:11.910> because<00:04:12.269> we<00:04:12.690> need<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.049> flopped

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
negative 50 because we need it flopped

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.670 
negative 50 because we need it flopped
flipped<00:04:14.340> upside<00:04:14.880> down<00:04:14.910> or<00:04:15.870> right<00:04:15.930> side<00:04:16.140> up<00:04:16.500> now

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
flipped upside down or right side up now

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.569 
flipped upside down or right side up now
and<00:04:18.079> we'll<00:04:19.079> change<00:04:19.290> it<00:04:19.470> from<00:04:19.620> side<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.370> just

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
and we'll change it from side to just

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.600 
and we'll change it from side to just
the<00:04:20.820> front<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.690> can<00:04:21.900> see<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.349> that<00:04:22.610> limits

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
the front you can see that that limits

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.290 
the front you can see that that limits
it<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.789> just<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.210> front<00:04:24.539> side<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:25.140> ribbon

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
it to just the front side of this ribbon

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.629 
it to just the front side of this ribbon
and

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
and

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.129 
and
the<00:04:27.789> next<00:04:28.210> thing<00:04:28.360> we<00:04:28.449> need<00:04:28.569> to<00:04:28.629> do<00:04:28.840> is<00:04:28.990> that's

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
the next thing we need to do is that's

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.070 
the next thing we need to do is that's
actually<00:04:29.620> way<00:04:29.860> too<00:04:29.889> big<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:30.610> what<00:04:31.539> we<00:04:31.689> can<00:04:31.870> do

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
actually way too big so what we can do

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.830 
actually way too big so what we can do
is<00:04:32.319> go<00:04:32.530> back<00:04:32.560> into<00:04:33.069> our<00:04:33.280> height<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.879> our<00:04:34.479> spline

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
is go back into our height in our spline

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.869 
is go back into our height in our spline
shader<00:04:35.229> I'm<00:04:35.740> actually<00:04:35.889> bring<00:04:36.310> this<00:04:36.460> up<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:36.699> you

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:36.879 
shader I'm actually bring this up so you

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.249 
shader I'm actually bring this up so you
can<00:04:37.060> see<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.449> and<00:04:38.460> scale<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.639> down<00:04:39.699> even<00:04:40.270> more

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
can see it and scale this down even more

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:49.230 
can see it and scale this down even more
and<00:04:44.310> let's<00:04:45.310> see<00:04:46.319> go<00:04:47.319> in<00:04:47.499> here<00:04:48.210> into<00:04:49.210> our

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
and let's see go in here into our

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.749 
and let's see go in here into our
material<00:04:49.590> turn<00:04:50.590> tiling<00:04:51.099> off<00:04:51.249> we<00:04:51.430> don't<00:04:51.580> want

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
material turn tiling off we don't want

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.850 
material turn tiling off we don't want
it<00:04:51.849> to<00:04:51.939> tile<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.539> then<00:04:53.139> we<00:04:53.289> can<00:04:53.439> just<00:04:53.650> go<00:04:53.830> in

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
it to tile and then we can just go in

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.499 
it to tile and then we can just go in
here<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.490> adjust<00:04:54.819> the<00:04:55.710> offsets<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:58.270> whatever

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
here and adjust the offsets to whatever

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.369 
here and adjust the offsets to whatever
we<00:04:58.990> want<00:04:59.379> to<00:04:59.620> get<00:04:59.860> this<00:05:00.990> centered<00:05:01.990> nice<00:05:02.169> and

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
we want to get this centered nice and

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.510 
we want to get this centered nice and
centered<00:05:02.680> here<00:05:03.240> so<00:05:04.240> let's<00:05:04.419> bring<00:05:04.659> back<00:05:04.900> up<00:05:05.199> our

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
centered here so let's bring back up our

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.129 
centered here so let's bring back up our
material<00:05:06.520> editor<00:05:06.699> here<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:09.779> and<00:05:10.779> again<00:05:10.900> you

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
material editor here and and again you

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.200 
material editor here and and again you
can<00:05:11.289> still<00:05:11.590> change<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:12.039> height<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.550> whatever

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
can still change the height and whatever

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.779 
can still change the height and whatever
you<00:05:14.139> want<00:05:14.349> to<00:05:14.439> do<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.039> spline<00:05:15.400> shader

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
you want to do in the spline shader

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.820 
you want to do in the spline shader
options<00:05:16.330> change<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.500> color<00:05:19.319> what<00:05:20.319> we<00:05:20.439> want<00:05:20.710> to

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
options change the color what we want to

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.320 
options change the color what we want to
do<00:05:21.009> is<00:05:21.250> we<00:05:21.490> don't<00:05:21.610> want<00:05:21.729> this<00:05:22.060> black

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
do is we don't want this black

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.089 
do is we don't want this black
background<00:05:22.659> so<00:05:23.169> what<00:05:23.379> we're<00:05:23.560> going<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.710> do<00:05:23.919> is

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
background so what we're going to do is

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.640 
background so what we're going to do is
just<00:05:24.219> copy<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:25.330> whole<00:05:25.569> spline<00:05:26.020> shader<00:05:26.349> and

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
just copy this whole spline shader and

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.700 
just copy this whole spline shader and
just<00:05:27.129> use<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:27.729> as<00:05:27.909> an<00:05:28.270> alpha<00:05:28.810> to<00:05:29.169> cut<00:05:29.439> out<00:05:29.680> just

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
just use it as an alpha to cut out just

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.079 
just use it as an alpha to cut out just
that<00:05:30.370> text<00:05:30.879> we<00:05:31.750> need<00:05:32.379> to<00:05:32.469> hit<00:05:32.589> paste<00:05:33.330> dope<00:05:34.379> copy

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089 
that text we need to hit paste dope copy

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:40.769 
that text we need to hit paste dope copy
and<00:05:37.089> paste<00:05:37.659> there<00:05:38.349> we<00:05:38.589> go<00:05:38.770> so<00:05:39.370> that<00:05:40.240> cuts<00:05:40.569> a

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
and paste there we go so that cuts a

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.010 
and paste there we go so that cuts a
hole<00:05:40.960> out<00:05:40.990> so<00:05:41.409> if<00:05:41.770> I<00:05:41.889> render<00:05:42.250> this<00:05:42.779> you'll<00:05:43.779> see

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
hole out so if I render this you'll see

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.769 
hole out so if I render this you'll see
that<00:05:44.289> just<00:05:44.589> our<00:05:44.979> text<00:05:45.430> is<00:05:45.580> applied<00:05:46.389> as<00:05:46.750> a

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
that just our text is applied as a

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.999 
that just our text is applied as a
material<00:05:47.439> with<00:05:48.009> itself<00:05:48.370> onto<00:05:48.819> that<00:05:49.330> green

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
material with itself onto that green

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.820 
material with itself onto that green
ribbon<00:05:51.009> object<00:05:51.610> there<00:05:52.229> so<00:05:53.229> you<00:05:53.319> can<00:05:53.469> do<00:05:53.620> it

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
ribbon object there so you can do it

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.939 
ribbon object there so you can do it
just<00:05:54.069> like<00:05:54.129> I<00:05:54.430> did<00:05:54.550> right<00:05:54.939> here<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.889> apply<00:05:56.889> it

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
just like I did right here and apply it

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.209 
just like I did right here and apply it
as<00:05:57.159> a<00:05:57.189> 2d<00:05:57.669> material<00:05:58.439> but<00:05:59.439> they<00:05:59.529> can<00:05:59.710> go<00:05:59.830> so<00:06:00.099> much

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
as a 2d material but they can go so much

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.529 
as a 2d material but they can go so much
further<00:06:00.550> say<00:06:01.509> you<00:06:01.569> want<00:06:02.139> to<00:06:02.319> use<00:06:02.589> it<00:06:02.800> as<00:06:02.979> like<00:06:03.370> a

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
further say you want to use it as like a

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.559 
further say you want to use it as like a
bump<00:06:04.539> to<00:06:05.729> create<00:06:06.729> some<00:06:06.939> kind<00:06:07.089> of<00:06:07.180> embossed

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
bump to create some kind of embossed

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.450 
bump to create some kind of embossed
text<00:06:08.319> on<00:06:08.439> a<00:06:08.500> piece<00:06:08.889> of<00:06:08.919> metal<00:06:09.159> or<00:06:09.430> something

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
text on a piece of metal or something

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.119 
text on a piece of metal or something
like<00:06:09.879> that<00:06:10.089> where<00:06:10.300> you<00:06:10.330> have<00:06:10.750> it<00:06:10.930> pushed<00:06:11.229> the

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
like that where you have it pushed the

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.820 
like that where you have it pushed the
metal<00:06:12.399> pushed<00:06:12.699> out<00:06:12.939> or<00:06:13.180> stamped<00:06:13.750> with<00:06:14.589> some

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
metal pushed out or stamped with some

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.899 
metal pushed out or stamped with some
text<00:06:15.189> so<00:06:15.279> you<00:06:15.370> can<00:06:15.520> actually<00:06:15.669> put<00:06:16.089> use<00:06:16.810> this

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
text so you can actually put use this

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.369 
text so you can actually put use this
spline<00:06:18.909> shader<00:06:19.240> and<00:06:19.479> put<00:06:19.689> it<00:06:19.810> into<00:06:20.110> say<00:06:20.349> the

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:20.379 
spline shader and put it into say the

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.559 
spline shader and put it into say the
bump<00:06:20.740> channel<00:06:20.800> or<00:06:21.370> displacement<00:06:22.029> channel<00:06:22.389> and

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
bump channel or displacement channel and

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.559 
bump channel or displacement channel and
do<00:06:23.439> it<00:06:23.560> that<00:06:23.740> way<00:06:23.919> so<00:06:24.180> using<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.270> spline

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
do it that way so using the spline

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.320 
do it that way so using the spline
shader<00:06:25.870> just<00:06:26.259> brings<00:06:26.589> in<00:06:27.060> allows<00:06:28.060> you<00:06:28.089> to

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
shader just brings in allows you to

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.050 
shader just brings in allows you to
bring<00:06:28.750> in<00:06:28.930> a<00:06:29.050> text<00:06:29.439> text<00:06:30.279> as<00:06:30.399> a<00:06:30.430> material

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
bring in a text text as a material

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.100 
bring in a text text as a material
without<00:06:31.779> having<00:06:32.439> to<00:06:33.300> you<00:06:34.300> know<00:06:34.389> do<00:06:34.960> anything

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
without having to you know do anything

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.259 
without having to you know do anything
in<00:06:35.529> Photoshop<00:06:36.099> save<00:06:36.459> it<00:06:36.610> out<00:06:36.699> and<00:06:37.000> deal<00:06:37.240> with

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:37.269 
in Photoshop save it out and deal with

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:40.050 
in Photoshop save it out and deal with
an<00:06:37.569> extra<00:06:37.899> step<00:06:38.229> you<00:06:38.500> can<00:06:39.129> just<00:06:39.370> use<00:06:39.639> all<00:06:39.879> of

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
an extra step you can just use all of

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.740 
an extra step you can just use all of
your<00:06:40.089> text

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
your text

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.100 
your text
here<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:41.110> you<00:06:41.440> know<00:06:41.500> change<00:06:41.770> your<00:06:43.110> change

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
here and you know change your change

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.460 
here and you know change your change
your<00:06:44.260> font<00:06:44.560> I<00:06:45.450> just<00:06:46.450> got<00:06:46.600> to<00:06:46.690> copy<00:06:46.900> this<00:06:47.260> and

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
your font I just got to copy this and

your font I just got to copy this and
paste<00:06:47.620> it<00:06:47.830> into<00:06:47.950> my<00:06:48.100> alpha<00:06:48.580> so<00:06:49.240> it's<00:06:49.390> very

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
paste it into my alpha so it's very

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.330 
paste it into my alpha so it's very
simple<00:06:50.050> very<00:06:50.260> easy<00:06:50.620> using<00:06:51.340> the<00:06:53.010> very<00:06:54.010> under

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
simple very easy using the very under

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.070 
simple very easy using the very under
use<00:06:54.580> spline<00:06:55.540> shader<00:06:55.930> and<00:06:56.680> get<00:06:56.920> text<00:06:57.630> into<00:06:58.630> or

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
use spline shader and get text into or

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.100 
use spline shader and get text into or
get<00:06:59.860> text<00:07:00.340> and<00:07:00.520> use<00:07:00.760> it<00:07:00.940> as<00:07:01.060> a<00:07:01.090> material<00:07:01.840> and

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
get text and use it as a material and

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.070 
get text and use it as a material and
apply<00:07:02.890> it<00:07:02.950> onto<00:07:03.250> your<00:07:03.520> objects<00:07:04.090> you<00:07:04.810> can<00:07:04.960> also

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
apply it onto your objects you can also

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.920 
apply it onto your objects you can also
use<00:07:05.500> splines<00:07:06.250> to<00:07:06.880> do<00:07:07.000> this<00:07:07.150> as<00:07:07.360> well<00:07:07.510> so<00:07:07.780> it's

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
use splines to do this as well so it's

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.220 
use splines to do this as well so it's
not<00:07:07.990> just<00:07:08.350> limited<00:07:08.530> to<00:07:08.770> text<00:07:09.750> so<00:07:10.750> hopefully

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230 
not just limited to text so hopefully

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.430 
not just limited to text so hopefully
this<00:07:11.440> will<00:07:11.560> get<00:07:11.950> you<00:07:12.070> thinking<00:07:12.490> of<00:07:12.730> how<00:07:13.090> to<00:07:13.440> use

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 
this will get you thinking of how to use

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.200 
this will get you thinking of how to use
the<00:07:14.800> very<00:07:15.490> underused<00:07:16.120> and<00:07:18.000> very<00:07:19.000> useful

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
the very underused and very useful

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.410 
the very underused and very useful
spline<00:07:20.140> shader
