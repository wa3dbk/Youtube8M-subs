00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:10.000
 model hello on video consider 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:12.250
 gps on this model garmin gps max 408 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.990
 I do not recommend immediately to take this 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.700
 device so the price is unreasonable 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.490
 overpriced today 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.550
 there is pretty good 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.810
 alternatives differing more 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.999
 productive system and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.359
 correspondingly wider choice 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.079
 software products for these devices 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.599
 the distinctive minus of this device 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.520
 9 what's here if you buy take 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.289
 this device you can use 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.559
 Only Igor dimensions of the map Egor Minsk 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:41.530
 products are no longer what to throw here 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 it is impossible that is one linear one-sided 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.500
 You can say the device is exactly 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.280
 created to pull you out 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.480
 more money here is relative 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.120
 minus 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.269
 in the second in the second minus what is here 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.460
 This is very technical 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.180
 weak then here 1st processor 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.360
 after hundreds of region of ram 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.060
 128gb 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.370
 that is, the device is created like a current for 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.950
 navigation but more than navigation 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.050
 on it already the future cannot be used 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.840
 My opinion is not behind these device but for 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.500
 monarch functional devices 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.010
 functional device you can 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.390
 present today it is 5 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.090
 let's say operating system devices 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.430
 android systems are n't what i say to 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.350
 traditional game system for android

 what then can be said here by 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.830
 technical parameters if u take

 know supported google play 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.420
 market and, accordingly, he did not create 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.130
 this google program 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.709
 he and accordingly exist under it 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.799
 different programs allow using 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.720
 This device as different things can 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.970
 even create a program for this 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.870
 OSes use it to you only 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.870
 head must be included 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.550
 here 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.739
 highlights concerns with regards to 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.340
 This device but if you think that

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.000
 technological stock with a capacity of 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.820
 computing power and accordingly 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.910
 Take the device for 5 to 6 7 years to
