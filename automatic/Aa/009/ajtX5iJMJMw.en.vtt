00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.000
 Get up, Argent Crusaders! 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.500
 The Hour of Justice has arrived! 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.000
 You can feel it, my son, 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.000
 everything closing around you? 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 The Light of Righteousness was awakened. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 The sins of the past, 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 finally fall on you. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.300
 You will account, 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.900
 for all the atrocities he committed ... 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.470
 the unpronounceable horrors that you have released on this world, 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.400
 and the dark and ancient powers that enslaved. 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.000
 Although my soul was the first to be killed for its evil, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.440
 there are thousands of other prey on this blade, 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 and they are waiting, to leave. 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.000
 Look at your defenses now, my son, 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.650
 for the Champions of Justice who group at their gates. 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.000
 Let them come. Frostmourne is hungry. 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.420
