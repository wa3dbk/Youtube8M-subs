00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.590
 very well and the doctor who is now there 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:19.980
 talk about how many cigarettes you smoke 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:22.920
 coffee really take if you coffee it 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.710
 I take just the least a small cup 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.939

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 breakfast a third, if anything, a friend of mine 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.260
 in the afternoon cigarettes in the four smoke 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.090
 or five maximum six on Sunday 7th 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.629
 I would recommend limiting cigarettes to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.760
 three uniforms like sails of vi do io a al 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.870
 morning after coffee for needs 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.680
 we say personal the other after lunch and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.199
 the third in the evening after dinner I will succeed in 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.649
 certainly you as a child had had the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.590
 measles 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.109

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.910
 my parents and I'll let you know when 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.830
 it will be the moment we will make you know the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.619
 your parents will be an honor and honor 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.659
 will be to give me measurement leadership 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.189
 sorry you don't owe yourself a moment 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 forget to ask the fact that the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.380
 measles because measles in adults 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240
 it can be deadly 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.810
 my parents had marked him in the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.460
 your parents' diary 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.400
 two colossuses enjoy excellent health 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.680
 splash health from the beautiful ei 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.900
 grandparents 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.900
 my grandfather died at the age of 47 so young 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.899
 laugh the balance falls back there 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.750
 a fall at the age of 47 remained on the spot 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.759
 loses balance 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.490
 we should investigate 47 years know nothing 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.040
 my grandmother is there and my grandmother left us at 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.710
 92 years 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.510
 there would be a lot of compensation 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.720
 curious to know if site was 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.180
 boyfriend with other girls boyfriend 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.610
 not really flirting with 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.530
 three four girls but since i 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.810
 immediately realized that their character was not 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.990
 gave her with my truncate every 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.760
 relationship is better where i'm sorry to tell you 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.260
 but this your attitude in 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.330
 comparisons of three or four races is not 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.440
 nothing but the obvious sign of yours 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.390
 volubility I know that massive pieces all 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.860
 young people, if dinner is taken, but 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.760
 once at home and then put the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.650
 head party I would think of 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.650
 deepen another topic 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.650
 yes yes yes you give us back 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.930
 perfectly account you will not come to 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.930
 to say that you have been a saint 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.150
 imagine that with your colleagues 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.150
 you will often be gone to women 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:19.360
 so far nothing bad I would like to ask you 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.360
 if you've ever had any regrets 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.240
 love a sorrow of character 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.450
 hygienic 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:35.390
 I don't really understand I mean if 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:40.960
 these women say bad they were not 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:46.300
 very bad indeed these gays if in Italy 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.300
 demented that how to say women of malfeasance 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.410
 women therefore hair but good 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.970
 deal 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.150
 so if one of these women go away 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.300
 unfortunately infected one of those 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.920
 evils that man is ashamed of 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:06.170
 to confess a reminder really doesn't me 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.010
 I was waiting for a question like that 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.440
 I find it confused we are between men and for 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.740
 come and I'm a doctor 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.090
 be brave talk if you have been 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.090
 struck was certainly not your fault 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.550
 what can I say I was one 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.370
 of the lucky few you are certainly not 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.360
 I never had trouble tomorrow afternoon 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.610
 people 5 laugh study god I will examine you 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.680
