there with the screwdriver but you get
the<00:01:14.580> gist<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:19.549> hmm<00:01:20.689> let's<00:01:21.689> talk<00:01:21.930> about

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the gist of it hmm let's talk about

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.539 
the gist of it hmm let's talk about
something<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.560> looks<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> might<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
something that looks like it might be a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:36.550 
something that looks like it might be a
bit<00:01:23.759> difficult

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.249 

okay<00:01:37.560> there's<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.159> screw<00:01:38.810> look<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.080> its

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
okay there's one screw look at that its

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.870 
okay there's one screw look at that its
exact<00:01:40.590> same<00:01:40.830> screws<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.430> use<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
exact same screws they use on the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.520 
exact same screws they use on the
Corsair<00:01:43.520> not<00:01:44.520> nice<00:01:45.770> now<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.310> park<00:01:47.970> zone<00:01:48.530> BF

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
Corsair not nice now the park zone BF

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.499 
Corsair not nice now the park zone BF
109<00:01:51.440> uses<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.680> 15<00:01:53.130> BL<00:01:53.580> motor<00:01:53.940> which<00:01:54.270> is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
109 uses the 15 BL motor which is

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.969 
109 uses the 15 BL motor which is
equivalent<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.320> 15<00:01:55.830> size<00:01:56.220> nitro<00:01:56.759> engine<00:01:56.909> and

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
equivalent to a 15 size nitro engine and

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.380 
equivalent to a 15 size nitro engine and
what<00:01:58.979> we're<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.430> putting<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.940> here

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
what we're going to be putting on here

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.559 
what we're going to be putting on here
is<00:02:00.740> something<00:02:01.740> closer<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.909> equivalent<00:02:03.450> of

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
is something closer to the equivalent of

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:09.490 
is something closer to the equivalent of
a<00:02:03.690> 25<00:02:04.319> to<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.710> 35<00:02:05.630> sighs<00:02:06.630> nitro<00:02:07.229> engine<00:02:08.179> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
a 25 to a 35 sighs nitro engine the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.390 
a 25 to a 35 sighs nitro engine the
parks<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.679> engine<00:02:11.269> i<00:02:12.269> believe<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.880> 870<00:02:14.880> kv<00:02:16.400> now

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
parks on engine i believe is 870 kv now

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.259 
parks on engine i believe is 870 kv now
some<00:02:17.700> people<00:02:17.730> get<00:02:18.120> confused<00:02:18.360> by<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.730> 870<00:02:20.730> kv

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
some people get confused by that 870 kv

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.110 
some people get confused by that 870 kv
I<00:02:21.660> believe<00:02:23.150> means<00:02:24.769> 870<00:02:25.769> revolutions<00:02:26.489> for<00:02:26.730> per

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
I believe means 870 revolutions for per

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.280 
I believe means 870 revolutions for per
minute<00:02:27.420> or<00:02:27.890> basically<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.130> RPM<00:02:30.290> capabilities

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
minute or basically the RPM capabilities

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.610 
minute or basically the RPM capabilities
of<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.500> motor<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:33.060> motor<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:34.230> we're<00:02:34.500> going

1500 kv motor and our turnigy 36 35 or
35<00:03:10.650> 36<00:03:11.160> rather<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.840> they're<00:03:12.840> pretty<00:03:13.500> close<00:03:13.620> to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
35 36 rather and they're pretty close to

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.180 
35 36 rather and they're pretty close to
being<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.340> same<00:03:14.579> length<00:03:14.880> if<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.329> notice<00:03:16.190> even

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
being the same length if you notice even

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.699 
being the same length if you notice even
when<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.700> bottoms<00:03:18.060> are<00:03:18.239> level<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.140> snouts

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
when the bottoms are level of the snouts

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.400 
when the bottoms are level of the snouts
of<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.100> motor<00:03:20.310> colors<00:03:20.790> are<00:03:21.060> ready<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.079> even

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
of the motor colors are ready but even

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.220 
of the motor colors are ready but even
so<00:03:23.060> we'll<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.299> put<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.510> one<00:03:24.840> off<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.170> the
