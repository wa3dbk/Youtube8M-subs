00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
several types of languages C and Java

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.270 
several types of languages C and Java
just<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.670> name<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> few

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
just to name a few

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.749 
just to name a few
in<00:01:23.280> Java<00:01:23.580> you'll<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.970> learning<00:01:24.299> Java<00:01:24.600> 1<00:01:24.869> 2<00:01:25.110> &amp;<00:01:25.380> 3

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
in Java you'll be learning Java 1 2 &amp; 3

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.010 
in Java you'll be learning Java 1 2 &amp; 3
the<00:01:26.759> reason<00:01:27.030> being<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.330> Java<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.900> an

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the reason being is because Java is an

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
the reason being is because Java is an
object-oriented<00:01:28.590> language<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.340> terms<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
object-oriented language in terms of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
object-oriented language in terms of
software<00:01:30.270> development<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:31.170> really<00:01:31.680> big

a<00:02:07.140> lot<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.350> fun<00:02:07.680> especially<00:02:07.860> once<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.580> get<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
a lot of fun especially once you get to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.249 
a lot of fun especially once you get to
towards<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> end<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.270> your<00:02:09.390> program<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
towards the end of your program and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.860 
towards the end of your program and
software<00:02:11.099> engineering<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.450> my<00:02:12.510> favorite

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
software engineering one of my favorite

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.630 
software engineering one of my favorite
parts<00:02:13.050> was<00:02:13.379> after

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
parts was after

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.400 
parts was after
being<00:02:13.880> submitted<00:02:14.270> into<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.510> classroom<00:02:14.900> and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
being submitted into a classroom and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.570 
being submitted into a classroom and
then<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.740> very<00:02:15.920> first<00:02:16.190> thing<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
then the very first thing that the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.910 
then the very first thing that the
teacher<00:02:16.730> says<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.530> hey<00:02:18.530> you're<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.860> be

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
teacher says is hey you're going to be

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.380 
teacher says is hey you're going to be
clattering<00:02:19.250> through<00:02:19.400> colleagues<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.060> create

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
clattering through colleagues to create

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.480 
clattering through colleagues to create
this<00:02:20.510> giant<00:02:20.630> project<00:02:21.410> for<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> client<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.280> so

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
this giant project for a client and so

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.460 
this giant project for a client and so
they'll<00:02:22.730> throw<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:22.940> into<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.540> pool<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.080> clients

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
they'll throw you into a pool of clients

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.320 
they'll throw you into a pool of clients
you<00:02:24.650> pick<00:02:25.069> one<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.640> figure<00:02:25.910> out<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.120> needs

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
you pick one you figure out the needs

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.699 
you pick one you figure out the needs
and<00:02:26.600> once<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.930> client<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.350> then<00:02:27.470> you

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
and once that client and then you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.080 
and once that client and then you
collaborate<00:02:28.250> your<00:02:28.400> colleagues<00:02:28.730> based<00:02:28.940> off

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
collaborate your colleagues based off

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.180 
collaborate your colleagues based off
what<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.330> learned<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:30.290> develop<00:02:30.709> software<00:02:30.890> for

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
what you learned to develop software for

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.730 
what you learned to develop software for
this<00:02:31.490> client<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.000> then<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.390> course<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.620> know

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
this client and then of course you know

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.560 
this client and then of course you know
you<00:02:34.070> apply<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.640> execute<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.180> towards<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
you apply and you execute it towards the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.690 
you apply and you execute it towards the
end<00:02:35.690> it's<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.959> lot<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.230> fun<00:02:36.440> for<00:02:36.709> me<00:02:36.770> personally

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
end it's a lot of fun for me personally

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.500 
end it's a lot of fun for me personally

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the map portion of it so it was a great

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.449 
the map portion of it so it was a great
experience<00:02:47.680> things<00:02:48.680> like<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.070> are<00:02:49.220> actually

several<00:03:00.950> languages<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.940> have<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.180> be

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
several languages and you have to be

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.670 
several languages and you have to be
really<00:03:02.540> advanced<00:03:02.930> with<00:03:03.050> those<00:03:03.170> languages<00:03:03.590> so

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
really advanced with those languages so

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.110 
really advanced with those languages so
you'll<00:03:03.830> take<00:03:03.980> several<00:03:04.220> courses<00:03:04.550> throughout

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
you'll take several courses throughout

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.449 
you'll take several courses throughout
the<00:03:05.450> program<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:07.040> quite<00:03:07.250> difficult

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
the program and it is quite difficult

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.390 
the program and it is quite difficult
but<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:09.019> they're<00:03:09.320> very<00:03:09.530> challenging<00:03:09.769> so<00:03:10.220> if

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
but and they're very challenging so if

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.850 
but and they're very challenging so if
you<00:03:11.030> were<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.239> be<00:03:11.390> asked<00:03:11.840> what<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.590> hardest

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
you were to be asked what is the hardest

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.990 
you were to be asked what is the hardest
thing<00:03:13.070> in<00:03:13.250> software<00:03:13.489> engineering<00:03:13.580> he'd

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
thing in software engineering he'd

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.280 
thing in software engineering he'd
probably<00:03:14.180> be<00:03:14.390> learning<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.810> languages<00:03:15.260> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
probably be learning the languages and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.770 
probably be learning the languages and
applying<00:03:15.890> them<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.040> formerly<00:03:16.850> big<00:03:17.150> algorithms

and<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.410> solve<00:03:18.680> big<00:03:18.920> problems<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.640> happened

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
and to solve big problems that happened

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.380 
and to solve big problems that happened
in<00:03:20.510> software<00:03:20.750> engineering<00:03:21.370> something<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.489> feel

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
in software engineering something I feel

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.210 
in software engineering something I feel
I<00:03:23.450> should<00:03:23.750> mention<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.500> there<00:03:24.769> is<00:03:24.920> math

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
I should mention is that there is math

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.870 
I should mention is that there is math
in<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.519> degree<00:03:25.670> up<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.780> calc<00:03:27.019> 2<00:03:27.280> if<00:03:28.280> you're

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
in this degree up to calc 2 if you're

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.449 
in this degree up to calc 2 if you're
like<00:03:29.060> me<00:03:29.329> math<00:03:30.140> was<00:03:30.350> never<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.620> strong<00:03:31.160> point

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
like me math was never a strong point

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.729 
like me math was never a strong point
but<00:03:31.730> once<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.329> overcome<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.780> it's<00:03:33.290> actually

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
but once you overcome that it's actually

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.340 
but once you overcome that it's actually
you<00:03:34.579> don't<00:03:34.730> see<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.060> lot<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.570> hard<00:03:36.140> math

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
you don't see a lot of hard math

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.680 
you don't see a lot of hard math

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
I can't say you're computer science so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.910 
I can't say you're computer science so
if<00:03:40.340> you're<00:03:40.459> software<00:03:40.700> engineering<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.150> can

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
if you're software engineering I can

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.800 
if you're software engineering I can
mainly<00:03:42.920> because<00:03:43.160> it's<00:03:43.459> more<00:03:43.810> software

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
mainly because it's more software

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.030 
mainly because it's more software

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.350 
collaboration and things of that nature
not<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:48.739> much<00:03:48.950> of<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> growth<00:03:49.730> apart<00:03:50.060> it's

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
not so much of the a growth apart it's

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.539 
not so much of the a growth apart it's
important<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.019> it's<00:03:51.079> not<00:03:51.320> actually<00:03:51.709> the

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
important but it's not actually the

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.370 
important but it's not actually the
whole<00:03:52.880> idea<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.750> picture<00:03:54.019> of<00:03:54.110> software

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
whole idea of the picture of software

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
whole idea of the picture of software
engineering<00:03:55.600> in<00:03:56.600> closing<00:03:57.110> if<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:58.250> are

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
engineering in closing if you are

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.100 
engineering in closing if you are
thinking<00:03:58.730> about<00:03:58.790> software<00:03:59.209> engineering<00:03:59.239> some

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
thinking about software engineering some

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.990 
thinking about software engineering some
things<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.709> would<00:04:00.860> say<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.370> encourage<00:04:01.700> you

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
things that I would say to encourage you

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.720 
things that I would say to encourage you
to<00:04:02.120> do<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:02.450> is<00:04:02.709> suffering<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.130> lot<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.400> fun<00:04:04.549> if

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
to do so is suffering is a lot of fun if

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.330 
to do so is suffering is a lot of fun if
you<00:04:04.940> enjoy<00:04:05.299> using<00:04:05.660> computers<00:04:06.110> if<00:04:06.350> you<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.890> not

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
you enjoy using computers if you and not

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.130 
you enjoy using computers if you and not
just<00:04:07.610> for<00:04:07.820> basic<00:04:08.120> necessities<00:04:08.239> but<00:04:08.750> actually

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
just for basic necessities but actually

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.289 
just for basic necessities but actually
have<00:04:09.980> questions<00:04:10.459> of<00:04:10.640> how<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:10.880> computer<00:04:11.090> works

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
have questions of how a computer works

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.780 
have questions of how a computer works
how<00:04:12.019> is<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.230> computer<00:04:12.560> tie-in<00:04:13.190> with<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.489> rest

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
how is it computer tie-in with the rest

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.729 
how is it computer tie-in with the rest
of<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:13.940> world<00:04:14.180> housing<00:04:14.840> things<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.650> that

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
of the world housing things of that

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.039 
of the world housing things of that
nature<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:16.340> if<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:16.640> enjoy<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.209> then<00:04:17.479> take<00:04:18.019> a

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
nature and if you enjoy that then take a

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.199 
nature and if you enjoy that then take a
look<00:04:18.200> at<00:04:18.320> software<00:04:18.530> engineering<00:04:18.919> because

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
look at software engineering because

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.909 
look at software engineering because
with<00:04:20.209> computers<00:04:20.690> computers<00:04:21.410> are<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.739> future

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
with computers computers are the future

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.090 
with computers computers are the future
and<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:23.000> if<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.720> enjoy<00:04:24.020> using<00:04:24.260> them

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
and and if you enjoy using them

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.230 
and and if you enjoy using them
software<00:04:25.400> engineering<00:04:25.670> can<00:04:25.850> be<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:25.970> great

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
software engineering can be a great

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.570 
software engineering can be a great
outlet<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.780> not<00:04:27.110> only<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.860> know<00:04:27.980> that's<00:04:28.430> a

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
outlet to not only to you know that's a

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.230 
outlet to not only to you know that's a
