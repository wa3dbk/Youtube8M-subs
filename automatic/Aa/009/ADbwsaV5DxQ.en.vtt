 hello in this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:10.360
 how to tame birds 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.360
 Minecraft 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.470
 the first thing we need are seeds 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.090
 the seeds how are you 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.550
 and now I have to bring up a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.550
 birds 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.140
 I'm going to break this 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.670
 and in a 10 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370
 v 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.880
 there they are all 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.760
 and good now what we have to do 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.170
 is to throw the seeds on the button the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.450
 letter q 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.409
 and beige come all here 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.409
 now I walk away 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.250
 and now it 's 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.590
 domesticated you see no longer escape 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.360
 we 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.350
 you see 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.350
 Unlike 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.909
 one that is not domesticated 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.220
 You see this one escapes from us because one 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.120
 is domesticated 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.120
 but this is not 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.280
 you see 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.720
 and I wanted to thank my two
