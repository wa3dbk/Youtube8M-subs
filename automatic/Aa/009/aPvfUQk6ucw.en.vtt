I think we'll be pretty good this season
the<00:01:03.780> strengths<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.170> orphans<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.650> our

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450

graduated<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.860> got<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> couple<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.310> new<00:01:29.430> guys

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
graduated we got a couple of new guys

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.030 
graduated we got a couple of new guys
coming<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> line<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.570> big<00:01:31.500> bodies<00:01:31.829> they

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
coming in the line the big bodies they

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
coming in the line the big bodies they
seem<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.640> they're<00:01:32.700> doing<00:01:32.970> they're

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
seem to know what they're doing they're

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
seem to know what they're doing they're
picking<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:34.590> think<00:01:34.920> our<00:01:35.040> offensive<00:01:35.310> line

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
picking it up I think our offensive line

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.560 
picking it up I think our offensive line
is<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> force<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> reckon<00:01:36.329> with

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
is going to be a force to reckon with

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.690 
is going to be a force to reckon with
this<00:01:36.780> season<00:01:37.049> defense<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.829> gone<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.460> be

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this season defense is gone I think be

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
this season defense is gone I think be
our<00:01:38.880> strong<00:01:39.180> suit<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.810> us<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.380> lot<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
our strong suit for us we got a lot of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.069 
our strong suit for us we got a lot of
guys<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.579> are<00:01:41.820> naturally<00:01:42.329> aggressive<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
guys that are naturally aggressive and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.410 
guys that are naturally aggressive and
like<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> tackle<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:43.890> run<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:45.119> our<00:01:45.210> team

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like the tackle and run I think our team

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
like the tackle and run I think our team
speed<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> good<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.710> worry<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.070> bigger

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
speed is good I just worry about bigger

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.520 
speed is good I just worry about bigger
bodies<00:01:48.000> same<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> offensive<00:01:49.110> defense

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
bodies same with the offensive defense

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
bodies same with the offensive defense
has<00:01:49.619> been<00:01:49.649> together<00:01:49.890> while<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:50.790> how

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
has been together while they know how

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
has been together while they know how
each<00:01:51.240> other<00:01:51.329> play<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.869> they're<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> be

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
each other play and they're going to be

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.980 
each other play and they're going to be
pretty<00:01:53.159> tough<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.490> season<00:01:53.790> too<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.090> think

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
pretty tough this season too I think

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.319
