00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello how are you I'm Nancy and in the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.129
 today's video I bring you some ideas from 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.629
 healthy drinks and this is because I 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.059
 I know that when we have heat we want 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.460
 take a soda or juice 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 fruits or at worst there are 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.940
 people who take redbull or all of these 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.890
 energy drinks and all these 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.660
 drinks that I just mentioned are 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.370
 full of sugar preservatives 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.200
 chemicals and a lot of things that 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.910
 they really are not good at all 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.830
 our body and this does not just happen 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.329
 with cold drinks also happens with 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.030
 hot drinks when they are 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.460
 we ordered a chocolate so sweetly filled 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.500
 of cream or we ask for a super coffee 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.660
 loaded and this is not so good for 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700
 our body then also going to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.649
 give a healthy idea for them to take 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.360
 a hot drink that is delicious and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.370
 that will do your body very well 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.590
 so if you're interested to see what they are 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.950
 these healthy drinks keep watching the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.950
 video 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.609
 ok let's start with cold drinks 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.710
 and for that it's the first thing we're going to 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.710
 make is strawberry lemonade and for this 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.750
 I used lemons and water strawberries and if you 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.460
 you want you can add some sweetener 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.649
 natural but the truth I'm not going to use 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.270
 no sweetener because I do not feel 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.960
 like the taste of fruits is 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 enough 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.100
 here as you can see cut the lemons 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.350
 in half and the strawberries remove them 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.490
 part green quote and now I'm just going 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.490
 to squeeze the lemons 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.330
 and now I'm just going to put water 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.480
 the lemon juice and the strawberries in my 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.490
 blender and actually this juice is 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.110
 where you see it has a lot of nutrients 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.780
 is full of antioxidants by the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.580
 vitamin c strawberries for the lemon and for 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.120
 a sunny day is perfect for 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.120
 refresh 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.159
 for this next juice we are going to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.049
 need fine cucumber and an apple 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.280
 green and they do not think that the pineapple is 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.380
 too much moon 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.750
 for me it is one of the most beautiful fruits 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.129
 they are leaving aside my relationship of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.140
 love with the pineapple I'm going to cut in 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.670
 little pieces of cucumber and apple and I'm going to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.670
 cut a slice of pineapple 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.980
 make sure you take the part of the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.719
 center or the heart to the pineapple since 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.090
 It has a super strong flavor and also 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.890
 it has enzymes that when put in 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.299
 contact with saliva creating an acid 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.299
 very strong for our mouth 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.650
 now simply with everything in the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.330
 blender and at the end you can strain it 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.130
 because I do not know why you do not want 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.770
 come out like bits of the shell of 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.750
 apple or cucumber and you're 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.090
 enjoy this natural juice and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.819
 delicious and actually this is 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.739
 definitely my favorite when the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.890
 heat when I want to represent 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.330
 when I am very thirsty 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.840
 past 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.840
 Y 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.500
 now on a day when you are very cold 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.330
 clearly you will not want to take any 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.800
 of the drinks that I showed you before like this 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.320
 I'm going to show you a drink here 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.670
 hot that I love here like 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.500
 see what I'm doing is preparing 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.530
 my favorite tea you can use the water 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.810
 aromatic a green tea a black I do not know what 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.180
 what else do you like 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.580
 and I'm going to put it in a cup in a little cup 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.080
 my favorite red fruits out already 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.080
 use raspberries and cherries 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.750
 and now it simply serves the tea and not 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.280
 you know how rich is this fries 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.260
 as they soften and is totally 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.800
 delicious to bite when they are 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.800
 soft 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.330
