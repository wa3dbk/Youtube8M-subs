00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
video so let's try this one this is a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.209 
video so let's try this one this is a
gray<00:00:07.950> motor<00:00:08.849> company<00:00:09.300> from<00:00:09.540> Detroit<00:00:09.870> Michigan

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219

line<00:00:14.179> from<00:00:15.179> my<00:00:15.330> research<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.020> figured<00:00:16.590> that

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
line from my research I figured that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.700 
line from my research I figured that
this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.119> 1913<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:19.170> way<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> could<00:00:19.529> come<00:00:19.650> up

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
this is a 1913 the way I could come up

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.099 
this is a 1913 the way I could come up
with<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.490> two<00:00:21.060> distinctive<00:00:21.600> features<00:00:21.990> on

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
with that is two distinctive features on

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.859 
with that is two distinctive features on
this<00:00:22.260> particular<00:00:22.590> engine<00:00:23.130> one<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.539> tri

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
this particular engine one is the tri

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.560 
this particular engine one is the tri
fuel<00:00:25.170> carburetor<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:26.939> now<00:00:27.119> I'll<00:00:27.359> try

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
fuel carburetor and right now I'll try

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.980 
fuel carburetor and right now I'll try
to<00:00:27.630> get<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> video<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:29.449> see<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.779> run

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to get the video that see it can be run

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.530 
to get the video that see it can be run
on<00:00:31.230> gas<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:32.009> gasoline<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.090> pump<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> gas

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
on gas or gasoline you can pump the gas

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.360 
on gas or gasoline you can pump the gas
right<00:00:33.809> into<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.079> side<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.739> then<00:00:34.950> apparently

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
right into the side and then apparently

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.770 
right into the side and then apparently
there<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.550> another<00:00:35.610> attachment<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.600> could

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
there was another attachment that could

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.190 
there was another attachment that could
go<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.860> run<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.100> kerosene

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
go on and you can run on kerosene

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.020 
go on and you can run on kerosene
