 doing now let's start the first 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.530
 enamel that I applied on all my 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.500
 childhood is in wise and and nothing else has a 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.540
 number of 203 to followed by this I'm going to 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 be using a color glaze 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.989
 White 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.550
 I will be using this sancti and 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.100
 this enamel I 'm just going to 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.590
 apply by going to the side of my girl 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.900
 rounding him around in the area of 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.829
 up and nothing else I'm going to fill in the 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.989
 part of the side 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.359
 now I will be using this 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.699
 crack enamel with black color and it's 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.309
 the brand mia secret and nothing else I 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.579
 I am applying on the area that I have 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.159
 enameled in white and starts to 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.300
 breaking the enamel and gives a very 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.820
 funny 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.890
 now it's time to paint a heart 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.900
 first I will be delineating the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.750
 heart with a red color I'm 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.910
 using acrylic paint for this and 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.340
 I'm just giving shape to that 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.440
 heart on both sides and I want that 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.110
 the heart is big enough but 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.020
 for this design paint my hearts in 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.540
 different girls in different sizes 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.910
 then it is a very free art and you 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.980
 they can decide to make their hearts like 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.590
 you better find it now nothing more 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.960
 I'm filling in the center part of the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.550
 heart and I'm going to make sure to put 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.710
 all the tools you use to 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.790
 this design below this video in the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.790
 section description 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.440
 once my heart is completely dry 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.350
 I'm going in with a glaze with 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.020
 shines in red you can 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.060
 use any glaze with glitter 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.430
 that have even this painting 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.040
 acrylic red with glosses 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.280
 could I use now I'm going to apply 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.100
 a clear glaze over my heart to 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.590
 that in this way the surface is made 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.560
 and so I can start to fix the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.350
 balines these balines are tiny 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.060
 if I buy them in an art store and 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.800
 well they work very well for this 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.470
 then nothing else I'm delineating everything 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.370
 around my heart 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.370
 with these balines 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.440
 also going upwards I will be 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.350
 applying some pellets in the area that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.110
 divide the color of pink with enamel 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.080
 krako below my heart I'm going to 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.480
 fix three balls in the same color 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.490
 Silver below these three 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.790
 I'm going to fix a pebble in 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.380
 red in size two millimeters and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.800
 nothing else I'm rounding well the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.800
 balines towards the sides of my pebble 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.350
 red I'm going to be fixing two balls in 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.230

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.630
 second pebble in same red color 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.570
 measure two millimeters like the other 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.420
 on the sides I'm going to apply two balines 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.460
 on each side and going down three 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.740
 more validity 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.780
