place like a restaurant or a movie

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.429 
place like a restaurant or a movie
always<00:02:30.480> makes<00:02:30.629> me<00:02:30.959> feel<00:02:30.989> even<00:02:31.290> more

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
uncomfortable movies aren't just bad

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.660

in a restaurant I feel is always awkward
and<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.269> because<00:02:39.390> there<00:02:39.720> are<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:39.840> many

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
and just because there are so many

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.720 
and just because there are so many
people<00:02:40.230> around<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.859> so<00:02:41.099> it's<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.340> awkward

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
there's so many other just little

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.280 
there's so many other just little
factors<00:02:44.879> of<00:02:45.090> things<00:02:45.329> going<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:45.780> around<00:02:45.959> you

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290

communicating<00:02:46.980> with<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.159> waiter<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.609> all

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
communicating with the waiter and all

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.819 
communicating with the waiter and all
that<00:02:47.909> just<00:02:48.180> makes<00:02:48.780> me<00:02:48.870> very<00:02:49.019> self-conscious<00:02:49.680> I

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
that just makes me very self-conscious I

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.649 
that just makes me very self-conscious I
don't<00:02:50.040> know<00:02:50.099> if<00:02:50.220> that's<00:02:50.400> weird<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.420> guess<00:02:51.510> a

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
don't know if that's weird so I guess a

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.319 
don't know if that's weird so I guess a
dream<00:02:51.989> date<00:02:52.139> would<00:02:52.290> probably<00:02:52.620> be<00:02:52.769> like

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
dream date would probably be like

dream date would probably be like
something<00:02:54.329> outside<00:02:54.659> maybe<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.709> beach
