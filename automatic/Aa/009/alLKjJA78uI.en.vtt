00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.850
 our planet is exposed to 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.529
 numerous pollutants that harm 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.900
 the welfare to the health of beings 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:18.090
 alive that inhabit it 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.820
 the pollutants are substances 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.699
 chemical and biological shaped 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.800
 thermal energy radiations or noise that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.590
 adhere or come in contact with the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.560
 air soil or water affecting your 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.150
 composition and causing damage to the environment 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.410
 in which animals live plants 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.410
 and the oven 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.540
 and water pollution can 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.280
 come from natural sources the greatest 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.900
 part of the current pollution 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.530
 comes 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.530
 mayer 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.480
 samaranch 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:27.580
 not because of what he saw 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.390
 We are polluting in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.200
 contaminants can be found in 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.930
 Water 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.950
 we need 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.450
 they can be dissolved or suspended 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.450
 means that it is in 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.370
 no no 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.270
 a mixture of sun particles 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.119
 emissions from cars the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.720
 and the dust can be suspended as 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.200
 part 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.200
 Y 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.690
 so he did not see badly in himself I saw him because 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.880
 does not offer you a prize was something that 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.880
 I intuit male and a phallus 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.140
 a kind of pollution 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.660
 weather conditions 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.709
 nitrogen oxides ozone and for what 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.890
 acid rain is formed when 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.319
 sulfur and nitrogen oxides 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.860
 react with atmospheric humidity 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.860
 producing various 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.390
 it's a music of the moment because if I go 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.390
 to dead
