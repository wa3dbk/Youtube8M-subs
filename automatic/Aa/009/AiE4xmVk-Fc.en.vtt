00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.170
 presentation clinical case masterclass a 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.170
 surgery 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.309
 33-year-old male patient who 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.000
 go for the first time to our consultation 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.740
 on June 25, 2010 referring 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.470
 discomfort in the right knee and that 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.689
 after a clinical examination and 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.350
 imaging tests an injury is observed 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.330
 of cartilage in internal femoral condyle 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.610
 Conservative measures are indicated by 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.850
 present little clinic and reviews 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.850
 periodic 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.460
 On June 4, 2012 he came again 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.490
 to query referring to being with more 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.260
 pain that the previous consultation despite 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.140
 have had two surgeries during 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.210
 two years in a first surgery will 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.000
 they performed a mosaicplasty with bad 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.590
 results in a second surgery 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.590
 place a tweet in the injury 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.829
 is asked in a series of tests of 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.379
 image starting with a telemetry of 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.030
 lower limbs where we observe a 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.520
 correct alignment of the limb without 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 no type of axis deviation 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.450
 in the bone scintigraphy a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.670
 increase in activity in the area of 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.740
 injury that indicates that the injury is 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.079
 active with bone involvement 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.260
 subchondral and that sits on the condyle 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.570
 internal femoral of the right knee 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.550
 the magnetic resonance shows us a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 osteochondral lesion in the condyle 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.630
 internal femoral in loading area with 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.630
 inner healthy meniscus 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.410
 it is decided to perform surgery 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.250
 arthroscopic knee on day 24 of 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.050
 June 2013 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.420
 and observe the lesson in situ 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.740
 here we have the images of the surgery 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.740
 putting together a lesson 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.910
 due to the depth of the injury 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.250
 decides to fill the defect with graft 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.410
 of the patient's own bone that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.500
 we take from the outer face of the knee 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.210
 as you can see in the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.180
 picture on the left 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.040
 and place it in the area of ​​the injury 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.150
 we also take a healthy cartilage biopsy 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.150
 to send to cultivate 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.320
 we observed the cartilage sample 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.100
 obtained the boat on the left is a 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.380
 death 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.380
 of the lesson we keep for study 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.280
 this video is observed as we cultivate 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.440
 the cartilage cells and how they're going 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.690
 dividing to get a larger number 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.630
 of cells that we will place in the lesion 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.480
 of the patient this number of cells goes to 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.820
 depend on the size of the version 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.520
 we put 5 million per centimeter 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.010
 square if the injury is from a 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.020
 centimeter we need 5 million 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.810
 usually the crop needs between 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.750
 four and six weeks to divide 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.180
 but the size time will depend 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.400
 of the injury we will need more cells and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.370
 the age of the patient as 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.720
 we are observing as we get older 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.720
 slow are in dividing 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.200
 this is the resonance after the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.480
 surgery to observe that there is good 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.220
 filling the cavity and we can also 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.890
 see the perforations we made 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.370
 for the grafted bone to adhere to 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.370
 the injury 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.680
 we also do an x-ray 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.140
 showing the injury but a good space 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.120
 articulate and a conserved knee 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.980
 on this slide we have wanted 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.230
 show a comparison of the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.330
 resonances before surgery to the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.580
 left and after surgery to 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.230
 the right observing a correct 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.849
 cavity filling 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.120
 here we see some photos of the 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.989
 exploration of August 28, 2013 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.400
 checking that the patient has a 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.410
 good mobility with an extension 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.300
 complete and a flex 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.130
 and yes it presents atrophy 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.130
 muscle and a small joint effusion 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.909
 in this same consultation we check the 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.200
 scars and we're ready to 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.200
 the surgery of the cartilage implant
