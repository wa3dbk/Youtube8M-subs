00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.640
 youtube whadoyaknow friends because we are 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.480
 here in a new video and we have here in 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.619
 2 xbox 360 screen is on this side 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.490
 this is a xbox of 4 gigas slim clear and 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:22.630
 another slim 250 gigas and well 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:26.170
 we have here the typical or rather said 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.670
 the weird red light as we see here is 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.730
 marking red light and then this xbox is 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.800
 semi new era is new but then 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.679
 has use already has a time of use 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.109
 and then suddenly I do not know the fault that 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.969
 they wanted here is to love them and to chirp for 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.819
 have free games and look what you 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.760
 happened it was unusable put totally 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:51.489
 because according to I had investigated everything 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.889
 this and it has no solution and if it reaches 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.329
 having a solution is going to work very 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.870
 little time and you will have again 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.510
 problems constantly etcetera and then 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.699
 this one is mine is the one that I use 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.619
 people shout yet thank god not 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.890
 Nothing has happened to him, he has endured very well 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.939
 all nevertheless because the city â€‹â€‹or 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.119
 the serious mistake of this is to want 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.100
 put them free games and then you see and 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.570
 well on screen what appears here is 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:23.500
 the error 82 as we see there to see if 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.340
 comes to focus light well we are 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.020
 says system error and gun calls 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.020
 to service customer support 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.180
 xbox and because it gives us the page of the box 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.780
 point that waved to support id at 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.520
 error 82 and they go to google and all that 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.880
 Well, the same thing will happen to you as light 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.030
 red red light of death circle 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.610
 red of death and then several things 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.940
 but we are not going to solve no 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.910
 solution for this friends and well then 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:01.300
 if we have a weird but true case of 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.530
 the red light on xbox 360 slim but not 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.130
 it happens to go through overheating 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.110
 because you use them too much nothing that's not 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.899
 very difficult to happen only from that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.170
 I had be too much in that to be able 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.090
 do this and well then here we have 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.370
 everything else works fine but then if 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.129
 can not start 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.510
 because the system can not do nothing 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.580
 What can be done in these cases? 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.860
 would sell the pieces as it could be 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.780
 functional as is the fan the reader 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.510
 Of discs 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.819
 and even the same one 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.610
 to this thing that I do not know what this is called 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.650
 it also serves but what it is that 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.290
 it would be the damn surprise card 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.450
 well, it would practically serve us 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.590
 the hard drive task still works like this 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.349
 is that nothing I hope you liked 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.480
 this video just to tell them to take care 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.579
 your consoles do not try to chipping 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.470
 because the moment you connect them to 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.290
 internet and try to play online but 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.420
 They are going to bathe going to happen this so 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.569
 that nothing we see until the next 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.569
 bye
