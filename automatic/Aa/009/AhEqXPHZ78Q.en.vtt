00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
background Philadelphia let's see if I

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.480 
background Philadelphia let's see if I
can<00:00:08.790> zoom<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.389> focus<00:00:10.110> rather<00:00:10.400> he's<00:00:11.400> in

can zoom in on it focus rather he's in

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.570 
can zoom in on it focus rather he's in
the<00:00:11.580> 85<00:00:14.990> 1.2<00:00:15.990> version<00:00:16.440> -<00:00:16.650> I've<00:00:17.220> got<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the 85 1.2 version - I've got the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.550 
the 85 1.2 version - I've got the
aperture<00:00:18.029> strolling<00:00:18.900> through<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.260> dial

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
aperture strolling through that dial

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.790 
aperture strolling through that dial
right<00:00:19.710> now<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:21.779> polarization<00:00:22.470> filter<00:00:24.800> let's

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
right now the polarization filter let's

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.200 
right now the polarization filter let's
see<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.160> get<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> little<00:00:26.609> side<00:00:26.789> effect

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
see if we can get a little side effect

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.490 
see if we can get a little side effect
going<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.310> meant<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.519> 13<00:00:30.320> watch<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
clouds there I'm just dialing back and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.410 
clouds there I'm just dialing back and
forth<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.710> bit<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.399> less<00:00:37.790> turn<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
forth a little bit for less turn it up a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.860 
forth a little bit for less turn it up a
little<00:00:40.379> bit<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.040> walk<00:00:41.190> towards<00:00:41.610> it

little<00:00:47.550> blue<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.920> wrote<00:00:49.920> take<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> taking

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
little blue in here wrote take it taking

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.979 
little blue in here wrote take it taking
a<00:00:50.550> full<00:00:50.730> rotation<00:00:50.940> around<00:00:52.070> real<00:00:53.070> slow<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> you

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
a full rotation around real slow so you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.770 
a full rotation around real slow so you
can<00:00:55.230> watch<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> clouds<00:00:55.920> there<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.449> watch<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
can watch the clouds there and watch the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.580 
can watch the clouds there and watch the
sky

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.410 

so<00:01:01.250> just<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.489> little<00:01:01.730> lighter<00:01:01.940> there<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.329> I'm

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
so just a little lighter there and I'm

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:23.830 
so just a little lighter there and I'm
gonna<00:01:02.690> dial<00:01:02.870> back<00:01:03.079> in<00:01:03.140> more<00:01:03.440> blue<00:01:22.360> was<00:01:23.360> rotated

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
gonna dial back in more blue was rotated

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.060 
gonna dial back in more blue was rotated
again<00:01:24.159> all<00:01:25.159> right<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:25.580> Suns<00:01:26.330> off<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.690> my<00:01:26.780> left

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
again all right so Suns off to my left

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.260 
again all right so Suns off to my left
so<00:01:28.070> let's<00:01:28.250> go<00:01:28.369> ahead<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.520> face<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.909> Sun<00:01:29.090> now

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
so let's go ahead and face the Sun now

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.850 
so let's go ahead and face the Sun now
and<00:01:29.479> I'll<00:01:29.540> give<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.869> version<00:01:30.259> of<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.560> well

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
and I'll give you a version of that well

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.200 
and I'll give you a version of that well
not<00:01:31.070> really<00:01:31.310> gonna<00:01:31.430> face<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:31.909> hard<00:01:32.119> enough

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
not really gonna face it hard enough

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.930 
not really gonna face it hard enough
where<00:01:32.420> my<00:01:32.660> meter<00:01:32.899> there<00:01:33.140> my<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.440> sensor<00:01:33.940> let's

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
where my meter there my a sensor let's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.210 
where my meter there my a sensor let's
dial<00:01:35.450> now

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
dial now

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.210 
dial now
so<00:01:37.220> now<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.369> would<00:01:37.520> dial<00:01:37.789> it<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.009> it's<00:01:40.009> up<00:01:40.130> to

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
so now I would dial it and it's up to

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.370 
so now I would dial it and it's up to
you<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.340> pause<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.820> video<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.240> see<00:01:41.600> whatever

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
you to pause the video and see whatever

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.919 
you to pause the video and see whatever
you<00:01:42.560> care<00:01:42.830> tube<00:01:43.070> as<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.700> dial<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.740> variable

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
you care tube as I dial this variable

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.279 
you care tube as I dial this variable
filter<00:01:47.929> all<00:01:48.470> right<00:01:48.679> now<00:01:49.520> turn<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.289> other

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
filter all right now turn to the other

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.340 
filter all right now turn to the other
clouts<00:01:51.800> there<00:01:52.250> we<00:01:52.340> go<00:01:52.869> now<00:01:53.869> as<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.170> can<00:01:54.289> see

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
clouts there we go now as you can see

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.660 
clouts there we go now as you can see
the<00:01:55.159> effect<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.640> much<00:01:55.819> greater

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.340 

and<00:01:59.120> he's<00:01:59.270> rotating<00:01:59.420> through<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.870> you<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.260> see

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
and he's rotating through it you can see

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.560 
and he's rotating through it you can see
the<00:02:00.560> effect<00:02:00.800> much<00:02:01.010> greater<00:02:01.310> when<00:02:02.180> your<00:02:02.330> son

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
