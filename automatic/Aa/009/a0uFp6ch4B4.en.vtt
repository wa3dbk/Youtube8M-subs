00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello to you with the castle of 5000 and today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.650
 I will write another video in the category 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.309
 minecraft mechanisms today i will 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.759
 review and show you the command 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.210
 block 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.539
 let's get started I built this 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.529
 good example well let's see 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.010
 experience 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:32.219
 pressing the key is not on the roof of the button 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.630
 the right mouse button gives us 500 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.260
 experience and so we can gain level so 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.300
 The second example is the change of day and night 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 example click on our us button 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.969
 night appears click on the day we 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.789
 the day appears so the third example is 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.520
 changing modes for example a knife 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.430
 survival and we have a mode 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.219
 survival push creative with us 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.530
 appeared against push adventure 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:10.290
 as you can see the game mode is changed jim 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.470
 adventures give choose creative 4 4 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.119
 An example of this is this subject 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.810
 for example a diamond block 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.200
 As you can see, here is the emerald blessing 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.009
 you can select any any blocks in any 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.549
 quantity 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.210
 well i mean up to one click 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.909
 you will be issued with so 64 pieces and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.189
 we can delete everything on the button and 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.729
 us all is lost 5 example is the point 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.790
 rebirth that will help 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.079
 it's like your spawn thats so 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.299
 the rebirth point is entered on 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.920
 set coordinates let's 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.549
 write kill and slander us we are killed and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.520
 here you are revived 6 example this 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.250
 teleport 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.409
 push the button up and here we are 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.410
 top click down 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.069
 we appeared so 6 example is change 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.330
 complexity 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:26.700
 up peacefully easy normal and difficult 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:30.860
 give post peace so 7 example is you 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.349
 probably everyone went through the map 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.120
 cards passed but only on some 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:43.920
 there is such a let's show an example 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:49.140
 when you step on forgot how 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.650
 called ok ok pressure plate here 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.769
 such a name here displays a message 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.769
 presented 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:02.430
 Hello everyone now, April 28, 2013 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:06.060
 so the last example is changing the weather 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.849
 give and push clear and take from us 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.310
 written to change to fair weather 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.290
 let's wait and as you can see 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.280
 appeared if the weather let's press 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.680
 rain and change the rainy weather and us 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.900
 it started to rain, we’ll hit the storm and in theory here 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.590
 there must be lightning but for some reason I don’t 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:36.900
 see so let's click clear and see 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:40.139
 all from behind let's and here we look and experience 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.639
 here everywhere command blocks see what 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.400
 it gives us experience is the usual console 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.239
 team probably 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.709
 if you had a server you asked yourself 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.989
 experience and 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:01.970
 and introduced like hear money and 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:04.900
 amount of experience and then just enter here 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:09.859
 this team and we are given 500 experience 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.859
 so the second example is the day and night shift 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:18.440
 day and night so night 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:24.229
 this surveillance we are full 16000 it gives us 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:30.530
 night day this is tim and set 5000 and this is day 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:35.830
 so the third example is the change of modes 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:39.430
 games survival is a fashion house 0 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:49.090
 Tarsky 1 and adventure 2 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:49.090
 so shorts examples gives us that 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:05:01.340
 items and removes them this here this 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.380
 the team here is 57 and t1 monoblock and one 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.590
 this amount 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:11.930
 can be changed for example to 64 no glass 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:16.729
 reached you see everything preserved 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:19.520
 click and we are the rule glass let's 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:23.510
 All the same, we put it as it was 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:27.710
 and here we have a surgery preserved 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.770
 deleting this here is this command which on 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.130
 one key multiplier 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:37.789
 deletes all blocks by example push and 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.820
 all distant point of rebirth point 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:44.720
 rebirth is when we step on 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:49.760
 the plates you have saved. 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.600
 let's see what we have in the team 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.860
 block 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:06:02.360
 here it says spawn point hear spam 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:08.030
 point and this team here is a block of grass 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.990
 so that everything was as it was now 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:15.850
 teleports 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.850
 teleports are put like this 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:24.530
 team dog n and coordinates where are you 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.540
 want to teleport well upstairs well 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:30.740
 other coordinates of r. 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.430
 get out of here 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:38.120
 section from here down 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:42.620
 bottom up so the next example is like 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.760
 once the modes change for this we see what 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.600
 in command blocks 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:52.720
 watch this team if you can 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.380
 pause and lead so here alone 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.090
 peaceful this 0 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:02.690
 easy one is normal 2 and difficult 3 so 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:08.530
 senior example it displays a message in 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:13.220
 chat let's see this write sa and 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:17.450
 message so that's it and the last 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:22.180
 example this is a change of weather clear this here 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:26.600
 this team is rain this is this team 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:31.120
