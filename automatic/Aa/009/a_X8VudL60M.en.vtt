through like that place it through to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.469 
through like that place it through to
the<00:01:53.929> other<00:01:54.020> side<00:01:54.640> my<00:01:55.640> lace<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.060> just<00:01:56.299> long

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
the other side my lace is just long

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.010 
the other side my lace is just long
enough<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.080> can<00:01:57.350> double<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.039> up<00:01:58.929> so<00:01:59.929> it's

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
enough that I can double it up so it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.300

lace<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.500> through<00:02:00.740> again<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:03.069> well<00:02:04.069> you<00:02:04.159> know

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
lace it through again and well you know

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.670 
lace it through again and well you know
the<00:02:04.580> idea<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:05.209> this<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.469> instead<00:02:06.469> of<00:02:06.530> having

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
the idea with this is instead of having

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.319 
the idea with this is instead of having
a<00:02:07.039> belt<00:02:07.280> or<00:02:07.430> something<00:02:07.729> where<00:02:07.939> you<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:08.209> only

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
a belt or something where you can only

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.330 
a belt or something where you can only
get<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.630> close<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:09.019> a<00:02:09.049> certain<00:02:09.320> extent<00:02:09.739> this

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
get it close to a certain extent this

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.340 
get it close to a certain extent this
really<00:02:11.000> gets<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.359> really<00:02:11.750> tight<00:02:12.019> in<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
really gets it really tight in the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.190 
really gets it really tight in the
pocket<00:02:13.180> which<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.209> really<00:02:14.570> gonna<00:02:14.690> break<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.079> in

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
pocket which is really gonna break it in

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.699 
pocket which is really gonna break it in
a<00:02:15.260> lot<00:02:15.440> faster<00:02:16.269> so<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.299> just<00:02:17.510> tell<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.720> like<00:02:17.750> this

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.570 

then<00:02:24.709> you're<00:02:24.860> going<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.040> tie<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.310> up<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.549> tight
