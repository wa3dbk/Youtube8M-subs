00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.820
 with you 5 technique that helped me to 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.020
 have more volume at my level 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.180
 hair is a question that me 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.980
 really comes back very very very often 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.820
 and I'm told why not a video 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.220
 to answer 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.950
 especially since I have very few 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.349
 hair on their heads and they are really 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.970
 very fine so I really searched at 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.960
 thread of my hair adventure 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.370
 products which could help him 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.870
 so the first product I'm going to 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.750
 you talk to his two elders you know 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.859
 by my videos or even by instagram that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.440
 it's a product that I like 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.329
 especially because seniors at 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.160
 Beyond the fact that it will earn you 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.899
 hair to just bring over 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.210
 volume it's a product that there is 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.999
 a lot of virtue it's a product that 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.589
 will bring more strength and thousands 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.530
 of hair he will purify the leather 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.399
 hairy and especially low what we 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.679
 interested in this video 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.710
 gainey bauchau so by doing it 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.270
 regularly so times a month by 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.690
 example me that's what I'm doing it's going 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.780
 actually allow you to recover your 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.979
 hair of a thin film 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.990
 and this is precisely this thin film 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.340
 that you will accumulate and that will give you 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.479
 an impression of evolving even more 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.220
 than a volume impression that you 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.780
 will give more volume because the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.670
 diameter of your hair will be thickened 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.950
 thanks to the elders then the second 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.259
 product it's Indian powders 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.909
 so the lady powder where the powder of 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.290
 chic to kayes for example these are also 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.680
 products that will purify your 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.500
 scalp that will also help you to 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.759
 bring strength to the vigor and 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.840
 also a lot of brilliance and 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.789
 problems these are products that 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.930
 can slightly reach the hair 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.630
 in arts so if you have a 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.909
 color for example a little blonde or 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.480
 caramel avoided happened because 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.610
 how are you 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.650
 you color your hair but there too 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.660
 it's going to win the hair is really 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.340
 you bring a volume impression 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.940
 then the third product is 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.320
 Castor oil 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.030
 it's a product that I like 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.140
 really a lot even though today I 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.190
 can not use it anymore because it's 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.200
 itchy scalp 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.310
 I did a lot of oil bath 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.840
 castor at the beginning of my adventure 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.550
 capillaries and I had really noticed 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 that my hair was there too 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.630
 bulky more and pc reviews vary 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.520
 according to the people but I had 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.980
 really found that sir was and 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.790
 is stronger and thicker so the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.910
 life it can help you 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.100
 then 4th technique it will be at the level of 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.750
 your smoothing so I did it like 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.750
 a lot of smoothing with curlers or 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.980
 with bending is simply 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.960
 because unlike the smoothing 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.510
 straightener that will leave you in fact 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.370
 loops and a lot more volume 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.630
 for example it yesterday I did a smoothing 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.880
 with my flexi rhodes 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.040
 besides I will put you the link of 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.480
 my tutorial and I really like this 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.890
 technical because here it leaves me 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.720
 loops and a wick are all of 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.250
 more voluminous suite for nothing and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.570
 that's what I'm looking for because the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.930
 smoothing to paralyze even if I like 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.310
 is much smoothing is done 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.200
 really to the extreme so the hair 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.300
 are really all flat and without volume 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.490
 and finally the last technique is at 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.350
 haircut level so me 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.400
 I was doing a lot of degrading and 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.870
 realized that by making 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.070
 sharp cuts straight cuts my 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.300
 hair were immediately more 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.290
 bulky and there it is really a 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.840
 impression because dark hair 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.250
 equal length while degrading 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.810
 and really recommended for girls 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.450
 who have hair that is too bulky 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.380
 really very thick if you wish 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.880
 really have more things 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.180
 bulky think to make you 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.590
 clean cuts straight and without degrading 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.390
 so here I hope that all 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.980
 techniques and products will help you 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.410
 you too have voluminous hair 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.080
