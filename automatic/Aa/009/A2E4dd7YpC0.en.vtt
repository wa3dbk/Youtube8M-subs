00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 The first question this year urged 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.400
 you see the trailer and it looks okay 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.870
 is it like a story? 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.300
 really necessary what a man 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.820
 enters his own grave in search of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.710
 hopefully a desperate hello 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.720
 together the film factory vampire films 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.240
 have boom but with dracula 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.519
 there is no love story with you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.510
 a few glittery he design in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.130
 Cinemas but actually the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.769
 Prehistory of dracula for the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.109
 Berth us to protect his family 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.420
 Mehmed wants to be in front of the sultan 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 unbelievably many sons from his 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.590
 kingdom for his army he has 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.260
 opposes it and with it he 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.480
 can be particularly strong, he is a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 cursing packs up because he sells 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.170
 or 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.989
 he gives his soul away almost 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.910
 immortal to be strong and will 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.680
 thereby to the first vampire and time for it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 just as you know it when you know it 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.039
 Seelen wants to get rid of an extreme 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.660
 high price 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.920
 and how the whole looks and how 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.899
 that is dark and if he really is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.440
 looks like a vampire to the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.470
 trailer 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.940
 I've been waiting for an eternity 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.370
 a man of your strength what a 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.410
 his own grave in search of 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.930
 hope a desperate turks 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.960
 domain rich to destroy they are already 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.830
 very close with your powers I could 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.420
 save my people and my family 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:33.350
 your direction is in the dark 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.350
 and all their power 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.260
 you will be strong like 100 men 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.860
 and about the night and all theirs 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.000
 creatures prevail 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:55.580
 At what price you know nothing 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.580
 but I'll show you drinking 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.950
 that happens with the i have it 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.950
 chosen but why 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.399
 because swords men not before 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.400
 to fear 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.400
 he comes she fear monsters 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.220
 we do not know you 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.580
 if you only fight for life 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.580
 can 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.760
 I live here because I can save in China 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.820
 never forget who I am 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.970
 if you are busy and 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.130
 that's ok, that's a historical one 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.350
 Context because this sheet really has 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.480
 exists and actually has the 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.210
 original draxler story from bram 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.520
 stoker inspired makes it in the film 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.620
 Immediately he says relevant at a time and 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.420
 also interesting and makes lukas 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.760
 his thing more than neat as 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.620
 leaf it shows it does not go to the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.090
 complete range of acting 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.400
 but he is definitely convincing 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.140
 as this flath and crazy wise 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.070
 looks a bit like that too 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.500
 Eastern European or opens it up 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.730
 any case meaning to occupy him 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.220
 and make international film 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.110
 Generally one notices clearly here 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.250
 not somehow just gloomy deeper 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.350
 to be told going story 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.450
 but it is also absolutely entertainer 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.610
 blockbuster cinema that's fine too 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.560
 Unfortunately, you forget it anyway 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.240
 sometimes with the character itself 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.190
 a bit further apart 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.470
 Although one understands in the background 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.440
 why he acts and why he acts like that 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.090
 but really close you get the 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.340
 do not act and that too though 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.470
 the later his wife really 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.420
 Angelic really plays like his 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.430
 eleven yes is always running around and then looks 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.470
 always desperate that works out 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.400
 every case good but unfortunately was there 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.290
 then one or the other 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.490
 give away potential and if you look 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.959
 with his characters right 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.180
 You do not get too far apart 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.280
 the right access to the figures and 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.110
 that means the movie is traveling somehow 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.940
 not with and that is a great pity 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.230
 because that also needs a film of only 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.690
 light entertainment needs to be 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.709
 that a lot of fun and 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.180
 to generate voltage 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.820
 this does not work here, unfortunately 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.270
 see settings and quite neat 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.160
 Outsource a bit much 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.450
 Green screen but you realize you have 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.710
 In any case, I have to give what I have 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.510
 do not understand is the castor mini 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.190
 Cooper man notices it himself 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.250
 somehow Persian or from the East 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.330
 but is just on the best of it 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.130
 make the hair a bit more 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.810
 darker a bit quarterly under the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.520
 eyes and suddenly he is the one 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.660
 sultan more with that I always find one 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.870
 Bit weak if I exist 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.850
 also talented in the east of this world 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.470
 Actors why do not you just take 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.730
 someone who can accent 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.770
 Talk makes the thing but only a lot 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.360
 better than if dominic cooper with 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.370
 Accent speaks that is total 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.540
 nonsense I do not understand that and so 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.360
 then i want hollywood 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.460
 a bit braver is what films too 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.890
 occupy is also like now at dies 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.820
 Slowly German as a Russian so 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.570
 nonsense 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.770
 I will like to know from you if you 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.990
 want to see more interviews here the 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.070
 film factory of the teacher giving and hatch 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.240
 Evans met 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.700
 Thieves are the two main actors 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.070
 They were very nice in Berlin 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.810
 can hit soon , yes , yes 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.490
 it's worth asking something 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.560
 also to do and a day in berlin too 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.370
 sacrifice writes like that in 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.930
 the comments 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.400
 my personal rating falls 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.490
 that's why not so strong 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.680
 fill of 10 points are available from never 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.390
 for dracula that's just because of that 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.160
 the movie did not make it me 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.380
 entrain take 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.240
 in another world and just the same 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.400
 Although I praise the historical context 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.800
 but somehow mention it relatively 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.360
 remains irrelevant and irrelevant and 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.420
 just the end I find now 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.620
 but you have to do it yourself 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.880
 decide who have seen the movie 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.230
 write my comments how did you guys 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.510
 fallen because maybe we are 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.770
 different opinion one may indeed 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.690
 his is a free country 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.090
 who would rather see something else 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.040
 Maybe check it down here 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.840
 a review is currently in progress 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.600
 He likes to look fresh in the cinemas 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.920
 pure as you like or you have 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.870

 points to the point in the cinema is still there 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.230
 more than sekt speed and then we see 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.450
 happy to be back at a new cinema 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.860
 criticism film criticism here the film factory 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.510
