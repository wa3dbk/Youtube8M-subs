00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
here on the action for us but on the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
here on the action for us but on the
older<00:00:30.599> iPhone<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.710> bit<00:00:31.800> different

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
older iPhone it's a little bit different

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.889 
older iPhone it's a little bit different
but<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.820> you're<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> go<00:00:33.239> over<00:00:33.270> them<00:00:33.630> here

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
but if you're going to go over them here

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.500 
but if you're going to go over them here
a<00:00:34.079> status<00:00:34.649> bar<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.520> lock<00:00:35.880> screen<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
a status bar on the lock screen is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
a status bar on the lock screen is
larger<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.500> see<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.370> normal

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
larger so you can see here the normal

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.080 
larger so you can see here the normal
size<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.300> then<00:00:40.079> when<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.559> lock<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.250> device

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.700 

you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.539> way<00:00:45.690> bigger<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.379> terms<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you can see it's way bigger in terms of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
you can see it's way bigger in terms of
size<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.399> won't<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.789> lock<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:49.020> can

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
size and then won't get lock it we can

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
size and then won't get lock it we can
see<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.770> goes<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.309> bit<00:00:50.520> smaller

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
see that it goes a little bit smaller

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.990 
see that it goes a little bit smaller
again<00:00:51.739> also<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> folders<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> little<00:00:53.910> bit

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
again also the folders is a little bit

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
again also the folders is a little bit
more<00:00:54.180> transparent<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.829> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
more transparent right now so when you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.189 
more transparent right now so when you
create<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> folder<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
create the folder you can see it's a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
create the folder you can see it's a
little<00:00:58.379> bit<00:00:58.469> more<00:00:58.649> transparency<00:00:59.219> there<00:00:59.489> that

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
little bit more transparency there that

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.500 
little bit more transparency there that
you<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.210> through<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.730> continue

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you can see through and if we continue

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.780 
you can see through and if we continue
on<00:01:03.690> also<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.350> UI<00:01:04.619> tweaks<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.640> the

here<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.500> using<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> could<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.630> good

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
here that you're using so could be good

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.609 
here that you're using so could be good
to<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.759> also<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.840> Y

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
to know there and then also if Y

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.889 
to know there and then also if Y
continue<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.939> calculator<00:02:03.509> should

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
continue on here the calculator should

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.230 
continue on here the calculator should
be<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.290> bit<00:02:04.439> different<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:06.210> way

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
be a little bit different in the way

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.640 
be a little bit different in the way
behaves<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
behaves so

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.300 
behaves so
will<00:02:07.920> bring<00:02:08.100> up<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.250> calculator<00:02:08.880> over<00:02:09.149> here

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
will bring up the calculator over here

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.110 
will bring up the calculator over here
it<00:02:11.310> could<00:02:11.940> look<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.720> little<00:02:12.870> bit<00:02:13.050> different<00:02:13.470> and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
it could look a little bit different and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.670 
it could look a little bit different and
then<00:02:15.120> also<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:16.410> terms<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:17.120> messages<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.680> when

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
then also in terms of messages and when

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.380 
then also in terms of messages and when
you're<00:02:19.950> going<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.400> text<00:02:20.580> your<00:02:20.820> friends<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you're going to text your friends and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.120 
you're going to text your friends and
stuff<00:02:23.690> they<00:02:24.690> could<00:02:25.020> be<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.650> could<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:26.100> a

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
stuff they could be it could be a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.370 
stuff they could be it could be a
possibility<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.690> will<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.110> little

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
possibility that you will get a little

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.550 
possibility that you will get a little
bit<00:02:28.470> more<00:02:28.620> space<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.330> compared<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.630> before

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
bit more space here compared to before

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.370 
bit more space here compared to before
but<00:02:32.430> I'm<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.820> very<00:02:32.940> sure<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.200> real

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
but I'm not very sure that is a real

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.180 
but I'm not very sure that is a real
update<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:36.090> wallpaper<00:02:36.570> section<00:02:37.470> also<00:02:37.710> has<00:02:38.160> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
update the wallpaper section also has a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.610 
update the wallpaper section also has a
little<00:02:38.490> bit<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.910> UI<00:02:39.180> tweak<00:02:39.660> remember<00:02:40.500> that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
little bit of a UI tweak remember that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.740 
little bit of a UI tweak remember that
this<00:02:40.740> update<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.130> mostly<00:02:41.820> like<00:02:42.120> bug<00:02:42.330> fixes<00:02:42.720> and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750

this update is mostly like bug fixes and
stuff<00:02:43.050> as<00:02:43.170> such<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.950> then<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.640> also<00:02:44.760> do<00:02:44.910> have

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
stuff as such but then we also do have
