00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
bothered you never bother me just flared

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.039 
bothered you never bother me just flared
up<00:01:38.790> bro<00:01:39.360> time<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> freshman<00:01:40.560> years<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
up bro time to the freshman years and

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.420 
up bro time to the freshman years and
surgery<00:01:43.049> okay<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> thought<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.130> had<00:01:44.310> been

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
surgery okay I thought there had been

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.190 
surgery okay I thought there had been
some<00:01:44.610> lingering<00:01:44.939> issue<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.720> came

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
some lingering issue but it just came

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
some lingering issue but it just came
out<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.409> nowhere<00:01:46.759> yeah<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.659> guess<00:01:48.990> our<00:01:49.409> when

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
out of nowhere yeah and I guess our when

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.240 
out of nowhere yeah and I guess our when
it<00:01:50.340> happened<00:01:50.790> did<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.619> did<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it happened did we kind of just did the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.190 
it happened did we kind of just did the
surgery<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> only<00:01:54.090> option<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.840> suppose

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
surgery was the only option as I suppose

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.109 
surgery was the only option as I suppose
or<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.189> could<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.790> also<00:01:57.000> just

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
or was the could you have also just

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.780 
or was the could you have also just
chosen<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.600> rest<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.049> or<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.560> will<00:01:59.280> surge<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.670> was

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
chosen to rest it or I will surge it was

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.289 
chosen to rest it or I will surge it was
only<00:01:59.969> option<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:01.219> correct<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.820> terms<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
only option to correct it in terms of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.510 
only option to correct it in terms of
putting<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> bone<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:03.990> together<00:02:04.520> but

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
putting the bone back together but

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
putting the bone back together but
otherwise<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.450> was<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> go<00:02:07.079> back

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
otherwise it was not going to go back

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.940 
otherwise it was not going to go back
together

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
together

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.889 
together
um<00:02:09.129> I<00:02:09.520> mean<00:02:10.119> at<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.300> point<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.660> growing

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
um I mean at this point is growing

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.479 
um I mean at this point is growing
really<00:02:11.020> well<00:02:11.170> healing<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:11.709> well<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.220> I

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
really well healing really well so I

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.850 
really well healing really well so I
mean<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.269> surgery<00:02:13.629> was<00:02:13.810> was<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.500> best<00:02:14.680> around

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
mean the surgery was was the best around

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.890 
mean the surgery was was the best around
so<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.519> bone<00:02:15.700> had<00:02:15.940> sort<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.269> been<00:02:16.330> he<00:02:16.629> played

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
so the bone had sort of been he played

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.990 
so the bone had sort of been he played
with<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.230> bone<00:02:17.410> kind<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.830> out<00:02:18.099> of<00:02:18.160> place<00:02:18.640> for

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
with the bone kind of out of place for

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.240 
with the bone kind of out of place for
like<00:02:19.450> your<00:02:19.629> whole<00:02:19.690> life<00:02:19.989> for<00:02:20.290> ya<00:02:20.530> okay<00:02:20.950> i<00:02:20.980> guess
