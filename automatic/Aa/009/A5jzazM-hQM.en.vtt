00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.760
 what's up this is another tutorial I'll try 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.250
 to talk a little louder about what 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.130
 normal to see if they hear me because 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.760
 we almost do not hear the latest videos 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.120
 what have i done 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.720
 and well, let's start the tutorial 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.840
 today is how to make a culverin a 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.650
 kite and well, as we had already done 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.390
 the sun and the culebrina is easier 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.550
 they had been asking me to 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.610
 did the culverin for this only 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.010
 you need three rods and not like the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.809
 another one that needs four and over here 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.870
 the little corner of work out there I'm going to 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.970
 be leaving the link of the previous video 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.760
 where it's like making a sun in this 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.629
 then it's going to be a hill 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.500
 we will begin by measuring two rods 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.140
 two that remain in the same 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.270
 the same measurements and the third one is going 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.040
 to cut a bit I cut him a 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.890
 piece there are other people who do not 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.180
 cut pieces 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.830
 but good the taste of each one 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.880
 I like to cut the piece so it does not 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.530
 it looks so round and so 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.950
 a little more this 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.320
 longer 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.750
 a little bit like this is the way it's going to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.110
 stay and well then we start 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.110
 roll up 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.170
 going 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.970
 from here up 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.970
 down we split it in half 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.500
 after half of class 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.870
 which we are going to use 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.640
 we get the measure if they have a rule 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.730
 It may not be a rule, but because 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.920
 yes 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.840
 and here is half then here in the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.320
 half with what this is 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.800
 a few laps to ensure 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800
 there is 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.690
 and now we take off the sheet 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.980
 good that it does not move much 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.000
 there we are 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.000
 in this video it will not be edited 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.370
 it's usual 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.370
 tell me that I do not have 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.209
 if you are to continue making these 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.209
 videos 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:58.160
 remember that the thread to do it 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.880
 the base shape is with thin thread 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.880
 it also seems 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.920
 English 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.190
 and well this form is very easy once 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.290
 already they did this and nothing else is 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.050
 put the other rod that we cut him 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.790
 we cut a piece 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.650
 also calculating that is 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.260
 exactly in the middle 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.260
 and already once 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.400
 they believe that it is already there exactly already 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.100
 turn around with the thread for you 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.610
 moored 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.610
 barillas 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.830
 these rods get them in 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.830
 stationery here in mexico stationery 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:53.140
 school children 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.140
 I do not know the name of these rods but 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.700
 jobs that are occupied in school and 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.730
 before sales 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.150
 or they can make them this homemade too 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.150
 It can 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.819
 with the materials 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.750
 that is the way of l'aquila 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.780
 is limited to touching 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.000
 well here it is known as texas is not 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.000
 know you met scientist over there 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.070
 once we have just turned it around 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.509
 because the same thing is rolled in one of these 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.509
 rods whatever 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.220
 and now if that form 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.220
 base 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.820
 in a low spiral way around here 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.820
 at one time 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.420
 I will follow the circumference 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.430
 the culverin 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.350
 to another 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.700
 and if you want to reinforce it with give 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.170
 again another pass 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.170
 they go over there too 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.750
 and that would be all right now I'm going to do 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.610
 another video where the forms are shown 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.490
 that can be given as much as 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.490
 culebrinas with parasols for both 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.460
 it's under the same 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.780
 exists that can be applied to 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.860
 both do not 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.860
 then there is 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.490
 this is the culverin 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.139
 it's a little cooler and today 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.320
 we arrange with mud 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.830
 the ways but good that's all 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.830
 bye
