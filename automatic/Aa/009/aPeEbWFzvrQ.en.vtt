00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
you see the ceiling around on Terry

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.310 
you see the ceiling around on Terry
house<00:01:20.300> car<00:01:20.540> soon<00:01:20.780> as<00:01:20.840> he<00:01:20.900> hit<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.050> throttle

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
house car soon as he hit the throttle

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.170 
house car soon as he hit the throttle
and<00:01:21.470> what<00:01:21.680> happens<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.340> really<00:01:22.910> starts

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
and what happens is that really starts

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.550 
and what happens is that really starts
mixing<00:01:23.390> up<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.690> cylinders<00:01:24.140> because<00:01:24.410> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
mixing up the cylinders because the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.550 
mixing up the cylinders because the
boost<00:01:24.800> goes<00:01:25.100> up<00:01:25.720> into<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.870> other<00:01:27.080> cylinders

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
boost goes up into the other cylinders

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.230 
boost goes up into the other cylinders
makes<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.830> other<00:01:27.920> cylinders<00:01:28.400> lean<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.880> then

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
makes the other cylinders lean and then

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.790 
makes the other cylinders lean and then
the<00:01:29.360> engines<00:01:29.660> not<00:01:29.720> happy<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.440> as<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.590> result

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
the engines not happy and as a result

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.609 
the engines not happy and as a result
from<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.420> get<00:01:32.570> this<00:01:32.690> big<00:01:32.930> explosion

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
from that you get this big explosion

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.030 
from that you get this big explosion
