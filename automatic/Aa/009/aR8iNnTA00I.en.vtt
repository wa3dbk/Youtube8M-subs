I<00:00:08.550> really<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.990> don't<00:00:10.349> have<00:00:10.860> any<00:00:11.160> real<00:00:13.370> knowledge

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
I really I don't have any real knowledge

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.590 
I really I don't have any real knowledge
of<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.590> immediately<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.699> but

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600

before<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:21.289> so<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.439> would<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.800> my<00:00:22.980> fourth

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
and

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.979 
and
or<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:39.010> little<00:00:39.340> way<00:00:39.489> off<00:00:39.730> in<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.120> NFL<00:00:40.720> you<00:00:40.960> know

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
or a little way off in the NFL you know

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.260 
or a little way off in the NFL you know
until<00:00:41.260> these<00:00:41.410> games<00:00:41.710> start

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
until these games start

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.660 
until these games start
there's<00:00:43.480> not<00:00:43.630> a<00:00:44.020> lot<00:00:44.350> of<00:00:44.620> people<00:00:45.040> suffering<00:00:45.520> a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
there's not a lot of people suffering a

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.770 
there's not a lot of people suffering a
lot<00:00:45.880> so<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:48.190> all<00:00:48.460> football<00:00:48.730> fans<00:00:48.940> I'm<00:00:49.420> hoping

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
lot so like all football fans I'm hoping

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.840 
lot so like all football fans I'm hoping
it<00:00:49.930> gets<00:00:50.050> resolved<00:00:50.740> and<00:00:50.920> I'd<00:00:51.010> be<00:00:51.220> saddened<00:00:51.700> by

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
it gets resolved and I'd be saddened by

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.340 
it gets resolved and I'd be saddened by
the<00:00:51.910> fact<00:00:52.060> that<00:00:52.450> there<00:00:52.810> was<00:00:53.020> any<00:00:53.770> football

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.650 

somehow<00:00:57.070> I'm<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.370> little<00:00:57.700> optimistic<00:00:58.150> I<00:00:58.450> think

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
somehow I'm a little optimistic I think

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.780 
somehow I'm a little optimistic I think
sometimes<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.320> might<00:01:00.070> not<00:01:00.250> be<00:01:00.460> without<00:01:00.640> a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
sometimes it might not be without a

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.979 
sometimes it might not be without a
little<00:01:01.060> blood<00:01:01.990> but<00:01:02.980> I<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:04.000> think<00:01:04.630> it'll<00:01:04.750> get

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
little blood but I I think it'll get

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.150 
little blood but I I think it'll get
reasonable<00:01:05.440> you<00:01:05.500> think<00:01:05.680> they'll<00:01:05.830> miss<00:01:05.950> any

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
reasonable you think they'll miss any

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.220 
reasonable you think they'll miss any
games<00:01:06.400> next<00:01:06.730> season<00:01:06.850> because<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.540> well<00:01:07.960> you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
games next season because of it well you

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.710 
games next season because of it well you
know<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.670> would<00:01:09.940> say<00:01:10.120> would<00:01:10.300> just<00:01:10.540> be<00:01:10.690> a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
know what I would say would just be a

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.740 
know what I would say would just be a
guess<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.910> would<00:01:12.910> certainly<00:01:13.060> hope<00:01:13.390> not

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
guess I would certainly hope not

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.160 
guess I would certainly hope not
and<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:15.040> think<00:01:15.310> probably<00:01:15.580> because<00:01:16.270> nobody's

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and I think probably because nobody's

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.140 
and I think probably because nobody's
happy<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.950> owners<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.460> players<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.970> fans

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
happy the owners the players the fans

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.270 
happy the owners the players the fans
the<00:01:19.540> advertisers<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.440> TV<00:01:20.770> people

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
the advertisers the TV people

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.430 
the advertisers the TV people
nobody's<00:01:21.880> happy<00:01:22.240> if<00:01:22.330> they<00:01:22.479> miss<00:01:22.660> games<00:01:22.900> so<00:01:23.200> I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
nobody's happy if they miss games so I

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.860 
nobody's happy if they miss games so I
would<00:01:24.280> be<00:01:24.430> very<00:01:24.460> hopeful<00:01:25.150> that<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.540> didn't

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
would be very hopeful that that didn't

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.530 
would be very hopeful that that didn't
and<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:26.979> know<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.370> see<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.729> on<00:01:27.970> many

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
and you know you see that on many

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.940 
and you know you see that on many
different<00:01:28.780> levels<00:01:28.990> from<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.740> know<00:01:29.800> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
different levels from the you know the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.290 
different levels from the you know the
players<00:01:30.190> all<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.610> way<00:01:30.700> up<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.940> kind<00:01:31.119> of<00:01:31.210> the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
players all the way up to kind of the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.150 
players all the way up to kind of the
ownership<00:01:31.570> level<00:01:32.080> but<00:01:32.200> talk<00:01:32.350> about<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:33.040> know

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
ownership level but talk about you know

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.340 
ownership level but talk about you know
talks<00:01:33.430> really<00:01:33.670> about<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.600> players<00:01:34.930> versus

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
talks really about the players versus

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.990 
talks really about the players versus
the<00:01:35.440> ownership<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:36.130> really<00:01:36.400> what<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:36.670> sounds

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
the ownership is really what it sounds

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.370 
the ownership is really what it sounds
like<00:01:37.060> but<00:01:37.330> talk<00:01:37.509> about<00:01:37.540> how<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:37.960> affects<00:01:38.229> the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
like but talk about how it affects the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.550 
like but talk about how it affects the
coaching<00:01:38.770> staff<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.750> think<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.170> coaching

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
coaching staff well I think the coaching

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.490 
coaching staff well I think the coaching
staff<00:01:41.800> has<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.220> do<00:01:42.369> its<00:01:42.550> best<00:01:42.790> to<00:01:42.970> remain<00:01:43.500> even

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
staff has to do its best to remain even

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.350 
staff has to do its best to remain even
though<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.860> coach<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.310> part<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.729> management

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
though the coach is part of management

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.680 
though the coach is part of management
he<00:01:46.990> has<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.560> remain<00:01:47.890> neutral<00:01:48.190> in<00:01:48.759> in<00:01:49.390> those

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
he has to remain neutral in in those

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.190 
he has to remain neutral in in those
kind<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.970> negotiations<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.180> can't<00:01:52.509> align

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
kind of negotiations you can't align

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.680 
kind of negotiations you can't align
yourself<00:01:53.710> because<00:01:54.160> you<00:01:54.880> have<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.300> deal<00:01:55.450> with

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
yourself because you have to deal with

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.810
