the fall approaches the weather is
getting<00:00:18.510> colder<00:00:18.710> which<00:00:19.710> means<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> air<00:00:20.130> is

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
getting colder which means the air is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
getting colder which means the air is
getting<00:00:20.430> drier<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:20.880> also<00:00:21.810> our<00:00:21.840> skin<00:00:22.260> is
