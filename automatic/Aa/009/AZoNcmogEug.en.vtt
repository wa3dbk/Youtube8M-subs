hi<00:00:02.280> guys<00:00:02.520> now<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.840> are<00:00:03.870> all<00:00:04.200> pros<00:00:04.950> at

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
hi guys now that you are all pros at

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.460 
hi guys now that you are all pros at
using<00:00:05.940> dichotomous<00:00:06.690> keys<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.259> key<00:00:07.440> out

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
using dichotomous keys to key out

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.410 
using dichotomous keys to key out
organisms<00:00:08.220> now<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.940> focus<00:00:09.300> on

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
organisms now we're going to focus on

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.690 
organisms now we're going to focus on
making<00:00:09.800> dichotomous<00:00:10.800> keys<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:11.519> that's

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
making dichotomous keys and so that's

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220 
making dichotomous keys and so that's
what<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:11.969> video<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.330> about<00:00:12.540> how<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.960> make<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
what this video is about how to make a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.010 
what this video is about how to make a
looking<00:00:14.160> back<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.759> six<00:00:15.089> pairs<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.870> shoes

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
looking back we have six pairs of shoes

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.099 
looking back we have six pairs of shoes
right<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:17.150> dichotomous<00:00:18.150> key<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.420> always<00:00:18.720> going

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
right a dichotomous key is always going

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.980 
right a dichotomous key is always going
to<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:20.010> fewer<00:00:20.760> steps<00:00:21.240> than<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:21.960> are

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
to have one fewer steps than there are

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.070 
to have one fewer steps than there are
items<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.400> there's<00:00:23.730> five<00:00:24.029> steps<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.720> our<00:00:24.869> key

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
items so there's five steps in our key

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
items so there's five steps in our key
because<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.619> six<00:00:25.890> items<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.789> however

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
because we have six items so however

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.179 
because we have six items so however
many<00:00:27.720> items<00:00:28.140> you're<00:00:28.320> including<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.859> your<00:00:28.980> key

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
many items you're including in your key

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.370 
many items you're including in your key
you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.910> go<00:00:30.090> ahead<00:00:30.359> right<00:00:30.570> off<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.900> bat<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you can go ahead right off the bat and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.130 
you can go ahead right off the bat and
set<00:00:32.099> up<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.700> steps<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.149> need<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.930> just

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
set up all the steps you need you just

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.260 
set up all the steps you need you just
see<00:00:34.290> how<00:00:34.440> many<00:00:34.500> items<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
see how many items you have that you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.900 
see how many items you have that you
want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> key<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:38.280> fewer<00:00:38.610> steps

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
want to key out and do one fewer steps

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.020 
want to key out and do one fewer steps
than<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.600> since<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.030> dichotomous

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
than that and since it's a dichotomous

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.090 
than that and since it's a dichotomous
key<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.600> means<00:00:42.780> there's<00:00:43.230> two<00:00:43.290> choices<00:00:43.649> at

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
key that means there's two choices at

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
key that means there's two choices at
each<00:00:44.219> step<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.570> each<00:00:45.690> step<00:00:45.930> you're<00:00:46.110> going

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
each step so for each step you're going

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.040 
each step so for each step you're going
to<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.410> an<00:00:46.530> A<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.280> B<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.670> B<00:00:48.329> maybe<00:00:48.719> maybe

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
to have an A and a B a B maybe maybe

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380 
to have an A and a B a B maybe maybe
maybe<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.250> six<00:00:50.489> pairs<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.789> shoes<00:00:50.940> five

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
maybe so we have six pairs of shoes five

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.850 
maybe so we have six pairs of shoes five
steps<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.410> B<00:00:52.559> option<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.100> each<00:00:54.590> next<00:00:55.590> step

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
steps and a B option at each next step

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.880 
steps and a B option at each next step
is<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.489> separate<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.600> items<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.680> two

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
is to separate all the items into two

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.229 
is to separate all the items into two
groups<00:01:00.020> for<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.250> first<00:01:02.250> step<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.059> key

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
groups for that first step of the key

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.910 
groups for that first step of the key
and<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:05.489> look<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.939> our<00:01:06.090> shoes<00:01:06.920> there's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and so if we look at our shoes there's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.480 
and so if we look at our shoes there's
our<00:01:08.159> six<00:01:08.310> pairs<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> shoes<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.920> chose<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
our six pairs of shoes and I chose to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.760 
our six pairs of shoes and I chose to
divide<00:01:12.030> them<00:01:12.270> by<00:01:12.479> having<00:01:12.750> heels<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.560> not

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
divide them by having heels and not

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.030 
divide them by having heels and not
having<00:01:14.010> heels<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:14.700> high<00:01:14.850> heels<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.950> can

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
having heels or high heels so you can

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.130 
having heels or high heels so you can
see<00:01:17.250> there's<00:01:17.460> two<00:01:17.790> pairs<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.960> high

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
see there's two pairs they have high

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.359 
see there's two pairs they have high
heels<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.920> rest<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.400> flat<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:22.100> those<00:01:23.100> are<00:01:23.280> our

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
heels the rest are flat so those are our

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.910 
heels the rest are flat so those are our
two<00:01:23.400> groups<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.900> after<00:01:25.560> you've<00:01:25.740> done

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
two groups and then after you've done

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.300 
two groups and then after you've done
that<00:01:26.570> you're<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.950> first<00:01:28.950> step<00:01:29.130> for

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that you're going to first step for

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.370 
that you're going to first step for
follow<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.970> first<00:01:30.270> option<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.290> way

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
follow the first option all the way

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.609 
follow the first option all the way
through<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.490> mean<00:01:32.759> by<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.619> you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
through and what I mean by that is you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
through and what I mean by that is you
take<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.890> first<00:01:35.310> option<00:01:35.640> shoe<00:01:36.060> has<00:01:36.360> high

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
take that first option shoe has high

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.999 
take that first option shoe has high
heels<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:38.610> tell<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.320> key<00:01:40.320> router<00:01:40.560> where

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
heels and you tell the key router where

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.760 
heels and you tell the key router where
to<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.280> next<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.990> logical<00:01:42.990> step<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
to go next so logical step is to go to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.840 
to go next so logical step is to go to
the<00:01:43.920> next<00:01:44.070> step<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> step<00:01:44.850> two<00:01:45.060> okay<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.320> now

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
the next step go to step two okay so now

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.210 
the next step go to step two okay so now
we<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.299> those<00:01:48.899> two<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.350> did<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.860> high

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
we take the those two that did have high

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.020 
we take the those two that did have high
heels<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.630> tell<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> key<00:01:52.950> router<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
heels and we tell the key router what to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.840 
heels and we tell the key router what to
do<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.329> though<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> first<00:01:55.200> option<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.890> has

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
do it though so the first option is has

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.999 
do it though so the first option is has
red<00:01:57.360> soles<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:57.990> want<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> take<00:01:58.500> those<00:01:58.740> two

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
red soles so we want to take those two

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.770 
red soles so we want to take those two
that<00:01:59.189> did<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.579> high<00:01:59.790> heels<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.479> figure<00:02:00.750> out

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that did have high heels and figure out

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.289 
that did have high heels and figure out
well<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.380> separates<00:02:01.890> them<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.640> could<00:02:02.880> pick

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
well what separates them you could pick

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.450 
well what separates them you could pick
the<00:02:03.329> color<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> shoe<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.860> could<00:02:05.250> pick<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the color of the shoe you could pick the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.600 
the color of the shoe you could pick the
fact<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> solid<00:02:06.479> heel<00:02:06.930> that's<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
fact that this is a solid heel that's a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.660 
fact that this is a solid heel that's a
like<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> stiletto<00:02:09.149> heel<00:02:09.569> there's<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.670> under

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
like a stiletto heel there's the under

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
like a stiletto heel there's the under
of<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
of the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.559 
of the
you<00:02:13.590> color<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.010> sole<00:02:14.220> color<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.360> one

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you color the sole color so this one

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.530 
you color the sole color so this one
says<00:02:16.080> shoe<00:02:16.350> has<00:02:16.560> red<00:02:16.860> soles<00:02:17.190> those<00:02:18.180> are<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
says shoe has red soles those are the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.960 
says shoe has red soles those are the
Christian<00:02:19.170> Louboutin<00:02:19.680> stilettos<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.730> then

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
Christian Louboutin stilettos and then

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.300 
Christian Louboutin stilettos and then
the<00:02:21.420> shoe<00:02:21.690> has<00:02:21.930> solid<00:02:22.200> heels<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.860> two<00:02:22.980> straps

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the shoe has solid heels and two straps

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.520 
the shoe has solid heels and two straps
those<00:02:23.730> would<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> wedges<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.959> this

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
those would be the wedges so in this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.570 
those would be the wedges so in this
case<00:02:25.800> we<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.340> needed<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.910> go<00:02:27.290> one<00:02:28.290> step

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
case we just needed to go one step

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.190 
case we just needed to go one step
further<00:02:29.580> from<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.120> first<00:02:30.600> step<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:30.959> had

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
further from that first step we just had

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.470 
further from that first step we just had
to<00:02:31.319> go<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.650> second<00:02:32.010> step<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.459> we<00:02:33.060> keyed

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
to go to the second step and we keyed

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.590 
to go to the second step and we keyed
out<00:02:33.690> all<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.100> shoes<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.030> were<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.360> that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
out all of the shoes that were in that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.520 
out all of the shoes that were in that
one<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:39.000> very<00:02:39.209> first<00:02:39.540> option<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.350> we're

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
one that that very first option so we're

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.979 
one that that very first option so we're
done<00:02:40.800> with<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.190> step<00:02:41.459> now<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:41.880> there<00:02:42.810> were

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
done with that step now if there were

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.190 
done with that step now if there were
three<00:02:44.120> different<00:02:45.120> shoes<00:02:45.330> with<00:02:45.540> high<00:02:45.690> heels<00:02:45.959> we

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
three different shoes with high heels we

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.020 
three different shoes with high heels we
would<00:02:46.380> need<00:02:46.560> an<00:02:46.830> extra<00:02:47.220> step<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.519> we'll<00:02:47.850> see

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
would need an extra step and we'll see

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.240 
would need an extra step and we'll see
that<00:02:48.060> with<00:02:48.420> when<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:49.530> follow<00:02:49.769> through<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
that with when we follow through the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.070 
that with when we follow through the
group<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.610> doesn't<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.150> high<00:02:51.360> heels<00:02:51.570> next

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
group that doesn't have high heels next

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.590 
group that doesn't have high heels next
so<00:02:52.769> first<00:02:53.730> though<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:53.970> take<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.390> first

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
so first though you take the first

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.570 
so first though you take the first
option<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.470> follow<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.130> all<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.370> way

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
option and you follow it all the way

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.090 
option and you follow it all the way
through<00:02:57.170> till<00:02:58.170> you've<00:02:58.380> keyed<00:02:58.650> out<00:02:58.830> all<00:02:59.040> of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
through till you've keyed out all of

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.210 
through till you've keyed out all of
those<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.880> then<00:02:59.910> you're<00:03:00.330> going<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.480> go<00:03:00.690> back

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
those and then you're going to go back

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.120 
those and then you're going to go back
to<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.780> second<00:03:03.780> option<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.650> first<00:03:04.890> step

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
to the second option of the first step

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.340 
to the second option of the first step
so<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.550> go<00:03:05.700> back<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.150> first<00:03:06.360> step<00:03:06.630> now<00:03:07.019> and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
so we go back to the first step now and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.710 
so we go back to the first step now and
follow<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.340> second<00:03:08.760> option<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.150> second

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
follow the second option that second

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.229 
follow the second option that second
option<00:03:10.110> being<00:03:10.319> shoe<00:03:11.280> does<00:03:11.489> not<00:03:11.819> have<00:03:12.060> high

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
option being shoe does not have high

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.720 
option being shoe does not have high
heels<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.319> we<00:03:13.680> already<00:03:13.860> used<00:03:14.190> step<00:03:14.519> two

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
heels and so we already used step two

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.610 
heels and so we already used step two
right<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.300> for<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.750> option<00:03:16.290> we're<00:03:16.440> going<00:03:16.560> to

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
right so for this option we're going to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.780 
right so for this option we're going to
go<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.860> step<00:03:17.190> three

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
go to step three

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.740 
go to step three
and<00:03:18.260> now<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:20.040> again<00:03:20.700> want<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.180> look<00:03:21.360> at<00:03:21.540> all

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
and now you again want to look at all

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.180 
and now you again want to look at all
the<00:03:21.900> ones<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.260> didn't<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.680> heel<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.070> all

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the ones that didn't have heel so all

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.979 
the ones that didn't have heel so all
the<00:03:23.310> flat<00:03:23.519> shoes<00:03:23.820> there's<00:03:24.060> these<00:03:24.299> two<00:03:24.660> in

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
the flat shoes there's these two in

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.069 
the flat shoes there's these two in
these<00:03:25.620> two<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.280> again<00:03:27.239> we<00:03:27.390> want<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> divide

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
these two and again we want to divide

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.770 
these two and again we want to divide
them<00:03:28.290> into<00:03:28.530> two<00:03:29.220> groups<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.630> two

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
them into two groups and so the two

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.960 
them into two groups and so the two
groups<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.230> chose<00:03:31.560> wear<00:03:31.920> has<00:03:32.160> laces<00:03:32.700> because

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
groups I chose wear has laces because

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.120 
groups I chose wear has laces because
these<00:03:33.299> have<00:03:33.510> laces<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.260> these<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.680> laces

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
these have laces and these have laces

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.210 
these have laces and these have laces
and<00:03:35.400> then<00:03:36.120> these<00:03:36.989> two<00:03:37.290> don't<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.590> laces<00:03:38.100> so

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
and then these two don't have laces so

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.009 
and then these two don't have laces so
we<00:03:38.910> take<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:41.090> option<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.450> shoe<00:03:42.660> having

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
we take the option of the shoe having

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.660 
we take the option of the shoe having
laces<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.650> we're<00:03:43.769> going<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:43.950> follow<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.459> all

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
laces and we're going to follow that all

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.920 
laces and we're going to follow that all
the<00:03:44.880> way<00:03:44.970> through<00:03:45.000> till<00:03:45.570> we've<00:03:45.660> keyed

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
the way through till we've keyed

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.500 
the way through till we've keyed
everybody<00:03:46.380> out<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.340> for<00:03:47.910> shoes<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.150> have

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
everybody out so for shoes that have

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.710 
everybody out so for shoes that have
laces<00:03:48.989> we<00:03:49.260> say<00:03:49.470> go<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.920> next<00:03:50.130> step<00:03:50.489> and

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
laces we say go to the next step and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.990 
laces we say go to the next step and
then<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.739> two<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.100> have<00:03:53.340> laces<00:03:53.790> how<00:03:53.940> do

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
then of the two that have laces how do

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.030 
then of the two that have laces how do
we<00:03:54.150> want<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.390> divide<00:03:54.630> those<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.200> said<00:03:55.829> has<00:03:56.010> a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
we want to divide those I said has a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.979 
we want to divide those I said has a
swoosh<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.519> doesn't<00:03:57.090> have<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> swoosh<00:03:57.630> the

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
swoosh and doesn't have a swoosh the

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.470 
swoosh and doesn't have a swoosh the
Nike<00:03:58.590> swoosh<00:03:58.829> there<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.940> one<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.269> has<00:04:00.450> a

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
Nike swoosh there so the one that has a

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.170 
Nike swoosh there so the one that has a
swoosh<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.140> Nike<00:04:01.620> Air<00:04:01.799> Force<00:04:02.040> Ones<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.910> shoe

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
swoosh is a Nike Air Force Ones the shoe

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.210 
swoosh is a Nike Air Force Ones the shoe
that<00:04:03.420> lacks<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:04.019> swoosh<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:04.560> means<00:04:04.739> doesn't

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
that lacks a swoosh that means doesn't

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.039 
that lacks a swoosh that means doesn't
have<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> switch<00:04:05.670> those<00:04:06.390> are<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.720> Sperry

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
have a switch those are the Sperry

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.380 
have a switch those are the Sperry
top-siders

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
top-siders

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.229 
top-siders
so<00:04:09.390> now<00:04:09.690> for<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.109> next<00:04:10.140> step<00:04:10.890> we<00:04:11.730> need<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.090> go

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
so now for the next step we need to go

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.110 
so now for the next step we need to go
back<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:13.019> that<00:04:13.230> we<00:04:13.890> followed<00:04:14.579> through<00:04:14.820> the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
back to that we followed through the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.569 
back to that we followed through the
shoes<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.570> had<00:04:15.780> laces<00:04:16.289> so<00:04:16.979> now<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.430> to

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
shoes that had laces so now we have to

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.430 
shoes that had laces so now we have to
talk<00:04:17.729> about<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.180> shoes<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.660> do<00:04:18.840> not<00:04:19.109> have

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
talk about the shoes that do not have

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.330 
talk about the shoes that do not have
laces<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:21.780> then<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.530> only<00:04:22.710> step<00:04:23.070> we<00:04:23.190> have

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
laces and so then the only step we have

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.480 
laces and so then the only step we have
open<00:04:23.669> down<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:24.360> fill<00:04:24.539> in<00:04:24.690> is<00:04:24.870> step<00:04:25.140> 5<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:25.919> we<00:04:26.250> say

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
open down to fill in is step 5 so we say

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.960 
open down to fill in is step 5 so we say
the<00:04:26.729> one

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
the one

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.910 
the one
that<00:04:27.150> don't<00:04:27.510> have<00:04:27.720> laces<00:04:28.110> go<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.350> step<00:04:28.680> five

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
that don't have laces go to step five

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.000 
that don't have laces go to step five
and<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:30.270> we<00:04:30.420> have<00:04:30.660> these<00:04:31.170> shoes<00:04:31.620> in<00:04:31.830> these

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
and so we have these shoes in these

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.390 
and so we have these shoes in these
shoes<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.310> are<00:04:32.870> flat<00:04:33.870> bottom<00:04:34.470> don't<00:04:35.130> have

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
shoes that are flat bottom don't have

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.330 
shoes that are flat bottom don't have
laces<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.870> way<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.340> separated

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
laces and so the way that I separated

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.270 
laces and so the way that I separated
them<00:04:38.550> was<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.450> height<00:04:39.690> so<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.320> said<00:04:40.950> shoes

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
them was the the height so I said shoes

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.550 
them was the the height so I said shoes
it<00:04:41.460> our<00:04:41.580> calf<00:04:41.850> high<00:04:42.150> those<00:04:42.930> are<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.290> ugg<00:04:43.530> boots

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
it our calf high those are the ugg boots

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.800 
it our calf high those are the ugg boots
and<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.580> ones<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:44.850> are<00:04:45.030> low<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.540> do<00:04:45.630> not

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
and the ones that are low and do not

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.190 
and the ones that are low and do not
reach<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.710> ankle<00:04:47.070> those<00:04:47.310> are<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.640> Tom's<00:04:48.200> so

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
reach the ankle those are the Tom's so

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.040 
reach the ankle those are the Tom's so
now<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:49.410> see<00:04:49.800> here<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.130> we<00:04:50.310> have<00:04:50.870> keyed<00:04:51.870> out

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
now you see here that we have keyed out

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.450 
now you see here that we have keyed out
all<00:04:52.350> six<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.280> our<00:04:53.430> shoes<00:04:54.770> using<00:04:55.770> five

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
all six of our shoes using five

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.740 
all six of our shoes using five
different<00:04:57.030> steps<00:04:58.520> two<00:04:59.520> options<00:05:00.120> at<00:05:00.300> each<00:05:00.420> step

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
different steps two options at each step

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.320 
different steps two options at each step
and<00:05:01.490> remember<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.610> important<00:05:03.030> thing<00:05:03.180> to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
and remember the important thing to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.450 
and remember the important thing to
making<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.750> key<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.260> that<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:07.560> follow<00:05:07.950> through

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
making a key is that you follow through

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.690 
making a key is that you follow through
your<00:05:09.030> first<00:05:09.390> option<00:05:09.750> each<00:05:10.170> time<00:05:10.470> so<00:05:10.740> when<00:05:11.610> you

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
your first option each time so when you

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.920 
your first option each time so when you
separate<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.210> separate<00:05:12.600> them<00:05:12.690> into<00:05:12.840> two

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
separate you separate them into two

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.140 
separate you separate them into two
groups<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.560> follow<00:05:13.920> through<00:05:14.400> your<00:05:14.880> first

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
groups and follow through your first

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.760 
groups and follow through your first
option<00:05:15.720> all<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.140> way<00:05:16.230> through<00:05:16.440> till<00:05:16.620> you've

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
option all the way through till you've

option all the way through till you've
keyed<00:05:16.980> out<00:05:17.160> all<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.580> ones<00:05:17.730> that<00:05:18.060> apply<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.050> the

keyed out all the ones that apply to the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.620 
keyed out all the ones that apply to the
first<00:05:19.500> option<00:05:19.919> then<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.220> go<00:05:20.370> back<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:20.850> you

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.200 
little unclear on how exactly to do this
you<00:05:34.980> might<00:05:35.190> have<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.520> go<00:05:35.640> back<00:05:35.820> and<00:05:36.060> watch

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
you might have to go back and watch

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.450 
you might have to go back and watch
again<00:05:36.480> it<00:05:36.930> might<00:05:37.260> be<00:05:37.320> helpful<00:05:37.620> helpful<00:05:38.310> to
