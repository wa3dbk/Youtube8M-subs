00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 if you were interested in biology classes 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.210
 in primary or secondary school or in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.550
 preparatory insurance have you ever been 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.410
 asked how the vesicles move 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.259
 within a cell and what is more 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.120
 interesting how do they know where to go since 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.130
 according to the drawings of the books of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.710
 text seems to float inside the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.539
 cell and so they went to their destination good in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.240
 I will explain this video in a rough way 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.099
 how is it that this happens but first they 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.289
 I will explain something that is essential to know 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 to understand the movement of the tails 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.059
 and even organelles inside the cell 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.530
 it's about the cytoskeleton the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.600
 cytoskeleton is made up of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.180
 microtubules micro filaments and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 intermediate filaments microtubules 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.200
 they are very hollow cylindrical structures 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.360
 small formed by 13 proto 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.940
 filaments composed of subunits of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.100
 a protein called tubulin this to its 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 it is divided into tubulin alpha and beta 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 the microtubules originate from the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.399
 centrosome place from which it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.649
 polymerizes the tubulin subunits 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.469
 from his side - to his side more to 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.510
 form the microtubules the microtubules 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.909
 they give structural stability to the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.960
 cell form a scaffolding help 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.119
 keep the organs 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 instead they form the mitotic spindle and 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.659
 form a kind of rails for 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 vesicular movement among others 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.760
 functions the microfilaments are other 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.100
 structures much thinner than 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.740
 microtubules but equally important 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.930
 these are made up of subunits of 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.670
 a protein called actin their 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 functions are to constrain the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.110
 cell in mitosis give movement to 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.000
 the cell for example the filaments of 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 actin or microfilaments with 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140
 help of another protein called myosin 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.539
 they perform muscle contraction this 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.179
 only with presence of calcium but that already 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.280
 it is more complicated also thanks to the 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.410
 microfilaments the cell performs the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 phagocytosis and those that interest us 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.759
 It also serves as rails for 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.420
 vesicular movement among others 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.920
 functions and finally the filaments 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.990
 intermediate the assembly of the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.149
 intermediate filaments is done in 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.310
 four steps first one forms a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.170
 monomer of various globular domains 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.229
 with a mino side and a car box and what 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.000
 second join two monomers that can 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.820
 be identical or not according to the type of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.560
 intermediate filament two two 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.720
 first join to form a 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.180
 but which is considered the subunit 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.190
 structural of the filaments 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.020
 intermediate between the functions of these 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.450
 they find themselves providing strength 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.120
 mechanics in cells like epithelial 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.830
 the cardiac or nervous ones help to give 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.930
 thickness to the axons and are part 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
 important of adherent unions like 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.800
 emirs moss or more since they have the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.810
 ability to bind to other proteins 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.610
 as well as other structures of the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.340
 cytoskeleton like the ones we've already seen 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.810
 so far no protein is known 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.540
 that moves on filaments 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.090
 intermediate good now that we already know 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.890
 the cytoskeleton we can already respond to 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.110
 the questions we had asked ourselves 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.700
 principle as we saw only the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.190
 microtubules and microfilaments 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 they act as rails on the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.750
 microtubules act two proteins 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.690
 different divine ones and the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.060
 related and nash the dynes are proteins 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.010
 with a pair of globular heads that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.049
 they move retrograde that is to say 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.690
 towards the centrosome or how is it 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.670
 from more to less among its functions of 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.799
 this protein is the position of the spindle 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.049
 mitotic instead the movement of 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.250
 the chromosomes locate the apparatus of 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.890
 golgi the mobile 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.810
 of organeros in two or more lysosomes and 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.960
 vesicles for example the reticulum 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.270
 rough endoplasmic golf and movies 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.640
 Chinese are lighter than the dyne 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.840
 they have a pair of globular heads more 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.390
 small and move so 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.310
 antegrade that is from the centrosome to 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.920
 the ends of the cell or what is it 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.510
 same from less to more and like the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.850
 dynas serve for the movement 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.160
 vesicular also help the ex oz and 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.440
 ptosis to the movement of organelles between 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.510
 other functions for example a type of 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.640
 cinema is unable to move because 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.470
 by sticking to the microtubules causes its 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.600
 polymerization in the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.090
 microfilaments a protein is recognized 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.520
 motorboat called myosin which is divided 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.739
 in conventional or myosin type 2 which 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.510
 is found in muscle cells and 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.610
 helps the contraction of the same and 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.950
 the unconventional myosin that splits 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.560
 in at least 17 types for example the 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.239
 myosin type 5 with two heads involved 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.900
 in transporting organelles and 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.459
 vesicles as well as myosin 1 and 6 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.320
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.780
 video and the most important thing that they have 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.790
 learned something this is an explanation 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.850
 very simple of what the quote is 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.310
 the motor proteins is actually 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.770
 much more complicated if they want to know 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.450
 more of this I recommend you go 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.400
 to a cell biology book and 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.170
 molecular like the cap that is the one 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.080
 I've been in college or any other 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.060
 already know put thumb up comment 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.100
 If you have any doubt suggestion 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.290
 correction or for the simple sake of 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.090
 comment and even some topic that 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.580
 they want me to talk and subscribe for 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.580
 that upload more videos says goodbye jac
