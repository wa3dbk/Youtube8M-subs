flat waxed nylon this is a fairly heavy
thread<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:44.189> idea<00:01:44.639> that<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.060> does<00:01:45.240> is

now<00:02:06.060> we'll<00:02:06.270> take<00:02:06.419> a<00:02:06.479> little<00:02:07.139> strip<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.560> foam

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
now we'll take a little strip of foam

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.940 
now we'll take a little strip of foam
and<00:02:08.069> we're<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> cut<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> point

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and we're going to cut this to a point

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.809 
and we're going to cut this to a point
here<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.370> front<00:02:11.640> about<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.660> okay<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
here in front about like that okay and

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.600 
here in front about like that okay and
we'll<00:02:14.819> tie<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.600> firmly<00:02:16.260> right<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.520> at

we'll tie this in firmly right here at

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.890 
we'll tie this in firmly right here at
the<00:02:17.700> point

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the point

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.759 
the point
and<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.580> going<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.940> spiral<00:02:21.870> back<00:02:22.170> see

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
and then I'm going to spiral back see

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.860 
and then I'm going to spiral back see
I'm<00:02:22.950> making<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.610> spiral<00:02:23.940> now<00:02:24.299> that'll<00:02:24.599> roll

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
I'm making a spiral now that'll roll

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.910 
I'm making a spiral now that'll roll
that<00:02:25.140> foam<00:02:25.500> right<00:02:25.769> on<00:02:25.830> top<00:02:26.159> of<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.459> hook<00:02:27.920> see

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
that foam right on top of the hook see

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.589 
that foam right on top of the hook see
how<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.159> cuts<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.610> there<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.209> rolls<00:02:30.450> it

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
how that cuts in there it just rolls it

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.380 
how that cuts in there it just rolls it
right<00:02:30.780> up<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.080> top<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.209> add

right up on top this is going to add

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.380 
right up on top this is going to add
some<00:02:34.170> flotation<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.819> get<00:02:36.000> as<00:02:36.150> far

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
some flotation to it and we get as far

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.149 
some flotation to it and we get as far
back<00:02:36.599> as<00:02:36.659> you<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.440> full<00:02:37.620> length<00:02:37.829> of<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
can see how we have a segmented effect

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.940 
can see how we have a segmented effect
right<00:02:57.239> there<00:02:57.299> now<00:02:58.170> we're<00:02:58.349> going<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.500> counter

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
right there now we're going to counter

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.009 
right there now we're going to counter
wine<00:02:59.190> we're<00:03:00.000> going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.180> go<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.480> opposite

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
wine we're going to go the opposite

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.220 
wine we're going to go the opposite
directions<00:03:01.379> when<00:03:01.890> we<00:03:02.010> came<00:03:02.220> forward<00:03:03.170> okay<00:03:04.170> so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
directions when we came forward okay so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.039 
directions when we came forward okay so
there<00:03:04.739> see<00:03:05.280> how<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.489> can<00:03:05.730> follow<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.750> previous

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
there see how we can follow the previous

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.860 
there see how we can follow the previous
wrap<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.329> that<00:03:09.329> way<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.569> maintain

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
wrap like this in that way you maintain

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.589 
wrap like this in that way you maintain
the<00:03:10.319> segmentation<00:03:10.890> on<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.459> thing<00:03:11.730> I'm<00:03:12.269> not

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
the segmentation on that thing I'm not

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.599 
the segmentation on that thing I'm not
sure<00:03:12.659> that<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.079> blue<00:03:13.349> B<00:03:13.530> already<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:14.159> bothered

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
sure that a blue B already is bothered

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.599 
sure that a blue B already is bothered
by<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:15.060> much<00:03:15.329> but<00:03:15.629> what<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.079> heck<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:17.430> can

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.670 
going to trim this now like so and this
will<00:03:53.549> become<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:53.879> head<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.449> fly<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:55.379> clip

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
will become the head of the fly you clip

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.409 
will become the head of the fly you clip
off<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.889> corners<00:03:56.459> here<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.120> makes<00:03:57.329> it

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
off the corners here it just makes it

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.800 
off the corners here it just makes it
look<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.750> little<00:03:57.930> bit<00:03:58.139> more<00:03:58.290> artsy<00:03:58.769> craftsy

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
look a little bit more artsy craftsy

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.599 
look a little bit more artsy craftsy
okay<00:04:00.810> now<00:04:01.410> at<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:01.650> point<00:04:01.919> you<00:04:02.099> can<00:04:02.280> level

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
okay now at this point you can level

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.520 
okay now at this point you can level
everything<00:04:02.879> that'll<00:04:03.810> kind<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.049> slide<00:04:04.349> around

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
everything that'll kind of slide around

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.220 
everything that'll kind of slide around
the<00:04:04.859> hook<00:04:05.150> so<00:04:06.150> once<00:04:06.389> you<00:04:06.510> have<00:04:06.629> it<00:04:06.810> pretty<00:04:07.049> well

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
the hook so once you have it pretty well

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.189 
the hook so once you have it pretty well
leveled<00:04:07.859> out<00:04:08.389> we're<00:04:09.389> going<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.780> use<00:04:09.959> some

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
leveled out we're going to use some

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.659 
leveled out we're going to use some
super<00:04:10.859> glue<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:12.829> glue<00:04:13.829> it<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.129> hook<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:14.579> it

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
super glue and glue it to the hook so it

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.830 
super glue and glue it to the hook so it
doesn't<00:04:14.970> slide<00:04:15.810> any<00:04:16.109> more<00:04:17.090> right<00:04:18.120> okay<00:04:18.780> so

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
doesn't slide any more right okay so

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.290 
doesn't slide any more right okay so
okay
