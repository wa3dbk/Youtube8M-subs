then he said sure I believe I believe

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.980 
then he said sure I believe I believe
it's<00:01:47.399> when<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.610> translates<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.600> something

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it's when it translates to or something

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's when it translates to or something
like<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.110> by<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.530> way<00:01:49.710> he<00:01:50.130> did<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> molten

like that by the way he did a molten
rice<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.390> sugarcane<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.990> scared<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> SH<00:01:52.950> out

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
unsatisfied with this because they were

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.270 
unsatisfied with this because they were

hoping that Noah till we get a new form

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.730 
hoping that Noah till we get a new form
personally<00:02:02.969> i<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.270> believe<00:02:03.750> he<00:02:04.140> has<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> new

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
personally i do believe he has a new

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.160 
personally i do believe he has a new
form<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.490> he<00:02:05.969> still<00:02:06.270> has<00:02:06.420> an<00:02:06.570> activated

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
form because he still has an activated

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.529 
form because he still has an activated
world<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.649> far<00:02:07.710> as<00:02:08.190> these<00:02:08.340> leaked<00:02:08.670> images<00:02:09.270> are

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
world as far as these leaked images are

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.770 
world as far as these leaked images are
concerned<00:02:09.929> anyway<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.560> may<00:02:10.920> happen<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
concerned anyway it may happen in the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.570 
concerned anyway it may happen in the
short<00:02:11.959> chapter<00:02:12.319> when<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.530> comes<00:02:12.709> out<00:02:12.890> he<00:02:13.280> still

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
short chapter when it comes out he still

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.690 
short chapter when it comes out he still
has<00:02:13.760> not<00:02:13.880> activated<00:02:14.630> his<00:02:14.930> new<00:02:15.260> bijuu<00:02:15.860> mode<00:02:15.890> so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
has not activated his new bijuu mode so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.880 
has not activated his new bijuu mode so
maybe<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.510> BG<00:02:17.840> mode<00:02:18.020> has<00:02:18.319> characteristics

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
maybe the BG mode has characteristics

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.670 
maybe the BG mode has characteristics
from<00:02:19.580> all<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.420> tail<00:02:20.600> beats<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.500> maybe

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
from all of the tail beats so that maybe

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.410 
from all of the tail beats so that maybe
your<00:02:21.950> loop<00:02:22.130> form<00:02:22.370> right<00:02:22.520> there<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:23.240> this

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
your loop form right there but this

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.590 
your loop form right there but this
right<00:02:23.750> here<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.740> him<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.550> his<00:02:25.640> perfected

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
right here is just him and his perfected

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.410 
right here is just him and his perfected
sage<00:02:26.930> mode<00:02:27.319> state<00:02:28.190> because<00:02:28.610> we<00:02:28.790> see<00:02:29.000> he<00:02:29.180> has<00:02:29.270> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
sage mode state because we see he has to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.750 
sage mode state because we see he has to
Sage<00:02:29.660> Mode<00:02:29.930> eyes<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.920> cube<00:02:31.190> eat<00:02:31.400> slashed

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
Sage Mode eyes and the cube eat slashed

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.479 
Sage Mode eyes and the cube eat slashed
it<00:02:32.030> was<00:02:32.150> i<00:02:32.300> but<00:02:32.750> he<00:02:32.870> does<00:02:33.080> not<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
it was i but he does not have the the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.820 
it was i but he does not have the the
orange<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.300> circle<00:02:35.989> around<00:02:36.170> his<00:02:36.350> eye<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:36.680> this

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
orange a circle around his eye so this

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.790 
orange a circle around his eye so this
suggests<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.459> he<00:02:37.850> has<00:02:38.120> perfected<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.560> sage

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
suggests that he has perfected the sage

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.220 
suggests that he has perfected the sage
mode<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.310> i<00:02:40.550> have<00:02:40.760> no<00:02:41.030> doubt<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.569> my<00:02:41.750> mind<00:02:41.930> that

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
mode so i have no doubt in my mind that

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.229 
mode so i have no doubt in my mind that
he's<00:02:42.470> going<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.739> activate<00:02:43.100> his<00:02:43.400> BG<00:02:43.640> mode<00:02:43.940> and

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
he's going to activate his BG mode and

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.449 
he's going to activate his BG mode and
it's<00:02:44.540> going<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.810> look<00:02:45.050> badass<00:02:45.350> because<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
it's going to look badass because the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.940 
it's going to look badass because the
only<00:02:46.640> BG<00:02:47.060> mode<00:02:47.239> we've<00:02:47.420> been<00:02:47.630> shown<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.200> when<00:02:48.440> he

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
only BG mode we've been shown is when he

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.280 
only BG mode we've been shown is when he
had<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.610> majority<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.630> nine<00:02:50.810> tails<00:02:51.110> chakra

in my opinion so now Naruto has
literally<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.829> power<00:03:40.100> of<00:03:40.459> all<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:41.030> beasts<00:03:41.390> or

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.219 
does get the Rinnegan i'm pretty sure
that<00:05:47.280> it<00:05:47.850> will<00:05:48.000> have<00:05:48.240> different<00:05:48.690> abilities

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229

from<00:05:50.130> moderates<00:05:50.790> because<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.210> only<00:05:51.330> really

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
from moderates because the only really

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.750 
from moderates because the only really
god<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:52.080> we've<00:05:52.229> seen<00:05:52.500> in<00:05:52.770> action<00:05:53.010> what's

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
god that we've seen in action what's

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.659 
god that we've seen in action what's
moderates<00:05:54.270> like<00:05:54.450> Nagato<00:05:55.110> used<00:05:55.410> it<00:05:55.650> obito<00:05:56.430> use

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
moderates like Nagato used it obito use

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.150 
moderates like Nagato used it obito use
it<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.060> I<00:05:57.330> originally<00:05:57.570> belonged<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.710> moderate

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
it and I originally belonged to moderate

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.820 
it and I originally belonged to moderate
so<00:05:59.400> maybe<00:06:00.000> Sasuke's<00:06:00.840> Rena<00:06:01.110> God<00:06:01.350> would<00:06:01.710> have

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
so maybe Sasuke's Rena God would have

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.440 
so maybe Sasuke's Rena God would have
like<00:06:02.130> different<00:06:02.400> summoning<00:06:03.060> maybe<00:06:03.300> a

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
like different summoning maybe a

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.690 
like different summoning maybe a
different<00:06:03.870> God<00:06:04.410> like<00:06:04.710> attack<00:06:05.040> other<00:06:05.370> than
