00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.390 
in the goal this is way harder and way
more<00:04:01.600> satisfying<00:04:02.410> when<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.799> happens<00:04:03.220> which<00:04:03.370> is

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
more satisfying when it happens which is

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.610 
more satisfying when it happens which is
never<00:04:03.730> oh<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.660> got<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:04.989> soccer

never oh I got that soccer
not<00:04:05.739> that<00:04:05.890> it<00:04:05.980> matters<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.430> guess<00:04:06.640> you're<00:04:06.819> just

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
not that it matters I guess you're just

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.460 
not that it matters I guess you're just
like<00:04:07.150> trying<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.450> block<00:04:07.690> them<00:04:07.989> from<00:04:08.019> getting

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.289 
like trying to block them from getting
points<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:08.890> makes<00:04:09.069> sense<00:04:09.459> but<00:04:09.849> I<00:04:09.909> mean<00:04:10.120> I
