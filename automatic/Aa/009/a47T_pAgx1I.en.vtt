00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:15.820
 prepare a bonsai in cup this bonsai 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.300

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:23.170
 the leaves and flowers so beautiful that 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.660

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.540
 twigs that are going to combine very nice 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.220
 For this bonsai summer glow 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.680

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.649

 some twigs then here we have the cup 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.149
 the cup that perhaps is not appreciated very 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.550
 well the color the base as you 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.579
 can appreciate is the same color of the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.549
 flowers so that it is a color so 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.519
 pretty so beautiful and you can 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 ready to place the center and then 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.150
 are going to be filled with the pebbles of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.940
 colors that we have 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.210
 to place the branches 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.700
 you need this light wire that is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.580

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.880
 in the hardware store 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.310
 we are going to cut the desired size and 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.230
 these are going to be flexible in the branch 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.140
 dry the only difference is that they are 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.410
 fixed but these can be folded can 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.410
