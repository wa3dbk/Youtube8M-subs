I've<00:00:31.060> license<00:00:31.599> them<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.900> surefire<00:00:32.349> and

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
I've license them to surefire and

three in a box for nine dollars it's
pretty<00:00:39.010> good<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:40.300> biggest<00:00:40.720> key<00:00:40.989> is<00:00:41.290> this<00:00:41.829> is<00:00:42.070> a

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
pretty good the biggest key is this is a

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.390 
pretty good the biggest key is this is a
shooting<00:00:43.150> technique<00:00:43.690> that<00:00:44.290> we<00:00:44.470> can<00:00:44.710> use<00:00:45.070> for

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
shooting technique that we can use for

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.430 
shooting technique that we can use for
searching<00:00:45.940> as<00:00:46.120> opposed<00:00:46.900> to<00:00:47.020> a<00:00:47.080> search

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
technique that we can employ for

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.600 
technique that we can employ for
shooting<00:00:50.290> when<00:00:50.950> I<00:00:50.980> was<00:00:51.130> with<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.340> Air<00:00:51.460> Marshal

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
shooting when I was with the Air Marshal

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.700 
shooting when I was with the Air Marshal
program<00:00:52.240> we<00:00:52.690> were<00:00:52.840> limited<00:00:53.050> in<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.440> type<00:00:53.650> of

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
program we were limited in the type of

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.740 
program we were limited in the type of
equipment<00:00:54.220> we<00:00:54.490> could<00:00:54.670> carry<00:00:54.940> on<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.150> plane<00:00:55.480> and

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
equipment we could carry on a plane and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.260 
equipment we could carry on a plane and
still<00:00:55.990> look<00:00:56.260> like<00:00:56.500> casual<00:00:56.980> passengers<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:58.090> we

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
still look like casual passengers so we

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.850 
still look like casual passengers so we
needed<00:00:58.660> something<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.560> developed

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
needed something and I developed

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.320 
needed something and I developed
something<00:01:00.520> that<00:01:00.670> worked<00:01:01.060> in<00:01:01.300> that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
something that worked in that

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.200 
something that worked in that
environment<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.860> great<00:01:03.070> thing<00:01:03.310> is<00:01:03.490> it<00:01:03.910> works

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
environment the great thing is it works

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.899 
environment the great thing is it works
in<00:01:04.420> every<00:01:04.780> combat<00:01:05.259> application<00:01:06.070> or<00:01:06.280> defensive

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
in every combat application or defensive

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.200 
in every combat application or defensive
environment<00:01:07.740> simply<00:01:08.740> we<00:01:09.340> grasp<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:10.030> light

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
environment simply we grasp the light

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.850 
environment simply we grasp the light
either<00:01:10.810> middle<00:01:11.710> finger<00:01:12.100> or<00:01:12.280> index<00:01:12.790> finger<00:01:13.570> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
either middle finger or index finger and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.070 
either middle finger or index finger and
when<00:01:14.860> we<00:01:14.980> present<00:01:15.250> our<00:01:15.580> pistol<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.300> get<00:01:16.930> our

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
when we present our pistol and get our

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.220 
when we present our pistol and get our
two-handed<00:01:17.740> grip<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.640> off<00:01:18.880> hand<00:01:19.230> pressure

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
two-handed grip the off hand pressure

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.340 
two-handed grip the off hand pressure
that<00:01:21.100> we<00:01:21.250> normally<00:01:21.490> shoot<00:01:22.030> with<00:01:22.350> activates

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
that we normally shoot with activates

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.880 
that we normally shoot with activates
the<00:01:23.590> light<00:01:24.030> line<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.240> light<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.780> line<00:01:26.440> of<00:01:26.650> gun

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
the light line of light and line of gun

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.580 
the light line of light and line of gun
isn't<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:28.030> big<00:01:28.210> consideration<00:01:28.600> because<00:01:29.260> we're

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
isn't a big consideration because we're

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.469 
isn't a big consideration because we're
just<00:01:29.620> illuminating<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.700> threat<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.270> we've

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
just illuminating a threat that we've

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.160 
just illuminating a threat that we've
already<00:01:31.900> decided<00:01:32.800> we<00:01:33.460> go<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.700> guns<00:01:34.000> on<00:01:34.300> we're

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
already decided we go to guns on we're

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.830 
already decided we go to guns on we're
using<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.800> light<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.220> reinforce<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.510> choice

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
using the light to reinforce that choice

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
using the light to reinforce that choice
so<00:01:38.909> simply<00:01:39.909> as<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:41.170> holding<00:01:41.560> on<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.740> this
