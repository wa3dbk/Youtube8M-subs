white membrane surrounding the seeds

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.830 
white membrane surrounding the seeds
that's<00:03:28.830> where<00:03:29.190> most<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.030> raw<00:03:30.300> heat<00:03:30.630> is

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that's where most of that raw heat is

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.560 
that's where most of that raw heat is
going<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.350> be<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:32.160> in<00:03:32.370> goes<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.910> roughly<00:03:33.239> just

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
going to be so in goes that roughly just

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.550 
going to be so in goes that roughly just
cut<00:03:33.870> one<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.260> pepper<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.989> I've<00:03:37.080> got<00:03:37.290> here

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
cut one and pepper and I've got here

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.620 
cut one and pepper and I've got here
about<00:03:37.860> three<00:03:38.190> scallions<00:03:38.550> that<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.090> chopped<00:03:39.450> up

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
about three scallions that I chopped up

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.250 
about three scallions that I chopped up
roughly<00:03:40.050> as<00:03:40.290> well

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
roughly as well

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.890 
roughly as well
get<00:03:42.769> better<00:03:43.000> sort<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.180> mix<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.690> we're<00:03:44.780> gonna

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
get better sort of a mix and we're gonna

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.979 
get better sort of a mix and we're gonna
bring<00:03:45.140> everything<00:03:45.440> together<00:03:46.659> with<00:03:47.659> some

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
bring everything together with some

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.440 
bring everything together with some
lemon<00:03:48.260> juice<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:48.830> I've<00:03:48.950> got<00:03:49.159> here<00:03:49.610> one<00:03:50.030> lemon

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
lemon juice so I've got here one lemon

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.020 
lemon juice so I've got here one lemon
and<00:03:51.200> I'm<00:03:51.319> just<00:03:51.500> gonna<00:03:51.680> squeeze<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.370> lemon<00:03:52.670> in

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
and I'm just gonna squeeze that lemon in

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.539 
and I'm just gonna squeeze that lemon in
there<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:54.860> we're<00:03:54.980> gonna<00:03:55.069> mix<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.519> up

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
there and then we're gonna mix that up

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.509 
there and then we're gonna mix that up
and<00:03:55.849> let<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:56.330> sit<00:03:56.750> for<00:03:56.780> about<00:03:57.099> 5-10<00:03:58.099> minutes

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
and let that sit for about 5-10 minutes

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.789 
and let that sit for about 5-10 minutes
so<00:03:59.000> everything<00:03:59.510> comes<00:03:59.810> together<00:04:02.049> as<00:04:03.049> our<00:04:03.349> sort

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
so everything comes together as our sort

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.430 
so everything comes together as our sort
of<00:04:03.920> pickle<00:04:04.370> comes<00:04:04.640> together<00:04:04.910> here<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:05.690> want<00:04:06.349> to

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
of pickle comes together here I want to
