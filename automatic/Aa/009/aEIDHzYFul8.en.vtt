00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
edge and you use fairly low level air

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.080 
edge and you use fairly low level air
defenses<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.960> wizard<00:00:49.350> towers<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:50.940> gonna

side<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> base<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> looks<00:00:57.899> pretty

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
side of the base because it looks pretty

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.560 
side of the base because it looks pretty
weak<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.760> also<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.059> where<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> dark

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
weak and also that's where the dark

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
weak and also that's where the dark
elixir<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.379> trying<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> lot<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
elixir is and I'm trying to get a lot of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.119 
elixir is and I'm trying to get a lot of
dark<00:01:02.550> elixir<00:01:02.760> too<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> start<00:01:04.890> dropping

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
dark elixir too so to start dropping

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.730 
dark elixir too so to start dropping
them<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.610> by<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.850> wizard<00:01:06.360> tower<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.530> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
them at by the wizard tower and that I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
them at by the wizard tower and that I
started<00:01:08.340> circling<00:01:08.549> around<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.299> didn't

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
started circling around and I didn't

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.390 
started circling around and I didn't
realize<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> he<00:01:10.320> had<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> heart<00:01:10.799> retire<00:01:11.130> there

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
realize that he had a heart retire there

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.980 
realize that he had a heart retire there
so<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.729> kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.060> screwed<00:01:12.360> me<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.780> could

so that kind of screwed me up I could

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.580 
so that kind of screwed me up I could
have<00:01:13.189> possibly<00:01:14.189> been<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.939> factor<00:01:15.720> benefactor

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.789 
have possibly been the factor benefactor
and<00:01:16.740> trying<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> three-star<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> I
