00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
varieties of lettuce to growing at the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.590 
varieties of lettuce to growing at the
same<00:00:42.250> time<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:44.290> way<00:00:44.440> we<00:00:44.620> do<00:00:44.860> things<00:00:45.129> here

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
same time and the way we do things here

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.720 
same time and the way we do things here
we<00:00:46.600> start<00:00:46.870> all<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.140> our<00:00:47.440> lettuce<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:48.070> the

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.600 
we start all of our lettuce in the
greenhouse<00:00:49.449> and<00:00:49.840> then<00:00:49.960> eventually<00:00:50.830> it<00:00:51.220> works

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
greenhouse and then eventually it works

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.280 
greenhouse and then eventually it works
its<00:00:51.790> way<00:00:51.970> out<00:00:52.269> here<00:00:52.540> will<00:00:52.690> transplant<00:00:52.989> them

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
its way out here will transplant them

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.240 
its way out here will transplant them
into<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.620> ground

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250

if you haven't seen how we start our

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.070 
if you haven't seen how we start our
lettuces<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.489> greenhouse<00:01:00.879> just<00:01:01.180> check

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
lettuces in the greenhouse just check

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.039 
lettuces in the greenhouse just check
out<00:01:02.229> the<00:01:02.379> video<00:01:02.650> boom<00:01:03.460> right<00:01:04.120> there<00:01:04.180> it'll

show you step-by-step how it's done from

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.000 
show you step-by-step how it's done from
seed<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.150> then<00:01:07.870> we<00:01:08.170> take<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.530> from<00:01:08.770> there<00:01:08.979> and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
seed and then we take it from there and

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.120 
seed and then we take it from there and
into<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:10.000> ground<00:01:10.260> real<00:01:11.260> simple<00:01:11.650> stuff<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:11.979> go

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
into the ground real simple stuff so go

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.859 
into the ground real simple stuff so go
check<00:01:12.340> out<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.549> video<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.210> it'll<00:01:13.720> show<00:01:13.750> you

check out that video and it'll show you
a<00:01:13.930> little<00:01:14.020> bit<00:01:14.110> more<00:01:14.320> information<00:01:14.500> about<00:01:14.799> that

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
a little bit more information about that

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.010 
a little bit more information about that
but<00:01:15.760> let's<00:01:15.909> take<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.060> closer<00:01:16.360> look<00:01:16.510> at<00:01:16.810> how<00:01:16.990> we

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
but let's take a closer look at how we

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.500 
but let's take a closer look at how we
plant<00:01:17.560> these<00:01:17.770> over<00:01:18.070> here<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.580> how<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.240> set

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
plant these over here and how we set

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.899 
plant these over here and how we set
them<00:01:19.630> up<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.049> we<00:01:20.920> pretty<00:01:21.100> much<00:01:21.220> you<00:01:21.820> know

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
them up and we pretty much you know

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.850 
them up and we pretty much you know
plant<00:01:22.180> them<00:01:22.299> pretty<00:01:22.510> close<00:01:22.810> together<00:01:23.020> this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
plant them pretty close together this

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.630 
plant them pretty close together this
particular<00:01:24.490> variety<00:01:24.780> rehears<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.020> rock<00:01:26.320> sea

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
particular variety rehears is a rock sea

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.030 
particular variety rehears is a rock sea
lettuce<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:28.000> we<00:01:28.540> plant<00:01:28.869> them<00:01:29.049> you<00:01:29.260> know<00:01:29.770> I

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
lettuce and we plant them you know I

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.070 
lettuce and we plant them you know I
would<00:01:30.280> say<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.460> good<00:01:30.820> you<00:01:31.120> know<00:01:31.240> five<00:01:31.690> six

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
would say a good you know five six

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.360 
would say a good you know five six
inches<00:01:32.880> apart<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.060> this<00:01:34.570> bed<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:34.930> about<00:01:35.370> four

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
inches apart and this bed is about four

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.500 
inches apart and this bed is about four
feet<00:01:37.330> wide<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:39.370> would<00:01:39.550> say<00:01:39.700> it's<00:01:39.850> about<00:01:39.970> 20

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
feet wide and I would say it's about 20

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.100 
feet wide and I would say it's about 20
feet<00:01:40.840> long<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.310> get<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.700> pretty<00:01:43.420> good

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
feet long so we get a pretty good

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.430 
feet long so we get a pretty good
variety<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:45.010> a<00:01:45.040> good<00:01:45.310> good<00:01:45.580> amount<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:45.910> space

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
variety and a good good amount of space

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.310 
variety and a good good amount of space
on<00:01:47.440> these<00:01:47.800> lettuces<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.690> we<00:01:49.690> do<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> pretty<00:01:50.080> nice

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
on these lettuces so we do a pretty nice

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.680 
on these lettuces so we do a pretty nice
job<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:50.890> getting<00:01:51.580> everything<00:01:51.820> set<00:01:52.300> up<00:01:52.330> in<00:01:52.540> the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
job and getting everything set up in the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.720 
job and getting everything set up in the
ground<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:53.260> you<00:01:53.830> can<00:01:53.860> easily<00:01:54.100> do<00:01:54.400> this<00:01:54.550> at

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
ground and you can easily do this at

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.840 
ground and you can easily do this at
home<00:01:55.350> build<00:01:56.350> yourself<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.770> raised<00:01:56.950> bed<00:01:56.980> it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
home build yourself a raised bed it

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.460 
home build yourself a raised bed it
makes<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.210> easier<00:01:58.630> because<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.110> can<00:01:59.230> kind<00:01:59.440> of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
makes it easier because you can kind of

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.160 
makes it easier because you can kind of
control<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.890> weeding<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.490> lot<00:02:01.030> easier<00:02:01.480> as<00:02:01.750> you

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
control the weeding a lot easier as you

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.640 
control the weeding a lot easier as you
can<00:02:02.470> see<00:02:02.680> here<00:02:03.100> we<00:02:03.730> have<00:02:03.760> this<00:02:04.300> plastic<00:02:05.050> lay

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
can see here we have this plastic lay

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.320 
can see here we have this plastic lay
down<00:02:06.010> here<00:02:06.310> now<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.760> something<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.090> we

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
down here now this is something that we

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.359 
down here now this is something that we
just<00:02:07.630> kind<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.810> left<00:02:08.080> on<00:02:08.259> here<00:02:08.530> not<00:02:09.099> sure<00:02:09.250> if

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
just kind of left on here not sure if

just kind of left on here not sure if
you<00:02:09.459> guys<00:02:09.610> remember<00:02:09.789> that<00:02:10.269> we<00:02:10.390> did<00:02:10.599> grow<00:02:11.550> some

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
you guys remember that we did grow some

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.360 
you guys remember that we did grow some
lettuce<00:02:13.480> on<00:02:13.810> I'm<00:02:14.019> not<00:02:14.200> not<00:02:14.349> lettuce<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.860> some

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
lettuce on I'm not not lettuce but some

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.479 
lettuce on I'm not not lettuce but some
onions<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:15.909> here<00:02:16.500> previously<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.769> we're<00:02:18.280> now

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
onions on here previously so we're now

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.780 
onions on here previously so we're now
switching<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.420> rotation<00:02:20.290> again<00:02:21.159> going<00:02:21.700> back

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
switching the rotation again going back

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.059 
switching the rotation again going back
to<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.299> plastic<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.590> makes<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.040> a

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
to this plastic here it makes it a

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.860 
to this plastic here it makes it a
little<00:02:24.580> bit<00:02:24.730> easier<00:02:25.150> when<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.540> comes<00:02:25.750> to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
little bit easier when it comes to

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.410 
little bit easier when it comes to
dealing<00:02:26.049> with<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> weeds<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.060> all<00:02:28.060> we<00:02:28.239> did

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
dealing with the weeds and all we did

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.380 
dealing with the weeds and all we did
was<00:02:28.599> just<00:02:28.659> lay<00:02:28.959> this<00:02:29.140> plastic<00:02:29.680> down<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.390> kind

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
was just lay this plastic down and kind

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.070 
was just lay this plastic down and kind
of<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.599> tuck<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.049> on<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> ends<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:34.080> plug

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
of just tuck it in on the ends and plug

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.990 
of just tuck it in on the ends and plug
some<00:02:35.290> holes<00:02:35.319> in<00:02:35.740> there<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:36.370> transplant

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
some holes in there and then transplant

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.150 
some holes in there and then transplant
the<00:02:37.150> lettuce<00:02:37.420> right<00:02:38.140> into

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
the lettuce right into

right into the into this soil here now

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.580 
right into the into this soil here now
the<00:02:42.460> soil<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:43.090> use<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.440> regular

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
little bit of lines just to get some

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.140 
little bit of lines just to get some
extra<00:02:56.040> alkalinity<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.130> then<00:02:57.550> sometimes<00:02:57.970> will

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
extra alkalinity and then sometimes will

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.700 
extra alkalinity and then sometimes will
give<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.330> little<00:02:58.480> boost<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:59.110> some<00:02:59.500> fish

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
give a little boost with some fish

emulsion in terms of the fertilizer just
a<00:03:02.650> little<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.100> know<00:03:03.190> something<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.730> get<00:03:03.850> it

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
a little you know something that get it

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.300 
a little you know something that get it
going<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:05.290> if<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.470> have<00:03:05.620> really<00:03:05.770> good<00:03:05.890> soil

you know really alkaline if you're using

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.980 
you know really alkaline if you're using
some<00:03:09.460> organic<00:03:11.550> potting<00:03:12.550> mixes<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.870> know

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
for rock dust and there's like so many

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.900 
for rock dust and there's like so many

different varieties out there in terms
of<00:03:22.120> organic<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.350> know<00:03:23.380> rich<00:03:23.680> soil<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.970> showed

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
of organic you know rich soil I showed

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.300 
of organic you know rich soil I showed
you<00:03:25.780> guys<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.110> other<00:03:26.170> day<00:03:26.290> some<00:03:26.830> of<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.070> leaf

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
you guys the other day some of the leaf

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.060 
you guys the other day some of the leaf
compost<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:28.720> we<00:03:28.840> use<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.500> actually<00:03:29.710> make

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
compost that we use to actually make

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.730 
compost that we use to actually make
mixes<00:03:30.670> but<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.510> can<00:03:31.660> actually<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.290> use<00:03:32.380> that

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
mixes but you can actually just use that

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.650 
mixes but you can actually just use that
leaf<00:03:32.980> compost<00:03:33.520> and<00:03:33.700> throw<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.480> raised

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
leaf compost and throw it in the raised

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.720 
leaf compost and throw it in the raised
bed<00:03:34.990> and<00:03:35.260> man<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.130> stuff<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.400> going<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.610> do

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
bed and man that stuff is going to do

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.140 
bed and man that stuff is going to do
some<00:03:37.420> serious<00:03:37.840> stuff<00:03:38.020> in<00:03:38.200> terms<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.560> growing

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
some serious stuff in terms of growing

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.840 
some serious stuff in terms of growing
but<00:03:40.150> again<00:03:40.740> real<00:03:41.740> easy<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.190> do<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.640> is

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
but again real easy to do this is

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.830 
but again real easy to do this is
something<00:03:43.270> that<00:03:43.570> we<00:03:44.910> do<00:03:45.910> here<00:03:46.270> on<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.570> farm

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
something that we do here on the farm

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.770 
something that we do here on the farm
and<00:03:47.380> now<00:03:47.800> all<00:03:48.130> this<00:03:48.400> stuff<00:03:48.460> will<00:03:48.940> be<00:03:49.090> speed<00:03:49.390> cut

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
and now all this stuff will be speed cut

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.230 
and now all this stuff will be speed cut
when<00:03:49.930> we<00:03:49.960> go<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.230> harvest<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.860> we'll<00:03:51.820> just<00:03:51.850> cut

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
when we go to harvest it we'll just cut

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.090 
when we go to harvest it we'll just cut
it<00:03:52.360> right<00:03:52.600> from<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.020> bottom<00:03:53.380> here<00:03:53.620> get<00:03:53.950> some

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
it right from the bottom here get some

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.400 
it right from the bottom here get some
some<00:03:54.460> cutters<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.000> then<00:03:55.570> we'll<00:03:55.840> harvest<00:03:56.140> a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
some cutters and then we'll harvest a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.960 
some cutters and then we'll harvest a
whole<00:03:56.560> entire<00:03:56.830> head<00:03:57.070> like<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.460> it

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
whole entire head like that it

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.620 
whole entire head like that it
eventually<00:03:58.180> it'll<00:03:58.540> be<00:03:58.600> sitting<00:03:59.020> on<00:03:59.250> display

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
eventually it'll be sitting on display

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.940 
eventually it'll be sitting on display
really<00:04:01.630> beautiful<00:04:02.080> but<00:04:02.290> as<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.530> can<00:04:02.680> see<00:04:02.830> the
