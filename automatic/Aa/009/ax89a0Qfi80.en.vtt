Minecraft 1.8 in this video we're just

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.750 
Minecraft 1.8 in this video we're just
going<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.960> focus<00:00:07.170> more<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.010> main<00:00:08.160> menu<00:00:08.370> and

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
going to focus more on the main menu and

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.209 
going to focus more on the main menu and
then<00:00:09.480> when<00:00:09.719> one<00:00:09.960> point<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.530> released<00:00:10.889> will

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
then when one point a is released will

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.700 
then when one point a is released will
go<00:00:11.250> through<00:00:11.730> more<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.690> updates<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
go through more of the updates the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.169 
go through more of the updates the
reason<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.130> sticking<00:00:14.370> just<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.000> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
reason is sticking just to this is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.090 
reason is sticking just to this is
because<00:00:15.570> chances<00:00:16.080> are<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:16.980> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
because chances are it's not going to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.070 
because chances are it's not going to
change<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.550> much<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.210> ready<00:00:18.930> and

change that much it and it's ready and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.470 
change that much it and it's ready and
it's<00:00:19.380> finished<00:00:19.740> over<00:00:20.340> bits<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.060> game<00:00:21.270> may

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
