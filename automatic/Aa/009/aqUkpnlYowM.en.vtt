00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.520
 jo people welcome to another pb 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.099
 preview video This time it's time to learn 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.409
 game mode on the pc server is namely 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.449
 the very beautiful titled hexa kill 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:14.009
 features game mode came out 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.020
 the whole as you might already 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.120
 thinking is a six against six 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.500
 play mode 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.950
 Of course you can find all that under 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.960
 play pvp witcher kill and collect swift 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.539
 You can also open custom games 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.150
 but unfortunately only on the rift 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.289
 the summoner is limited when we are 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.669
 then quite normal in the queue 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.949
 Of course, it will be announced again 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.329
 either invite teams or just join in 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.940
 dice random people together 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.589
 and finally finally witch here 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 kiel there is no longer the sixth wheel 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.890
 how many times have I had five? 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.690
 friends then we had to say yes 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.089
 shit say that's not possible because we 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.940
 one too many are here now witch keel 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.469
 that fits 1a with a car with six 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.249
 mature I think quite well anchored to the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.469
 summer may not be the best 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:59.489
 metaphor but you know the scenario he 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.749
 sure if we then a game 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.460
 have found there of course it is in 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.440
 the champion from waal and here will be with 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.520
 Everything was chosen for the light peak procedure 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.530
 others might as well 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.270
 take a bit long after a short time 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.890
 Of course, it is also time , of course 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.400
 play and in the loading screen very me 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.030
 beautiful 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.290
 There are twelve players involved in the game 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.400
 Apart from the loading screen were in 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.810
 the game mode, of course, too 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.730
 corresponding interface change 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.620
 made it just left on the edge 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.150
 that we see a portrait more or in the 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.760
 scoreboard that's a total of twelve 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.020
 Apart from that, there are a lot of champions 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.460
 but not much behind the game mode 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.920
 it's just the six against six 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.180
 the rift collects what you like quite normally 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.850
 make of it, of course, you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.580
 leave six solo low mode open 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.310
 top line or just two top 22 bottom 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.420
 five young middle-aged no idea that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.330
 is of course up to you 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.860
 The main thing was found a thing the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.780
 Definitely worth mentioning 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.870
 is that also new sound files are there for 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.810
 the new multicar more precisely the 68th 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.760
 so far the highest pentagon resp 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.170
 not exactly the highest one though 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.909
 was definitely in 5 vs. 5 mode 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.680
 So you could kill five and pentax 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.360
 There are already scenarios there 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.060
 the opponents revive you can also 6 7 8 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.850
 9 10 theoretically kill that were always 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.100
 kill a legendary here in the witch now 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.350
 However, there is a name- giving mode 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.380
 So exactly when we have six children 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.390
 the pentax ricoh more but in the hexagon 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:37.500
 and because they sound good I play 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:39.360
 now just before olja the woman 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.220
 but is also always with emotions 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.080
 the thing 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.850
 well witch kill is yes as I said one 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.610
 feature game mode and featured game 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.860
 modes according to wsj point of view so far 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.690
 not be made permanently available 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.700
 For example, Snowden Showdown was one 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.600
 Christmas event and witcher Kiel is coming 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.570
 probably to each other 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.160
 time temporarily out of therefore hold 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.450
 keep you up to date and if it's there 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.250
 I can only recommend you one 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.310
 why play with friends 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.350
 certainly as much fun in any case to 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.120
 exact game mode from me or 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.790
 or one year older 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.080
 Guys mh say thank you for seeing 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.130
 and I hope we will first see 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.130
 thanks again for a video 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.100
 The End
