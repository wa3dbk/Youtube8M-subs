00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
let's go and not using do this

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.200 
let's go and not using do this
yeah<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.950> designed<00:01:56.219> tracks<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.729> fit<00:01:56.909> together

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
yeah we designed tracks to fit together

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.179 
yeah we designed tracks to fit together
so<00:01:57.990> you've<00:01:58.110> got<00:01:58.200> me<00:01:58.350> through<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.710> you're<00:01:58.829> DJ

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
so you've got me through when you're DJ

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.499 
so you've got me through when you're DJ
and<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.399> play<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> there's<00:01:59.939> such<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> point

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and you play it there's such a point

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.030 
and you play it there's such a point
that<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> tracks<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.229> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> swap<00:02:02.009> over

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that the tracks just kind of swap over

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.459 
that the tracks just kind of swap over
each<00:02:02.399> other<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> lot<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> times<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.290> house

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
each other so a lot of times in house

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.749 
each other so a lot of times in house
and<00:02:04.740> stuff<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.610> easy

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and stuff it's really really easy

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.459 
and stuff it's really really easy
because<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.210> first<00:02:06.450> day<00:02:06.630> two<00:02:06.780> bars<00:02:07.079> will<00:02:07.320> just

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
because the first day two bars will just

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.830 
because the first day two bars will just
squat<00:02:08.129> over<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.580> last<00:02:08.940> 32<00:02:09.330> bars<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
squat over the last 32 bars of the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.570 
squat over the last 32 bars of the
previous<00:02:10.229> song<00:02:10.410> however<00:02:11.039> doesn't<00:02:11.459> always

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
previous song however doesn't always

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.100 
previous song however doesn't always
work<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.000> simply<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.599> just<00:02:12.780> got<00:02:12.900> upon<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
work that simply so you just got upon a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.420 
work that simply so you just got upon a
look

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
look

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.069 
look
your<00:02:13.609> tracks<00:02:13.939> kind<00:02:14.299> of<00:02:14.359> using<00:02:14.629> your<00:02:14.719> ears<00:02:14.989> and

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079

I<00:06:21.020> did<00:06:21.350> or<00:06:21.740> 16<00:06:22.100> I<00:06:22.220> get<00:06:22.370> 32<00:06:22.730> and<00:06:22.880> 16<00:06:23.180> confused<00:06:23.600> to

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
I did or 16 I get 32 and 16 confused to

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.660 
I did or 16 I get 32 and 16 confused to
bring<00:06:24.230> it<00:06:24.350> in<00:06:24.410> before<00:06:24.740> I<00:06:24.770> did<00:06:25.070> but<00:06:25.430> there<00:06:25.580> were

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
bring it in before I did but there were

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.730 
bring it in before I did but there were
still<00:06:25.970> some<00:06:26.150> melodic<00:06:26.420> stuff<00:06:26.870> going<00:06:27.140> on<00:06:27.260> in<00:06:27.530> the

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
still some melodic stuff going on in the

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.490 
still some melodic stuff going on in the
track<00:06:27.980> before<00:06:28.930> which<00:06:29.930> will<00:06:30.050> demand<00:06:30.170> that<00:06:30.440> the

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
track before which will demand that the

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.870 
track before which will demand that the
melodies<00:06:30.860> will<00:06:30.980> cannot<00:06:31.130> overlapping<00:06:31.550> and

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
melodies will cannot overlapping and

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.860 
melodies will cannot overlapping and
then<00:06:31.970> as<00:06:32.060> a<00:06:32.120> listener<00:06:32.480> you<00:06:32.600> were<00:06:32.690> getting

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
then as a listener you were getting

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.150 
then as a listener you were getting
confused<00:06:33.260> see<00:06:33.500> these<00:06:33.800> are<00:06:33.890> the<00:06:33.920> sort<00:06:34.130> of

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
confused see these are the sort of

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.460 
confused see these are the sort of
things<00:06:34.310> you<00:06:34.400> got<00:06:34.550> me<00:06:34.610> thinking<00:06:34.910> about<00:06:35.470> basses

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
things you got me thinking about basses

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.470 
things you got me thinking about basses
another<00:06:36.680> integral<00:06:37.130> one<00:06:37.310> kick<00:06:37.670> drums<00:06:37.970> can't<00:06:38.360> be

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
another integral one kick drums can't be

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.450 
another integral one kick drums can't be
overlapping<00:06:38.950> that's<00:06:39.950> one<00:06:40.070> of<00:06:40.130> the<00:06:40.190> reasons

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
overlapping that's one of the reasons

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.040 
overlapping that's one of the reasons
why<00:06:40.640> a<00:06:40.940> lot<00:06:41.000> of<00:06:41.120> times<00:06:41.210> people<00:06:41.450> will<00:06:41.660> take<00:06:41.810> out

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
why a lot of times people will take out

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.050 
why a lot of times people will take out
although<00:06:42.230> end<00:06:42.500> in<00:06:42.620> a<00:06:42.710> track<00:06:42.980> or<00:06:43.250> use<00:06:43.610> a<00:06:43.640> filter

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
although end in a track or use a filter

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.780 
although end in a track or use a filter
or<00:06:44.500> EQ<00:06:45.500> to<00:06:45.650> do<00:06:45.770> it<00:06:45.920> because<00:06:46.250> you've<00:06:46.520> been<00:06:46.640> had

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
or EQ to do it because you've been had

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.520 
or EQ to do it because you've been had
the<00:06:46.910> kicks<00:06:47.150> overlapping<00:06:47.570> it<00:06:47.990> goes<00:06:48.260> mental

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
the kicks overlapping it goes mental

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.710 
the kicks overlapping it goes mental
just<00:06:48.920> don't<00:06:49.160> do<00:06:49.370> it<00:06:49.400> I<00:06:49.700> can<00:06:50.240> explain<00:06:50.450> to<00:06:50.630> you

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
just don't do it I can explain to you

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.280 
just don't do it I can explain to you
why<00:06:50.900> but<00:06:51.230> it<00:06:51.290> gets<00:06:51.470> me<00:06:51.590> complicated<00:06:52.250> is<00:06:52.430> it<00:06:52.610> so

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
why but it gets me complicated is it so

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.890 
why but it gets me complicated is it so
yeah<00:06:54.290> make<00:06:54.560> short<00:06:54.770> kicks<00:06:55.040> don't<00:06:55.280> overlap

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
yeah make short kicks don't overlap

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.150 
yeah make short kicks don't overlap
similarly<00:06:56.900> bass<00:06:57.230> lines<00:06:57.500> don't<00:06:57.740> got<00:06:57.980> off<00:06:58.130> of

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
similarly bass lines don't got off of

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.330 
similarly bass lines don't got off of
each<00:06:58.340> other<00:06:58.810> melodies<00:06:59.810> sometimes<00:07:00.350> can<00:07:00.710> drums

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
each other melodies sometimes can drums

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.740 
each other melodies sometimes can drums
are<00:07:01.520> almost<00:07:01.700> always<00:07:01.940> go<00:07:02.210> on<00:07:02.330> top<00:07:02.480> of<00:07:02.630> each

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
are almost always go on top of each

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.510 
are almost always go on top of each
other<00:07:02.960> sometimes<00:07:03.410> a<00:07:03.560> very<00:07:03.830> nice<00:07:04.010> way<00:07:04.250> but<00:07:04.400> it

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
other sometimes a very nice way but it

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.750 
other sometimes a very nice way but it
kind<00:07:04.700> of<00:07:04.730> will<00:07:05.470> yeah<00:07:06.470> that's<00:07:07.400> pretty<00:07:07.520> much<00:07:07.610> the

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
kind of will yeah that's pretty much the

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.040 
kind of will yeah that's pretty much the
sort<00:07:07.880> of<00:07:07.970> vibe<00:07:08.150> just<00:07:08.420> going<00:07:08.600> to<00:07:08.660> choose<00:07:08.900> the

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
sort of vibe just going to choose the

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.480 
sort of vibe just going to choose the
right<00:07:09.170> point<00:07:09.470> in<00:07:09.590> the<00:07:09.650> sort<00:07:09.890> of<00:07:10.010> bring<00:07:10.250> it<00:07:10.400> in

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
and you don't even have to worry about

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.800 
and you don't even have to worry about
using<00:07:12.350> these<00:07:12.590> things<00:07:12.860> or<00:07:13.100> effects<00:07:13.810> right
