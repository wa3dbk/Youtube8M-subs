00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.420 
basically i think that it was kind of a
dud<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.549> my<00:01:20.939> opinion<00:01:21.210> invasion<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.650> no<00:01:23.009> weapon

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
dud in my opinion invasion so no weapon

dud in my opinion invasion so no weapon
to<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.150> least<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:25.380> i<00:01:25.740> always<00:01:26.369> loved<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.909> for

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to at least use i always loved going for

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
to at least use i always loved going for
the<00:01:27.450> weapons<00:01:27.750> gold<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.380> would<00:01:28.500> come

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the weapons gold when they would come

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.990

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910 
definitely want to see I honestly think
we've<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.180> enough<00:01:45.210> new<00:01:46.049> maps<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.649> baby

we've got enough new maps we got baby

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.030 
we've got enough new maps we got baby
we've<00:01:47.759> got<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> fog<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.200> had<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> few<00:01:49.560> cool<00:01:49.799> maps

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
we've got a fog we had a few cool maps

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.359 
we've got a fog we had a few cool maps
ruins<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.360> Hema<00:01:51.720> 'the<00:01:51.960> those<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
ruins but Hema 'the those are kind of

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.249 
ruins but Hema 'the those are kind of
cool<00:01:53.520> maps<00:01:53.759> i<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.240> devastation<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
cool maps i like from devastation so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
cool maps i like from devastation so
honestly<00:01:55.770> i<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.640> should

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
honestly i think that what they should

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.469 
honestly i think that what they should
do<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.000> bring<00:01:57.420> back<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:58.560> old<00:01:59.189> maps<00:01:59.880> bring<00:02:00.329> back

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
do is bring back for old maps bring back

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.380 
do is bring back for old maps bring back
to<00:02:00.780> model<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.229> three<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.909> two<00:02:02.909> from<00:02:03.090> model

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
to model for three and two from model

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.520 
to model for three and two from model
for<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> lot<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> people<00:02:04.049> want<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.409> see

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
for to a lot of people want to see

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.139 
for to a lot of people want to see
high-rise<00:02:05.100> back<00:02:05.490> i<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.060> would

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
high-rise back i think that would

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.270 
high-rise back i think that would
definitely<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.540> cool<00:02:06.869> um<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.129> just

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
definitely be cool um I think they just

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.460 
definitely be cool um I think they just
should<00:02:08.729> definitely<00:02:09.209> bring<00:02:09.360> back<00:02:09.569> resistance

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
should definitely bring back resistance

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.500 
should definitely bring back resistance
I<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.760> guys<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.209> you've<00:02:12.390> been

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
I know that you guys if you've been

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
I know that you guys if you've been
watching<00:02:12.690> my<00:02:12.930> videos<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.319> know

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
watching my videos you know

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.260 
watching my videos you know
I really<00:02:13.860> love<00:02:14.040> resistance<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.819> maybe<00:02:15.090> you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
I really love resistance and maybe you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.540 
I really love resistance and maybe you
like<00:02:15.390> mission<00:02:15.900> hard<00:02:16.560> hat<00:02:16.860> one<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.220> those<00:02:17.310> types

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
like mission hard hat one of those types

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.550 
like mission hard hat one of those types
of<00:02:17.670> maps<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:19.050> think<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.410> they<00:02:19.530> should

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
of maps and I think that they should

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.140 
of maps and I think that they should
just<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.040> definitely<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.910> another

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
just you know definitely have another

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640 
just you know definitely have another
weapon<00:02:21.360> it's<00:02:21.720> probably<00:02:22.080> gonna<00:02:22.200> end<00:02:22.319> up<00:02:22.410> being

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
weapon it's probably gonna end up being

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.530 
weapon it's probably gonna end up being
an<00:02:22.740> LMG<00:02:23.160> which<00:02:23.610> kind<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.030> stinks<00:02:24.360> because<00:02:24.450> I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
an LMG which kind of stinks because I

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.820 
an LMG which kind of stinks because I
don't<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:24.720> use<00:02:24.990> those<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.410> much<00:02:25.590> but

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
don't really use those that much but

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.400 
don't really use those that much but
I'll<00:02:25.950> definitely<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.459> videos<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.410> it'd

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
I'll definitely do videos on that it'd

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.050 
I'll definitely do videos on that it'd
be<00:02:28.530> awesome<00:02:28.740> if<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.160> was<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> salt<00:02:29.670> rifle<00:02:30.000> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
be awesome if it was in the salt rifle I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.979 
be awesome if it was in the salt rifle I
think<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:30.360> would<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> best<00:02:30.780> case

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
think that would be the best case

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.949 
think that would be the best case
scenario<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.500> me<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.239> mean<00:02:33.540> common<00:02:33.840> what

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.240 
scenario for me so I mean common what
