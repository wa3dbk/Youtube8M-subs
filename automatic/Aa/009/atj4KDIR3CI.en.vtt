00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 we have dessert bread pudding 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.620
 this dessert has all the 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.530
 characteristics that we like is cheap 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.540
 It is very rich and it is very easy to make and 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.030
 for this we are going to need a bar 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.610
 previous day's bread 150 grams of 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.470
 brown sugar a liter of milk a 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.390
 little cinnamon and 4 eggs 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.070
 this recipe is cheap because 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.140
 we take advantage of the bread that we have left 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.149
 house of the previous day and the first thing that 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.040
 let's do is cut the bread in 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.579
 small pieces so that later it is more 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.499
 easy for milk to soak it 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.570
 once we have broken the bread what 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.089
 we put in a large glass bowl and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.079
 we add all the liter of milk 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.390
 trying to get it right to all 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.190
 places so that the bread soaks up well if 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.079
 we want to make a little more healthy 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.579
 we can do it perfectly with milk 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.079
 soy 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.909
 Now we will add a good part of the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.530
 sugar reserving a couple of tablespoons 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.869
 to make the candy that we will see 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.089
 then we will also add the 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:05.519
 Cinnamon is to taste but with a couple of 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.289
 teaspoons will be enough cinnamon 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.289
 It is grown mainly in the southeast 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.899
 asian especially in ceylon or sri 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.340
 lanka as it is currently called once 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.679
 that the bread is soft because it is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.049
 perfectly soaked in milk will 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.789
 let's add the 4 eggs that will be what 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.039
 that makes our pudding set in the 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.479
 oven and now we are going to beat it very well 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.149
 because we do not want lumps left 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.640
 of bread another characteristic of cinnamon 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.770
 is that it is anticoagulant what helps 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.689
 that menstrual pains are reduced 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.969
 now let's make the candy that is 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.100
 very simple we put a saucepan on the fire 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.229
 with the medium-low fire and we add the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.630
 couple of tablespoons of sugar we add 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.490
 another couple of tablespoons of water and 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.770
 we just let the sugar get 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.710
 melt without stopping moving so that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.149
 we burn after a couple of minutes 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.950
 this is the consistency of our 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.479
 candy that when hot is 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.990
 liquid and the moment in which 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.520
 cool another curiosity will solidify 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.100
 of cinnamon is that when 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.590
 Portuguese conquered Ceylon in 1500 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.560
 they forced the king of ceylan to pay them a 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.829
 annual tribute of 12 thousand kilos of cinnamon 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.900
 a year we put the candy in the background 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.870
 from a refractory container and when 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.940
 be cold we are going to spend a little bit of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.920
 oil through the mold walls to 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.920
 that later it is easier to dismantle it 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.780
 with the same objective we are going to put a 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.170
 little bit of flour on the walls of the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.170
 mold 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.580
 Now let's add the mixture to the mold 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.200
 of eggs sugar milk and cinnamon and to 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.660
 we are going to put a wooden spoon 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.730
 and we are going to add the mixture with 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.770
 very careful above that spoon 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.690
 this will make the impact less 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.650
 and will prevent it from mixing with the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.090
 candy 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.150
 meanwhile we will have been 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.050
 preheating the oven to 180 degrees just 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.090
 below we'll have it baked about 45 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.670
 minutes or until we put a knife 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.530
 and leave clean once cold is very 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.500
 important that it is cold we can 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.420
 unmold and until the next recipe if 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.420
 you liked do not forget to subscribe 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500
