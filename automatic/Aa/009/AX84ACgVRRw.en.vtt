imperfections<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.819> cover<00:02:06.060> today<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> after

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
imperfections to cover today and after

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.430 
imperfections to cover today and after
one<00:02:07.770> layer<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.459> definitely<00:02:09.390> better<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:09.780> I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
one layer it's definitely better but I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.800 
one layer it's definitely better but I
think<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.250> need<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.610> little<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.630> will

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
think I need a little more so I will

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.830 
think I need a little more so I will
apply<00:02:13.110> another<00:02:13.799> layer<00:02:14.099> okay<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.120> that's<00:02:15.750> how

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
apply another layer okay so that's how

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.009 
apply another layer okay so that's how
it<00:02:16.019> looks<00:02:16.319> after<00:02:16.680> two<00:02:17.069> layers<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.810> think<00:02:18.810> that's

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
it looks after two layers I think that's

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.170 
it looks after two layers I think that's
still<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.650> need<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.040> little<00:02:20.310> concealer<00:02:20.730> today

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.210 
but I'm satisfied with this foundation
it<00:02:23.549> smells<00:02:23.910> very<00:02:24.030> nice<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.470> very<00:02:26.010> easy

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
it smells very nice and it's very easy

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.300 
it smells very nice and it's very easy
to<00:02:26.340> apply<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.500> still<00:02:28.709> think<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.099> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
to apply but I still think that the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.490 
to apply but I still think that the
color<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:30.090> little<00:02:30.120> bit<00:02:30.480> too<00:02:30.840> dark<00:02:31.019> for<00:02:31.170> me

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
color is a little bit too dark for me

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.699 
color is a little bit too dark for me
but<00:02:32.370> I'm<00:02:32.489> quite<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.880> pale<00:02:33.299> person<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.200> most<00:02:34.590> of

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
but I'm quite a pale person and most of

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.819 
but I'm quite a pale person and most of
the<00:02:34.829> people<00:02:34.980> have<00:02:35.700> darker<00:02:36.090> skin<00:02:36.120> than<00:02:36.420> mine<00:02:36.829> so

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
the people have darker skin than mine so

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.759 
the people have darker skin than mine so
my<00:02:37.980> base<00:02:38.190> will<00:02:38.489> be<00:02:38.700> perfect<00:02:39.299> for<00:02:39.599> most<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
my base will be perfect for most of the

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.229 
my base will be perfect for most of the
population<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.840> maybe<00:02:43.109> if<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.620> mix<00:02:44.280> this

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
population but maybe if I mix this

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.740 
population but maybe if I mix this
foundation<00:02:45.900> with<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.170> BB<00:02:46.470> cream<00:02:46.769> or<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:48.540> my

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
foundation with a BB cream or with my

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.280 
foundation with a BB cream or with my
standard<00:02:49.230> foundation<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:50.069> will<00:02:50.810> get<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.019> color

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
standard foundation I will get the color

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.920 
standard foundation I will get the color
that<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.859> perfect<00:02:52.889> for<00:02:53.340> me<00:02:53.639> and<00:02:53.880> but<00:02:54.510> for<00:02:54.750> me

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that is perfect for me and but for me

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.710 
that is perfect for me and but for me
it's<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:56.340> little<00:02:56.670> bit<00:02:57.000> too<00:02:57.120> dark<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.630> think

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
it's a little bit too dark so I think

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.009 
it's a little bit too dark so I think
maybe<00:02:58.250> if<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.430> finally<00:03:00.030> gets<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.389> little<00:03:00.540> warmer

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
maybe if it finally gets a little warmer

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.650 
maybe if it finally gets a little warmer
and<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.350> get<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> little<00:03:01.859> tent<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:03.299> will<00:03:03.510> be

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and I get a little tent it will be

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.930 
and I get a little tent it will be
perfect<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:04.500> my<00:03:04.560> final<00:03:04.799> opinion<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.639> very

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
perfect and so my final opinion is very

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.620 
perfect and so my final opinion is very
positive

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
positive

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.990 
positive
I<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.530> foundation<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.250> gives<00:03:08.549> decent

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
I like this foundation and gives decent

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.080 
I like this foundation and gives decent
coverage<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.900> costs<00:03:10.620> quite<00:03:11.190> little<00:03:11.670> because

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
coverage it costs quite little because

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.289 
coverage it costs quite little because
of<00:03:12.239> Newton's<00:03:12.420> latte<00:03:13.190> but<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.370> really<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.269> to

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
of Newton's latte but you really have to

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.629 
of Newton's latte but you really have to
be<00:03:15.540> careful<00:03:15.930> with<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.380> colors<00:03:16.739> because<00:03:17.220> it's

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
be careful with the colors because it's

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.280 
be careful with the colors because it's
quite<00:03:19.670> poor<00:03:20.670> lunch<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.180> course<00:03:21.540> available

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
quite poor lunch of the course available

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.449 
quite poor lunch of the course available
I<00:03:22.560> hope<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:23.910> will<00:03:24.150> wide<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.680> give

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
I hope that they will wide it and give

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.300 
I hope that they will wide it and give
me<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> little<00:03:27.090> lighter<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:28.109> colored<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.099> this

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
me a little lighter I colored in this

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.440 
me a little lighter I colored in this
and<00:03:29.790> then<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.480> will<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.900> verified<00:03:31.889> for<00:03:32.190> me

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
and then it will be verified for me

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.150 
and then it will be verified for me
thank<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.510> very<00:03:33.630> much<00:03:33.959> for<00:03:34.169> watching<00:03:34.319> I<00:03:34.919> wait

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
thank you very much for watching I wait

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.680 
thank you very much for watching I wait
