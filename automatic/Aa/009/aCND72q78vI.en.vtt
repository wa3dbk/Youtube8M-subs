export<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> quicktime<00:00:32.930> animatic<00:00:33.930> you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
export it as a quicktime animatic you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.029 
export it as a quicktime animatic you
can<00:00:34.950> simply<00:00:35.220> type<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.870> name<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.630 
can also set a scene range if you want
and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.410> export<00:00:47.010> by<00:00:47.399> choosing

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and then you can just export by choosing

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.779 
and then you can just export by choosing
the<00:00:47.930> quality<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> compression<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.519> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the quality and the compression for the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:00.259 
the quality and the compression for the
QuickTime<00:00:51.329> file<00:00:56.600> when<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:59.149> rendering<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
QuickTime file when the rendering is

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.630 
QuickTime file when the rendering is
done<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.519> time

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
done you see that with time

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
done you see that with time
automatically<00:01:03.239> opens<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.530> animatic<00:01:07.530> will

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
automatically opens the animatic will

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.060 
automatically opens the animatic will
contain<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.400> transition<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.830> also<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
contain the transition and also the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.620 
contain the transition and also the
animation<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.120> I<00:01:12.210> define<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> timeline

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
animation that I define in the timeline

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.500 
animation that I define in the timeline
so<00:01:15.630> apart<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.050> these<00:01:17.030> animatic<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.330> also

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
so apart from these animatic I can also

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.270 
so apart from these animatic I can also
export<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.620> storyboard<00:01:21.200> sketches<00:01:22.280> also

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
export from the storyboard sketches also

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.680 
export from the storyboard sketches also
in<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.460> case<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:24.030> select<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.570> location

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
in this case I can select the location

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.580 
in this case I can select the location
type<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.470> name<00:01:25.620> and<00:01:25.980> also<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.960> scene<00:01:27.960> range<00:01:28.230> for
