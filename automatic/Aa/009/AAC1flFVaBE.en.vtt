00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.110

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.299

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.429
 all and finally thrilled for the movie 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.250

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.750

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.920
 Do not want it before you start talking 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.480
 about the new trailer for Batman and 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.160

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.170

 for you help me in the patron a priest one 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.480
 financial aid platform where you 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.760
 can give a minimum amount of sealing a 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.989
 dollar to $ 5 per month on the channel and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.489

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.710
 video for you as always 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.059
 then look patriot side though speak 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.830
 on rail in old superman neighborhood 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.269
 I finally got carried away to 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.970
 coming down stopped showing the same things 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.559
 always and showed that he should show without 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.670
 spoil a lot without ruining the 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.809
 without ruining who will be the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.030
 true villain of the movie 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.680
 I really liked the scenes in the fighting neighborhood. 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.300
 only of superman anguish and 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.970
 showing how it is divided between 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.280
 continue on earth although I finally liked it 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.380
 quite a lot of very subtle references when 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.120
 for example the benefit that is the arm and me 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.700
 How many honest men do you ask? 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.530
 left and he cuts and shows the woman 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.060
 I found it very cool, I liked it. 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.100
 much of the film's special effects 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.690
 those little scenes that we see 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.130
 a Dantesque destruction I liked 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.020
 quite a lot of what many people 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.370
 want to find out what is also about 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.520
 how is it going to be a clash between the 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.050
 Batman and a superman because we know 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.820
 is an unfair fight through just vote 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.040
 only in armor and with superman 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.960
 super strength and courage kalou and vision of 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.370
 X-ray is finally great either unfair fight 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.810
 know how they will solve this movie 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.530
 how are they going to leave the fight 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.060
 equals 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.400
 I really liked the lex luthor that the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 I was a little strange at first. 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.240
 quebec guinea by jesse eisenberg la no 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.370
 role of the former pilot but he is well 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.050
 I really liked his figure and I 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.030
 remembered the first super middle back that 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.250
 he wore wig lexus go from 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.140
 finally and we'll have some 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.970
 anything related to the general osÃ³rio 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.640
 Their bodies will use something from him. 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.860
 that came rumors that a turn 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.330
 himself villain who wants school 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.920
 to no one and google expands 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.900
 Find out who it is, let's wait until 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.340
 next year is anxious anxious 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.170
 because it's almost a year away from the end 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.849
 to leave and I think I should post this 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.800
 Year my blog another bid or 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.690
 finally you who complained of milan 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.099
 in the comments of your father telling me 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.730
 that I used to be that I was older and not 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.890
 I know what 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.110
 Look out, shut up, the movie, now it's finally over. 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.330
 I'm excited, I'm looking forward to 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.130
 movie and I want to see the woman more 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.690
 wonder I want to see more of the camp 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.580
 also said that the flash may appear 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.500
 in the movie 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.270
 There are many possibilities for people 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.870
 You know almost nothing and I'm happy. 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.550
 therefore 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.500
 besides some scenes in training and me 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.330
 remembered how great is that it is another 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.160
 Sexual symbol from here I think it's excellent. 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.470
 as much as many people do not like 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.330
 I have changed the end of the tone I like 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.220
 enough of the great and the death scene of 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.620
 parents of bruce who appear quickly and 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.090
 remembered another great and also 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.430
 showed how the secretary bringing 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.570
 back to his trademark, which is the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.090
 slow supercamera 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.620
 God miss you, do not expect a man of steel. 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.030
 so I finally became anxious for the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.530
 I liked the movie very much and enjoyed it very much. 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.560
 well ahead and he's acting well 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.270
 look only when mouths expressive for more 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.980
 that is expressions is perhaps simple 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.080
 make a goal of anger and despair 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.520
 He is expressive so I did not speak ill of 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.440
 me in the front it will be a good bat 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.730
 but it's already being a bombast and I hope 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.100
 let him be a good luciene 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.660
 I also liked the germ years as author 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.820
 that I did not expect you to like the 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.070
 psychologist luciane as alfred i stayed 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.840
 afraid single scene that appears I stayed 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.970
 happy with his participation as well as 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.310
 I was also happy with this super hour. 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.709
 give that generated upon batman that 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.080
 he really hits and he leaves the bandits 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.850
 in the street handcuffed and bleeding and 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.800
 beaten I liked that work 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.360
 negative on top of it but I did not like it 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.519
 much of the desert neighborhood bid 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.560
 I found a caricature but he's a fuck 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.050
 I like fucking brought or hope 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.940

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.290

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.670
