it'll dry faster then what you're going
to<00:01:49.550> do<00:01:49.700> is<00:01:49.970> you're<00:01:50.180> going<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.390> peel<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.630> up<00:01:51.010> but

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
to do is you're going to peel it up but

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.219 
to do is you're going to peel it up but
and<00:01:52.369> there's<00:01:52.970> two<00:01:53.180> ways<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.479> doing<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:53.780> I

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
and there's two ways of doing this I

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.380 
and there's two ways of doing this I
like<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:54.860> show<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.580> little<00:01:55.820> bit<00:01:55.940> of<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.180> white

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
like to show a little bit of the white

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.990 
like to show a little bit of the white
so<00:01:57.050> that<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.229> could<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:57.560> dress<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.800> edges<00:01:58.220> and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
so that I could just dress the edges and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.760 
so that I could just dress the edges and
how<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.690> do<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.080> is<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.260> take<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.530> paper

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
how you do that is you take the paper

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.340 
how you do that is you take the paper
and<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.100> pull<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:01.520> up<00:02:01.790> if<00:02:02.510> you<00:02:02.660> don't<00:02:03.020> want

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and you pull it up if you don't want

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.650 
and you pull it up if you don't want
this<00:02:03.530> white<00:02:03.800> core<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.550> show<00:02:04.760> then<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.510> would

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
this white core to show then you would

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.120 
this white core to show then you would
take<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.990> you'd<00:02:06.080> pull<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.440> down<00:02:06.619> like<00:02:06.860> that

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
take and you'd pull it down like that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.969 
take and you'd pull it down like that
and<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.239> wouldn't<00:02:08.509> show<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.979> would

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
and then it wouldn't show it would

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.979 
and then it wouldn't show it would
actually<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.369> white<00:02:10.459> with<00:02:10.580> me<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.850> inside

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
actually the white with me on the inside

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.490 
actually the white with me on the inside
so<00:02:11.989> you're<00:02:12.200> going<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.500> pull<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:14.239> paper

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.780 

ripping<00:02:18.500> upwards<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.400> get<00:02:19.520> some<00:02:19.700> of

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
ripping upwards so that you get some of

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.400 
ripping upwards so that you get some of
that<00:02:19.820> white<00:02:20.060> core<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.720> glue<00:02:21.080> will<00:02:21.350> hold

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
that white core and the glue will hold

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.760 
that white core and the glue will hold
down<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.600> most<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.930> paper<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.500> parts

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
down and most of the paper but the parts

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.900 
down and most of the paper but the parts
that<00:02:24.800> aren't<00:02:25.010> through<00:02:25.190> down<00:02:25.370> will<00:02:25.520> rip<00:02:25.700> right

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
that aren't through down will rip right

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.940 
that aren't through down will rip right
off<00:02:28.540> that's<00:02:29.540> why<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.750> kind<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.140> showed<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.800> to

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
off that's why I kind of showed you to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.320 
off that's why I kind of showed you to
do<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.190> scribbling<00:02:31.610> technique<00:02:32.060> with<00:02:32.239> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
do this scribbling technique with the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:43.680 
do this scribbling technique with the
glue

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:56.010 

just<00:02:44.690> tearing<00:02:45.560> away

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.700 

okay<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.400> now<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.580> want<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.350> little<00:02:59.350> bit<00:02:59.500> more

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
okay and now I want to a little bit more

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.820 
okay and now I want to a little bit more
patterned<00:03:00.280> paper<00:03:00.520> on<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.600> edges<00:03:01.900> here<00:03:02.260> so

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
patterned paper on the edges here so

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.140 
patterned paper on the edges here so
take<00:03:03.490> my<00:03:03.700> glue<00:03:03.940> stick<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.800> just<00:03:06.100> think<00:03:06.970> some

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
take my glue stick and I just think some

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.900 
take my glue stick and I just think some
glue<00:03:07.470> along<00:03:08.470> those<00:03:08.740> edges<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:09.220> little<00:03:09.520> bit

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
glue along those edges a little bit

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.360 
glue along those edges a little bit
there<00:03:10.800> then<00:03:11.800> I'm<00:03:11.890> going<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.040> take<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:12.310> piece

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
there then I'm going to take this piece

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.090 
there then I'm going to take this piece
of<00:03:12.580> noise<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.270> set<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.630> back<00:03:13.720> over<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:17.100> rub

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
of noise and set it back over that rub

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:34.470 
of noise and set it back over that rub
it<00:03:18.220> down<00:03:26.940> same<00:03:27.940> thing<00:03:32.820> this<00:03:33.820> kind<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.120> gives<00:03:34.300> it

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
it down same thing this kind of gives it

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.080 
it down same thing this kind of gives it
sort<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.470> torn<00:03:35.770> wallpaper<00:03:36.340> lip<00:03:36.640> which<00:03:36.940> is

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
sort of a torn wallpaper lip which is

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.450 
sort of a torn wallpaper lip which is
what<00:03:37.240> I<00:03:37.270> like<00:03:39.810> exactly<00:03:40.810> what<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.050> was<00:03:41.140> gonna<00:03:41.460> do

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
what I like exactly what I was gonna do

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.240 
what I like exactly what I was gonna do
on<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.670> floor<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.740> I<00:03:47.740> went<00:03:47.770> all<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.160> way<00:03:48.190> to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
on the floor and I went all the way to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.520 
on the floor and I went all the way to
the<00:03:48.460> edge<00:03:48.580> so<00:03:48.910> it's<00:03:49.120> kind<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.630> hard<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.260> tear

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
the edge so it's kind of hard to tear

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.740 
the edge so it's kind of hard to tear
that<00:03:50.680> area<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.940> what<00:03:52.180> I'm<00:03:52.300> doing<00:03:52.330> is<00:03:52.540> I'm<00:03:52.630> just

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
that area so what I'm doing is I'm just

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.400 
that area so what I'm doing is I'm just
using<00:03:52.930> my<00:03:53.050> fingers<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:54.690> grab<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.840> paper<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:56.350> I

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
using my fingers to grab that paper so I

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:07.320 
using my fingers to grab that paper so I
could<00:03:56.560> peel<00:03:56.710> it<00:03:56.830> off<00:03:59.670> key<00:04:00.670> only<00:04:01.180> on<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:07.060> same

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
could peel it off key only on the same

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.460 
could peel it off key only on the same
thing<00:04:07.600> with<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:07.900> part<00:04:12.000> all<00:04:13.000> right<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:14.260> will

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
thing with this part all right this will

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.440 
thing with this part all right this will
give<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:14.800> really<00:04:15.370> really<00:04:15.640> distressed<00:04:16.180> look

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
give it a really really distressed look

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.140 
give it a really really distressed look
so<00:04:17.350> now<00:04:17.560> I'm<00:04:17.739> going<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.920> take<00:04:18.190> just<00:04:18.520> a<00:04:19.030> regular

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
so now I'm going to take just a regular

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.780 
so now I'm going to take just a regular
sponge<00:04:19.570> brush<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.520> some<00:04:21.520> walnut<00:04:21.910> stain<00:04:23.790> and

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
sponge brush and some walnut stain and

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.190 
sponge brush and some walnut stain and
you<00:04:25.030> can<00:04:25.180> use<00:04:25.300> your<00:04:25.420> blender<00:04:25.720> tool<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:26.080> like

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
you can use your blender tool I like

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.790 
you can use your blender tool I like
using<00:04:26.350> this<00:04:26.650> because<00:04:27.070> it<00:04:27.310> keeps<00:04:27.520> em<00:04:28.800> it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
using this because it keeps em it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.920 
using this because it keeps em it
absorbs<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.310> lot<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.610> e<00:04:30.790> or<00:04:31.060> holds<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.480> lot<00:04:31.630> of<00:04:31.660> ink

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
absorbs a lot of e or holds a lot of ink

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.880 
absorbs a lot of e or holds a lot of ink
and<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.770> also<00:04:33.720> helps<00:04:34.720> this<00:04:35.350> part<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.740> paper

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
and it also helps this part of the paper

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.710 
and it also helps this part of the paper
resist<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.550> ink<00:04:36.730> so<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.180> you<00:04:37.270> only<00:04:37.480> goes

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
resist the ink so that you only goes

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.530 
resist the ink so that you only goes
into<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.260> part<00:04:38.830> that's<00:04:38.980> torn<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:40.330> white

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
into the part that's torn that white

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.330 
into the part that's torn that white
core<00:04:40.840> that's<00:04:41.020> showing<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:42.130> you're<00:04:42.280> just

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
core that's showing and you're just

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.090 
core that's showing and you're just
going<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.610> rub<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.790> off

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.950 

and<00:04:49.100> you<00:04:49.490> can<00:04:49.700> even<00:04:50.270> dip<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:50.750> brush<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.260> your

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
and you can even dip this brush in your

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.070 
and you can even dip this brush in your
color<00:04:53.960> wash<00:04:54.190> mix<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.310> is<00:04:55.460> or<00:04:56.050> tattered<00:04:57.050> angels

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
color wash mix it is or tattered angels

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.320 
color wash mix it is or tattered angels
and<00:04:57.530> just<00:04:57.650> dip<00:04:57.800> it<00:04:57.830> in<00:04:58.010> there<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.190> use<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:58.430> it

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
and just dip it in there and use that it

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.600 
and just dip it in there and use that it
does<00:04:59.510> get<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.840> edges<00:05:00.110> a<00:05:00.140> little<00:05:00.400> more<00:05:01.400> wet

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
does get the edges a little more wet

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:18.720 
does get the edges a little more wet
than<00:05:01.640> you'd<00:05:02.000> like<00:05:02.720> but<00:05:03.140> it<00:05:03.860> works<00:05:04.040> just<00:05:04.160> fine<00:05:04.430> i

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.860 

also<00:05:19.730> like<00:05:19.940> youth<00:05:20.090> needs<00:05:20.330> precious<00:05:20.630> cuz<00:05:20.810> they

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
also like youth needs precious cuz they

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.100
