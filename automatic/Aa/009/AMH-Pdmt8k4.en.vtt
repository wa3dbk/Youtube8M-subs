00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.330 
being said this was a really good
episode<00:05:02.280> it's<00:05:03.280> not<00:05:03.580> as<00:05:03.850> good<00:05:04.210> as<00:05:04.620> 2d<00:05:05.620> blacktop

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
episode it's not as good as 2d blacktop

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.250 
episode it's not as good as 2d blacktop
the<00:05:06.700> episode<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.360> just<00:05:07.630> reviewed<00:05:07.990> right<00:05:08.110> now

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
the episode I just reviewed right now

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.140 
the episode I just reviewed right now
but<00:05:08.650> it<00:05:08.830> was<00:05:08.950> still<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.490> really<00:05:09.700> enjoyable

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
but it was still a really enjoyable

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.200 
but it was still a really enjoyable
episode<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.230> think<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.950> comedy<00:05:12.430> moments<00:05:12.910> form

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
episode I think the comedy moments form

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.710 
episode I think the comedy moments form
most<00:05:13.630> of<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.870> part<00:05:14.230> were<00:05:14.410> really<00:05:14.830> nice<00:05:15.100> and

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
most of the part were really nice and

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.870 
most of the part were really nice and
it's<00:05:16.720> nice<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.140> see<00:05:17.380> more<00:05:18.040> of<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.340> Fry<00:05:18.850> and

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
it's nice to see more of the Fry and

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.690 
it's nice to see more of the Fry and
Leela<00:05:19.740> relationship<00:05:20.740> right<00:05:20.980> here<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.610> I

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
Leela relationship right here and I

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.130 
Leela relationship right here and I
thought<00:05:21.850> how<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.060> episode<00:05:22.630> was<00:05:22.750> just<00:05:22.960> written

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
thought how the episode was just written

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.260 
thought how the episode was just written
overall<00:05:23.680> it's<00:05:23.830> really<00:05:24.280> good<00:05:24.490> I<00:05:24.520> was<00:05:24.730> impressed

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
overall it's really good I was impressed

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.420 
overall it's really good I was impressed

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
by it if I have to say my flaws with

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.400 
by it if I have to say my flaws with
this<00:05:27.550> episode<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.360> be<00:05:28.510> honest<00:05:28.870> though<00:05:29.110> it's

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
this episode to be honest though it's

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.890 
this episode to be honest though it's
just<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:29.920> it<00:05:30.430> does<00:05:30.790> get<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.120> little<00:05:31.210> boring<00:05:31.630> a

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
just that it does get a little boring a

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.760 
just that it does get a little boring a
couple<00:05:32.410> of<00:05:32.530> times<00:05:32.830> there<00:05:33.370> are<00:05:34.170> certain<00:05:35.170> misses

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
couple of times there are certain misses

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.670 
couple of times there are certain misses
in<00:05:35.950> terms<00:05:36.250> of<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.580> comedy<00:05:37.120> aspects<00:05:37.900> it<00:05:38.080> didn't

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
in terms of the comedy aspects it didn't

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.210 
in terms of the comedy aspects it didn't
like<00:05:39.160> Leela<00:05:40.150> here<00:05:40.660> I<00:05:40.690> didn't<00:05:41.170> like<00:05:41.200> how<00:05:41.530> even
