and<00:03:24.780> honestly<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.290> braiding<00:03:26.799> took<00:03:27.070> the

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
and honestly the braiding took the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.060 
and honestly the braiding took the
longest<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:28.600> putting<00:03:29.200> these<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:29.680> my<00:03:29.830> hair

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
longest like putting these in my hair

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.180 
longest like putting these in my hair
took<00:03:30.370> about<00:03:30.610> 45<00:03:31.209> minutes<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.080> that's<00:03:32.739> because

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
took about 45 minutes and that's because

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.050 
took about 45 minutes and that's because
I<00:03:33.220> was<00:03:33.760> going<00:03:34.180> back<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.420> forth<00:03:34.630> with<00:03:35.200> um

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
I was going back and forth with um

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.520 
I was going back and forth with um
taking<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.209> locks<00:03:37.420> out<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.959> placing<00:03:38.440> them

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
taking the locks out and placing them

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.740 
taking the locks out and placing them
other<00:03:38.860> places<00:03:39.190> just<00:03:39.400> making<00:03:40.360> sure<00:03:40.510> they're

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
other places just making sure they're

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.710 
other places just making sure they're
spaced<00:03:41.140> evenly<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.130> each<00:03:42.820> section<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.360> my<00:03:43.480> hair

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
spaced evenly so each section of my hair

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.250 
spaced evenly so each section of my hair
has<00:03:43.870> enough<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.590> know<00:03:44.739> lock<00:03:45.010> extensions<00:03:45.670> but

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
has enough you know lock extensions but

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.160 
has enough you know lock extensions but
yeah<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.620> braiding<00:03:48.510> took<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.660> longest

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
yeah the braiding took the longest

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.259 
yeah the braiding took the longest
because<00:03:50.650> braiding<00:03:51.430> my<00:03:51.549> hair<00:03:51.580> just<00:03:51.880> takes<00:03:52.120> so

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
because braiding my hair just takes so

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.740 
because braiding my hair just takes so
long<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.600> don't<00:03:52.660> know<00:03:53.080> why<00:03:53.350> it's<00:03:53.739> just<00:03:54.360> who<00:03:55.360> that

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
long I don't know why it's just who that

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.440 
long I don't know why it's just who that
took<00:03:56.350> me<00:03:56.500> about<00:03:56.709> an<00:03:56.830> hour<00:03:56.860> by<00:03:57.370> itself<00:03:57.760> putting

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
took me about an hour by itself putting

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.500 
took me about an hour by itself putting
the<00:03:58.720> LOC<00:03:58.900> extensions<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.940> was<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:00.970> breeze<00:04:01.239> and

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
the LOC extensions in was a breeze and

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.979 
the LOC extensions in was a breeze and
it<00:04:01.630> would<00:04:01.810> have<00:04:01.930> went<00:04:02.140> quicker<00:04:02.500> if<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:03.040> had<00:04:03.690> if<00:04:04.690> I

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
it would have went quicker if I had if I

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.409 
it would have went quicker if I had if I
knew<00:04:05.290> how<00:04:05.530> much<00:04:05.709> hair<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.070> was<00:04:06.400> going<00:04:06.669> to<00:04:06.880> need<00:04:07.120> I

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
knew how much hair I was going to need I

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.870 
knew how much hair I was going to need I
had<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.930> five<00:04:08.139> packs

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
had the five packs

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.110 
had the five packs
when<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.510> got<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.990> fourth<00:04:10.170> pack<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.650> was<00:04:10.800> like

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
when I got to the fourth pack I was like

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.720 
when I got to the fourth pack I was like
okay<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.150> got<00:04:12.510> one<00:04:13.050> more<00:04:13.200> pack<00:04:13.470> left<00:04:13.740> so<00:04:14.100> we're

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
okay I got one more pack left so we're

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.220 
okay I got one more pack left so we're
gonna<00:04:14.850> try<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.090> make<00:04:15.300> this<00:04:15.480> work<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.990> needed

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
gonna try to make this work so I needed

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.680 
gonna try to make this work so I needed
to<00:04:16.440> take<00:04:16.620> some<00:04:16.680> out<00:04:17.160> here<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:17.790> place<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.330> here

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
to take some out here and place it here

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.290 
to take some out here and place it here
take<00:04:19.230> some<00:04:19.260> out<00:04:19.650> there<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.190> put<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.489> here<00:04:20.520> and

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
take some out there and put it here and

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.440 
take some out there and put it here and
so<00:04:22.290> that's<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.980> only<00:04:23.010> reason<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.640> took<00:04:23.820> me<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
so that's the only reason it took me the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.120 
so that's the only reason it took me the
whole<00:04:24.480> 45<00:04:25.110> minutes<00:04:25.500> because<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.920> would<00:04:26.040> have

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
whole 45 minutes because it would have

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.670 
whole 45 minutes because it would have
took<00:04:26.310> me<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> good<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:27.060> 30<00:04:27.570> minutes<00:04:27.870> if<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.350> knew

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
took me a good like 30 minutes if I knew

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.530 
took me a good like 30 minutes if I knew
I<00:04:28.710> had<00:04:28.920> enough<00:04:29.220> hair<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:30.120> kept<00:04:30.330> going

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
I had enough hair and I just kept going

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.440 
I had enough hair and I just kept going
so<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:31.800> takes<00:04:32.040> you<00:04:32.280> no<00:04:32.550> time<00:04:32.580> at<00:04:33.000> all<00:04:33.120> if

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
so it really takes you no time at all if

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.330 
so it really takes you no time at all if
you're<00:04:33.990> considering<00:04:34.650> getting<00:04:34.830> these<00:04:35.130> like

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
you're considering getting these like

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.830 
you're considering getting these like
extensions<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:36.000> would<00:04:36.240> definitely<00:04:36.630> tell<00:04:36.780> you

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
extensions I would definitely tell you

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.050 
extensions I would definitely tell you

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
they are kind of shiny so I think once

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.210 
they are kind of shiny so I think once
they<00:04:58.650> get<00:04:58.830> old<00:04:59.130> they'll<00:04:59.460> start<00:04:59.880> to<00:05:00.770> lose<00:05:01.770> its

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220
