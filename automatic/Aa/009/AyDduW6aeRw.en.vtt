00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
computer power supply works well it's

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.840 
computer power supply works well it's
the<00:00:15.289> weight<00:00:16.289> power<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:17.100> how<00:00:17.670> does<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the weight power what how does the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.359 
the weight power what how does the

computer power supply work it's quite

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.830 
computer power supply work it's quite
complicated<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.210> power<00:00:21.390> supply<00:00:21.660> actually

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
complicated the power supply actually

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.859 
complicated the power supply actually
works<00:00:22.260> by<00:00:22.529> quite<00:00:23.010> doing<00:00:23.460> an<00:00:23.609> AC<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.480> DC

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
works by quite doing an AC to a DC

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
you survive now look it's not quite that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.389 
you survive now look it's not quite that
easy<00:00:30.560> but<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.679> not<00:00:31.830> quite<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.040> complicated

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399

these things have different power
requirements<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.559> where<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.570> confusion

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
requirements that's where the confusion

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.869 
requirements that's where the confusion
of<00:01:00.660> cables<00:01:01.199> come<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:01.770> even<00:01:02.670> though<00:01:02.760> we

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
of cables come from even though we

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
of cables come from even though we
plugged<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.719> into<00:01:03.930> our<00:01:04.110> wall<00:01:04.500> which

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
plugged that right into our wall which

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.740 
plugged that right into our wall which
is<00:01:04.830> AC<00:01:06.350> inside<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.650> power<00:01:07.860> supply<00:01:08.510> energy<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
is AC inside the power supply energy and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.190 
is AC inside the power supply energy and
power<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.860> converted<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.880> DC<00:01:12.659> from

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
power is converted to DC from

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.679

alternating current to direct current

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.039 
alternating current to direct current
kind<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> car<00:01:17.430> battery<00:01:17.700> system<00:01:18.509> now

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
kind of like a car battery system now

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.960 
kind of like a car battery system now
the<00:01:19.110> nice<00:01:19.470> thing<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.830> computers<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the nice thing about computers in the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
the nice thing about computers in the
21st<00:01:21.509> century<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.890> almost

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
21st century is that it's almost

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.140 
21st century is that it's almost
impossible<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.450> plug<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:25.049> power<00:01:25.320> supply<00:01:25.799> in

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
impossible to plug your power supply in

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.330 
impossible to plug your power supply in
incorrectly<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.900> only<00:01:28.170> fit<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.860> way

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
incorrectly they can only fit one way

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.429 
incorrectly they can only fit one way
here's<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.299> main<00:01:30.540> power<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
here's the main power for the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.440 
here's the main power for the
motherboard<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.220> look<00:01:32.700> I'm<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> do

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
motherboard now look I'm going to do

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.039 
motherboard now look I'm going to do
here<00:01:33.780> ah<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:35.430> clicks<00:01:35.880> into<00:01:36.119> place<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.869> as

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
here ah it clicks into place and as

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.020 
here ah it clicks into place and as
you'll<00:01:37.259> notice<00:01:37.500> nothing<00:01:38.310> else<00:01:38.729> has<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you'll notice nothing else has a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.219 
you'll notice nothing else has a
connector<00:01:39.509> quite<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.579> takes

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
connector quite like that it takes

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
connector quite like that it takes
alternating<00:01:43.229> current<00:01:43.619> AC<00:01:43.740> current<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
alternating current AC current it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.569 
alternating current AC current it
transforms<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> into<00:01:45.869> DC<00:01:46.590> current<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.070> then

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
transforms it into DC current and then

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.760 
transforms it into DC current and then
it<00:01:47.850> sends<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.780> various<00:01:49.560> different

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it sends it out to various different

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.940 
it sends it out to various different
wires<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:51.000> power<00:01:51.270> different<00:01:52.020> things<00:01:52.259> inside

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
wires to power different things inside

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.490 
wires to power different things inside
your<00:01:53.250> computer<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.540> fan<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
your computer like the fan like the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.819 
your computer like the fan like the
processor<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.700> nice<00:01:56.939> thing<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.469> read<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
processor the nice thing is read the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.700 
processor the nice thing is read the
flippin<00:01:59.399> manual<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> tell<00:02:01.500> you
