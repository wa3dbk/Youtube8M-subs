00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
step up to that because that's a huge

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.420 
step up to that because that's a huge
improvement<00:03:00.240> it's<00:03:00.540> gonna<00:03:00.660> make<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.680> call<00:03:02.310> of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
improvement it's gonna make the call of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.570 
improvement it's gonna make the call of
duty<00:03:02.460> series<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.920> thousand<00:03:04.920> times<00:03:05.010> better<00:03:05.280> I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
duty series a thousand times better I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.490 
duty series a thousand times better I
think<00:03:06.210> because<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.690> lag<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
think because the lag is that one of the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
think because the lag is that one of the
main<00:03:07.650> problems<00:03:07.680> anyways<00:03:08.430> subscribe<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.360> knew

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
main problems anyways subscribe you knew
