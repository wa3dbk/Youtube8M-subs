00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.370
 in today's switching session tutorial 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.820
 I'll show you one of the problems on the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.000
 most often occur and that is when it is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.960
 There are two to go under 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.769
 very widespread coils carpathians 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.470
 that's one of those here one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.140
 can have one pin up and another 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.090
 one under gay corp without thong 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.040
 both are alike that they shut up 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.910
 have at it under the coil better 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.860
 can hold 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 at the same time a small one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.850
 function has to later the coil too 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.579
 hold 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.410
 the under coil is threaded so that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.600
 The one has a coil ideally 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.969
 in the coils also fit in there 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.550
 sometimes you have several at home as well 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.430
 I and I would see this under 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.880
 Spool stands out what not a spool 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 An hour coil should always be flush 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.100
 close with the coil corp and you 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.619
 should not be able to wiggle back and forth 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.280
 in a further consequence I explain you the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.100
 and the coils corp has one here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.909
 clamp on it will be with this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.979
 screw pressed tightly 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.740
 should it be that your underrun 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.170
 Too easy to be loose 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.689
 With this screw you could completely 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.150
 easily occur or turn around the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.450
 increase or decrease tension 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.060
 it is important that when you are at the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.790
 thread that attracts the coil in the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:57.360
 turn clockwise and you pull the 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.640
 thread then into the slot of the under 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.830
 coil and very important and the jam 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.430
 feather 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.520
 the coil should hold without that 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.020
 falls off and only on light 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.800
 give way back 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.530
 Use the principle of underrun 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.070
 works after the lock key 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.100
 Principle of the pin should engage 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.350
 for those who want to know if that 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.770
 also correct is last in time 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.540
 the small flap and then after the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.360
 key in and press pure 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.520
 this click make it again betrays you 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.120
 that the school really tears properly 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.640
 it looks a little bit boring 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.920
 side hangs 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.410
 and now the upper thread I have in the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.260
 last session yes already right 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:02.820
 keep feeling for the year run over 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.650
 turn the handwheel to you and now 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.380
 you see , play again right away 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.870
 that the picture arises here becomes one 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.400
 thread sling made of claw that 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.880
 this tap is pulling down here 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.000
 loop 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.480
 then he puts on under colors 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.480
 Mr. above 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.630
 the principle of underrun and thread 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.180
 education and looping education and 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.730
 Education is great to understand 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.100
 notary as a sweet video from the broadcast 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.410
 with the mouse like a sewing machine 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:51.470
 does the cold and the 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.470
 peace policy and fragile
