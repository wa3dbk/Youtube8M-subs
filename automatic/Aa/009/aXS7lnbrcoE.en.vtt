CAMH<00:00:02.399> has<00:00:02.639> had<00:00:02.850> an<00:00:03.780> interest<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.830> really<00:00:05.100> made

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
CAMH has had an interest and really made

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.570 
CAMH has had an interest and really made
driving<00:00:06.690> issues<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> research<00:00:07.620> priority<00:00:08.370> for

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
driving issues a research priority for

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.640 
driving issues a research priority for
many<00:00:08.730> years<00:00:09.059> what<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:09.599> need<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.019> understand<00:00:10.500> of

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
many years what we need to understand of

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.280 
many years what we need to understand of
course<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.160> how<00:00:11.750> various<00:00:12.750> things<00:00:13.019> influence

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
course is how various things influence

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.379 
course is how various things influence
driving<00:00:14.040> behavior<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:14.790> need<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> understand

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
driving behavior we need to understand

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.500 
driving behavior we need to understand
how<00:00:15.570> alcohol<00:00:16.520> drugs<00:00:17.520> like<00:00:17.699> cannabis<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
how alcohol drugs like cannabis and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.220 
how alcohol drugs like cannabis and
cocaine<00:00:20.390> therapeutic<00:00:21.390> drugs<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> medicinal

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
cocaine therapeutic drugs and medicinal

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
cocaine therapeutic drugs and medicinal
drugs<00:00:22.500> might<00:00:23.100> influence<00:00:23.490> driving<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.359> so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
drugs might influence driving and so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.439 
drugs might influence driving and so
that's<00:00:25.320> why<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.150> driving

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that's why we have this driving

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.480 
that's why we have this driving
simulator<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.260> undertaking<00:00:28.500> really<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
simulator we're undertaking really a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.160 
simulator we're undertaking really a
series<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> projects<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.750> look<00:00:30.900> at<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
series of projects to look at the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.260 
series of projects to look at the
effects<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.679> drugs<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.460> cannabis<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
effects of drugs like cannabis and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.139 
effects of drugs like cannabis and
alcohol<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.340> how<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:35.850> influence

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
alcohol and so on and how they influence

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
alcohol and so on and how they influence
driving<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.920> factors<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.670> might

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
driving and the factors that might

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.970 
driving and the factors that might
affect<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.540> influence<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.590> we're<00:00:40.800> really

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
affect that influence so we're really

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
affect that influence so we're really
beginning<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.820> research<00:00:42.329> initiative<00:00:42.960> now

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
beginning that research initiative now

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830 
beginning that research initiative now
and<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:44.430> exciting<00:00:44.579> time<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.210> us<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and it's a very exciting time for us the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410 
and it's a very exciting time for us the
the<00:00:46.260> simulator<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.640> purchased<00:00:48.120> through

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the simulator was was purchased through

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.049 
the simulator was was purchased through
funds<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> canada<00:00:50.399> foundation<00:00:50.910> for

organizations for this work and and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
organizations for this work and and
we're<00:01:01.980> starting<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:02.699> we're<00:01:03.390> very<00:01:03.420> excited

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
we're starting it now we're very excited

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
we're starting it now we're very excited
about<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> results<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.310> think

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
about the results and it's it's I think

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.450 
about the results and it's it's I think
in<00:01:08.790> many<00:01:09.570> ways<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.680> look<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
in many ways we we look at the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.630 
in many ways we we look at the
epidemiologic<00:01:12.330> data<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.979> look<00:01:14.130> at<00:01:14.280> survey

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
epidemiologic data we look at survey

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
epidemiologic data we look at survey
data<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.659> need<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.020> understand

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
data but we really need to understand

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.130 
data but we really need to understand
how<00:01:16.820> drugs<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.000> cannabis<00:01:18.509> affect<00:01:18.869> driving

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
how drugs like cannabis affect driving

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.230 
how drugs like cannabis affect driving
behavior<00:01:19.950> before<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> complete

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
behavior before we can get a complete

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.810 
behavior before we can get a complete
picture<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.960> what<00:01:24.110> what<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.400> what

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
picture of what what it is that we what

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450

the<00:01:26.970> risks<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.540> associated<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.500> drugs<00:01:29.310> like

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the risks are associated with drugs like

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.760 
the risks are associated with drugs like
cannabis<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.060> cocaine<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.530> might<00:01:31.710> be

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
cannabis or cocaine and what we might be

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.370 
cannabis or cocaine and what we might be
able<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.700> ameliorate<00:01:33.360> those<00:01:33.720> risks<00:01:34.110> and

behavior<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.880> think<00:02:11.450> we<00:02:11.570> should<00:02:11.600> we<00:02:11.960> should

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
behavior I think we should we should

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.670 
behavior I think we should we should
recognize<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.710> for<00:02:13.520> many<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.940> us<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
recognize that for many of us the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.680 
recognize that for many of us the
driving<00:02:15.680> task<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.400> one<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.030> most<00:02:17.150> complex

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
driving task is one of the most complex

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.860 
driving task is one of the most complex
things<00:02:18.050> one<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.440> most<00:02:18.620> complex

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
things one of the most complex

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.450 
things one of the most complex
psychomotor<00:02:20.870> tasks<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.530> will<00:02:21.680> ever<00:02:21.890> do<00:02:22.190> and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
psychomotor tasks that will ever do and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.740 
psychomotor tasks that will ever do and
we<00:02:23.120> do<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.300> on<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.570> regular<00:02:23.690> basis<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:26.150> we

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
we do it on a regular basis and and we

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.810 
we do it on a regular basis and and we
often<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.560> think<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:27.890> don't<00:02:28.040> recognize<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
often I think we don't recognize the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.330 
often I think we don't recognize the
extent<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.240> which<00:02:31.780> driving<00:02:32.920> related<00:02:33.920> issues

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
extent to which driving related issues

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.430 
extent to which driving related issues
influence<00:02:34.820> our<00:02:34.970> life<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.810> course<00:02:36.020> being

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
influence our life and of course being

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.530 
influence our life and of course being
involved<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:37.010> collisions<00:02:37.550> influenced<00:02:38.450> our

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
involved in collisions influenced our

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.810 
involved in collisions influenced our
life<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:38.959> well<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:40.030> we<00:02:41.030> know<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.450> that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
life as well and so we know that that

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.250 
life as well and so we know that that
motor<00:02:43.820> vehicle<00:02:44.300> collisions<00:02:44.720> are<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> leading

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
motor vehicle collisions are a leading

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.810 
motor vehicle collisions are a leading
source<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.400> death<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.840> serious<00:02:48.230> injury

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
source of of death and of serious injury

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.449 
source of of death and of serious injury
we<00:02:49.820> know<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.300> there<00:02:50.650> we<00:02:51.650> suspect<00:02:52.370> that

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
we know that there we suspect that

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.880 
we know that there we suspect that
they're<00:02:52.760> an<00:02:53.330> important<00:02:53.840> contributor<00:02:54.380> for

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
they're an important contributor for

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.640 
they're an important contributor for
example<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.520> why<00:02:55.870> folks<00:02:56.870> with<00:02:57.110> with<00:02:57.410> many

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
example to why folks with with many

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.770 
example to why folks with with many
kinds<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.040> psychiatric<00:02:58.370> disorders<00:02:59.120> are<00:02:59.360> more

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
kinds of psychiatric disorders are more

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.080 
kinds of psychiatric disorders are more
likely<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:01.430> an<00:03:01.550> increased<00:03:01.880> mortality

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
likely to have an increased mortality

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.540 
likely to have an increased mortality
rate<00:03:02.750> once<00:03:03.170> they're<00:03:03.380> diagnosed<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:04.250> on<00:03:04.400> so

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
rate once they're diagnosed and so on so

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.300 
rate once they're diagnosed and so on so
so<00:03:05.270> it's<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:05.959> an<00:03:06.110> important<00:03:06.560> area<00:03:06.800> for<00:03:06.950> us

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
so it's a it's an important area for us

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.800 
so it's a it's an important area for us
from<00:03:07.580> from<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.030> perspective<00:03:08.660> of

from from the perspective of

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.810 
from from the perspective of
understanding<00:03:09.740> addictive<00:03:10.130> behaviors<00:03:10.580> and
