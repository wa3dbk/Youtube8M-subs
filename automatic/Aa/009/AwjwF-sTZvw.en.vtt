00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.340

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.220
 where we can see the cover of the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.829
 official club penguin notebook a little more 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 modern as we can see the buttons are 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:37.230
 updated and then the play button 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.829
 it's like more well-designed buttons 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.170
 they are clearer and here we can see 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.190
 well here we can change the language that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 in previous cover it could not be changed 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.829
 here we have another one button different to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.550
 the previous one and the these buttons before 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.739
 they were here and now they are here 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.879
 good if you realize and you do not have 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.570
 that fix a lot because we can change not 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.940

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.530

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.280

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.890

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.410
 you have to reach 50 thousand to improve the 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.590
 habitats of the monkeys as this code 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.530
 there is the code that we have to use 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.289
 at the moment and two thousand 574 costumes of 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.720
 unlocked monkey and two thousand 574 dollars 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.730

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.220

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.890
 this article 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.160
 we also have the code in club 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.760
 penguin churros 4.4 dotcom 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.910
 in the part here is why we copy it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.310
 that I'm not going to copy 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.790
 and we are going to try to enter the club 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.790
 penguin 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.400

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.560
 very well once we enter the chest of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:45.260
 those of the book the treasures 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:49.940
 we have to unlock the code and 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:55.660
 because the code is monkey 4 and we're going 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.540
 the uppercase monkey and monkey 4 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.530
 and we give it to next is what we see 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.470
 this disguise we will go in to see how 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.070
 it looks 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.070
 all right 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.890

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.579
 monkey yes or something like that I heard it and then 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.829
 is in danger of extinction seems to me 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.030
 is that I see many documentaries that 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.650
 sometimes I do not understand them very much and 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.950
