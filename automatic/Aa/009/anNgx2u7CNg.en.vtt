00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.359
 when it comes to choosing a motorcycle to 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.390
 take the road always generate doubt which 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.879
 style is more appropriate for costs and 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.530
 foreign but opens 3 can get close 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.420
 of perfection and why not 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.370
 sport-touring with protection 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 aerodynamics by lowering the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 Wind is ine 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.160
 that's why we 're here six hours from 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.340
 morning leaving the publisher's our idea is 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.050
 running for over ten hours there in three 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.840
 styles and three motorcycles are 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.680
 reference within each fat boy style 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.390
 lia ray and gs 1200 any your bike and 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.900
 depending on the visual we will know in 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 practice what each now offers 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.310
 the first stop of our adventure and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.650
 I could see that at the expense you are a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.870
 limited mobility of the motorcycle. 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.729
 I can not lift the bank impact 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.830
 my leg is very forward then 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.560
 will have to take a little more hand in the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.240
 mostly everyone thinks 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.180
 that she is uncomfortable but if you 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.120
 know how to use your posture the right way 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.810
 she will be much more comfortable 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.480
 sustains here 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.670
 your weight on the leg and abdomen leave the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.530
 much freer arm with impact 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.870
 Can you absorb that energy? 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.910
 is always here absorbing then 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.540
 pressure is here not only of the weight above 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.190
 one million 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.920
 you can get much better my 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.080
 guide out the comfort of the fairing she is 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.650
 going very well on the road in question 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.360
 comfort and also opens training quite 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.550
 now with a good upgrade posture her 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.730
 I think it's the middle ground here the bank 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.860
 very soft and especially those that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.530
 suspension it has a much larger course 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.260
 then an immediate understanding of a hole is 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.209
 super smooth and even return it back 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.670
 a much smoother way much more 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.190
 slow and that Elano whip out that 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.530
 the aerodynamic protection is fantastic 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.900
 So far so good is she 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.700
 hayabusa radio and also just that it was not 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.920
 a short ride still has eight hours 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.820
 I 'm already well with other people. 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.820
 impressions and leave 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.720
 made them a rather 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.760
 people serving more than nine hours have 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.850
 playing around for about three hours 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.460
 For more then it will come out a little 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.230
 Morning will come back at night she predator 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.230
 although it had the black 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.160
 We 're getting there at the end of the day. 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.720
 enough with the three bikes 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.690
 is each has a characteristic 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.120
 completely different from the other wants 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.190
 I like not thinking of anything, just get the 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.860
 road is the radio more partners more 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.300
 courses that do not have as much autonomy 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.370
 wear a little more you want one 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.160
 little more sportsmanship with content 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.160
 long time the hayabusa out of 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.290
 series and shelter you do not know to 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.120
 where you will decide on time and in 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.980
 a mountain so that it can descend to the 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.980
 coast do what you want 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.520
 Look at this place, I think it's very 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.129
 trip for all bikes but it's a place 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.249
 I always came here to see the sunset. 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.249
 Sun 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.590
 already ran more than 12 hours now 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.570
 Olga reversed back to sao paulo has 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.720
 another hour and a half there for us 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.730
 to go to hayabusa is comfortable but 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.940
 after the excess we feel a little 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.780
 arm a little neck in position a 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.370
 harley 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.250
 now that he's trying to put together a 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.320
 played only we saw that it is not the beach 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.330
 accompanied by the transformer she does not 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.270
 It's the same rhythm, who's with her? 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.370
 always walking the limit of what 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.090
 can in the curve it has a very limited 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:51.150
 lower than the others and bm as 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.700
 all mini 3 if you want to get the 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.370
 motorcycle to drive the same good for 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.860
 To run Brazil, I'm going to leave Brazil . 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.510
 pellegrini step is not with the short time 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.270
 consultant suspension and 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.970
 teacher closes another 1 hour and 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:10.760
 Looked we were going to do about 14 hours 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.760
 then the next 14 hours the album was worth
