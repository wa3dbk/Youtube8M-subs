00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
much effort into a controller and then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
much effort into a controller and then
will<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> simple<00:01:27.960> simple

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
part of it we flip it back you can see

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.060 
part of it we flip it back you can see
that<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.049> prongs<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.890> lot

that the prongs if you will are a lot

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
that the prongs if you will are a lot
longer<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.970> looks<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> lot<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.479> the

around a few times it just bit the dust
they<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.540> ended<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:25.900> having<00:02:26.079> to<00:02:26.230> open

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
they so I ended up having to open

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.750 
they so I ended up having to open
the<00:02:26.590> controller<00:02:26.950> up<00:02:27.189> and<00:02:27.340> change<00:02:27.489> that<00:02:27.670> around

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the controller up and change that around

this<00:03:19.299> one<00:03:19.780> feels<00:03:20.290> like<00:03:20.439> wait<00:03:20.889> times<00:03:21.069> I<00:03:21.250> rigged

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
this one feels like wait times I rigged

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.809 
this one feels like wait times I rigged
a<00:03:21.609> nice<00:03:21.819> kind<00:03:21.909> of<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:23.459> think<00:03:24.459> that

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
a nice kind of but I think that

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.460 
a nice kind of but I think that
comes<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.120> new<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.419> game<00:03:25.569> however<00:03:26.169> when

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
comes in new to the game however when

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.830 
comes in new to the game however when
you<00:03:26.530> try<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.709> think<00:03:27.009> like<00:03:27.220> tricks<00:03:27.579> it's<00:03:27.939> it<00:03:28.180> it

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
you try to think like tricks it's it it
