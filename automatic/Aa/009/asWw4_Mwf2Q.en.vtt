00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
just think that's the best part of the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.869 
just think that's the best part of the
game<00:02:45.379> honestly<00:02:46.379> so<00:02:46.590> far<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:47.010> think<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.669> looks

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
game honestly so far I think it looks

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.979 
game honestly so far I think it looks
insane<00:02:48.919> and<00:02:50.000> i<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:51.359> it's<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.629> also<00:02:51.840> very

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
insane and i think it's be also very

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.520 
insane and i think it's be also very
cool<00:02:52.409> if<00:02:52.859> there's<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.370> way<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.639> you<00:02:54.419> know

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
cool if there's a way to you know

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.159 
cool if there's a way to you know
socially<00:02:55.530> share<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.879> different<00:02:57.359> variants

know the higher rated stuff shows up on
the<00:03:11.639> first<00:03:11.760> page<00:03:12.560> it's<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.950> brings<00:03:14.370> a

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
the first page it's just it brings a

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.330 
the first page it's just it brings a
different<00:03:14.969> aspect<00:03:15.719> to<00:03:16.260> call<00:03:16.469> of<00:03:16.650> duty<00:03:16.919> which<00:03:17.219> i

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
different aspect to call of duty which i

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.770 
different aspect to call of duty which i
think<00:03:17.400> has<00:03:17.579> been<00:03:17.790> kind<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.090> missing<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:18.750> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
think has been kind of missing for a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.479 
think has been kind of missing for a
little<00:03:18.900> bit<00:03:19.079> i<00:03:19.319> think<00:03:19.620> advanced<00:03:20.159> warfare

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
little bit i think advanced warfare

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.059 
little bit i think advanced warfare
brought<00:03:20.790> customization<00:03:21.629> back<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.079> huge

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
brought customization back to a huge

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.550 
brought customization back to a huge
degree<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.819> me<00:03:24.599> know<00:03:24.750> with<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.079> terms<00:03:25.199> of<00:03:25.409> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
degree on me know with in terms of the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.819 
degree on me know with in terms of the
gear<00:03:25.979> that<00:03:26.489> your<00:03:26.639> character<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:27.060> wear<00:03:27.680> but<00:03:28.680> i

see the different you know style gloves
that<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.079> on<00:03:40.319> but<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.979> doesn't<00:03:41.280> really

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
that you have on but it doesn't really

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.899 
that you have on but it doesn't really
you<00:03:41.790> know<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:42.720> doesn't<00:03:43.139> reflect<00:03:44.069> on<00:03:44.459> what<00:03:44.729> you

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
you know it doesn't reflect on what you

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.729 
you know it doesn't reflect on what you
see<00:03:45.150> while<00:03:45.389> you<00:03:45.629> play<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.199> i<00:03:46.259> think<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.650> the

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
see while you play and i think that the

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.979 
see while you play and i think that the
weapon<00:03:47.129> customization<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.479> bit<00:03:48.780> more

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
weapon customization is a bit more

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.559 
weapon customization is a bit more
important<00:03:49.530> because<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:50.069> really<00:03:50.549> get<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.180> see

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
important because you really get to see

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.749 
important because you really get to see
your<00:03:52.290> weapon<00:03:52.739> while<00:03:52.949> you<00:03:53.159> play<00:03:53.400> that's<00:03:53.609> the

your weapon while you play that's the

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.580 
your weapon while you play that's the
most<00:03:53.879> important<00:03:54.479> aspect<00:03:54.659> is<00:03:55.169> what<00:03:55.439> you're

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
most important aspect is what you're

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.009 
most important aspect is what you're
