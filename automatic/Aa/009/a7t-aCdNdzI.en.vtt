00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello guys and welcome back on channels 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.740
 rom managers are here in singapore and seen 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.099
 that many asked me on facebook of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.900
 make the usual prediction video 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.340
 of the 2015 Olympics I thought of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.300
 shoot a video and fast here too 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.439
 then the Olympia is coming and between 20 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.590
 days 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.230
 which in my opinion are the favorites la 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 battle is always among the usual ifs 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.099
 want 34 athletes I had seen the photos of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.260
 children wounded cai green clement yes 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.960
 will contend this year's title 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.719
 of the mister olympia 2015 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.329
 between the two I sincerely believe that it's over 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.700
 will still have the best for a series of 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.670
 reasons one of the main reasons 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.280
 the famous case of grapefruit and cai 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.680
 green as well as where the facts that is seen 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
 the gay for pay episode which is a lot 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.780
 widespread among others bil'in falbo 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.969
 professional cai green can think 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.859
 even just once to win the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.629
 hence the title of mister olympia 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.360
 organizers are always looking for a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.030
 ambassador for the sport of bodybuilding 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.130
 and therefore I am an athlete who has done 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.920
 stuff like that and you can among other things 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.950
 still look for something on google if one 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.560
 ago kay kay kay grinder way fruit that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.890
 it would be for grapefruit in English located 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.400
 indeed some images are little 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.500
 decent 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 definitely not from ambassador to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.590
 bodybuilding sports at the level 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.470
 international therefore for this reason 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.740
 according to me kay kay green will come again 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.390
 second and philippe will win is right or 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.570
 sincerely wrong also from the point 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.829
 view of the symmetry lines 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.079
 I still prefer a wire from a cai 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.640
 green high green and is always becoming 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.930
 bigger but really really huge 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.710
 exaggerated and in some districts 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.350
 muscle instead while if you want it over 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.149
 for a moment let's say those lines 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.759
 those symmetries even if in any case 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.560
 stomach and it's getting pretty 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.689
 also expanded for him so if you want 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.009
 another athlete that I really like and 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.649
 I hope he qualifies comes obviously 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.929
 action roden I would hope for almost a second 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.530
 position for him then a step further 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.010
 above compared to the previous ones 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.410
 then another cedric mcmullan I saw 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.700
 some photos even today excellent lines 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.800
 excellent boozer also with classic posing 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.360
 so sincerely hope that yes 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.540
 qualified very well 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.290
 others see brunch warnes well 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.209
 definitely muscle districts 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.470
 phenomenal as the legs the back 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.540
 especially the width of the back 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.100
 phenomenally honestly it has never been 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.380
 an athlete that I liked so much 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.380
 how sorry for many that he always has 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.480
 supported jay cutler those are for me 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.850
 of athletes with very wide hips 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.920
 that do not definitely recall the lines 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.690
 classic so not surely among the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.940
 my favorite athletes 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.030
 and then there is the usual bg 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.260
 obviously many are also waiting for him 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.420
 in short, a huge athlete 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.410
 obviously for those who are fascinated by 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.590
 freaks bg and definitely worth seeing 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.970
 I don't think he'll be able to go up that much 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.350
 higher than the edition 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.050
 precedent however will surely be 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.940
 interesting to see it then instead of 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.440
 surely look at it on youtube 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.660
 so 212 books and obviously here it will be 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.780
 open battle flex lewis said that 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.400
 will return to compete in the web suite 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.230
 just to keep the league is you 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.480
 then continue with his series of 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.090
 victories in this category but then there 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.880
 will be correa will be the same shawn flarida 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.260
 which I take I have known for 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.760
 the very first time during mine 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.359
 first race in 2010 nbf centrality 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.859
 in fact he had begun to compete 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.380
 in the google body building nuts 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.620
 confederations and then after of course it is 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.060
 passed by her fbb got the pro card 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.380
 and therefore interesting to see also 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.480
 the evolution of this athlete that now 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.130
 will compete in the link I don't know 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.959
 actually if you managed to 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.780
 qualify because I looked a moment 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.269
 fast standing here on the iphone 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.100
 then the racing scores of the various 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.739
 athletes who have competed 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.540
 this year, however, 66 will compete 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.950
 certainly interesting they look at us here 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.430
 there are so many other athletes in this one 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.160
 category 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.550
 the same correa then Brazilian 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.909
 I read futsu flex point lately that 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.849
 obviously will try to position itself on the 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:30.530
 podium then other athletes 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.330
 certainly of course the level 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.139
 pee is trying to push a lot 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.639
 the actual one that if you want to gods 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.990
 more similar aesthetic standards if you wish 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.569
 albori classic in comparison with 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.400
 freaks in the open category then there 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.849
 they will be bikinis and here too 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.729
 interesting to see athletes like the 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.539
 paolino amanda la tona is definitely 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.340
 interesting to watch Olympia too 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.159
 for this category 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.069
 so it is always difficult to determine who 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:03.080
 will win in the bikini category 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.550
 also because it depends a lot on how it is 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.590
 will present the athletes the same day 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.500
 of the race and also their preparation 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.240
 in the last few weeks before precisely of 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.889
 get on stage and then it will be 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.080
 definitely an open one 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.150
 open battle between the usual ones 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.729
 favorite and maybe even some athlete 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.639
 emerging therefore as usual 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.949
 I think I'll watch Olympia live 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.080
 now in twenty days online then 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.779
 will surely give the link to it 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.900
 streaming and therefore any one of you 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:36.020
 want to participate in this live on 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.819
 iron manager group usually every year 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.620
 in short, we find ourselves online at night 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:42.020
 in short, let's start commenting when 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.240
 begin filming streaming 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.740

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.289
 interesting fun another way 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.300
 to be together but let me know too 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.020
 you who are your favorites who 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.229
 do you believe 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.529
 will win the olympia mister this year 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.729
 who will win the bikini is up there you eur 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.729

 let me know and let me know 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.229
 in short, these predictions or this one 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.969
 discussion can we say start and then 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.330
 we feel the next among boys a 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.330
