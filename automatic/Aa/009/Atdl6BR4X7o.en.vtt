00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 model BMW 6 series in scale 1 43 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.240
 producers if I pronounce correctly 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.279
 this kyosho maybe i'm wrong 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.800
 I say well, sorry here the model has 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:26.400
 opening hood in my opinion very 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.519
 well made this model i would buy 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.940
 ear because she does not have one mirror 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.030
 here as something over time I will try it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.960
 make that is , the model is separate 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.030
 separate headlights 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.030
 grilles against fog lights 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.680
 wipers are also made separate 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 lateral air ducts 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.020
 This is a vystampovka painted pens for 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.160
 order 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.650
 individual mirrors they are made of 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.210
 some plastic is very fragile therefore 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.549
 there are not enough mirrors on my models 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.960
 rear light is also separate 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:20.040
 the exhaust system even has a hole 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:26.570
 pretty high quality imitates the real 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:30.619
 the salon is also well developed that is it 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.619
 as you can see two-color 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.700
 that we are there and brown seats a little bit 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:43.960
 gleams and gray dashboard me 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.650
 such a model is still of white color and she 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.750
 if I am not mistaken, black interior 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.009
 that is, the manufacturer does 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.229
 Salon is not something like the same 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.000
 each model makes a different salon 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.710
 I understand that there is this model 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.810
 off wheels 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.410
 behind the wheels have brake discs and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.430
 caliper 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:17.080
 that is, I rotate the wheel caliper 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.959
 is in place but brake disc he 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:25.390
 rotates like a real machine 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.370
 together with the wheel on the bottom exhaust 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.420
 system 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.000
 This is a separate part that is completely from 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.570
 beginning is all that gray 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.590
 exhaust system that's raznoshirokie 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.739
 wheels to open the hood on the model 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.510
 there is such a button here 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:54.480
 press the perry button opens 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:55.829
 I will try to open the hood neatly 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.730
 crawl 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:08.920
 not to break anything that is 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:13.060
 there is a v8 engine there probably is 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:18.040
 5 liters or 4 that is also good 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.200
 worked that is who saw the real 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.079
 cars so he drove on such a machine 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.420
 present and when compared to the original 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:30.810
 it is very reliably done here 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.810
 model 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.019
 there are license plates yet 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.330
 when compared with my model second 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.950
 same company with white color which 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:51.280
 there is at the moment 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:52.630
 German license plate models on my 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.260
 the models are simply written there 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:01.019
 bmw x series that is 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.830
 BMW 6 7 that is, the manufacturer is pretty 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.830
 different models makes
