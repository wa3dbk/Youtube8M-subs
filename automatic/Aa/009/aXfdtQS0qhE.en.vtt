00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.450
 video I just finished my live of a 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.389
 couple of hours for those who didn't know when 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.700
 I do my live I invite you to pass 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.070
 on my facebook page to sign up 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.230
 because I always tell you the day the hour 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 I always tell you everything you will always be 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.990
 updated so I invite you to pass 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.580
 in my facebook page is to register them 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.320
 however when you were live I asked the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.900
 people who were following me 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.960
 if they knew the house of the living dead 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.390
 and no one knew what I was talking 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 guys then I did again 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.430
 a mistake of mine because in my opinion it was one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.530
 which is obvious, however, for many of you 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.110
 precisely that they followed the live e 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.579
 I bet so many of you who 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.739
 you are looking at this 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.079
 moment this video you don't know what 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.020
 I'm talking so I'll tell you right away where 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.170
 I find myself exactly up here ahava 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.960
 in v the kills exactly here in here 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.600
 this corner there is a boys house and here 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.030
 in practice there is a really easter egg 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.129
 so to speak funny guys between 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.850
 very funny quotes because 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.610
 this easter egg practically picks up a 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.340
 made very very bad success in the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.479
 united states boys in practice resumes 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 a brutal series of murders guys there 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.009
 series of murders more violent than it is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.439
 succeeded in the united states of america is 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.390
 it really was a chilling thing 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.670
 I won't go into too much detail 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.280
 guys because I know this video is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.189
 they can watch so many people from 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.460
 a really wide age range then 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.299
 for those interested invitation to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.220
 curious to go online and search 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.049
 this digital easter egg inquire 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.430
 on the history that really happened in the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.229
 United States of America 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.060
 now as you can see there are really here 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.329
 very few people are there only 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.820
 these two people to my right 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.619
 sitting under the umbrella is a person 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.899
 He's down there at the barbecue he's cooking 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.409
 something I tell you right away what time it is 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.960
 it's 13 and a quarter let's say it's still 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.270
 very soon because you have to come back here 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.430
 towards evening in the street I leave you now and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.530
 I will come back precisely when the sun 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.120
 will stand 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.610
 and here I am guys like you see the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.409
 sun behind me is setting here 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.069
 it's almost seven in the evening 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:25.349
 and as if by magic the house was filled 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.440
 of people like via firm start video 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.900
 this is reggae lists of the dead 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.629
 living and how you see people here 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.879
 but now they are all alive in an instant 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.250
 just look at something 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.560
 It happens 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.840
 here you guys die like that by magic 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.840
 and you can even get the money 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.870

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.489

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.640

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.120
 Living dead as I told you is a 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.000
 easter egg in my opinion to remember 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.090
 all the heinous murders that exist 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.430
 states in the united states of america 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.349
 I think it's a way to remember 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.980
 this unlikely tragedy to me 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.540
 notice or even to make known 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.450
 also to the new generations what it is 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.910
 success in the history of america too 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.930
 for us maybe to repeat the same 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.000
 mistakes 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.549
