weapons<00:01:01.820> all<00:01:02.300> he<00:01:02.420> does<00:01:02.660> it<00:01:02.899> just<00:01:03.170> ripped<00:01:03.469> it

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620

just<00:01:03.829> instantly<00:01:04.309> appears<00:01:04.729> in<00:01:04.879> my<00:01:04.970> hands<00:01:05.420> I

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
just instantly appears in my hands I

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.580 
just instantly appears in my hands I
don't<00:01:08.420> know<00:01:08.479> if<00:01:08.570> that's<00:01:08.750> meant<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.140> be<00:01:09.229> there

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
don't know if that's meant to be there

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.890 
don't know if that's meant to be there
but<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.890> seems<00:01:10.130> kind<00:01:10.369> of<00:01:10.400> lazy<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:11.659> switch

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
but that seems kind of lazy to switch

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.950 
but that seems kind of lazy to switch
weapons<00:01:12.140> like<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:13.360> there's<00:01:14.360> no<00:01:14.420> animation

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
weapons like that there's no animation

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:24.730 
weapons like that there's no animation
of<00:01:15.259> him<00:01:15.380> switching<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.920> weapon<00:01:23.560> unless<00:01:24.560> he's

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
of him switching the weapon unless he's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.950 
of him switching the weapon unless he's
just<00:01:24.950> taking<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.610> scope<00:01:26.180> on<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.600> off<00:01:26.720> but

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
just taking the scope on and off but

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.540 
just taking the scope on and off but
still<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:27.350> seems<00:01:27.500> kind<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.800> lazy<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.280> not<00:01:28.399> have

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
still it seems kind of lazy to not have

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.210 
still it seems kind of lazy to not have
an<00:01:28.700> animation<00:01:29.000> for<00:01:29.300> that<00:01:29.680> whatever<00:01:32.110> example

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
an animation for that whatever example

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.930 
an animation for that whatever example
