really<00:01:45.630> recommend<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.500> either<00:01:46.710> impact

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
really recommend this one either impact

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.429 
really recommend this one either impact
is<00:01:47.460> probably<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.420> weaker<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> impact

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
is probably the weaker of impact

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.800 
is probably the weaker of impact
puncture<00:01:49.829> slash<00:01:50.270> puncture<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.360> definitely<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
puncture slash puncture is definitely a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.149 
puncture slash puncture is definitely a
little<00:01:51.990> bit<00:01:52.110> better<00:01:52.380> especially<00:01:52.530> versus

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
little bit better especially versus

little bit better especially versus
grenier<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.240> type<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> thing<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.869> slash

grenier and that type of thing and slash

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
grenier and that type of thing and slash
is<00:01:55.590> gonna<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> absolute<00:01:56.549> in-game<00:01:57.090> damage

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
is gonna be the absolute in-game damage

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.789 
is gonna be the absolute in-game damage
tight<00:01:57.780> especially<00:01:58.200> once<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.469> start<00:01:58.680> wearing

tight especially once you start wearing
coaster<00:01:59.250> projections<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.689> I'd<00:02:00.990> add<00:02:01.469> one

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
coaster projections so I'd add one

out of left field I've know where this
came<00:02:20.940> from<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.290> little<00:02:22.590> bit<00:02:22.680> better

well he might want to look out for those

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.110 
well he might want to look out for those
things<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.830> perfectly<00:02:38.459> accurate<00:02:38.700> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
things it's not perfectly accurate and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.150 
things it's not perfectly accurate and
you've<00:02:39.239> got<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.870> course<00:02:40.019> projectile<00:02:40.769> travel

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
you've got of course projectile travel

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.680 
you've got of course projectile travel
time<00:02:41.340> now<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.640> does<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:42.090> little<00:02:42.420> bit<00:02:42.540> more

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
time now this does a little bit more

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.559 
time now this does a little bit more
damage<00:02:42.959> than<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.319> original<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:45.060> about<00:02:45.239> ten

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
damage than the original it's about ten

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.479 
damage than the original it's about ten
or<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:45.750> more<00:02:45.930> damage<00:02:46.290> than<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> original<00:02:46.950> it

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
or so more damage than the original it

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.039 
or so more damage than the original it
has<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> little<00:02:48.120> bit<00:02:48.269> more<00:02:48.329> fire<00:02:48.720> rate

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
has a little bit more fire rate

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.870 
has a little bit more fire rate
originally<00:02:49.650> had<00:02:49.739> about<00:02:49.950> six<00:02:50.250> point<00:02:50.489> six<00:02:50.760> this

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
originally had about six point six this

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.600 
originally had about six point six this
has<00:02:51.090> about<00:02:51.390> seven<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.470> has<00:02:52.530> more<00:02:53.069> crit<00:02:53.340> chance

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
has about seven it has more crit chance

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.910 
has about seven it has more crit chance
the<00:02:53.910> original<00:02:54.269> head<00:02:54.480> about<00:02:54.810> 2.5<00:02:55.440> crit<00:02:55.769> chance

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
the original head about 2.5 crit chance

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.960 
the original head about 2.5 crit chance
this<00:02:56.130> has<00:02:56.340> ten

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
this has ten

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.720 
this has ten
this<00:02:57.569> has<00:02:57.780> more<00:02:57.989> crit<00:02:58.260> damage<00:02:58.410> 1.5<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.579> two

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
this has more crit damage 1.5 up to two

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.270 
this has more crit damage 1.5 up to two
times<00:02:59.910> great<00:03:00.269> damage<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:01.440> believe<00:03:01.799> this

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
times great damage and I believe this

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.589 
times great damage and I believe this
also<00:03:02.519> has<00:03:03.110> more<00:03:04.579> status<00:03:05.579> chance<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> think

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
also has more status chance so I think

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.490 
also has more status chance so I think
the<00:03:06.870> original<00:03:07.040> 10%<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.099> has<00:03:08.310> 15%<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.349> is

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the original 10% this has 15% so this is

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.080 
the original 10% this has 15% so this is
definitely<00:03:10.739> an<00:03:10.980> upgrade<00:03:11.099> now<00:03:11.489> how<00:03:11.700> much<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:12.000> an

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
definitely an upgrade now how much of an

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.059 
definitely an upgrade now how much of an
upgrade<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.629> is<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.019> don't<00:03:13.290> know<00:03:13.410> just<00:03:13.920> keep

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
upgrade this is I don't know just keep

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.319 
upgrade this is I don't know just keep
in<00:03:14.190> mind<00:03:14.220> we<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.790> talked<00:03:14.970> about<00:03:15.030> heavy

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
in mind we just talked about heavy

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.020 
in mind we just talked about heavy
trauma<00:03:15.660> not<00:03:15.900> being<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.319> best<00:03:16.639> damage<00:03:17.639> type

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
trauma not being the best damage type

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.090 
trauma not being the best damage type
overall<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:18.959> purely<00:03:19.410> puncture<00:03:19.889> with<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
overall this is purely puncture with a

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.890 
overall this is purely puncture with a
little<00:03:20.340> bit<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.519> impact<00:03:20.639> no<00:03:21.120> slash<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.720> this

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
little bit of impact no slash so this

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.809 
little bit of impact no slash so this
definitely<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.530> an<00:03:23.040> in-game<00:03:23.400> weapon

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
definitely is not an in-game weapon

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.879 
definitely is not an in-game weapon
especially<00:03:24.389> if<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> run<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.350> dedicated

this<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.150> not<00:03:30.359> gonna<00:03:30.569> be<00:03:30.660> your<00:03:30.780> best<00:03:31.079> bet<00:03:31.349> for

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
in-game or anything like that but maybe

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.569 
in-game or anything like that but maybe
for<00:03:34.139> some<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.410> your<00:03:34.530> middle<00:03:34.859> game<00:03:35.040> Dornier

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
that type of thing you may be even if

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.020 
that type of thing you may be even if
you're<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.530> long<00:03:37.769> but<00:03:38.430> your<00:03:38.579> damage<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:38.910> gonna

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you're so long but your damage is gonna

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.089 
you're so long but your damage is gonna
be<00:03:39.180> nice<00:03:39.359> not<00:03:39.599> as<00:03:39.750> bad<00:03:39.930> as<00:03:40.079> impact<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:40.950> you

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
be nice not as bad as impact but you

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.650 
be nice not as bad as impact but you
definitely<00:03:41.519> can<00:03:41.639> maybe<00:03:41.819> get<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.239> puncture

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.170 
definitely can maybe get that puncture
damage<00:03:42.690> up<00:03:43.169> and<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:44.489> would<00:03:44.609> be<00:03:44.760> okay<00:03:45.120> but

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
damage up and that would be okay but

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.150

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
chance on shotguns I believe the Tigers

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.580 
chance on shotguns I believe the Tigers
in<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.610> head<00:04:36.760> camp<00:04:36.970> about<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.210> 25%<00:04:37.900> status

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.400 
in the head camp about a 25% status

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
chance and thus grunting rate has about

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.530 
chance and thus grunting rate has about
40<00:04:41.980> so<00:04:42.160> even<00:04:42.430> though<00:04:42.520> there's<00:04:42.700> 60%<00:04:43.240> status

definitely can pick this up now this is
better<00:05:22.930> than<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.170> original<00:05:23.200> scanner<00:05:23.830> clearly

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
better than the original scanner clearly

the original scan as a starter weapon
that's<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.560> no-brainer<00:05:26.710> this<00:05:27.610> has<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:27.880> faster

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
that's a no-brainer this has a faster
