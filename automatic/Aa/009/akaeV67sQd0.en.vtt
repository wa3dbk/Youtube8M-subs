00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.519
 Hello! I'm Susana from Pink &amp; Fun and I'll show you another album I've done, also for a boy 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.900
 this is an album made with papers of size 20 x 20 cents 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.000
 so it's a little bigger 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.029
 than the ones I usually do 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.439
 so I'll show you: it's the cover 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.529
 on the cover I used a little doll 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.220
 which is a kind of waterfall 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.930
 I then left below the link 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.920
 where did I get the file? 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.160
 of this 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.000
 dinosaur, crocodile (I do not know what it is) of this animal 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.000
 Spine ... back ... 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.480
 Well the first page 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.310
 on the first page 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.890
 put 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.470
 a photo mat for 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.000
 photos 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.450
 and here a small label for notes 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.060
 and here a "post-its" - I wrote until "just a note" - and are a "post its" for 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.330
 when the photo is placed if the person wants by the date, 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.000
 some information about the photo, just take off from here the "post it" and put together with the photo 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 All pages have the pocket 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.460
 as it has also been usual for me to do 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.950
 I like this scheme 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.320
 which is the scheme of Kathy Ortha, I think it's very cute 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.730
 I like very much 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.500
 This side... 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.330
 it is so, I on some of the pages did not put anything, I left the pages blank, 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.360
 to give people the chance to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.450
 to paste the photos the way they want, do not have to be bound what I 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.600
 I thought I should, what I would think - has nothing to do 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 and then in some of them I left the "photo mat" 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.110
 for the person to use 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.610
 to put the photo on top but on others I left totally free 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.470
 there is still a 3rd option that was ... 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.209
 which is (...) I left "photo mats" loose 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.099
 and so 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.120
 each... 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.210
 when they are collar choose where they want to put, how they want to put, choose the position, 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.659
 choose the pages where you want them 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.959
 I just let them loose to give freedom 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.529
 to do what you also want 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.419
 because the album is not going to be for me 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.869
 and I like to give 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:36.939
 do what they understand 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.989
 I think freedom in these things 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.479
 also has to be given because this is a very personal thing 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:49.300
 but here anyway I put the "photo mat" and here behind was the "tag" guardadinha 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.200
 Here, the same scheme, plus 2 rugs 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.749
 for the person to orient himself 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:03.849
 here is behind the little doll - the little doll is also loose to give hypothesis 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.069
 to spread the photos better 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:13.069
 this is already free 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.159
 and this is not free at all, this is ... 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.400
 here are the 2 spaces for the photos, here 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.939
 the "tag" 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.049
 this side has only a small pocket 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.719
 so this also turns out to be a free space 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.459
 to put this, or nothing or what the person understands 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.469
 and I have here 2 little stickers that I printed from a website 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.659
 that the colors matched quite well 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.869
 are printables, here is where 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:48.139
 They were removed 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.510
 but I'll leave it too 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.139
 the information below 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.139
 so that if you want, you can 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:04:00.139
 also go to print the same labels 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:10.100
 one more pocket 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.629
 Here, I put an envelope 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:20.239
 on the other (Dinis Album) was a fake envelope 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.599
 in this one I have a real envelope 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.000
 always gives to put something of the child 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.699
 that the person wants to save 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.909
 and ends up staying here together 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.409
 with the other little things 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.139
 it works 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.370
 and besides that it is also a free space 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.400
 to put something 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.809
 here, behind this ribbon that I stamped, is one more note 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.710
 it's also a free space 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.300
 and here is the name 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.409
 of the boy 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.879
 to be put together with a photo, on top of a photo, type ... so 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:57.910
 the photograph 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.300
 it's the name 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.509
 These things 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.000
 I like to also leave it to the discretion of who will receive this 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.600
 And here another "photo mat" 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.919
 Here is a little monkey that is loose 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.919
 is loose from the tummy down to give a chance to put too ... 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:41.400
 these are all free 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.389
 and we reached the last page 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:53.000
 where I do not have much more other things than this 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.559
 and here a little joke just for 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:02.000
 put here some photos inside, wardadinhas 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.900
 fits here 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.999
 And that's it, it's another album 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:19.589
 any doubt, any suggestion, anything that I want to put 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:21.469
 make yourselves comfortable 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.650
 both by youtube, as by facebook, as by email 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.889
 can always contact me - or by blog - can always contact me 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.000
 that I will answer your questions 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.910
 Suggestions, 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.259
 I would also like to receive them 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.000
 I hope you enjoyed this video, 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.629
 Thank you so much for having been watching.
