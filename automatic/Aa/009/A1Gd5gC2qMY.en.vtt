00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
know with the right wallpaper would look

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.570

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
folder here so you can see that you know

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.479 
folder here so you can see that you know
pretty<00:01:46.289> much<00:01:46.349> all<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.709> stock<00:01:46.950> apps<00:01:47.160> are<00:01:47.340> all

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:47.489 
pretty much all the stock apps are all

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.270 
pretty much all the stock apps are all
skinned<00:01:47.849> here<00:01:48.119> actually<00:01:48.709> so<00:01:49.709> that's<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
skinned here actually so that's the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219 
skinned here actually so that's the
second<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> three<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:51.959> to<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
second of the three and if we go to the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.650 
second of the three and if we go to the
last<00:01:52.259> one<00:01:52.739> you'll<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.489> it's<00:01:53.670> even<00:01:54.539> more

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
last one you'll see it's even more

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.589 
last one you'll see it's even more
differently<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.560> gave<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:55.830> Supreme<00:01:56.280> One

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
differently so we gave the Supreme One

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.359 
differently so we gave the Supreme One
again<00:01:57.599> with<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> different<00:01:57.899> logo<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.739> on<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
again with a different logo and on the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.850 
again with a different logo and on the
boot<00:01:59.520> screen<00:01:59.550> there<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.349> the<00:02:01.349> like<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
boot screen there and the like so the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.080 
boot screen there and the like so the
first<00:02:02.069> one<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.250> probably<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.640> favorite<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090

just to try and get it and you know

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.190 
just to try and get it and you know
looking<00:02:08.340> good<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.759> terms<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.720> icons<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
looking good in terms of the icons you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.750 
looking good in terms of the icons you
might<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.739> home<00:02:10.920> screen<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.459> you

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
know which are supported and things but

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.500 
know which are supported and things but
and<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.610> final<00:02:14.970> one<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.270> again

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and so this is the final one and again

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.930 
and so this is the final one and again
you<00:02:15.630> can<00:02:15.660> see<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.260> don't
