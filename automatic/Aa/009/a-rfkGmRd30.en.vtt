00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
let's see what's in here here's the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.660 
let's see what's in here here's the
phone<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.930> great<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.980> mean<00:00:38.280> black

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
phone and it's a great one I mean black

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.660 
phone and it's a great one I mean black
was<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> grey<00:00:39.390> rim<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.010> remember<00:00:41.460> my

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
was a grey rim if you remember my

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240 
was a grey rim if you remember my
European<00:00:42.660> version<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.500> black<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.070> with

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
European version was that black one with

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.299 
European version was that black one with
the<00:00:44.340> red<00:00:44.520> rim<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.620> interesting

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the red rim so this will be interesting

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.760 
the red rim so this will be interesting
I<00:00:47.340> actually<00:00:47.610> kind<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> liked<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.270> red<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.440> I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
I actually kind of liked the red but I

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.340 
I actually kind of liked the red but I
think<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.640> gray<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.910> kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.390> understated<00:00:52.079> in

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
think the gray is kind of understated in

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.850 
think the gray is kind of understated in
a<00:00:52.500> nice<00:00:53.070> way<00:00:53.899> let's<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.410> else<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.829> have
