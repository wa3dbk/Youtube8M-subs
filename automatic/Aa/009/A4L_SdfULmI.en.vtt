00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
 welcome to the file seeks the cherry 6 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.590
 i want to show him a few features of the program now and 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.869
 Just start adding some pictures 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.399
 and animal welfare 6 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:15.199
 the TourBooks is the central place where all the elements are contained 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.609
 which you can use in the slideshow 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.289
 to insert pictures I just move 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.640
 the prayer object in the parts 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.099
 He wants my pictures now 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.560
 already they are included in the slideshow 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 to bring the filial piety are the ideal order 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.920
 offers the story offer 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.180
 Kaman now move the pictures comfortably 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.710
 resort as you would like 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.580
 One can also 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.350
 Sumi depending on the degree if you want to see more of those losing the pictures now 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.770
 or a larger overview 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.770
 she wants to procure 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.890
 back to parts 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.940
 if we just pull how it looks like now when I'm 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 happening 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 "Yes, he looks pretty good 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.899
 the transitions do not want to leave anything to chance 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.899
 he just can not get out of the toolbox right now 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.100
 choose crossfade 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 and draw on the pictures 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.650
 If you want to label your pictures, it can be done very easily 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.380
 click on the painted picture 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.390
 and in the properties 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.630
 under text 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.630
 something enters 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500
 Let's try again next time 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.679
 there is more movement against the pictures 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.429
 the pans works 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.659
 and with it, for example 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.249
 to create such effects behind us 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.229
 where the picture moves very easily 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.229
 I'm just sending a new camera panning point 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.989
 and around 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.119
 the feared consequences is that the picture within the five seconds 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.309
 Enables the large section on this small section 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.739
 for example, if I make a picture of several people 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.949
 I could be ahead 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.699
 At first I thought so 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.899
 a face 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.449
 then continue to 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.629
 Units the face 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.979
 and return again 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.979
 the overall view 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.649
 even more possibilities of animation arise when you have several tracks 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.649
 leaves a lot of uses 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.889
 the program itself does not have a fixed number of tracks 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.450
 instead, you can always go through the use of chapters 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.699
 create so many tracks you need at every point 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.699
 Here we go 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.049
 the team doctors breasts tool box 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.249
 a chapter 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.479
 and add 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.479
 two pictures inside 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.639
 These two pictures should now be the background pictures 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.639
 in the foreground I do not now animate two photos 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.699
 Just go to the 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.699
 bottom tab to create a new track 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.379
 and another picture 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.799
 she lies 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.799
 a little later in one is the track 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.449
 Of course that does not make any sense now as long as the pictures do 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.439
 Rethink the background completely 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.170
 To do this, do something smaller that actively executes that background 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.669
 should be 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.889
 the same 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.889
 with the other picture too 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:26.219
 Now for the right pictures to add no picture effect I want ideas right away 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.650
 valid Act 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.650
 looks easy by drag-and-drop on the picture 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.289
 Now I want to achieve an effect that throws the pill like Mr. Rhine 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.879
 I need something more for that 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.169
 and how kinect the picture outside the picture 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.830
 to place 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.900
 Navas a bit bigger 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.419
 and in dark the picture 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.400
 in 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400
 many ideas 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:06.879
 and still something 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.740
 aslant 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.740
 I do the same with the other picture as well 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.809
 place outside only 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.259
 exaggerated 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.259
 enlarge 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.099
 place in de 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.099
 and Porsche rules 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.300
 and so that the background is not too boring 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.440
 miss the app the pictures a Campbell to the effect 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.810
 For this purpose, quite a few are already stored under www congstar 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.279
 just buy the picture 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:53.210
 Suu Kyi 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.730
 Percent movement phases were slightly longer therefore background image as well 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.360
 extended APA so far do not need so far I just something 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 shorter 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.689
 and finally 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.689
 Let's put a text over it 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.379
 so you can make the view bigger again 

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:33.990
 operated 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.330
 push in the right place 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.070
 so we can see what has become of it plays the animals already like 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:40.969
 from this place
