and uh we take our food and we put it
inside<00:00:53.269> the<00:00:53.570> box<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.350> we<00:00:55.250> shook<00:00:55.610> radiation<00:00:56.360> at

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
inside the box and we shook radiation at

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.759 
inside the box and we shook radiation at
it<00:00:57.100> radiation<00:00:58.390> yeah<00:00:59.390> well<00:01:00.110> well<00:01:00.440> it's<00:01:00.589> not

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
it radiation yeah well well it's not

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.060 
it radiation yeah well well it's not
actually<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.489> radiation<00:01:02.449> it's<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.960> pure<00:01:03.589> wave

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
actually a radiation it's a pure wave

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.680 
actually a radiation it's a pure wave
energy<00:01:04.519> ah<00:01:05.200> that<00:01:06.200> makes<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.590> water<00:01:06.830> molecules

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
energy ah that makes the water molecules

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.670 
energy ah that makes the water molecules
spin<00:01:08.690> very<00:01:09.229> fast<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:10.159> cooks<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.850> food<00:01:11.060> and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
spin very fast that cooks the food and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.730 
spin very fast that cooks the food and
that's<00:01:12.680> why<00:01:12.920> sound<00:01:13.760> canta<00:01:14.420> canta<00:01:14.780> travel

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
that's why sound canta canta travel

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.600 
that's why sound canta canta travel
through<00:01:15.890> space<00:01:16.149> but<00:01:17.149> light<00:01:17.750> can<00:01:18.340> space<00:01:19.340> uh

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
through space but light can space uh

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.600 
through space but light can space uh
yeah<00:01:20.600> space<00:01:20.990> Oh<00:01:21.229> like<00:01:21.560> let<00:01:21.799> go<00:01:21.979> like<00:01:22.189> rocket

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
yeah space Oh like let go like rocket

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.109 
yeah space Oh like let go like rocket
ships<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:23.420> know<00:01:23.539> anyways<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.409> have<00:01:24.950> um<00:01:25.250> samba

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
ships you know anyways I have um samba

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
do I have diagrams of rocket ships and a

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.190 
do I have diagrams of rocket ships and a
half<00:01:35.149> equations<00:01:35.689> what<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:36.890> uh<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.909> is

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
half equations what is this uh that is

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.120 
half equations what is this uh that is
my<00:01:39.200> dog<00:01:40.090> micro<00:01:41.090> it's<00:01:42.020> what<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.229> god<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:42.920> what<00:01:43.100> I
