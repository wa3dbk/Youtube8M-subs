00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 bones emily I was coming to you with a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.549
 new video about my favorites from 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.200
 the year 2013 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.340
 and this time I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.910
 products I received from a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.910
 appreciation 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.720
 so I had everything to have started with 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.640
 a map that is Creole essence kreyol and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 sense as you see the screams right there 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.980
 we are a brand that we 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.410
 just hated to and his darlings yes the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 darling samba haiti and first of all it's 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.250
 what interested me with the product I 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.840
 I said wow ok super there there is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.340
 something interesting to do there 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.280
 especially that I am very cooperative 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 Caribbean so I liked it 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.550
 creo the essence and that of castres 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.930
 orient for those who speak English 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.510
 for those who want to find 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.010
 the exact title of the product but as 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.409
 I told you this is the purpose of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.989
 carapace of haiti in particular which is 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.760
 scented laurent I am delighted with you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.830
 say that this is a product that has 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 proven himself who is really very 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.930
 interesting it's true it's an island 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.990
 of car with legs which has a good quality 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.590
 I mean that some momentum 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 consistency 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.710
 like all carapater oils 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.180
 aisne stone bayle consistency but what 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.799
 which is interesting actually is that there 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 there will not be this odor problem 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.400
 that we find very often with 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.189
 towns of carapatte since we like 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.440
 the virtues of the product but we do not like 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.330
 necessarily its smell is there with the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.190
 little orange side and it's a lot more 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.780
 pleasant in terms of efficiency of 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.490
 product is what the latter has 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.470
 found to be effective i have to tell you 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 that yes since as you know if 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.180
 well him the carapatte has virtues for 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 contribute to the hair break but 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.050
 also to strengthen it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.640
 and I can tell you that at the level of 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.110
 outline of my hair since this is the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.360
 part generally which is the most 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.190
 fragile for people in general and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.159
 although I have seen a change since 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.320
 there was a small part where I had 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.250
 the impression that I had less what 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.200
 my hair was a lot more 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.480
 fragile so I really lingered 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.710
 top to rub my hair good 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.940
 it's true I wanted to do it 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.039
 practically every two days and 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.790
 unfortunately I could not keep 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.260
 term in terms of periodicity you 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.450
 already know how it goes we have 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.540
 good resolutions and after me why 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.640
 points but well in the end I used the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
 produced enough to be able to finish the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.110
 bottle and on you 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.550
 since it works and noticed that the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.440
 bottle is here to prove to you when 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.120
 the facts and she did her job well 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.100
 so in the end I can tell you that 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.020
 it is an oil that is interesting that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.640
 as soon as I have the opportunity to 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.320
 buy it again that I would 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.060
 since already it's a product that 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.190
 we come from haiti so in terms of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.690
 fraternity collaboration 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.580
 solidarity is something that 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.710
 interests me and also in relation to the fact 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.990
 that it is a carved island that has 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.190
 a smell that is very particular before 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.870
 to finish this point is to move to 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.100
 next product I wanted to answer 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.020
 to the different questions I had 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.570
 of certain Internet users who 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.250
 asked if carapa oil from Haiti 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.600
 was worth that of jamaica and 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.100
 unfortunately I am not able 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.000
 to answer you since I do not have 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.190
 still tried 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.990
 the one from jamaica but I do not 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.209
 will not delay in doing so and also I 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.220
 could you tell if both are worth 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.590
 let's move on to the next products 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.930
 positioned itself hours from my brand 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.340
 element when I do not know if everything 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.290
 like me you like to walk on 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.790
 youtube and find new products 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.920
 but for my part what can I do you 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.500
 to say that I had already heard 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.870
 talk about my element love and 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.120
 I could not wait to try it and when 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.100
 i saw patricia from one to cheat to 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.900
 Chocques sent me happened 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.820
 I was really very happy 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.620
 in addition to sending me a shampoo 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.630
 anbar that I find very interesting 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.640
 she was kind enough to send me 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.650
 also a conditioner that is at 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.300
 base of aloe and lemon what I liked 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.739
 from the outset with regard to 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.030
 condition enough to see that the 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.890
 most of the ingredients that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.090
 composed was natural season 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.500
 conditioners which is mainly 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.209
 compound of water so he had a 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.040
 consistency a little more watery 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.670
 more liquid than I usually 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.260
 to use 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.700
 but it is still a month it is 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.769
 that it is a product that is more or 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.019
 less interesting by cons where I 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.850
 have to put a little flat this is 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.370
 even though it's the consistency and 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.709
 a little bit too liquid and who 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.720
 does not provide enough nutrients 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.609
 the less I mean it does not slip 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.959
 not enough after you finish using the 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.150
 the conditioner I did not have 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.280
 the impression that it had added more 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.900
 particular to my hair but I 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.479
 wanted to use it all the way 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.150
 especially to echo this it's 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.270
 to say l had my scalp had 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.159
 with forgiveness of the conditioner and it has been 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.840
 mainly 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.400
 the purpose of this product used in caux 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.439
 h i have to say it is a lot more 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.009
 nice to use a conditioner or in 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:47.409
 deep care in terms of satisfaction 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.780
 let's say like deep care then as 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.949
 be weekly I would not say that 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.620
 it is necessarily what is 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.599
 interesting but not yet produced for 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.889
 the basis of a courage is that it's 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.020
 really nice 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.729
 this does not preclude as usual that 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.529
