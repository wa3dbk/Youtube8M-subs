00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.440 
side this is I think the question is to
come<00:03:04.470> along<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.580> see<00:03:05.850> whether<00:03:06.150> we're

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
come along just to see whether we're

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.040 
come along just to see whether we're
messing<00:03:07.020> with<00:03:07.200> atheism<00:03:08.690> nobody's<00:03:09.690> watching

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
messing with atheism nobody's watching

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.070 
messing with atheism nobody's watching
no<00:03:10.890> nobody's<00:03:11.820> watching<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.300> now<00:03:12.510> God<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:12.930> much
