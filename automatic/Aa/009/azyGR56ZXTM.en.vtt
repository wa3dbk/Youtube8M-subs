because<00:01:58.320> one<00:01:58.710> he's<00:01:59.040> poorly<00:01:59.369> drawn<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.149> that's

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
because one he's poorly drawn and that's

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.109 
because one he's poorly drawn and that's
it<00:02:00.899> he's<00:02:01.350> only<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> title<00:02:02.250> screen<00:02:02.280> not
