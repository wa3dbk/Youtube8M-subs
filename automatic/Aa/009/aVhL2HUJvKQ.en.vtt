I<00:02:00.580> started<00:02:01.580> using<00:02:01.790> biodynamic<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> Genesis

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
I started using biodynamic on a Genesis

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.010 
I started using biodynamic on a Genesis
tour<00:02:03.800> I<00:02:03.860> believe<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.820> would<00:02:05.060> have<00:02:05.180> been<00:02:05.390> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
tour I believe it would have been the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.190 
tour I believe it would have been the
mama<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.560> around<00:02:06.860> 84<00:02:07.570> but<00:02:08.570> we<00:02:08.840> started

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
mama to around 84 but we started

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.290 
mama to around 84 but we started
rehearsal<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.709> came<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.009> rehearsals<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.880> I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
rehearsal it came in rehearsals and I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.510 
rehearsal it came in rehearsals and I
hadn't<00:02:12.050> really<00:02:12.080> seen<00:02:12.290> him<00:02:12.620> before<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.340> have

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
hadn't really seen him before and I have

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.199 
hadn't really seen him before and I have
to<00:02:13.670> admit<00:02:13.970> they<00:02:14.690> sounded<00:02:15.110> amazing<00:02:16.150> by<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
to admit they sounded amazing by the

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.690 
to admit they sounded amazing by the
time<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.720> got<00:02:17.870> into<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.440> full<00:02:19.070> production

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
time we got into the full production

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.070 
time we got into the full production
stage<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.180> rehearsal<00:02:20.600> where<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.989> know

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
stage of rehearsal where you know

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.449 
stage of rehearsal where you know
everything<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.680> miked<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.340> you're

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
everything is miked up and you're

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.060 
everything is miked up and you're
hearing<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.850> in<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.300> big<00:02:23.510> system<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.830> was

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
hearing it in the big system it was

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.110 
hearing it in the big system it was
really<00:02:25.550> great<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.910> sounded<00:02:26.239> incredible

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
really great it sounded incredible

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.790 
really great it sounded incredible
they<00:02:29.120> were<00:02:29.239> simple<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.630> was<00:02:29.690> all<00:02:29.870> dynamic<00:02:30.140> mics

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
they were simple it was all dynamic mics

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.710 
they were simple it was all dynamic mics
I<00:02:31.100> think<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> only<00:02:31.880> condensers<00:02:32.480> would<00:02:32.630> have

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
I think the only condensers would have

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.350 
I think the only condensers would have
been<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.260> overheads<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> head<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.820> its

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
been the overheads and the head and its

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.970 
been the overheads and the head and its
really<00:02:35.690> turned<00:02:35.959> around<00:02:36.050> because<00:02:36.440> these<00:02:36.650> days

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
really turned around because these days

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.370 
really turned around because these days
I<00:02:37.430> find<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:37.970> prefer<00:02:38.330> condensers<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.140> toms

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
I find I prefer condensers on the toms

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.280 
I find I prefer condensers on the toms
as<00:02:39.680> well<00:02:39.890> in<00:02:40.700> fact<00:02:40.970> with<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.630> setup<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.110> think

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
as well in fact with this setup I think

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.110 
as well in fact with this setup I think
I'm<00:02:42.380> only<00:02:42.530> using<00:02:42.799> there's<00:02:43.340> only<00:02:43.459> dynamics<00:02:44.000> on

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
I'm only using there's only dynamics on

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.310 
I'm only using there's only dynamics on
the<00:02:44.150> snare<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.570> on<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.840> bass<00:02:45.019> drum

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
the snare and on the bass drum

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.259 
the snare and on the bass drum
everything<00:02:46.220> else<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:46.580> condenser<00:02:47.030> all<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
everything else is a condenser all the

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:47.800 
everything else is a condenser all the
toms

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
with Louise Conte and I heard these new

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.750 
with Louise Conte and I heard these new
mics<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.660> were<00:03:25.750> all<00:03:25.870> condensers<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.580> was

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
mics that were all condensers and I was

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.850 
mics that were all condensers and I was
really<00:03:28.000> blown<00:03:28.330> away<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:28.660> we<00:03:29.050> ended<00:03:29.230> up<00:03:29.380> using

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
really blown away so we ended up using

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.150 
really blown away so we ended up using
them<00:03:30.190> for<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.490> clinic<00:03:30.850> tour<00:03:31.170> then<00:03:32.170> we<00:03:32.470> did

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
them for the clinic tour then we did

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.460 
them for the clinic tour then we did
Phil<00:03:33.970> Collins<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.630> guess<00:03:34.780> what's<00:03:35.020> called<00:03:35.290> his

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
Phil Collins I guess what's called his

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.250 
Phil Collins I guess what's called his
first<00:03:35.770> final<00:03:36.190> farewell<00:03:36.580> tour<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.240> showed<00:03:38.050> up
