the sound of this engine before the
Surma<00:00:59.850> treatment<00:01:01.790> stamp<00:01:02.790> is<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.360> cemetry

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
Surma treatment stamp is the cemetry

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.219 
Surma treatment stamp is the cemetry
okay<00:01:06.439> we<00:01:07.340> all<00:01:07.490> gone<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> ad<00:01:08.000> server<00:01:08.659> treatment

okay we all gone the ad server treatment
to<00:01:09.439> this<00:01:09.560> engine<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.340> then<00:01:10.939> rev<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.390> up<00:01:11.509> about

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
to this engine and then rev it up about

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.179 
to this engine and then rev it up about
2,000<00:01:13.549> rpms<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.329> ten<00:01:14.570> minutes<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.200> then<00:01:15.920> this

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
2,000 rpms to ten minutes and then this

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.830 
2,000 rpms to ten minutes and then this
individual<00:01:16.850> need<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.240> drive<00:01:17.479> this<00:01:17.630> vehicle

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
individual need to drive this vehicle

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.800 
individual need to drive this vehicle
this<00:01:18.409> a<00:01:18.439> half<00:01:18.770> an<00:01:18.890> hour<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.939> an<00:01:20.060> hour

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
this a half an hour to an hour

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.340 
this a half an hour to an hour
the<00:01:21.380> initial<00:01:21.860> burning<00:01:22.189> time<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.539> most

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
the initial burning time is most

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.410 
the initial burning time is most
important<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.159> first<00:01:25.429> time<00:01:25.670> we<00:01:25.759> applaud<00:01:26.149> it

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
important the first time we applaud it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.039 
important the first time we applaud it
thereafter<00:01:26.899> it's<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.590> 3,000<00:01:28.490> mile<00:01:28.640> kuro<00:01:29.060> okay

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
thereafter it's a 3,000 mile kuro okay

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.980 
thereafter it's a 3,000 mile kuro okay
at<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.619> bottom<00:01:32.289> okay<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.479> engines

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
at the bottom okay this this engines

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.789 
at the bottom okay this this engines
been<00:01:36.140> treated<00:01:36.649> if<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.189> cabinet<00:01:38.060> burning

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
been treated if the cabinet burning

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.620 
been treated if the cabinet burning
notice<00:01:39.799> how<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.039> gas<00:01:40.610> cap<00:01:40.939> has<00:01:41.330> less

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
notice how the gas cap has less

00:01:41.630 --> 00:02:00.339 
notice how the gas cap has less
vibration<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:44.020> totally<00:01:57.819> and<00:01:59.140> this<00:02:00.140> vehicle

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
vibration and totally and this vehicle

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.460 
vibration and totally and this vehicle
still<00:02:00.860> needs<00:02:01.099> a<00:02:01.549> half<00:02:02.299> hour<00:02:02.569> burning<00:02:03.229> period

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
still needs a half hour burning period

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.460 
still needs a half hour burning period
of<00:02:03.799> driving<00:02:04.450> minimum<00:02:05.450> with<00:02:05.959> initial

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
of driving minimum with initial

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.460 
of driving minimum with initial
treatment<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.880> again<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.360> still<00:02:09.079> keeps<00:02:09.229> on

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
treatment and again it still keeps on

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.340 
treatment and again it still keeps on
improving<00:02:10.269> but<00:02:11.269> it<00:02:11.450> still<00:02:11.630> needs<00:02:11.840> 3,000<00:02:12.709> miles

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
improving but it still needs 3,000 miles

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.640 
improving but it still needs 3,000 miles
and<00:02:15.519> then<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.609> blower<00:02:16.819> bar<00:02:17.060> would<00:02:17.209> be<00:02:17.299> gone

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and then the blower bar would be gone

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.440 
and then the blower bar would be gone
actually<00:02:18.650> looks<00:02:19.190> less<00:02:20.440> alrighty
