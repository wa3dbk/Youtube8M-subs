00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.659 

alright<00:00:00.719> I'm<00:00:01.140> back<00:00:01.230> and<00:00:01.829> as<00:00:01.979> you<00:00:02.010> see<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.550> the

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
alright I'm back and as you see of the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.280 
alright I'm back and as you see of the
two<00:00:02.850> heat<00:00:03.060> sinks<00:00:03.419> laid<00:00:03.600> out<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:03.840> front<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.170> me

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
two heat sinks laid out in front of me

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.080 
two heat sinks laid out in front of me
this<00:00:05.279> one<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.759> completely<00:00:06.509> wired<00:00:07.849> except<00:00:08.849> for

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
this one is completely wired except for

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.110 
this one is completely wired except for
the<00:00:09.269> leads<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:10.019> we'll<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.429> running<00:00:11.429> out<00:00:11.759> to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
the leads that we'll be running out to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.580 
the leads that we'll be running out to
the<00:00:12.210> back<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> tank<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.410> that

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the back of the tank and the one that

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.780 
the back of the tank and the one that
we'll<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:13.740> connecting<00:00:14.190> over<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> next

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
we'll be connecting over to the next

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.000 
we'll be connecting over to the next
heatsink<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.230> basically<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
heatsink but this is basically the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.689 
heatsink but this is basically the
difference<00:00:18.500> between<00:00:20.840> wired<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.400> not<00:00:23.400> wired

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
difference between wired and not wired

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.000 
difference between wired and not wired
and<00:00:23.970> I'll<00:00:24.060> zoom<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:25.380> actually<00:00:25.769> pretty

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and I'll zoom in it's actually pretty

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.620 
and I'll zoom in it's actually pretty
hectic<00:00:26.250> but

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.200 

as<00:00:34.690> you<00:00:35.350> see<00:00:35.650> it's<00:00:35.830> it<00:00:36.520> gets<00:00:36.760> pretty<00:00:37.000> hectic

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
as you see it's it gets pretty hectic

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.030 
as you see it's it gets pretty hectic
out<00:00:37.510> on<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.750> sides<00:00:38.050> because<00:00:38.350> I<00:00:38.590> run<00:00:38.800> off<00:00:38.920> the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
out on the sides because I run off the

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.920 
out on the sides because I run off the
wires<00:00:39.250> out<00:00:39.520> to<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.730> sides<00:00:40.000> but<00:00:40.690> you<00:00:40.780> can

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
wires out to the sides but you can

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
wires out to the sides but you can
actually<00:00:41.110> with<00:00:41.620> these<00:00:41.740> heat<00:00:41.980> sinks<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.920> I

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
actually with these heat sinks what I

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.740 
actually with these heat sinks what I
did<00:00:45.220> is<00:00:45.400> I<00:00:45.520> basically<00:00:45.880> organized<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.540> wires

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
did is I basically organized the wires

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.280 
did is I basically organized the wires
and<00:00:47.140> if<00:00:47.770> one<00:00:48.250> was<00:00:48.460> coming<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:49.180> was<00:00:49.810> popping<00:00:50.020> out

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
and if one was coming I was popping out

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.000 
and if one was coming I was popping out
too<00:00:50.500> much

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
too much

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.760 
too much
I'd<00:00:51.340> solder<00:00:51.760> another<00:00:52.000> wire<00:00:52.390> over<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:53.200> that'd

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
I'd solder another wire over it that'd

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.890 
I'd solder another wire over it that'd
be<00:00:53.800> close<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.280> ID<00:00:54.640> for<00:00:54.940> example<00:00:55.000> this<00:00:55.690> wire

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
be close to ID for example this wire

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.170 
be close to ID for example this wire
right<00:00:55.930> here<00:00:56.410> was<00:00:56.620> popping<00:00:57.010> out<00:00:57.190> so<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.820> started

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
right here was popping out so I started

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.750 
right here was popping out so I started
this<00:00:58.360> wire<00:00:58.630> right<00:00:58.660> here<00:00:59.170> over<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.650> and<00:00:59.830> so<00:01:00.430> it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
this wire right here over it and so it

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.000 
this wire right here over it and so it
keeps<00:01:01.090> everything<00:01:01.420> down<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.050> then<00:01:02.650> with<00:01:02.830> all

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
keeps everything down and then with all

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.450 
keeps everything down and then with all
the<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:03.760> made<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.510> wires<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.950> little<00:01:05.950> bit<00:01:06.040> looser

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
the I made the wires a little bit looser

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.580 
the I made the wires a little bit looser
so<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.729> could<00:01:06.970> tuck<00:01:07.150> it<00:01:07.180> into<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.600> bottom<00:01:08.350> here

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
so I could tuck it into the bottom here

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.250 
so I could tuck it into the bottom here
in<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.770> bottom<00:01:08.830> corner<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.700> up<00:01:10.330> top<00:01:10.570> here<00:01:10.930> so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
in the bottom corner and up top here so

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.600 
in the bottom corner and up top here so
there's<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.530> couple<00:01:11.710> wires<00:01:11.979> that<00:01:12.160> stick<00:01:12.430> out<00:01:12.580> a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
there's a couple wires that stick out a

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.420 
there's a couple wires that stick out a
little<00:01:12.700> bit<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.300> might<00:01:14.290> touch<00:01:14.860> those<00:01:15.100> up<00:01:15.310> a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
little bit I might touch those up a

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.180 
little bit I might touch those up a
little<00:01:15.460> bit<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.930> organize<00:01:17.320> them<00:01:17.560> but<00:01:17.860> other

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
little bit and organize them but other

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.560 
little bit and organize them but other
than<00:01:18.340> that<00:01:18.400> pretty<00:01:18.729> happy<00:01:19.180> with<00:01:19.270> what<00:01:19.330> it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
than that pretty happy with what it

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.930 
than that pretty happy with what it
looks<00:01:19.780> like<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.290> did<00:01:21.009> have<00:01:21.160> a<00:01:21.190> problem<00:01:21.490> with<00:01:21.850> the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
looks like I did have a problem with the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.230 
looks like I did have a problem with the
cover<00:01:22.150> of<00:01:22.300> LEDs<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:24.430> had<00:01:24.610> one<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.000> warm

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
cover of LEDs we had one of the warm

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.100 
cover of LEDs we had one of the warm
whites<00:01:25.540> so<00:01:26.500> this<00:01:26.920> guy<00:01:27.100> in<00:01:27.369> this<00:01:27.550> guy<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.900> one

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
whites so this guy in this guy this one

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.810 
whites so this guy in this guy this one
over<00:01:29.380> here<00:01:29.590> actually<00:01:29.770> went<00:01:30.220> out<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.670> so<00:01:30.790> I

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
over here actually went out and so I

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.749 
over here actually went out and so I
switched<00:01:31.300> it<00:01:31.540> with<00:01:31.810> an<00:01:32.320> LED<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:33.280> heatsink

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
switched it with an LED on this heatsink

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.460 
switched it with an LED on this heatsink
over<00:01:34.030> here<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.479> then<00:01:35.110> one<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:35.920> my<00:01:36.420> UVs

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
over here and then one of my UVs

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.999 
over here and then one of my UVs
doesn't<00:01:39.160> is<00:01:39.310> only<00:01:40.119> working<00:01:40.569> like<00:01:41.319> half<00:01:41.619> power

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
doesn't is only working like half power

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.639 
doesn't is only working like half power
so<00:01:43.000> uh<00:01:43.950> I'm<00:01:44.950> gonna<00:01:45.330> once<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.479> finish<00:01:47.050> wiring<00:01:47.319> up

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
so uh I'm gonna once I finish wiring up

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.529 
so uh I'm gonna once I finish wiring up
the<00:01:47.679> next<00:01:48.190> heatsink<00:01:48.610> I'm<00:01:48.789> gonna<00:01:48.970> test<00:01:49.300> all

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
the next heatsink I'm gonna test all

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.400 
the next heatsink I'm gonna test all
LEDs<00:01:49.960> on<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.319> one<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.770> see<00:01:51.700> what<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.360> need<00:01:53.319> to

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
LEDs on that one and see what I need to

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.740 
LEDs on that one and see what I need to
get<00:01:53.560> replaced<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:54.550> our<00:01:54.970> LED<00:01:55.330> group<00:01:55.569> by

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
get replaced and so our LED group by

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.930 
get replaced and so our LED group by
they<00:01:56.050> basically<00:01:56.350> said<00:01:56.740> yeah<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.369> just<00:01:57.640> let<00:01:57.819> it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
they basically said yeah I just let it

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.850 
they basically said yeah I just let it
just<00:01:58.060> contact<00:01:58.569> us<00:01:58.720> let<00:01:58.960> us<00:01:59.080> know<00:01:59.259> what<00:01:59.470> LEDs

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
just contact us let us know what LEDs

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.309 
just contact us let us know what LEDs
you<00:02:00.039> need<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.520> they'll<00:02:01.390> get<00:02:01.630> those<00:02:01.810> out<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.050> me

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
you need and they'll get those out to me

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.580 
you need and they'll get those out to me
so<00:02:02.560> right<00:02:02.800> now<00:02:02.979> those<00:02:03.250> two<00:02:03.550> there's<00:02:03.910> one

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
so right now those two there's one

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.910 
so right now those two there's one
there's<00:02:05.590> one

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
there's one

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.949 
there's one
I<00:02:06.190> think<00:02:06.670> it's<00:02:07.950> Piper

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
I think it's Piper

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.440 
I think it's Piper
one<00:02:10.500> hyper<00:02:10.769> violet<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.549> then<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:11.849> warm<00:02:12.180> white

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
one hyper violet and then one warm white

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.210 
one hyper violet and then one warm white
so<00:02:12.840> I'm<00:02:13.110> gonna<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.470> replace<00:02:13.709> this<00:02:14.040> one

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
so I'm gonna have to replace this one

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.399 
so I'm gonna have to replace this one
right<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.909> then<00:02:15.569> both<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:16.019> these<00:02:16.140> warm

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
right here and then both of these warm

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.199 
right here and then both of these warm
whites<00:02:16.620> worked<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.579> one<00:02:17.760> over<00:02:17.879> here<00:02:18.000> on

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
whites worked but the one over here on

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.000 
whites worked but the one over here on
this<00:02:18.420> year<00:02:18.599> heat<00:02:18.900> sink<00:02:19.579> does<00:02:20.579> not<00:02:20.790> work<00:02:21.030> at<00:02:21.450> all

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
this year heat sink does not work at all

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.679 
this year heat sink does not work at all
does<00:02:23.010> not<00:02:23.040> turn<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.549> what<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.790> test<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.239> at<00:02:24.480> all

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
does not turn on what I test it at all

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.380 
does not turn on what I test it at all
so<00:02:25.159> I'm<00:02:26.159> gonna<00:02:26.310> start<00:02:26.609> out<00:02:26.790> wiring<00:02:27.150> up<00:02:27.239> this

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
so I'm gonna start out wiring up this

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.699 
so I'm gonna start out wiring up this
guy<00:02:27.599> ouch<00:02:28.230> I'll<00:02:28.560> start<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> video<00:02:29.159> again<00:02:30.709> when

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
guy ouch I'll start the video again when

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.429 
guy ouch I'll start the video again when
I'm<00:02:31.829> about<00:02:32.010> halfway<00:02:32.280> done<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.450> show<00:02:34.379> you

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
I'm about halfway done just to show you

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.580 
I'm about halfway done just to show you
what<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.739> looks<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.540> between<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.659> LEDs<00:02:37.140> but

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
what it looks like between the LEDs but

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.440 
what it looks like between the LEDs but
because<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.519> doesn't<00:02:38.790> look<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.970> mess<00:02:39.209> here<00:02:39.420> but

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
because it doesn't look a mess here but

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.030 
because it doesn't look a mess here but
that's<00:02:40.260> basically<00:02:40.470> what<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.769> looks<00:02:40.920> like

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
that's basically what it looks like

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.149 
that's basically what it looks like
wired<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.900> wiring<00:02:43.139> I<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.920> same

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
wired and the wiring I just do the same

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.210 
wired and the wiring I just do the same
thing<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.489> did<00:02:44.549> with<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.540> fuge<00:02:45.810> heatsink<00:02:46.349> just

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
thing I did with the fuge heatsink just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.729 
thing I did with the fuge heatsink just
take<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.549> solder<00:02:47.819> or<00:02:48.269> take<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.959> tip<00:02:49.200> down

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
take the solder or take the tip down

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.250 
take the solder or take the tip down
this<00:02:49.950> side<00:02:50.129> up<00:02:50.310> with<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> wire<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.840> nice<00:02:52.019> to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
this side up with the wire it's nice to

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.949 
this side up with the wire it's nice to
use<00:02:52.440> some<00:02:52.680> tweezers<00:02:52.859> I<00:02:53.549> have<00:02:54.540> some<00:02:54.720> tweezers

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
use some tweezers I have some tweezers

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.179 
use some tweezers I have some tweezers
here<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:57.049> just<00:02:58.049> get<00:02:58.200> as<00:02:58.379> good<00:02:58.409> of<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.709> joint<00:02:59.010> as

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
here and just get as good of a joint as

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.410 
here and just get as good of a joint as
I<00:02:59.310> can't<00:02:59.549> possible<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.329> again<00:03:00.720> sometimes

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
I can't possible and again sometimes

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.149 
I can't possible and again sometimes
sometimes<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.569> have<00:03:03.659> to<00:03:03.780> use<00:03:03.810> some<00:03:04.439> extra

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
sometimes I have to use some extra

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.860 
sometimes I have to use some extra
solder<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:05.939> just<00:03:06.090> use<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.359> side<00:03:06.569> I've<00:03:06.720> been

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
solder so I just use the side I've been

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.020 
solder so I just use the side I've been
using<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.069> actually<00:03:08.340> my<00:03:08.430> last<00:03:08.579> tube<00:03:08.909> I

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
using this is actually my last tube I

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.670 
using this is actually my last tube I
have<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.450> I'm<00:03:09.510> hoping<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.959> don't<00:03:09.989> need<00:03:10.319> any<00:03:10.500> more

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
have so I'm hoping I don't need any more

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.250 
have so I'm hoping I don't need any more
than<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:11.909> though<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.930> need<00:03:13.079> some

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
than this but though if I need some

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.800 
than this but though if I need some
extra<00:03:13.379> solder<00:03:13.829> before<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> screw<00:03:14.699> up<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.150> just

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
extra solder before I screw up I just

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.530 
extra solder before I screw up I just
suck<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.169> up<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.879> throw<00:03:17.879> some<00:03:18.060> extra<00:03:18.180> solder

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
suck it up and throw some extra solder

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.420 
suck it up and throw some extra solder
on<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.169> it<00:03:19.739> works<00:03:19.919> pretty<00:03:20.099> good

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
on it and it works pretty good

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.479 
on it and it works pretty good
so<00:03:20.849> that's<00:03:21.419> about<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.129> I'm<00:03:23.129> gonna<00:03:23.250> start

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
so that's about it and I'm gonna start

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.830 
so that's about it and I'm gonna start
working<00:03:23.760> on<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.879> other<00:03:23.940> heats<00:03:24.239> sake<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.750> now

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
working on the other heats sake and now

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.530 
working on the other heats sake and now
start<00:03:25.199> the<00:03:25.260> video<00:03:25.349> up<00:03:25.530> again<00:03:26.239> alright<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.510> I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
start the video up again alright so I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.659 
start the video up again alright so I
did<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.840> little<00:03:27.959> bit<00:03:28.139> of<00:03:28.169> soldering<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:29.129> just

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
did a little bit of soldering I just

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:30.800 
did a little bit of soldering I just
wanted<00:03:29.879> to<00:03:29.970> show<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.269> example<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.720> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
wanted to show you the example of a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.449 
wanted to show you the example of a
couple<00:03:31.019> channels<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.709> are<00:03:31.769> all<00:03:31.949> sided<00:03:32.310> up

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
couple channels that are all sided up

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.860 
couple channels that are all sided up
now<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:35.220> one<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.639> long<00:03:35.849> wires<00:03:36.269> what<00:03:36.659> you

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
now the one with the long wires what you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.330 
now the one with the long wires what you
see<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.650> most<00:03:37.919> on<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.669> fixture<00:03:40.190> these<00:03:41.190> are

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
see the most on that fixture these are

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.390 
see the most on that fixture these are
my<00:03:41.459> moon<00:03:41.699> lights<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.329> it's<00:03:42.479> from<00:03:42.780> negative

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
my moon lights and it's from negative

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.039 
my moon lights and it's from negative
comes<00:03:44.400> around<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:45.120> tucked<00:03:45.419> down<00:03:45.569> in<00:03:45.629> here

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
comes around it's tucked down in here

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.740 
comes around it's tucked down in here
comes<00:03:46.739> up<00:03:47.040> crosses<00:03:47.549> over<00:03:47.729> to<00:03:47.849> positive<00:03:48.389> and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
comes up crosses over to positive and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.759 
comes up crosses over to positive and
then<00:03:49.379> this<00:03:49.590> one<00:03:49.829> negative<00:03:50.159> comes<00:03:51.000> up<00:03:51.359> over<00:03:52.349> to

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
then this one negative comes up over to

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.280 
then this one negative comes up over to
the<00:03:52.859> positive<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.699> then<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:53.970> negative

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
the positive and then this negative

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.000 
the positive and then this negative
coming<00:03:55.290> down

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
coming down

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.580 
coming down
Thunder<00:03:56.400> oh<00:03:56.700> it's<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.360> positive<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
Thunder oh it's this positive the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.160 
Thunder oh it's this positive the
negative<00:03:58.890> will<00:03:59.310> go<00:03:59.489> out<00:03:59.700> and<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.689> positive

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
negative will go out and the positive

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.410 
negative will go out and the positive
comes<00:04:01.439> in<00:04:01.650> from<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.040> other<00:04:02.159> fixture<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.909> then

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
comes in from the other fixture and then

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.110 
comes in from the other fixture and then
as<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.890> see<00:04:05.189> I'll<00:04:05.340> zoom<00:04:05.549> in<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.819> little<00:04:05.939> bit

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
as you see I'll zoom in a little bit

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:15.050 
as you see I'll zoom in a little bit
more

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.759 

you<00:04:16.060> can<00:04:16.209> see<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.750> small<00:04:19.750> wires<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.530> did

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
you can see the small wires that I did

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.240 
you can see the small wires that I did
that<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.130> used<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:22.800> those<00:04:23.800> are<00:04:23.949> the<00:04:24.009> most

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
that I used and those are the most

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.520 
that I used and those are the most
tedious<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.360> guess<00:04:25.600> because<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.020> got<00:04:26.199> using

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
tedious I guess because you got using

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.520 
tedious I guess because you got using
tweezers<00:04:26.710> but<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:27.759> is<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.020> one<00:04:29.020> of<00:04:29.169> my<00:04:29.259> blue

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
tweezers but this is a one of my blue

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.689 
tweezers but this is a one of my blue
channels<00:04:30.009> these<00:04:30.160> four<00:04:30.460> right<00:04:30.669> here

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
channels these four right here

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.540 
channels these four right here
surrounding<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.509> amber<00:04:31.930> are<00:04:32.289> all<00:04:32.620> blue<00:04:32.979> LEDs

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
surrounding the amber are all blue LEDs

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.029 
surrounding the amber are all blue LEDs
and<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:34.780> goes<00:04:34.960> from<00:04:35.320> negative<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:36.009> positive

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
and so it goes from negative to positive

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.060 
and so it goes from negative to positive
negative<00:04:36.910> down<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.900> positive<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:38.680> negative

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
negative down the positive and negative

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.980 
negative down the positive and negative
over<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.460> positive<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.300> then<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.720> have<00:04:40.870> my

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
over to positive and then I have my

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.420 
over to positive and then I have my
negative<00:04:41.580> coming<00:04:42.580> out<00:04:42.759> tucked<00:04:43.509> in<00:04:43.770> out<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:45.220> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
negative coming out tucked in out to the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.300 
negative coming out tucked in out to the
amplifiers<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.690> positive<00:04:47.199> up<00:04:47.320> here<00:04:47.590> will

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
amplifiers and the positive up here will

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.550 
amplifiers and the positive up here will
come<00:04:48.550> from<00:04:48.699> over<00:04:49.060> from<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.510> heatsink<00:04:49.990> so

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
come from over from the heatsink so

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.020 
come from over from the heatsink so
that's<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.220> difference<00:04:51.370> between<00:04:51.910> the

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
that's the difference between the

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.610 
that's the difference between the
channels<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:52.660> there's<00:04:52.840> some<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.229> are<00:04:53.410> really

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
channels so there's some that are really

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.820 
channels so there's some that are really
long<00:04:54.150> like<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.300> moonlights<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.260> green

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
long like the moonlights and the green

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.310 
long like the moonlights and the green
LEDs<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:57.580> all<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.820> other<00:04:57.970> colored<00:04:58.630> LEDs<00:04:58.990> plus

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
LEDs and all the other colored LEDs plus

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.050 
LEDs and all the other colored LEDs plus
the<00:04:59.470> warm<00:04:59.680> whites<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.220> then<00:05:00.789> there's<00:05:00.910> some

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
the warm whites and then there's some

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.290 
the warm whites and then there's some
that<00:05:01.210> are<00:05:01.300> really<00:05:01.539> close<00:05:01.780> like<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:03.280> UV<00:05:03.760> down

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
that are really close like the UV down

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.980 
that are really close like the UV down
UV<00:05:04.900> down<00:05:05.169> and<00:05:06.240> some<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.449> other<00:05:07.599> royal

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
UV down and some of the other royal

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.710 
UV down and some of the other royal
blues<00:05:08.289> so<00:05:08.800> that's<00:05:09.520> what<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.180> wiring<00:05:10.539> looks

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
blues so that's what the wiring looks

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.520 
blues so that's what the wiring looks
like<00:05:10.960> basically<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:12.930> I'm<00:05:13.930> gonna<00:05:14.050> finish<00:05:14.289> it

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
like basically and I'm gonna finish it

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.360 
like basically and I'm gonna finish it
up<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.889> then<00:05:15.789> I'll<00:05:15.880> show<00:05:16.090> you<00:05:17.130> both<00:05:18.130> of<00:05:18.190> the

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
up and then I'll show you both of the

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.789 
up and then I'll show you both of the
fixtures
