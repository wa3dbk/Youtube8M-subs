browser<00:04:00.389> but<00:04:00.780> before<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.200> I'll<00:04:01.410> need<00:04:01.560> to

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
browser but before that I'll need to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.500 
browser but before that I'll need to
connect<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.010> Wi-Fi<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.400> let<00:04:02.519> me<00:04:02.579> do<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.299> it

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
connect to Wi-Fi so let me do that so it

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.210 
connect to Wi-Fi so let me do that so it
seems<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.049> browsing<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.530> fairly<00:04:04.739> fast

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
seems that the browsing is fairly fast

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.270 
seems that the browsing is fairly fast
and<00:04:05.519> fluid<00:04:05.819> so<00:04:06.000> no<00:04:06.120> issues<00:04:06.389> over<00:04:06.569> there

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
and fluid so no issues over there

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.229

pinching<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.400> does<00:04:08.519> not<00:04:08.609> work<00:04:08.790> because<00:04:08.940> we<00:04:09.150> are

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
pinching it does not work because we are

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.210 
pinching it does not work because we are

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
really smooth on this device and panning

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.310 
really smooth on this device and panning
around<00:04:19.739> also<00:04:20.130> seems<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.459> be<00:04:20.579> fairly<00:04:21.000> fluid<00:04:21.570> not

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
a lot of lag over here so pretty

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.610 
a lot of lag over here so pretty
impressive<00:04:24.900> when<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.260> comes<00:04:25.440> to

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
impressive when it comes to

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
to landscape and the switch is fairly

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.480
