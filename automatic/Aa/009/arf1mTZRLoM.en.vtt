00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
enough time in it now I don't normally a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.160 
enough time in it now I don't normally a
hundred<00:00:56.940> percent<00:00:57.000> games<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.629> generally<00:00:57.989> play

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
hundred percent games I generally play

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.270 
hundred percent games I generally play
through<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.649> many<00:00:58.770> achievements<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
through get as many achievements as I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.650 
through get as many achievements as I
can<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.969> comes<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> collecting

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
can but if it comes down to collecting

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.819 
can but if it comes down to collecting
things<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.989> tend<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.379> leave<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.680> because

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
things I tend to just leave that because

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.680 
things I tend to just leave that because
that's<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.309> all<00:01:02.340> about<00:01:02.550> however<00:01:03.390> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that's not really all about however this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.030 
that's not really all about however this
is<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.080> those<00:01:04.199> games<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
is one of those games that I do think I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.230 
is one of those games that I do think I
am<00:01:05.070> gonna<00:01:05.309> try<00:01:05.400> 100<00:01:05.729> percent<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> can

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
am gonna try 100 percent because I can

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
am gonna try 100 percent because I can
see<00:01:06.360> myself<00:01:06.510> spending<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.930> lot<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> time

other<00:03:30.570> achievements<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.110> should<00:03:31.260> gonna<00:03:31.410> do

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
other achievements you should gonna do

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.140 
other achievements you should gonna do
as<00:03:31.680> one<00:03:31.890> class<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.310> pick<00:03:32.490> your<00:03:32.610> class<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.910> start

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
as one class so pick your class to start

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.490 
as one class so pick your class to start
playthrough<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.990> should<00:03:34.140> really<00:03:34.290> really

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
playthrough so you should really really

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.990 
playthrough so you should really really
get<00:03:34.709> I'd<00:03:34.920> say<00:03:35.100> 98%<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.820> these<00:03:35.940> achievements

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
get I'd say 98% of these achievements

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.730 
get I'd say 98% of these achievements
then<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.930> last<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.290> laughs<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.650> to

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
then the last to you laughs you have to

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.870 
then the last to you laughs you have to
switch<00:03:37.950> off<00:03:38.100> so<00:03:38.250> I'm<00:03:38.370> gonna<00:03:38.459> play<00:03:38.640> through<00:03:38.760> as

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
switch off so I'm gonna play through as

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.040 
switch off so I'm gonna play through as
a<00:03:38.940> warlock<00:03:39.120> then<00:03:39.450> at<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> end<00:03:39.660> I'm<00:03:39.930> actually

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
a warlock then at the end I'm actually

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.140 
a warlock then at the end I'm actually
gonna<00:03:40.290> make<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> Titan<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.220> hunter<00:03:41.550> and<00:03:41.730> then

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
gonna make a Titan and a hunter and then

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.699 
gonna make a Titan and a hunter and then
it<00:03:42.240> requires<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.660> fully<00:03:42.870> upgrade<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.380> hunter

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
it requires you fully upgrade a hunter

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.530 
it requires you fully upgrade a hunter
subclass<00:03:44.070> now<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:44.670> played<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.940> Alpha<00:03:45.240> sub

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
subclass now if you played the Alpha sub

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.540 
subclass now if you played the Alpha sub
classes<00:03:45.900> or<00:03:46.020> FC<00:03:46.260> your<00:03:46.380> skill<00:03:46.620> trees<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:47.040> imagine

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
classes or FC your skill trees I imagine

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.850 
classes or FC your skill trees I imagine
there<00:03:47.670> will<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.790> multiple<00:03:48.180> subclasses<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.200> you

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
there will be multiple subclasses so you

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.960 
there will be multiple subclasses so you
basically<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.250> pick<00:03:50.370> one<00:03:50.550> and<00:03:50.670> then<00:03:50.730> fully

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
basically to pick one and then fully

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.430 
basically to pick one and then fully
upgrade<00:03:51.270> that<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.660> involves<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.200> having<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
upgrade that that involves you having to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.630 
upgrade that that involves you having to
play<00:03:52.560> through<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:53.280> know<00:03:53.340> get<00:03:53.520> enough

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
play through you know get enough

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.070 
play through you know get enough
experience<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.209> then<00:03:54.390> put<00:03:54.540> your<00:03:54.660> points<00:03:54.959> in

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
experience and then put your points in

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.810 
experience and then put your points in
so<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.709> then<00:03:55.740> complete<00:03:56.430> those<00:03:56.610> I

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
so that you can then complete those I

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.400 
so that you can then complete those I
imagine<00:03:57.240> it's<00:03:57.330> we're<00:03:57.540> gonna<00:03:57.630> take<00:03:57.840> awhile<00:03:57.930> if

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
imagine it's we're gonna take awhile if

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
imagine it's we're gonna take awhile if
you<00:03:58.530> think<00:03:58.740> about<00:03:58.830> when<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.100> played<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.370> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
you think about when you played in the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.370 
you think about when you played in the
Alpha<00:03:59.730> by<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.360> time<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.660> got<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.810> level<00:04:01.020> 8<00:04:01.170> you

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
Alpha by the time you got to level 8 you

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.350 
Alpha by the time you got to level 8 you
were<00:04:01.500> probably<00:04:01.910> completely<00:04:02.910> across<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.209> top

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
were probably completely across the top

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.940 
were probably completely across the top
line<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.750> I've<00:04:04.260> been<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.410> little<00:04:04.530> way<00:04:04.709> across

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
line and I've been a little way across

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.650 
line and I've been a little way across
the<00:04:05.070> middle<00:04:05.280> lines<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:06.209> probably<00:04:06.540> gonna

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
the middle lines so it's probably gonna

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.560 
the middle lines so it's probably gonna
be<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.840> don't<00:04:07.110> know<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.290> say<00:04:07.680> about<00:04:07.950> level<00:04:08.280> 15<00:04:09.150> 20

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
know what the level cap is but I'm

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.880 
know what the level cap is but I'm

speculating but alas they are the only
ones<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.220> should<00:04:14.550> require<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.180> to

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
ones that should require you to have to

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.000 
ones that should require you to have to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
make an alternative character and there
