want to show you my attempt to create
monkey<00:00:05.130> ball<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.490> Minecraft<00:00:05.879> now<00:00:06.330> if<00:00:06.390> you

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
monkey ball in Minecraft now if you

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.360 
monkey ball in Minecraft now if you
don't<00:00:06.509> know<00:00:06.629> what<00:00:06.720> monkey<00:00:06.870> ball<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.220> it's<00:00:08.220> a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
don't know what monkey ball is it's a

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.000 
don't know what monkey ball is it's a
monkey<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.910> rides<00:00:09.090> around<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.540> ball<00:00:09.719> and

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
monkey that rides around in a ball and

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.070 
monkey that rides around in a ball and
it<00:00:11.010> looks<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.219> little<00:00:11.280> bit<00:00:11.460> like<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.820> now<00:00:12.389> this

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
it looks a little bit like this now this

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.129 
it looks a little bit like this now this
ball<00:00:13.320> thing<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:14.059> really<00:00:15.059> crappy<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.750> just

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
ball thing is really crappy that just

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.570 
ball thing is really crappy that just
like<00:00:16.289> they're<00:00:16.470> rendering<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.160> some<00:00:17.310> reason

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
like they're rendering for some reason

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.040 
like they're rendering for some reason
like<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> slime<00:00:18.240> blocks<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
like the slime blocks that are on the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349 
like the slime blocks that are on the
ground<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.770> some<00:00:19.949> reason<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.730> rendering<00:00:21.210> in

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
ground for some reason are rendering in

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.170 
ground for some reason are rendering in
front<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.640> all<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> glass

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
front of all of the all of the glass

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.019 
front of all of the all of the glass
blocks<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> slime<00:00:24.990> ball<00:00:25.199> they're<00:00:25.619> like

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
blocks the slime ball they're like

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
blocks the slime ball they're like
changing<00:00:27.029> color<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.410> terrible<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.160> I'm

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
changing color and it's terrible so I'm

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.220 
changing color and it's terrible so I'm
actually<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> go<00:00:30.210> ahead<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:31.080> get

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
actually going to go ahead and just get

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.560 
actually going to go ahead and just get
rid<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.070> basically<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:33.000> works<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.450> lot

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
rid of it but basically this works a lot

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
rid of it but basically this works a lot
like<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.899> unicycle<00:00:34.200> from<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> other<00:00:34.710> day<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
like the unicycle from the other day so

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.540 
like the unicycle from the other day so
first<00:00:35.790> let's<00:00:36.000> reset<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.370> remove<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
first let's reset and then remove the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.670 
first let's reset and then remove the
glass<00:00:38.760> okay<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.500> same

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
glass okay so here we have the same

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.869 
glass okay so here we have the same
thing<00:00:40.890> without<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> glass<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.730> looks

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
thing without the glass it just looks

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.290 
thing without the glass it just looks
like<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> saddle<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.320> invisible<00:00:43.500> Pig<00:00:44.300> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
like a saddle from an invisible Pig so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.850 
like a saddle from an invisible Pig so
that<00:00:45.719> yeah<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.590> basically<00:00:47.219> point<00:00:47.520> down<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.450> go

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
that yeah you basically point down to go

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.529 
that yeah you basically point down to go
to<00:00:49.860> roll<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> ball<00:00:50.280> forward<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.510> if

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to roll the ball forward it's like as if

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.420 
to roll the ball forward it's like as if
you're<00:00:51.750> tilting<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> ground<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.190> certain

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you're tilting the ground in a certain

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.029 
you're tilting the ground in a certain
direction<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.449> point<00:00:54.660> more<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
direction and then you point more up to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.729 
direction and then you point more up to
roll<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> ball<00:00:56.309> backwards<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:58.590> can

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
roll the ball backwards and you can

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.779 
roll the ball backwards and you can
bounce<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.190> things

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
bounce off of things

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.959 
bounce off of things
and<00:01:00.289> if<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.440> roll<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.100> top<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.520> slime<00:01:02.789> block

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and if you roll on top of a slime block

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.539 
and if you roll on top of a slime block
it'll<00:01:03.840> basically<00:01:04.589> punch<00:01:05.010> your<00:01:05.189> way<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.400> into

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it'll basically punch your way up into

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.000 
it'll basically punch your way up into
the<00:01:05.700> air<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the air you can you can see that the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.820 
the air you can you can see that the
physics<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.670> pretty<00:01:08.909> accurate<00:01:09.830> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
physics are actually pretty accurate you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.810 
physics are actually pretty accurate you
bounce<00:01:11.280> off<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> things<00:01:11.850> correctly<00:01:12.299> whoa<00:01:13.820> that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
bounce off of things correctly whoa that

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149 
bounce off of things correctly whoa that
was<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:16.080> bounce<00:01:16.259> off<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.500> things<00:01:16.740> pretty<00:01:17.100> much

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
was you bounce off of things pretty much

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
was you bounce off of things pretty much
correctly<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:20.009> get<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.780> accelerated

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
correctly and you get like accelerated

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.030 
correctly and you get like accelerated
in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> direction<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:22.770> tilting<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
in the direction that you're tilting and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
in the direction that you're tilting and
if<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.640> hit<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.909> ground<00:01:27.390> you'll<00:01:27.720> bounce

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
if you like hit the ground you'll bounce

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.380 
if you like hit the ground you'll bounce
off<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> ground<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.460> bounce<00:01:30.119> off

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
off the ground you can like bounce off

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.270 
off the ground you can like bounce off
the<00:01:30.540> sides<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.020> things<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.590> also<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> tops<00:01:32.100> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the sides of things and also the tops of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
the sides of things and also the tops of
things<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.820> everything<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.570> I'm<00:01:34.110> pretty

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
things and everything so I'm pretty

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.840 
things and everything so I'm pretty
happy<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.340> how<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> physics

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
happy actually with how the physics

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.690 
happy actually with how the physics
turned<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.210> oh<00:01:36.390> okay<00:01:37.200> hot<00:01:37.470> darn<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.890> I've

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
turned out oh okay hot darn it I've

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.429 
turned out oh okay hot darn it I've
never<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:39.150> been<00:01:39.420> able<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
never actually been able to get all the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.780 
never actually been able to get all the
way<00:01:40.500> through<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.890> little<00:01:41.189> yellow<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
way through this little yellow thing I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.320 
way through this little yellow thing I
built<00:01:42.000> here

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
built here

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.780 
built here
but<00:01:43.900> yeah<00:01:44.710> if<00:01:44.800> your<00:01:44.950> head<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.370> some<00:01:45.490> reason<00:01:45.700> if

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
but yeah if your head for some reason if

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.700 
but yeah if your head for some reason if
your<00:01:45.910> head<00:01:46.030> like<00:01:46.630> goes<00:01:46.840> through<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.230> block<00:01:47.500> in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
your head like goes through a block in

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.270 
your head like goes through a block in
f5<00:01:48.040> mode<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:49.540> puts<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.470> out<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.800> five-month

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
f5 mode it puts you out of a five-month

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.590 
f5 mode it puts you out of a five-month
which<00:01:51.400> isn't<00:01:51.580> I<00:01:51.850> mean<00:01:52.120> I<00:01:52.180> guess<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.450> kind<00:01:52.570> of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
which isn't I mean I guess it kind of

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.060 
which isn't I mean I guess it kind of
makes<00:01:52.660> sense<00:01:52.840> but<00:01:53.080> syllable<00:01:53.350> obnoxious<00:01:53.860> for

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
makes sense but syllable obnoxious for

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.810 
makes sense but syllable obnoxious for
this<00:01:54.790> particular<00:01:55.450> case<00:01:55.660> anyway<00:01:56.580> let's<00:01:57.580> try

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820

this particular case anyway let's try
doing<00:01:58.180> this<00:01:58.420> again<00:01:58.780> it's<00:01:59.020> kind<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.200> fun<00:01:59.350> to

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
doing this again it's kind of fun to

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.890 
doing this again it's kind of fun to
play<00:01:59.560> around<00:01:59.710> with<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.400> I<00:02:00.640> didn't<00:02:01.450> like<00:02:01.570> try

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
it and if you want to try making your

own courses feel free to do it and but

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.220 
own courses feel free to do it and but
it's<00:02:27.910> definitely<00:02:28.240> definitely<00:02:28.720> really<00:02:29.020> fun<00:02:29.140> to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
it's definitely definitely really fun to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.590 
it's definitely definitely really fun to
play<00:02:29.320> around<00:02:29.500> with<00:02:29.760> we've<00:02:30.760> got<00:02:31.030> let's<00:02:31.450> see

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
play around with we've got let's see

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.760 
play around with we've got let's see
this<00:02:32.020> is<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.170> part<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.410> video<00:02:32.590> where<00:02:32.710> I

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
this is the part of video where I

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.830 
this is the part of video where I
explain<00:02:32.830> kind<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.610> how<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.850> works<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.780> course

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
explain kind of how it works of course

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.200 
explain kind of how it works of course
there's<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> visible<00:02:35.890> Pig

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
there's a visible Pig

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.990 
there's a visible Pig
it's<00:02:37.840> called<00:02:38.050> monkey<00:02:38.230> ball<00:02:38.730> let's<00:02:39.730> let's

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
it's called monkey ball let's let's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.720 
it's called monkey ball let's let's
respond<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.510> with<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.660> glass<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:42.010> temporarily

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
respond it with a glass just temporarily

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.960 
respond it with a glass just temporarily
so<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.750> we<00:02:43.930> can<00:02:44.080> see<00:02:44.440> let's<00:02:45.250> go<00:02:45.400> back<00:02:45.670> chiyan

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
so that we can see let's go back chiyan

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.090 
so that we can see let's go back chiyan
if<00:02:46.560> one<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.860> guess<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.640> five<00:02:48.910> whatever<00:02:50.100> let's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
if one I guess at five whatever let's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.440 
if one I guess at five whatever let's
see<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.430> there's<00:02:51.610> armor<00:02:51.850> stands<00:02:52.060> wearing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
see so there's armor stands wearing

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.699 
see so there's armor stands wearing
glass<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.840> their<00:02:52.959> head<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.260> just<00:02:53.290> does<00:02:53.560> not

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
glass on their head it just does not

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.920 
glass on their head it just does not
render<00:02:53.950> well<00:02:54.190> though<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:55.270> doesn't<00:02:55.570> know<00:02:55.690> what

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
render well though it doesn't know what

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.600 
render well though it doesn't know what
to<00:02:56.050> render<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.380> front<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.680> what<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.160> does<00:02:57.400> I

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
to render in front of what it does I

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.880 
to render in front of what it does I
mean<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.970> does<00:02:58.150> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.930> render<00:02:59.170> transparency

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
mean it does kind of render transparency

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.790 
mean it does kind of render transparency
correctly<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.330> it's<00:03:02.260> not<00:03:02.440> it's

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
correctly but it's just it's not it's

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.300 
correctly but it's just it's not it's
not<00:03:03.010> right<00:03:03.810> anyway<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:04.870> let's<00:03:05.410> go<00:03:05.560> back<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.010> so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
not right anyway so let's go back and so

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.280 
not right anyway so let's go back and so
that's<00:03:06.459> what's<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.790> with<00:03:06.970> kind<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.870> how<00:03:08.140> it's

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
that's what's up with kind of how it's

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.920 
that's what's up with kind of how it's
doing<00:03:08.440> graphically<00:03:09.130> but<00:03:09.910> then<00:03:10.060> we<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.420> stuff

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
doing graphically but then we have stuff

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.840 
doing graphically but then we have stuff
like<00:03:12.209> set<00:03:13.209> display<00:03:13.510> sidebar<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.890> there's<00:03:15.430> a

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
like set display sidebar so there's a

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.420 
like set display sidebar so there's a
couple<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.180> things<00:03:16.300> there's<00:03:16.600> like<00:03:16.780> tilt<00:03:17.430> tilt

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
couple of things there's like tilt tilt

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.430 
couple of things there's like tilt tilt
is<00:03:18.640> one<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.030> things<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.570> basically

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
is one of the things and that basically

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.050 
is one of the things and that basically
measures<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:21.070> can<00:03:21.190> see<00:03:21.370> when<00:03:21.640> I'm<00:03:21.730> pointing

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
measures you can see when I'm pointing

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.570 
measures you can see when I'm pointing
down<00:03:22.209> it's<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.620> two<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.950> when<00:03:24.100> I'm<00:03:24.190> pointing<00:03:24.459> up

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
down it's a two and when I'm pointing up

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.210 
down it's a two and when I'm pointing up
and<00:03:24.730> saying<00:03:24.880> two<00:03:25.000> three

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and saying two three

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.710 
and saying two three
and<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.880> measures<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.420> which

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
and so that measures like which

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.040 
and so that measures like which
direction<00:03:27.900> your<00:03:28.410> your<00:03:29.570> you've<00:03:30.570> tilted<00:03:30.990> the

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
direction your your you've tilted the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.630 
direction your your you've tilted the
world<00:03:31.260> whether<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.010> positive<00:03:32.280> or<00:03:32.580> negative

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
world whether it's positive or negative

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.230 
world whether it's positive or negative
because<00:03:33.060> there's<00:03:33.210> only<00:03:33.330> up<00:03:33.600> or<00:03:33.780> down<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.230> then

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
because there's only up or down and then

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.090 
because there's only up or down and then
I'm<00:03:36.240> gonna<00:03:36.390> get<00:03:36.570> off<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.320> freezes<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.920> ball

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
I'm gonna get off it freezes the ball

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.640 
I'm gonna get off it freezes the ball
when<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.400> get<00:03:38.520> off<00:03:38.670> square<00:03:39.240> were<00:03:39.650> dismembered

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
when you get off square were dismembered

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.010 
when you get off square were dismembered
so<00:03:41.040> there's<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:42.200> like<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.380> X<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.400> Z<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.420> ax<00:03:45.750> and

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
so there's a like a X and a Z so ax and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.540 
so there's a like a X and a Z so ax and
a<00:03:46.080> Z<00:03:46.140> they're<00:03:46.530> 0<00:03:46.800> when<00:03:47.070> you're<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.340> on<00:03:47.490> the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
a Z they're 0 when you're not on the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.340 
a Z they're 0 when you're not on the
monkey<00:03:47.790> ball<00:03:47.940> but<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.750> kind<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:48.990> see<00:03:49.170> it's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
monkey ball but you can kind of see it's

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.560 
monkey ball but you can kind of see it's
like<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.650> acceleration<00:03:50.370> direction<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.420> if

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
like the acceleration direction so if

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.870 
like the acceleration direction so if
I'm<00:03:51.780> tilted<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.040> I'm<00:03:53.130> not<00:03:53.160> accelerating

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
I'm tilted so that I'm not accelerating

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.020 
I'm tilted so that I'm not accelerating
it's<00:03:54.210> going<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:54.780> be<00:03:54.870> zero<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:55.950> if<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.430> tilt

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
it's going to just be zero but if I tilt

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.180 
it's going to just be zero but if I tilt
backwards<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.470> can<00:03:58.890> see<00:03:59.010> as<00:03:59.160> you

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
backwards and so you can see as you

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
backwards and so you can see as you
rotate<00:03:59.670> around<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.980> rotates<00:04:01.980> I'm<00:04:02.490> actually<00:04:02.730> I

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
rotate around it rotates I'm actually I

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.510 
rotate around it rotates I'm actually I
actually<00:04:03.600> looked<00:04:04.170> up<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.590> mathematical

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
actually looked up a mathematical

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.400 
actually looked up a mathematical
approximation<00:04:05.970> for<00:04:06.390> sine<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.840> cosine<00:04:07.230> and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
approximation for sine and cosine and

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.320 
approximation for sine and cosine and
that's<00:04:08.040> part<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.490> command<00:04:08.790> blocks<00:04:09.030> here

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
that's part of the command blocks here

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.180 
that's part of the command blocks here
so<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.840> have<00:04:10.050> this<00:04:10.170> approximation<00:04:10.890> for<00:04:11.160> sine

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
so I have this approximation for sine

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.820 
so I have this approximation for sine
and<00:04:11.700> cosine<00:04:12.120> going<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:13.350> order<00:04:13.650> to

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
and cosine going on in order to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.500 
and cosine going on in order to
calculate<00:04:14.040> those<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.820> they're<00:04:15.090> also<00:04:15.210> being

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
calculate those and they're also being

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.599 
calculate those and they're also being
multiplied<00:04:15.870> by<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.140> tilt<00:04:16.470> factor<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.430> can

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
multiplied by the tilt factor so you can

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.420 
multiplied by the tilt factor so you can
have<00:04:17.790> different<00:04:18.450> amounts<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:20.310> know

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
have different amounts of you know

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.949 
have different amounts of you know
magnitudes<00:04:20.940> for<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.269> vectors<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:21.690> I'm<00:04:21.810> doing

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
magnitudes for the vectors so I'm doing

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.960 
magnitudes for the vectors so I'm doing
some<00:04:22.290> actual<00:04:22.860> vector<00:04:23.370> math<00:04:23.520> here<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:23.850> it's

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
some actual vector math here and it's

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.960 
some actual vector math here and it's
pretty<00:04:24.660> cool<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.710> we<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:25.950> acceleration<00:04:26.460> and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
pretty cool so we have acceleration and

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.890 
pretty cool so we have acceleration and
then<00:04:27.510> we<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:28.050> velocity<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:30.270> can<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:30.810> if

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
then we have velocity and you can see if

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.440 
then we have velocity and you can see if
I'm<00:04:30.990> not<00:04:31.169> accelerating<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.890> velocity<00:04:32.370> in<00:04:33.330> the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
I'm not accelerating the velocity in the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.980 
I'm not accelerating the velocity in the
x-direction<00:04:33.720> is<00:04:34.470> is<00:04:35.840> doing<00:04:36.840> whatever

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
x-direction is is doing whatever

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.310 
x-direction is is doing whatever
actually<00:04:37.970> don't<00:04:38.970> seem<00:04:39.120> right<00:04:39.270> seems<00:04:40.110> like<00:04:40.230> it

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
actually don't seem right seems like it

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.960 
actually don't seem right seems like it
should<00:04:40.500> be<00:04:40.530> accelerating<00:04:41.460> okay<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:41.669> don't<00:04:41.910> know

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
should be accelerating okay I don't know

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.760 
should be accelerating okay I don't know
no<00:04:42.810> that's<00:04:43.169> fine<00:04:43.820> yeah<00:04:44.820> it's<00:04:44.940> definitely<00:04:45.060> fine

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
no that's fine yeah it's definitely fine

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.200 
no that's fine yeah it's definitely fine
mm<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.950> maximum<00:04:47.370> velocity<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:48.090> each

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
mm is the maximum velocity in each

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.830 
mm is the maximum velocity in each
direction

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
direction

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.750 
direction
in<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.200> X<00:04:50.290> and<00:04:50.530> Z<00:04:50.650> direction<00:04:51.100> so<00:04:51.130> there's<00:04:51.400> VX

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
in the X and Z direction so there's VX

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.720 
in the X and Z direction so there's VX
and<00:04:51.970> there's<00:04:52.090> VZ<00:04:52.570> course<00:04:53.320> x<00:04:53.680> y&amp;z<00:04:54.490> are<00:04:54.520> the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
and there's VZ course x y&amp;z are the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.330 
and there's VZ course x y&amp;z are the
three<00:04:54.940> coordinates<00:04:55.420> X<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.380> Z<00:04:56.560> X<00:04:56.889> is<00:04:57.100> this

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
three coordinates X and Z X is this

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.310 
three coordinates X and Z X is this
direction<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:58.060> pointing<00:04:58.630> now<00:04:58.750> Z<00:04:59.050> is<00:04:59.169> this

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
direction the pointing now Z is this

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.000 
direction the pointing now Z is this
direction<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.010> Y<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:00.639> up-and-down<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.770> yeah<00:05:02.980> I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
direction and Y is up-and-down so yeah I

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.530 
direction and Y is up-and-down so yeah I
mean<00:05:03.190> that's<00:05:03.430> pretty<00:05:03.580> much<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:03.850> keep<00:05:04.240> track<00:05:04.419> of

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
mean that's pretty much I keep track of

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.360 
mean that's pretty much I keep track of
it<00:05:04.630> if<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.930> detects<00:05:05.290> that<00:05:05.410> there<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.740> an<00:05:05.889> air<00:05:06.040> or

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
it if it detects that there is an air or

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.730 
it if it detects that there is an air or
something<00:05:06.820> other<00:05:06.940> than<00:05:07.150> air<00:05:07.389> block<00:05:07.720> in<00:05:08.650> the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
something other than air block in the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.020 
something other than air block in the
direction<00:05:08.980> that<00:05:09.130> you're<00:05:09.280> facing<00:05:09.460> it'll<00:05:09.850> just

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
direction that you're facing it'll just

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.420 
direction that you're facing it'll just
bounce<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:10.360> off<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:10.810> block<00:05:11.050> by

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
bounce you off of that block by

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.700 
bounce you off of that block by
reversing<00:05:12.430> your<00:05:12.460> velocity<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.810> that<00:05:13.840> sort<00:05:14.680> of

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
reversing your velocity and that sort of

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.040 
reversing your velocity and that sort of
stuff<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:14.950> it's<00:05:15.940> got<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.090> pretty<00:05:16.150> good<00:05:16.419> accurate

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
stuff so it's got a pretty good accurate

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.590 
stuff so it's got a pretty good accurate
physics<00:05:17.410> representation<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:19.360> does<00:05:19.510> the

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
physics representation and it does the

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.730 
physics representation and it does the
same<00:05:19.750> sort<00:05:19.930> of<00:05:20.020> stuff<00:05:20.200> for<00:05:20.320> bouncing<00:05:20.680> and

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
same sort of stuff for bouncing and

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.650 
same sort of stuff for bouncing and
everything<00:05:21.040> anyway<00:05:21.460> download<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.270> if<00:05:22.480> you'd

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
everything anyway download it if you'd
