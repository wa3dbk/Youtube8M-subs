we<00:01:06.479> did<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> first<00:01:07.080> video<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.799> cook

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
we did in the first video we just cook

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
we did in the first video we just cook
it<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.110> make<00:01:10.530> sure

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it up like this and and then make sure

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.910 
it up like this and and then make sure
it's<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:11.010> soft<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.290> then<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.409> feed<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's all soft and then we feed it to the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.499 
it's all soft and then we feed it to the
pigs<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.549> cool<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.720> love<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
pigs when it's cool and they love it and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.109 
pigs when it's cool and they love it and
it<00:01:18.509> actually<00:01:18.659> smells<00:01:19.080> good<00:01:19.259> enough<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> eat

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
it actually smells good enough to eat

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.899 
it actually smells good enough to eat
but<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:22.590> squash<00:01:22.890> makes<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> big<00:01:23.369> difference<00:01:23.790> in

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
but the squash makes a big difference in

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.600 
but the squash makes a big difference in
the<00:01:24.000> onions<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:25.229> far<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:25.890> flavor<00:01:26.310> goes

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the onions as far as I think flavor goes

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.390 
the onions as far as I think flavor goes
and<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.360> broccoli<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.619> then<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.250> my

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and the broccoli but then that's for my

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.140 
and the broccoli but then that's for my
own<00:01:29.430> personal<00:01:31.310> preference<00:01:35.000> that's<00:01:36.000> our

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
