00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.039
 in this video we parade the execution 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.960
 correct of a subcutaneous injection in 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.900
 so it's clear how this maneuver 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.930
 may be simple in the hope of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.150
 thus solving the many hesitations fears 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.150
 which are often due to errors 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.290
 they are usually administered per 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.320
 subcutaneous drug dosage of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.520
 modest entity around 0,1 0,4 m here 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.629
 that then the syringes used are 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:52.430
 small 2.5 ml or insulin syringes 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.840
 as you can see in this picture 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:01.050
 It is therefore necessary to know that an e-mail 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:05.159
 equals 100 insulin units and that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.340
 0.1 and meryl and equals 10 units 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.930
 insulin as explained in this one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.020
 of image on the fairy tale as indicated 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.210
 from the arrow we find the propeller ball 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.049
 the point to put pressure on with 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.470
 fingers to open it after opening the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.110
 vial we decline to insert lake after 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.350
 entrance hole down so as to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.960
 to expel all the liquid in Angola 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.299
 syringe up we use the plunger 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.380
 to expel the air if one persists 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.020
 exiguous 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.909
 let's not worry as we will 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.700
 an intramuscular injection 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.680
 let's proceed the same says danger 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.290
 the winter air is on tate e 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.829
 important to lift gently with 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.130
 then there is instead a showy gem 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.820
 skin in order to create the space in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.040
 to which we insert lake press up to 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.789
 having the feeling of having punched 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.819
 the lake tips come in for a third or not 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.220
 over half of its length with 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.340
 then an inclination of about 20 degrees 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.360
 staying still we enter quietly 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.360
 outing and medication
