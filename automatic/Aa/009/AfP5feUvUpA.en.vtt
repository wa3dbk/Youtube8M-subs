they've<00:00:40.620> actually<00:00:40.800> switched<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> way<00:00:41.640> they

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
they've actually switched the way they

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
they've actually switched the way they
do<00:00:41.879> their<00:00:42.120> file<00:00:42.360> structure<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.140> JSON<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
do their file structure so it's JSON and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.130 
do their file structure so it's JSON and
the<00:00:44.340> formatting<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> little<00:00:45.329> weird<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the formatting can be a little weird so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.290

usually<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> easiest<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
usually the easiest way to do this is to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.830 
usually the easiest way to do this is to
go<00:00:48.570> into<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:49.289> web<00:00:49.950> console<00:00:50.510> well<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.690> will
