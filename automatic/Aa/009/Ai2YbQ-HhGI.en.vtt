00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759

as<00:00:15.059> skeletons<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.199> know<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.710> don't

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
as skeletons but you know what I don't

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.450 
as skeletons but you know what I don't
know<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:17.640> gonna<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.880> possible

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
know if it's gonna be possible

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.150 
know if it's gonna be possible
skeletons<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.699> hard<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.119> deal<00:00:21.359> with<00:00:22.160> like

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
skeletons are so hard to deal with like

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.650 
skeletons are so hard to deal with like
unless<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:23.910> good<00:00:24.090> map<00:00:24.359> where

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
unless you have a really good map where

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.720 
unless you have a really good map where
it's<00:00:24.779> easy<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.199> defend<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> really

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it's easy to defend and with a really

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.029 
it's easy to defend and with a really
good<00:00:26.849> faction<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.500> don't

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
good faction like it's just I don't

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.140 
good faction like it's just I don't
think<00:00:29.220> you're<00:00:29.310> ever<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.519> see<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> very<00:00:30.000> long

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
skeletons video but we'll see how far

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.270 

I<00:01:29.540> guess<00:01:30.230> I<00:01:30.320> was<00:01:30.410> just<00:01:30.590> standing<00:01:30.800> this<00:01:31.040> line<00:01:31.250> I

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
I guess I was just standing this line I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.500 
I guess I was just standing this line I
don't<00:01:31.520> know<00:01:31.730> what<00:01:31.850> good<00:01:31.970> that's<00:01:32.120> gonna<00:01:32.240> do<00:01:32.390> is

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
seem to get a long match for skeletons

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:05.580 
seem to get a long match for skeletons
up<00:02:00.520> unfortunate

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.949

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
I'll see if these people want to

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.160 
I'll see if these people want to
continue<00:02:09.259> its<00:02:10.330> maybe<00:02:11.330> we'll<00:02:11.569> get<00:02:11.720> for<00:02:12.050> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
continue its maybe we'll get for the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.660 
continue its maybe we'll get for the
next<00:02:12.200> time<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.780> never<00:02:14.930> know

could happen someone wants to form a
circle<00:02:24.250> nope<00:02:25.280> let's<00:02:25.670> say<00:02:25.760> we're<00:02:25.880> going<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.090> be

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
circle nope let's say we're going to be

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.059 
circle nope let's say we're going to be
