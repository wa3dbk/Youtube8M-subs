 Good day, the channel welcomes you 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:16.220
 windows 8 and in this video we will look at 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.710
 several ways how to call or 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.770
 find the control panel in this 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.160
 operating the first easiest way 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.540
 it hover over the icon 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.759
 windows bottom left 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:42.769
 click on it with the right mouse button and in 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:43.600
 the list is possible not only from the desktop 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:52.420
 like this 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.420
 and we'll be lower left 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:05.300
 right click to select the next 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.340
 the way to find the control panel is to find it 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:15.340
 it through search that is done 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.020
 very simple we hover over 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:27.649
 upper right corner and we open 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:33.469
 Here is the first choose him just in 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:36.430
 line print the control panel with 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:41.780
 Here I want to note another important point that 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.200
 windows can't recognize even that 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.119
 what did i do i typed 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.920
 Russian but not in English 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:56.509
 less see the control panel well 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.219
 naturally if the same with white 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.079
 in Russian here then straight from there even 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:07.750
 needing is gaining it completely 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:10.750
 we just start on the chart appears 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.750
 required 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:21.930
 well, the last way is a way 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:26.440
 through the menu fell we press the icon 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:35.950
