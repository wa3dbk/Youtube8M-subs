dissolves and now that all that's
dissolved<00:04:10.549> we're<00:04:11.000> gonna<00:04:11.120> let<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.480> come<00:04:11.720> up

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
dissolved we're gonna let that come up

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.369 
dissolved we're gonna let that come up
to<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.220> slow<00:04:13.220> boil<00:04:13.639> after<00:04:14.569> that<00:04:14.690> mixture<00:04:14.989> starts

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
to a slow boil after that mixture starts

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.580 
to a slow boil after that mixture starts
to<00:04:15.500> warm<00:04:15.680> up<00:04:15.889> I'm<00:04:16.699> gonna<00:04:16.880> hit<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.090> with<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.329> match

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
to warm up I'm gonna hit it with a match

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.670 
to warm up I'm gonna hit it with a match
and<00:04:18.940> do<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:19.970> little<00:04:20.150> flambe<00:04:21.049> there<00:04:21.349> on<00:04:21.530> the

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
and do a little flambe there on the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.939 
and do a little flambe there on the
alcohol<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.340> let<00:04:22.460> that<00:04:22.610> burn<00:04:22.909> off<00:04:23.860> after<00:04:24.860> that

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
alcohol and let that burn off after that

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.529 
alcohol and let that burn off after that
burns<00:04:25.220> off<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.699> want<00:04:25.849> to<00:04:25.880> be<00:04:26.000> careful<00:04:26.270> with

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
burns off you want to be careful with

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.120 
burns off you want to be careful with
that<00:04:26.720> cuz<00:04:26.990> that's<00:04:27.020> gonna<00:04:27.349> flame<00:04:27.560> up<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.919> little

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
that cuz that's gonna flame up a little

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.290 
that cuz that's gonna flame up a little
bit<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.460> might<00:04:28.490> want<00:04:28.789> to<00:04:28.849> turn<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.120> heat<00:04:29.270> down

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
bit you might want to turn the heat down

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.200 
bit you might want to turn the heat down
before<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:29.990> do<00:04:30.169> it<00:04:30.699> we're<00:04:31.699> gonna<00:04:31.789> let<00:04:32.030> this

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
before you do it we're gonna let this

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.080 
before you do it we're gonna let this
slow<00:04:32.570> boil<00:04:32.990> until<00:04:33.320> we<00:04:33.830> reduce<00:04:34.280> this<00:04:34.580> until<00:04:34.970> it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
slow boil until we reduce this until it

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.899 
slow boil until we reduce this until it
starts<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.479> thicken<00:04:35.599> up<00:04:36.110> oK<00:04:36.979> we've<00:04:37.490> reduced

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
starts to thicken up oK we've reduced

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.820 
starts to thicken up oK we've reduced
this<00:04:38.120> down<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.690> what<00:04:38.810> I'm<00:04:38.930> looking<00:04:39.289> for<00:04:39.530> here

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
this down and what I'm looking for here

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.750 
this down and what I'm looking for here
is<00:04:40.300> reducing<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.389> down<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.780> about<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:42.490> 3/4<00:04:43.490> cup

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
is reducing it down to about a 3/4 cup

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.180 
is reducing it down to about a 3/4 cup
volume<00:04:44.479> this<00:04:45.080> is<00:04:45.289> not<00:04:45.440> gonna<00:04:45.650> be<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.889> really

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
volume this is not gonna be a really

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.279 
volume this is not gonna be a really
thick<00:04:46.669> sauce<00:04:47.030> it's<00:04:47.360> gonna<00:04:47.510> be<00:04:47.720> kind<00:04:47.960> of<00:04:48.050> thin

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
thick sauce it's gonna be kind of thin

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.740 
thick sauce it's gonna be kind of thin
it's<00:04:48.620> gonna<00:04:48.740> thicken<00:04:48.979> up<00:04:49.250> just<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.580> hair<00:04:49.610> as<00:04:50.060> it

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
it's gonna thicken up just a hair as it

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.909 
it's gonna thicken up just a hair as it
cools<00:04:51.020> but<00:04:51.409> we're<00:04:51.560> gonna<00:04:51.740> set<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.190> aside<00:04:52.250> and

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919
