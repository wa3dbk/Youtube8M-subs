thirty-five<00:01:46.500> anchor<00:01:47.119> hundred<00:01:48.119> feet<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.780> chain

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
thirty-five anchor hundred feet of chain

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.980 
thirty-five anchor hundred feet of chain
20<00:01:50.640> pounds<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.030> Rome

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
20 pounds of Rome

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.039 
20 pounds of Rome
pounds<00:01:52.470> okay<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.240> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> we

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
pounds okay so what we want to do is we

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.039 
pounds okay so what we want to do is we
want<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.290> take<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:56.430> 150<00:01:57.119> pounds<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.869> want

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
want to take that 150 pounds and we want

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.580 
want to take that 150 pounds and we want
to<00:01:58.110> multiply<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.799> by<00:01:59.100> three<00:02:00.080> okay<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:01.200> we'd

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to multiply that by three okay so we'd

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.590 
to multiply that by three okay so we'd
be<00:02:01.710> looking<00:02:01.860> at<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.310> her<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.670> bounce<00:02:02.970> so

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
be looking at for her for the bounce so

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.929 
be looking at for her for the bounce so
the<00:02:04.200> customer<00:02:04.560> may<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.860> 450<00:02:05.549> pounds<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
the customer may have 450 pounds of

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.410 
the customer may have 450 pounds of
total<00:02:06.330> ground<00:02:06.750> tuck<00:02:06.960> away<00:02:07.220> okay<00:02:08.220> what<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.209> want

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
total ground tuck away okay what we want

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.509 
total ground tuck away okay what we want
to<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.869> want<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> make<00:02:10.259> sure<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:11.099> his

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
to do is we want to make sure that his

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.550 
to do is we want to make sure that his
ground<00:02:11.819> tackle<00:02:12.060> weight<00:02:12.420> multiplied<00:02:12.989> by<00:02:13.170> three

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
ground tackle weight multiplied by three

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.390 
ground tackle weight multiplied by three
falls<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.670> under<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.500> maximum<00:02:16.680> pole<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
falls in under the maximum pole of the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.390 
falls in under the maximum pole of the
windless<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.970> were<00:02:18.090> specifying<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.310> this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
windless that were specifying so in this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.630 
windless that were specifying so in this
case<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:21.269> he<00:02:21.330> told<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.780> he<00:02:22.080> had<00:02:22.200> 5/16<00:02:23.010> inch

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
case if he told you he had 5/16 inch

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.880 
case if he told you he had 5/16 inch
chain<00:02:23.940> right<00:02:24.750> away<00:02:24.959> we<00:02:25.170> would<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.560> thinking

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
chain right away we would be thinking

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.150 
chain right away we would be thinking
about<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.190> rc8<00:02:26.810> okay<00:02:27.810> because<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.680> different

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
about the rc8 okay because the different

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.550 
about the rc8 okay because the different
units<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.600> different<00:02:31.019> size<00:02:31.200> change

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
units can have a different size change

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.180 
units can have a different size change
so<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.850> rc8<00:02:33.269> can<00:02:33.540> handle<00:02:33.870> eight<00:02:34.500> millimeter<00:02:35.069> a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
so the rc8 can handle eight millimeter a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.199 
so the rc8 can handle eight millimeter a
5/16<00:02:35.940> chain<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.250> then<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:38.489> look<00:02:38.640> at<00:02:38.819> okay

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
5/16 chain so and then we look at okay

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.199 
5/16 chain so and then we look at okay
he's<00:02:39.360> got<00:02:39.480> 450<00:02:40.110> pounds<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.489> our<00:02:41.819> maximum

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
he's got 450 pounds and our maximum

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.690 
he's got 450 pounds and our maximum
poulos<00:02:42.480> 1320<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.620> we're<00:02:43.769> well<00:02:44.010> within<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.459> spec

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
poulos 1320 so we're well within a spec

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.520 
poulos 1320 so we're well within a spec
there<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:45.090> far<00:02:45.360> as<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.989> know<00:02:46.080> being<00:02:46.319> able<00:02:46.440> to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
there as far as you know being able to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.830 
there as far as you know being able to
pull<00:02:46.769> his<00:02:47.040> total<00:02:47.910> gram

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
pull his total gram

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.500 
pull his total gram
so<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.190> rc8<00:02:50.610> would<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> perfect<00:02:51.330> fit<00:02:51.450> for

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
so the rc8 would be a perfect fit for

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.860 
so the rc8 would be a perfect fit for
this<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.470> wouldn't<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.769> problem<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
this but you wouldn't have a problem the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.530 
this but you wouldn't have a problem the
rc6<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.709> handle<00:02:56.010> six<00:02:56.700> millimeter<00:02:57.120> seven

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
rc6 can handle six millimeter seven

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.630 
rc6 can handle six millimeter seven
millimeter<00:02:57.900> quarter<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.410> changing<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.100> in

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
millimeter quarter it's changing and in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.210

half<00:02:59.850> inch<00:03:00.060> rope<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:01.260> rc8<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.190> eight

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
half inch rope the rc8 can do the eight

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.130 
half inch rope the rc8 can do the eight
