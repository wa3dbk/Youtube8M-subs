clean just playing this on a Fender

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.920 
clean just playing this on a Fender
Strat<00:00:46.890> I've<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> tone<00:00:48.270> rolled<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
Strat I've got the tone rolled all the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
Strat I've got the tone rolled all the
way<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.230> I'll<00:00:49.440> play<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.800> through<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> variety

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
way up I'll play it through the variety

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.250 
way up I'll play it through the variety
of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.910> pickup<00:00:51.270> positions<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> give

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
of the pickup positions to kind of give

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.080 
of the pickup positions to kind of give
you<00:00:52.289> ideas<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> how<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.520> sounds<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.000> each

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you ideas of how it sounds in each

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.229 
you ideas of how it sounds in each
position<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.520> amp<00:00:56.789> sounds

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
position here I think this amp sounds

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.740 
position here I think this amp sounds
best<00:00:57.539> probably<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.230> humbuckers<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.090> it's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
best probably with humbuckers so it it's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.170 
best probably with humbuckers so it it's
pretty<00:01:01.020> good<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:01.770> I've<00:01:02.100> got<00:01:02.280> some

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
pretty good with this but I've got some

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
pretty good with this but I've got some
p90<00:01:03.510> 4s<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.049> other<00:01:04.199> guitar<00:01:04.559> over<00:01:04.769> here

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
p90 4s on this other guitar over here

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.899 
p90 4s on this other guitar over here
that<00:01:05.040> I'm<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.580> through<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that I'm going to put it through and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.730

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
just kind of randomly chose those

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:50.950 

so<00:01:40.350> here's<00:01:40.620> our<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:41.010> how<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.190> face<00:01:41.430> position

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.990 

nice<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.260> balance<00:01:52.619> tone<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.729> put<00:01:53.910> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
nice little balance tone if you put it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000 
nice little balance tone if you put it
down<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.479> bridge<00:01:55.229> pickup<00:01:57.740> nice<00:01:58.740> little

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
out there that's the bridge position I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.590 
out there that's the bridge position I
like<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.980> better<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.459> strap<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
like it better on the strap up in the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:42.980 
like it better on the strap up in the
neck<00:02:30.840> position

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:59.600 

I<00:02:52.670> really<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.030> up<00:02:54.300> top<00:02:54.750> feel<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:58.610> and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
I really like that up top feel to it and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.240 
I really like that up top feel to it and
so<00:02:59.820> that's<00:03:00.090> on<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.390> single<00:03:00.870> coils<00:03:01.290> I'll<00:03:01.950> throw

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
so that's on the single coils I'll throw

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.050 
so that's on the single coils I'll throw
the<00:03:02.430> gain<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.120> maybe<00:03:03.510> like<00:03:03.750> 60%<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.910> would

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
the gain up to maybe like 60% this would

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:18.000 
the gain up to maybe like 60% this would
be<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> nice<00:03:06.360> little<00:03:06.540> mag<00:03:06.960> lead<00:03:07.320> here

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.339 

I<00:03:18.420> don't<00:03:19.420> know<00:03:19.510> if<00:03:19.599> it<00:03:19.689> comes<00:03:19.870> through<00:03:20.200> but

what it's really over driven and that's

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.699 
what it's really over driven and that's
just<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.660> single<00:03:55.990> call<00:03:56.170> that's<00:03:56.380> about<00:03:56.530> the

basically a Gibson l5 that I've had
modded<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:15.040> not<00:04:15.370> really<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.730> Gibson<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.239> a

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
modded it's not really a Gibson it's a

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.110 
modded it's not really a Gibson it's a
copy<00:04:16.540> of<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.900> Gibson<00:04:17.290> made<00:04:17.410> by<00:04:17.620> Ventura<00:04:18.120> but

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
copy of a Gibson made by Ventura but

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.270 
copy of a Gibson made by Ventura but
I've<00:04:19.209> had<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.510> modded<00:04:19.870> with<00:04:20.019> p90<00:04:20.470> fours<00:04:20.709> custom

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
I've had it modded with p90 fours custom

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:52.210 
I've had it modded with p90 fours custom
wire<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.820> be<00:04:21.850> pretty<00:04:22.210> hot

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.800 

really<00:04:52.910> nice<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.300> that's<00:04:53.420> just<00:04:53.630> kind<00:04:53.780> of

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
really nice and that's just kind of

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.750 
really nice and that's just kind of
playing<00:04:54.020> in<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.320> middle<00:04:54.470> if<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.190> playing<00:04:55.610> a

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
playing in the middle if you playing a

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.390 
playing in the middle if you playing a
bridge<00:04:55.970> pickup<00:04:56.420> it'd<00:04:56.600> be<00:04:56.750> more<00:04:56.930> like

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.650 

but<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.490> see<00:05:02.640> it's<00:05:02.760> got<00:05:02.910> some<00:05:02.940> Headroom<00:05:03.240> it's

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
but you see it's got some Headroom it's

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.840 
but you see it's got some Headroom it's
really<00:05:03.990> gonna<00:05:04.170> I<00:05:04.620> think<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.430> doesn't<00:05:05.610> break<00:05:05.820> up

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
really gonna I think it doesn't break up

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.420 
really gonna I think it doesn't break up
until<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.420> kind<00:05:06.600> of<00:05:06.660> get<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:06.930> up<00:05:07.110> there<00:05:07.430> switch

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
until you kind of get it up there switch

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.910 
until you kind of get it up there switch
it<00:05:08.550> over<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.180> lead<00:05:09.900> channel<00:05:10.230> here<00:05:10.530> this

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
it over to the lead channel here this

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.270 
it over to the lead channel here this
guitar<00:05:11.370> not<00:05:11.580> really<00:05:11.940> made<00:05:12.180> for<00:05:12.680> too<00:05:13.680> much<00:05:13.920> gain

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
guitar not really made for too much gain

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.280 
guitar not really made for too much gain
it'll<00:05:14.730> start<00:05:14.970> feeding<00:05:15.150> by<00:05:15.450> because<00:05:16.140> of<00:05:16.230> the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
it'll start feeding by because of the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
it'll start feeding by because of the
hollow<00:05:16.470> body

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:29.230 

I'll<00:05:21.310> play<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.550> in<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.820> middle

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:51.200 

a<00:05:29.990> little<00:05:30.830> more<00:05:30.979> volume

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.850 

so<00:05:52.210> if<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.360> might<00:05:52.540> say<00:05:52.750> I<00:05:53.020> think<00:05:53.410> that<00:05:53.590> like<00:05:53.830> I

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
so if the might say I think that like I

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.590 
so if the might say I think that like I
said<00:05:54.100> in<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.310> sub<00:05:54.490> 500<00:05:55.000> price<00:05:55.180> range<00:05:55.449> if

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
said in the sub 500 price range if

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.810 
said in the sub 500 price range if
you're<00:05:55.750> looking<00:05:56.110> for<00:05:56.620> a<00:05:56.680> nice<00:05:57.100> practice<00:05:57.370> amp

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
you're looking for a nice practice amp

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.210 
you're looking for a nice practice amp
or<00:05:58.060> a<00:05:58.120> gig<00:05:58.479> amp<00:05:58.840> -<00:05:58.990> over<00:05:59.229> your<00:05:59.440> smaller<00:05:59.680> venues

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
or a gig amp - over your smaller venues

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.460 
or a gig amp - over your smaller venues
this<00:06:01.030> thing<00:06:01.210> will<00:06:01.389> float<00:06:01.540> over<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.840> drummer

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
this thing will float over a drummer

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.040 
this thing will float over a drummer
it's<00:06:02.949> pretty<00:06:03.220> nice<00:06:03.370> 20<00:06:03.880> watts<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.479> don't<00:06:04.900> think

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
it's pretty nice 20 watts I don't think

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.560 
it's pretty nice 20 watts I don't think
you<00:06:05.110> can<00:06:05.229> beat<00:06:05.410> it
