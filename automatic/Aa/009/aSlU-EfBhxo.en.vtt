balloons<00:01:42.230> this<00:01:43.230> helps<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.620> keep<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> game

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
balloons this helps to keep the game

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.610 
balloons this helps to keep the game
fresh<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.670> interesting<00:01:45.470> unfortunately<00:01:46.470> this

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
fresh and interesting unfortunately this

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.940 
fresh and interesting unfortunately this
also<00:01:46.920> replaces<00:01:47.700> any<00:01:47.880> type<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.360> bosses<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.860> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
also replaces any type of bosses and I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.500 
also replaces any type of bosses and I
think<00:01:50.010> that's<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.460> game's<00:01:50.700> biggest<00:01:50.940> weakness

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
think that's the game's biggest weakness

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.780 
think that's the game's biggest weakness
the<00:01:52.260> only<00:01:52.470> box<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.830> fight<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.280> whole<00:01:53.520> game

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the only box you fight in the whole game

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.500 
the only box you fight in the whole game
is<00:01:54.030> Pete<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.540> he's<00:01:55.080> at<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.350> very<00:01:55.620> end

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
is Pete and he's at the very end

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.780 
is Pete and he's at the very end
now<00:01:57.080> while<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.350> gameplay<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.040> controls<00:01:58.640> in

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
now while the gameplay and controls in

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.790 
now while the gameplay and controls in
this<00:01:58.910> game<00:01:59.090> are<00:01:59.270> very<00:01:59.810> similar<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.350> rescue

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
this game are very similar to rescue

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.280 
this game are very similar to rescue
rangers<00:02:01.100> on<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> NES<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.970> do<00:02:02.360> think<00:02:02.930> that<00:02:03.020> it's

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
rangers on the NES I do think that it's

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.930 
rangers on the NES I do think that it's
quite<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.710> bit<00:02:04.070> harder<00:02:04.430> than<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:04.610> game

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
quite a bit harder than that game

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.600 
quite a bit harder than that game
despite<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.720> lack<00:02:05.900> of<00:02:05.930> bosses<00:02:06.530> some<00:02:07.400> of<00:02:07.490> that

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
despite the lack of bosses some of that

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.700 
despite the lack of bosses some of that
is<00:02:07.760> because<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:08.090> really<00:02:08.690> great<00:02:08.869> old-fashioned

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
is because of really great old-fashioned

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.920 
is because of really great old-fashioned
platforming<00:02:10.340> but<00:02:10.940> some<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.390> because<00:02:11.630> of

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
platforming but some of it is because of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.230 
platforming but some of it is because of
bad<00:02:12.140> level<00:02:12.530> design<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:13.100> falling<00:02:13.760> into<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.030> pit

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
bad level design like falling into a pit

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.420
