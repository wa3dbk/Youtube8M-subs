00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.620
 O 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.830
 from danger 2012 we have again 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.960
 brought you this videoweb tv box 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.320
 make each TV 1 martin 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.600
 should 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.390
 in the reason hides behind it 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.300
 large app center the media library of 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:51.080
 ard zdf sat1 includes plus access to 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.280
 it stops you on maxdome and as well 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.699
 merit can work 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.100
 In addition, we can retrieve youtube 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.360
 can surf the web via the browser 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.430
 Here we also see one more 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.229
 application from picasa to the pictures 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.760
 look at 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.470
 but we just catch the whole thing 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.130
 take a look and see what is behind it 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.130
 hidden 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.340
 Here we come the things ever closer 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.240
 and we see here equal coupons 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.000
 Vouchers coupon once for maxdome 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.060
 a blockbuster for free selection ok 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.560
 a quick guide the acquitted 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.640
 and maybe I just happened to also 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.869
 most of which is self-explanatory 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.259
 then we'll have him one more time 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.450
 coupon for zattoo and one 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.979
 manual on the waiver 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.789
 not as a rule we need 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.520
 not really after her 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.189
 the remote control is hereby 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.560
 still around the older model is the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.450
 new one is not there and we hope 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.259
 that we receive but subsequently 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.579
 can 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:15.349
 because we we see basically I asked 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:19.980
 Just look at it with a lot of feeling 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:23.130
 So here's a typical standard 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.709
 keyboard from tv to knows and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.959
 those the battery compartment at the new 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.630
 keyboard is so with the new one 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.680
 Remote control so you have to say it 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.090
 is located on the back one 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.959
 Keyboard about the one very comfortable 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.030
 can make entries 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.579
 and is beneficial yet there are 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.859
 a locked button, so to speak, behind 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.900
 that you can not look at the back of the 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.019
 back then on any buttons 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.840
 so we have to come there exciting 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.569
 still the new version brand comes then 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.010
 let's count a hdmi cable here because one 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.319
 other 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.680
 possibility does not exist the game too 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.680
 transfer 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:08.239
 this little tv box and what, of course 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.840
 not to be missed 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:18.409
 the power supply was very nice for my ideas 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.690
 powerful and defiant but not fail 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.209
 The question is , batteries will be 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.319
 but we'll have a look again 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.319
 this tv box 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:49.090
 okay that's so this dvd video is 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:55.000
 very small and she has a dimension 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:58.780
 of 19 32 15 00 34 centimeters so is 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.970
 This relatively small has one too 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.940
 very low power consumption of only 7.2 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:11.170
 What basically we are doing here 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.200
 turn off the front of the subject area 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:20.350
 At the back we have the connections 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.780
 hdmi lan twice usb power supply and the it 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.770
 Everything is integrated and integrated 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.630
 this box is not doing a wlan yet 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.690
 that means we can use this tv box 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.360
 also quite comfortable about the errors 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.979
 speak to 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.160
 mac address and so on what you can 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:42.610
 that's basically what this needs 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.100
 small tv box for my ideas 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.380
 makes a very interesting impression 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.479
 which of course does not work is that 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.350
 with this box the regular sender 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.500
 can receive 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.470
 Unfortunately, this is not possible and it too 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.689
 is completely sufficient 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.819
 I say 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.219
 to sit on the television and above 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:07.289
 to retrieve common media libraries maybe 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:11.089
 to surf over the browser or that 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:15.119
 to retrieve youtube what else is to say 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:18.119
 that there is the possibility on the mobile phone 

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:25.079
 call youtube to start a video 

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:26.759
 and it here by means of lisa from youtube 

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:29.219
 to transmit the television means 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:33.539
 your cellphone will be right on the 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:36.929
 TV over this tv box transfer 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:38.789
 that in itself a nice idea and yes 

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:41.129
 In the next window we'll take a look 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.929
 what I'm actually behind it 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.929
 hidden and how the whole thing works
