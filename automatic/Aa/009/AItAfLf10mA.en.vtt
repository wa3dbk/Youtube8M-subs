00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
sometimes the tide would come in and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
sometimes the tide would come in and
shorten<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> races<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
shorten the races and so it was just

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.480 
shorten the races and so it was just
really<00:01:30.780> different<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.189> smaller

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
really different and then this smaller

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.600 
really different and then this smaller
