00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.030 
here we just put our minds to it and
everybody<00:02:10.479> did<00:02:10.690> their<00:02:10.810> job<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.739> really

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
everybody did their job and we really

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.220 
everybody did their job and we really
started<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.430> grow<00:02:12.640> then<00:02:12.910> we<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.930> had<00:02:14.079> a<00:02:14.110> lot

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
started to grow then we just had a lot

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.850 
started to grow then we just had a lot
of<00:02:14.290> fun<00:02:14.500> doing<00:02:14.739> it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.640 

after<00:02:20.730> Rudy<00:02:21.150> past<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.600> think<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.380> know<00:02:22.470> we

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
after Rudy past I think that you know we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.930 
after Rudy past I think that you know we
all<00:02:22.800> were<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.010> little<00:02:23.130> bit<00:02:23.310> afraid<00:02:23.370> because<00:02:23.760> we

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
all were a little bit afraid because we

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.740 
all were a little bit afraid because we
didn't<00:02:24.150> know<00:02:24.240> what<00:02:24.390> was<00:02:24.480> going<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.660> happen

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
didn't know what was going to happen

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.590 
didn't know what was going to happen
because<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.320> leader<00:02:25.500> was<00:02:25.710> gone<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.300> just<00:02:27.300> had

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
because the leader was gone I just had

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.290 
because the leader was gone I just had
the<00:02:27.750> confidence<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.470> with<00:02:28.710> our<00:02:28.950> people<00:02:29.400> I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the confidence that with our people I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.540 
the confidence that with our people I
just<00:02:30.630> wanted<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.990> put<00:02:31.200> out<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.560> Joanne<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.190> I
