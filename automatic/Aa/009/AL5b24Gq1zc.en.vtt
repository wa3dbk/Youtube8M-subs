here<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:12.259> albums<00:01:12.829> are<00:01:13.009> designed<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.990> kind<00:01:14.990> of

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
here but albums are designed to kind of

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.520 
here but albums are designed to kind of
break<00:01:15.770> down<00:01:16.070> events<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.420> if<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:17.630> think<00:01:17.899> of<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
break down events so if you think of the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.610 
break down events so if you think of the
event<00:01:18.680> as<00:01:19.130> kind<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.580> main<00:01:20.000> bucket<00:01:20.479> we<00:01:21.290> then

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
event as kind of the main bucket we then

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.120 
event as kind of the main bucket we then
use<00:01:21.860> albums<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.790> kind<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.180> sub<00:01:23.510> categorize<00:01:24.229> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
use albums to kind of sub categorize the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.530 
use albums to kind of sub categorize the
events<00:01:25.580> or<00:01:25.729> multiple<00:01:26.420> events<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.380> we'll<00:01:27.770> take
