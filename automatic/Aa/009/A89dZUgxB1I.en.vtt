00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.699
 hello you love i am christian roth 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.900
 and shows you something of today again 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:27.060
 a mathilde i have a house jacket 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.710
 knitted from 1963 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.309
 I'll show you the pattern, too 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.190
 it is a very simple pattern 31 and 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:40.000
 the pattern page is on the left gue 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.790
 strict side ok as you can see we are 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.110
 here next to the workshop and me 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.909
 just need it here now 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.239
 rebuild a bit and then it works 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.780
 continue 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.229
 Hell hell, that's what we're in right now 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.879
 Workshop is the first pattern I have 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.739
 that was really total 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.150
 simply from the jacket there are always three 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.949
 Knitted mesh and a mesh in 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.670
 rest position and in the next row 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.720
 then the whole set off a little 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.320
 I have pieces here 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.770
 made 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:19.080
 I always use for such things completely 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.080
 like such a movable 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.890
 Particles so nagl voters and indeed can 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.450
 you actually all here individually 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.040
 that means I have now here 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.500
 down three stitches and one stitch 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.190
 which I then get up that is one 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.050
 needle and I can then always here 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.770
 put on shift I had now so 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:49.420
 finally the fourth needle in rest position 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.229
 from the left and take now the whole 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.140
 added 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:02:02.370
 that is the first needle in 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:08.170
 rest position up left right and 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:10.799
 the whole thing back and again 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.799
 added 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.269
 and one more purely and immediately running 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.129
 this pattern is always offset 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.909
 stretched maybe you can do that too 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.909
 even closer 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.280
 So that's the left side is the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:45.049
 pattern side that is on the right 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:51.450
 page looks pretty pretty 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:57.200
 From unspectacular you know so high 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.359
 brought stitches and from the left side 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.579
 is it then as I said the pattern page 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:07.700
 and so all the hardness is knitted that 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:11.940
 of course, see this in this one 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.459
 fourth the simulated wool sees this 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.459
 of course much better 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.640
 so ok at the same time the jacket or 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:30.959
 maybe I already have it 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:33.090
 made before because I have one 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.170
 jacket finished and one 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:43.280
 Mansion jacket from this knicks 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:50.750
 magazin and that is from february 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:57.060
 I made this jacket in 1963 and 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:04:00.599
 I made was to testify 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:05.689
 of reasons in such a gray brown 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.689
 melange moment there is this here 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.289
 I thought it was really nice because I did that 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:27.449
 very suitable for this thing 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:29.130
 the bags put the bags and 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.260
 I do not have the collar off cord 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:37.190
 made as it was stated 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:42.419
 but from a garden 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:47.210
 I have to look for that right now 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:50.220
 the instructions and that's what I have there 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.770
 the meshes per made and so came 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.750
 with this with this mesh sample super 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.759
 Good way 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.560
 the pattern is this one here 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:04.860
 that is always 3 1 that is three stitches 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.889
 knit a stitch in rest position and 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.080
 the whole way back and in the 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:15.650
 next row is the whole then 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.930
 another one moves to the next page 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.990
 then you see or see those too 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.949
 cut parts the sizes that came 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.150
 About 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.800
 I thought that was great, too 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.880
 cut parts these are the cut parts 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.430
 for the one for the one for the 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.520
 scarf wear once judgment on underside 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:45.130
 you have to enlarge that then 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:53.830
 So far, it worked quite well 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:57.100
 is now said jacket on it 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:04.990
 I have taken a few buttons in high 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:11.460
 optics the shawl collar sewn and after 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:14.950
 Sewn in the sleeves around the sleeves 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.740
 Sewn from the inside with the machine from 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.730
 outside then by hand 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:25.180
 also the same middle bags of 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.930
 Hands , the whole looks like this me 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.090
 Hope you can see it that way 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.690
 oh so that's a mansion as I said 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.220
 jacket from 1963 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.430
 and I but no men 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.710
 Tailor doll has this jacket 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.240
 now, unfortunately, a few bumps in front 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:48.850
 My darling does not have any 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.210
 Incidentally, I am quite proud of the mistake 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.210
 it
