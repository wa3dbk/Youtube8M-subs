00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.140
 good 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.490
 my name is the nan ascencio and the zoom 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.300
 education department official 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.580
 municipal in charge of everything that is 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.860
 School Safety and the Landaben 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.750
 of course to see all that is the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.300
 integral plan of I made a school of 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.890
 our commune of the municipal sector the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.320
 theme that we are going to see today is with 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.420
 regarding the handling and use of fire extinguisher 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.390
 fires something very basic that all 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.910
 person should know and it is recommended 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.590
 also that they know and know 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.610
 drive 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.100
 these are the types of extinguishers that 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 we found in our school 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.719
 commune and we have painters of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.890
 4 kilos of 6 kilos and 10 kilos 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.460
 normally what they are using are 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.530
 of 4 and 6 since it is easier to 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.720
 handling the fire extinguisher 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 some parts it is important that you 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.869
 know what it is for is a container 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 has an expulsion hose 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.729
 extinguishing agent comes from inside that is 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.360
 dry chemical a clock that is called 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.929
 manometer to see the pressure that has 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.720
 the container inside it 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.330
 container 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.990
 the extinguishing agent how will it come out 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.410
 the hose of the ejector hose 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.120
 where is 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.270
 the written agent to be able to turn off the 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.039
 fire 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.030
 in a general way we can say that the 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.070
 painters serve only to pay a 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.650
 fire principle a fire that 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 just start 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.119
 if we have smoke 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.179
 and we locate the fire we can 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.579
 come quickly with an extinguisher and for 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.579
 supposed to apply the emergency plan 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.759
 of the place be school be house at the same time 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.159
 also ask for support help and call the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.619
 emergency agencies as a fireman 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.560
 in this case we have phone at hand 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.400
 to be able to make the call and be able to 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 get with more good support the extinguisher 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.489
 as I said this is a fire extinguisher 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.490
 dry chemical powder for the fires of 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.000
 type abc 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.400
 the Chilean norm d 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.890
 the Chilean indicates that we have four 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 types of fire I kiss her and from this 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.740
 are regulated with letters and 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.650
 objectives are correspond to 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.590
 solid fuels wood part of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.590
 cardboard in the fires type d 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.720
 Flammable material or fuels are 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.440
 oak paraffin pectorals and 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.670
 Type 6 games are fires that are 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.390
 involved all 10 teams 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.090
 Electric in Egypt 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.819
 First of all, the different one has to 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.280
 be located in a visible place and 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.920
 expeditiously that there is no obstacle 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.120
 thing that some arrive place take them out 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.920
 quickly and here go to the place where 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.580
 the fire is starting 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.350
 one pulls out the expulsion hose 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:30.590
 it is taken as follows not here nor 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.450
 here or even far ahead but to 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.080
 a quarter of the mouthpiece part 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.470
 the insurance is taken out this has an insurance 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.960
 which if I arrive and throw like that is not going to 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.960
 go out 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.090
 I arrive I have to make a quick turn 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.090
 going to cut sack the insurance 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.570
 immediately trigger install the powder 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.840
 dry chemical towards the base of the 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.300
 fire with a small neighborhood 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.770
 If I have a principle of fire 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.630
 a wall is 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.750
 burning a wall 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:14.160
 I the fire came attacked him from below 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.670
 upwards in the longitudinal direction and 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.180
 we have an open fire 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.270
 on the floor at last 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.539
 the movement to the horizontal base 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.110
 the fires always have to be left well 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.150
 off the extinguisher is discharged 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.000
 completely once the 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.350
 Dry chemical powder must be returned to 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.560
 recharge 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:45.280
 if I get to the active preco the extinguisher 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.280
 of salt powder that uncle came and what 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.380
 I'm going to run again it's in its place 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.020
 the dust that is inside and will not come back 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.540
 to leave because this has a gas that 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.180
 nitrogen called the one that gives you the pressure 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.820
 that has to be in the colored part 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.220
 yellow the needle to be said of 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.110
 that this compression and you can be 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.570
 usable 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.720
 if I arrive and I charge it and use it a very 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.460
 little already after like nitrogen and 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.140
 it came out I activate it again in a 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.850
 emergency, the dust will not come out 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.730
 chemical has to be emptied 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.050
 completely and take it to the body 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.560
 corresponding to be recharged 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.830
 again it is operational that is the 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.220
 way in general how to use a 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.919
 extinguisher of the center the chemical powder not 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.259
 it's toxic continues there's no fear if you 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.629
 the face breathes is not there is no 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:43.280
 no problem with the organism is not 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.280
 it is not toxic let's say 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.350
 these containers are red they have 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.420
 to be in a place with your 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.870
 corresponding signage signage 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:58.190
 to be located there are also rules of 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.990
 that in 120 square meters you have to 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.330
 have a four- shot fire extinguisher in a 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:07.750
 building and 220 square meters 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:12.699
 adding with one of six kilos of four 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:15.370
 shots are 120 square meters for 1 224 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:18.380
 6 meters and from there upwards command 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.050
 of 10 kilos 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.260
 this is in a general way what we can 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.290
 say regarding the use of fire extinguisher 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.250
 what is what it is for and how it works 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:35.240
 use do not forget that you have a 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:37.640
 manometer a description handle and 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.060
 also the hose where the agent leaves 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.520
 fried and towards the base of the fire in shape 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.990
 of sweep do not throw the flame 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.650
 directly has to from the base the 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.810
 fire progresses and recedes 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:55.360
 looking if there is again some 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:58.009
 start to pay again 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.009
 do not 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:03.849
 this is an advice to educate the 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.849
 we bite tve
