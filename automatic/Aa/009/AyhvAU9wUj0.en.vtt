00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the rubber coating off that way you can

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
the rubber coating off that way you can
conduct<00:00:37.680> electricity<00:00:38.149> or<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.390> use<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
conduct electricity or I can use a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.700 
conduct electricity or I can use a
lighter<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> lighter<00:00:40.559> with

me right now alright so first thing you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.549 
me right now alright so first thing you
need<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.270> obviously<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> cut<00:00:49.200> into<00:00:49.440> this

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
need to do obviously is to cut into this

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.560 
need to do obviously is to cut into this
and<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.430> once<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.390> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
and then once you do that you have to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.389 
and then once you do that you have to
find<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.050> orange<00:00:52.410> wire<00:00:53.660> orange<00:00:54.660> by<00:00:55.219> its<00:00:56.219> gonna

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
find the orange wire orange by its gonna

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.270 
find the orange wire orange by its gonna
be<00:00:56.489> wrapped<00:00:56.699> around<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.000> white<00:00:57.719> wire<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.280> once

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
be wrapped around a white wire and once

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.069 
be wrapped around a white wire and once
you<00:00:59.399> find<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.120> cut<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.510> half<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you find it you just cut it in half and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.820 
you find it you just cut it in half and
you<00:01:02.000> strip<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.420> rubber<00:01:03.690> coating<00:01:04.229> off<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you strip the rubber coating off the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
you strip the rubber coating off the
wire<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.460> there's<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.570> copper<00:01:06.900> wire

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
wire that way there's just copper wire

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
wire that way there's just copper wire
that's<00:01:07.320> conduct<00:01:08.010> electricity<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that's conduct electricity so the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.250 
that's conduct electricity so the
current<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.270> flow<00:01:09.299> through<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.990> your<00:01:10.110> lack

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
current can flow through and your lack

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.230 
current can flow through and your lack
switch<00:01:10.500> works<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> once<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:14.240> you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
switch works so once you do that you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.300 
switch works so once you do that you
attach<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.049> orange<00:01:16.350> wires<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> two<00:01:17.100> leads

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
attach the orange wires to the two leads

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.910 
attach the orange wires to the two leads
of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> lights<00:01:17.729> finish<00:01:18.350> two<00:01:19.350> beats<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.770> light

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
of the lights finish two beats of light

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.950 
of the lights finish two beats of light
switch<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.430> two<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:24.210> attach<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.810> two

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
switch one two and you attach the two

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.069 
switch one two and you attach the two
leads<00:01:25.159> like<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.630> all<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.680> just

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
leads like this all I have to do is just

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.920 
leads like this all I have to do is just
wrap<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.110> around<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.720> screw

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
wrap it around like that and just screw

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.830 
wrap it around like that and just screw
it<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> same

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it on and then you just do the same

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
it on and then you just do the same
thing<00:01:38.270> for<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.600> other<00:01:39.630> side<00:01:40.079> which<00:01:40.950> I'll<00:01:41.220> do

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
thing for the other side which I'll do

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.960 
thing for the other side which I'll do
in<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.670> second

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.580 

and<00:01:45.970> make<00:01:46.540> sure<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.720> don't<00:01:46.780> screw<00:01:47.079> it<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.380> too

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
and make sure you don't screw it on too

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.960 
and make sure you don't screw it on too
tight<00:01:47.860> because<00:01:48.009> if<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.250> do<00:01:48.399> it'll<00:01:48.610> rip<00:01:48.790> the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
tight because if you do it'll rip the

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.710 
tight because if you do it'll rip the
wire<00:01:49.119> off<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.759> you<00:01:51.880> attach<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.539> other

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
wire off so and you attach to the other

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.690 
wire off so and you attach to the other
side<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.450> make<00:01:55.509> sure<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:57.009> orange<00:01:57.490> wire

side and make sure you the orange wire

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.620 
side and make sure you the orange wire
once<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:59.039> cut<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.159> it's<00:02:00.369> like<00:02:00.610> four<00:02:01.119> inches

once you cut it it's like four inches
long<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.110> each<00:02:02.259> side<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:04.000> once<00:02:04.179> your<00:02:04.299> screw

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
long on each side so once your screw

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.779 
long on each side so once your screw
both<00:02:04.720> ends<00:02:05.020> on<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.380> should<00:02:05.979> look<00:02:06.670> like<00:02:06.729> this

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
both ends on it should look like this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.259 
both ends on it should look like this
orange<00:02:09.789> wire<00:02:10.110> both<00:02:11.110> sides<00:02:11.380> attached<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.370> two

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
orange wire both sides attached to two

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.490 
orange wire both sides attached to two
leads<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.260> night<00:02:14.470> switch<00:02:14.739> tada<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.500> how

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
leads of the night switch tada and how

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.570 
leads of the night switch tada and how
it<00:02:17.560> works<00:02:17.799> is<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.160> go<00:02:18.280> into<00:02:18.489> a

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
it works is you go into a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.539 
it works is you go into a
search-and-destroy<00:02:19.000> match<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.280> plug

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
search-and-destroy match and you plug

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.670 
search-and-destroy match and you plug
one<00:02:22.510> before<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.989> want<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.230> search<00:02:23.410> for<00:02:23.440> a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
one before you want to search for a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.520
