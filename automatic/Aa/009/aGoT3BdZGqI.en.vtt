00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
if you want to hit chip shots and pitch

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.169 
if you want to hit chip shots and pitch
shots<00:00:09.480> closer<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> hole<00:00:10.759> then<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.790> two

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
shots closer to the hole then the two

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.879 
shots closer to the hole then the two
characteristics<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.139> come<00:00:13.440> straight<00:00:13.650> to

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
characteristics that come straight to

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.099 
characteristics that come straight to
mind<00:00:14.130> would<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:15.150> control<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> direction

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
mind would be to control the direction

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.380 
mind would be to control the direction
of<00:00:16.199> your<00:00:16.350> shot<00:00:16.400> and<00:00:17.400> control<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> distance

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
of your shot and control the distance

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.529 
of your shot and control the distance

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
understand where good pitching comes

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.990 
understand where good pitching comes
from<00:00:28.619> people<00:00:29.220> who<00:00:29.250> pitch<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.849> ball

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
from people who pitch the ball

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.990 
from people who pitch the ball
consistently<00:00:30.960> well<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:32.489> swing<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> golf

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
consistently well can swing the golf

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.970 
consistently well can swing the golf
club<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> plane<00:00:33.989> that's<00:00:34.320> close<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
club on a plane that's close to the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.610 
club on a plane that's close to the
original<00:00:35.370> plane<00:00:35.719> consistently<00:00:36.719> with<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
original plane consistently with the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
original plane consistently with the
correct<00:00:38.010> amount<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.399> rotation<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
correct amount of rotation of the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.700 
correct amount of rotation of the
clubface<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:39.930> striking<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> ball<00:00:40.530> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
clubface as it's striking the ball so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
clubface as it's striking the ball so
what<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.920> mean<00:00:40.950> by<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.120> set<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
what do I mean by that if I set up to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.970 
what do I mean by that if I set up to
this<00:00:42.690> golf<00:00:42.960> ball<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> ground

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
this golf ball that I have on the ground

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.650 
this golf ball that I have on the ground
you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.309> again<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.570> in

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you can see again like I have in

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
you can see again like I have in
previous<00:00:46.050> lessons<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.590> my<00:00:46.710> yellow<00:00:47.100> line

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
previous lessons I have my yellow line

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.920 
previous lessons I have my yellow line
stretched<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.270> get<00:00:48.360> an<00:00:48.480> idea<00:00:48.809> of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
stretched out so that you get an idea of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.330 
stretched out so that you get an idea of
the<00:00:49.020> direction<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.530> hitting<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:49.920> golf<00:00:50.129> shot

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the direction I'm hitting my golf shot

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
the direction I'm hitting my golf shot
what<00:00:50.820> I've<00:00:50.969> also<00:00:51.120> done<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.690> put<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
what I've also done is I put down a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.130 
what I've also done is I put down a
piece<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:53.010> plywood<00:00:53.660> they<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.840> propped

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
piece of plywood they have propped

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
piece of plywood they have propped
against<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> golf<00:00:55.739> shaft<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:57.000> just

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
against a golf shaft to really just

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.720 
against a golf shaft to really just
illustrate<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.379> idea<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.129> swing<00:00:59.460> plane

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
illustrate the idea of this swing plane

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
illustrate the idea of this swing plane
and<00:00:59.879> what<00:00:59.969> I've<00:01:00.090> done<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> I've<00:01:00.570> set<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.410> angle

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and what I've done is I've set the angle

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.369 
and what I've done is I've set the angle
of<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.039> ply<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.940> basically<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.899> angle<00:01:04.260> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
of this ply up to basically the angle of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.740 
of this ply up to basically the angle of
this<00:01:04.580> sand<00:01:05.580> wedge<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.479> hand

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
this sand wedge that I have in my hand

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.330 
this sand wedge that I have in my hand
so<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.290> understand<00:01:07.770> this

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
so that you can understand this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.870 
so that you can understand this
relationship<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.460> golf<00:01:11.670> club

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
relationship that is that the golf club

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
relationship that is that the golf club
is<00:01:12.000> built<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.360> an<00:01:12.510> inclined<00:01:12.900> plane<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.380> must

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
is built on an inclined plane and must

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
is built on an inclined plane and must
maintain<00:01:13.799> its<00:01:14.280> relationship<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
maintain its relationship to the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.760 
maintain its relationship to the
inclined<00:01:15.720> plane<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.290> want<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> hit<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
inclined plane if you want to hit the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
inclined plane if you want to hit the
golf<00:01:16.920> shot<00:01:17.189> better<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.689> means<00:01:18.930> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
golf shot better so what that means is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
golf shot better so what that means is
that<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.380> can't<00:01:19.740> move<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> golf<00:01:20.340> club<00:01:20.549> too<00:01:20.759> far

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that I can't move the golf club too far

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
that I can't move the golf club too far
away<00:01:21.240> from<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.570> plane<00:01:21.810> either<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.680> way<00:01:22.890> or

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
away from the plane either this way or

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.469 
away from the plane either this way or
that<00:01:23.070> way<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that way that what I would do is as I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
that way that what I would do is as I
swing<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> golf<00:01:24.990> club<00:01:25.110> back<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> maintain

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
swing the golf club back that I maintain

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.240 
swing the golf club back that I maintain
this<00:01:27.049> straight-line<00:01:28.049> relationship<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
this straight-line relationship of the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.030 
this straight-line relationship of the
plane<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.299> as<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.600> look<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
plane so as you look at it here the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.880 
plane so as you look at it here the
plane<00:01:32.479> angle<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> shaft<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.560> look<00:01:34.710> like

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
plane angle of the shaft will look like

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.350 
plane angle of the shaft will look like
it's<00:01:35.070> swinging<00:01:35.310> back<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.790> straight<00:01:36.090> line

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it's swinging back in a straight line

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.969 
it's swinging back in a straight line
but<00:01:36.570> actually<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> head<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.470> moving<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.860> an

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
but actually the head is moving in an

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.580 
but actually the head is moving in an
arc<00:01:38.159> around<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:39.060> body<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.810> shaft<00:01:40.140> appears

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
arc around your body the shaft appears

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
arc around your body the shaft appears
to<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:40.829> moving<00:01:40.979> straight<00:01:41.549> back<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.939> straight

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
to be moving straight back and straight

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
through but the club head is moving in

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
an arc so when I strike this golf shot
what<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.579> want<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.909> make<00:01:48.090> sure

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
what I want to do is I want to make sure

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
what I want to do is I want to make sure
that<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> golf<00:01:48.930> club<00:01:49.200> maintains<00:01:49.770> its

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
that the golf club maintains its

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.069 
that the golf club maintains its
relationship<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.450> golf<00:01:51.630> club<00:01:51.869> head

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
relationship the golf club head

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.260 
relationship the golf club head
maintains<00:01:52.530> its<00:01:52.710> relationship<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.640> target

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
maintains its relationship to the target

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
maintains its relationship to the target
line<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> shaft<00:01:55.649> does<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.130> move

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
line and that the shaft does not move

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
line and that the shaft does not move
too<00:01:56.520> far<00:01:56.700> away<00:01:56.880> from<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.180> board<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.990> let<00:01:58.079> me

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
too far away from this board so let me

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.569 
too far away from this board so let me
just<00:01:58.320> hit<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.619> shot<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> little<00:01:59.399> pitch

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
just hit one shot for you a little pitch

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
just hit one shot for you a little pitch
shot<00:01:59.689> and<00:02:00.689> we'll<00:02:00.899> talk<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.680> from<00:02:01.799> there

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.690 

so<00:02:05.649> what<00:02:05.770> I've<00:02:05.890> done<00:02:06.039> there<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.399> I've<00:02:06.520> just

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
so what I've done there is I've just

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.619 
so what I've done there is I've just
swung<00:02:06.909> back<00:02:07.060> along<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.140> plane<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:10.420> going<00:02:10.569> to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
swung back along the plane I'm going to

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.970 
swung back along the plane I'm going to
ball<00:02:10.750> teed<00:02:10.959> up<00:02:11.050> right<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.440> top<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.800> line

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
ball teed up right on top of the line

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.160 
ball teed up right on top of the line
here<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.780> can<00:02:13.959> see

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
here like this just so that you can see

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.780 
here like this just so that you can see
this<00:02:14.290> if<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.560> was<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.800> hold<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.099> club<00:02:15.250> directly

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
this if I was to hold the club directly

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.790 
this if I was to hold the club directly
against<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.239> like<00:02:16.269> this<00:02:16.569> this<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.530> kind<00:02:17.739> of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
against it like this this is kind of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.770 
against it like this this is kind of
what<00:02:17.950> I'm<00:02:18.069> talking<00:02:18.430> about<00:02:18.489> but<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> golf

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
what I'm talking about but the golf

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.930 
what I'm talking about but the golf
shaft<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.410> moving<00:02:21.010> back<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.370> forward<00:02:21.610> along

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
shaft is moving back and forward along

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.150 
shaft is moving back and forward along
the<00:02:22.060> plane<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.110> club<00:02:23.349> head<00:02:23.560> itself<00:02:23.920> is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
the plane but the club head itself is

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.120 
the plane but the club head itself is
inscribing<00:02:25.120> an<00:02:25.390> arc<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.319> board<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
inscribing an arc on this board so the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.009 
inscribing an arc on this board so the
golf<00:02:27.310> club<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.640> moving<00:02:28.000> back<00:02:28.420> along<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.810> plane

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
golf club is moving back along the plane

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.720 
golf club is moving back along the plane
and<00:02:29.319> in<00:02:29.410> an<00:02:29.560> arc<00:02:29.739> around<00:02:30.130> your<00:02:30.310> body<00:02:30.459> if<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
and in an arc around your body if the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.160 
and in an arc around your body if the
swing<00:02:30.970> was<00:02:31.090> long<00:02:31.269> enough<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.900> would<00:02:32.049> of<00:02:32.140> course

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
swing was long enough it would of course

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.320 
swing was long enough it would of course
go<00:02:32.440> back<00:02:32.650> like<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.670> would<00:02:33.819> go<00:02:33.849> right<00:02:34.150> up

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
go back like this it would go right up

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.839 
go back like this it would go right up
to<00:02:34.360> here<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.500> end<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> handle<00:02:36.700> here

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
to here and this end of the handle here

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.910 
to here and this end of the handle here
would<00:02:36.940> point<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.390> yellow<00:02:37.720> line<00:02:37.989> coming

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
would point to that yellow line coming

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.240 
would point to that yellow line coming
down<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.310> would<00:02:39.430> follow<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.940> yellow<00:02:40.239> line

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
down it would follow that yellow line

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.620 
down it would follow that yellow line
the<00:02:42.250> club<00:02:42.459> head<00:02:42.640> this<00:02:42.940> end<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.299> shaft<00:02:43.510> now

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
the club head this end of the shaft now

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.300 
the club head this end of the shaft now
would<00:02:43.840> be<00:02:43.930> touching<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.470> line<00:02:44.799> or<00:02:45.010> pointing

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
would be touching that line or pointing

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.220 
would be touching that line or pointing
to<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.579> it<00:02:46.030> comes<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:46.420> along<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:46.930> very

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
to it it comes back along it's very

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.960 
to it it comes back along it's very
close<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.829> original<00:02:47.920> planet<00:02:48.489> started<00:02:48.849> on

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
close to the original planet started on

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.210 
close to the original planet started on
strikes<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.599> golf<00:02:49.810> ball<00:02:50.110> travels<00:02:51.010> through

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
strikes the golf ball travels through

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.880 
strikes the golf ball travels through
notice<00:02:51.519> how<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.730> stays<00:02:51.970> on<00:02:52.120> its<00:02:52.239> plane<00:02:52.890> stays

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
notice how it stays on its plane stays

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.650 
notice how it stays on its plane stays
on<00:02:54.069> its<00:02:54.190> plane<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.640> club<00:02:54.880> which<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.450> club

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
on its plane in the club which the club

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.509 
on its plane in the club which the club
head<00:02:55.840> would<00:02:55.959> start<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.349> rotate<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:57.069> way<00:02:57.280> and

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
head would start to rotate this way and

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.069 
head would start to rotate this way and
back<00:02:57.730> up<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:57.970> plane<00:02:58.269> on<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.540> side<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:58.959> this

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
back up the plane on this side so this

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.569 
back up the plane on this side so this
is<00:02:59.290> kind<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.620> what<00:02:59.769> we're<00:02:59.890> talking<00:03:00.069> about<00:03:00.280> a

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
is kind of what we're talking about a

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.270 
is kind of what we're talking about a
lot<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.180> people<00:03:01.480> don't<00:03:01.780> understand<00:03:02.349> this<00:03:02.560> then

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
lot of people don't understand this then

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.220 
lot of people don't understand this then
they<00:03:03.370> set<00:03:03.549> up<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.849> golf<00:03:04.060> ball<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.510> golf<00:03:04.930> club

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
they set up to a golf ball the golf club

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.350 
they set up to a golf ball the golf club
too<00:03:05.530> often<00:03:05.920> gets<00:03:06.099> too<00:03:06.310> quickly<00:03:06.730> behind<00:03:06.910> their

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
too often gets too quickly behind their

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.390 
too often gets too quickly behind their
body<00:03:07.540> line<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.709> club<00:03:08.920> head<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.130> going

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
body line that is the club head is going

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.580 
body line that is the club head is going
over<00:03:09.639> here<00:03:09.670> too<00:03:10.030> much<00:03:10.209> it's<00:03:10.780> never<00:03:11.079> staying<00:03:11.440> in

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
over here too much it's never staying in

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.170 
over here too much it's never staying in
front<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.920> them<00:03:12.010> enough<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:12.760> if<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:12.940> want<00:03:13.120> to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
is traveling along the plane and up so

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.849 
is traveling along the plane and up so
the<00:03:22.420> club<00:03:22.630> head<00:03:22.780> really<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.260> relation<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.680> my

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
the club head really in relation to my

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.379 
the club head really in relation to my
hands<00:03:24.069> here<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:24.400> still<00:03:24.670> kind<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:24.940> in<00:03:25.060> front<00:03:25.209> of

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
hands here is still kind of in front of

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.270 
hands here is still kind of in front of
my<00:03:25.450> hands<00:03:25.870> it's<00:03:26.380> not<00:03:26.590> over<00:03:26.889> here<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.220> is

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
my hands it's not over here this is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.349 
my hands it's not over here this is
where<00:03:27.489> you're<00:03:27.579> going<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.760> get<00:03:27.819> into<00:03:28.060> trouble

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
where you're going to get into trouble

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.199 
where you're going to get into trouble
if<00:03:28.450> your<00:03:28.569> club<00:03:28.720> gets<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.109> here<00:03:30.000> swings<00:03:31.000> back

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
if your club gets to here swings back

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.240 
if your club gets to here swings back
along<00:03:31.540> stays<00:03:31.870> more<00:03:32.200> in<00:03:32.319> front<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.829> then

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
along stays more in front and then

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.089 
along stays more in front and then
swings<00:03:33.519> through

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.220 

and<00:03:36.609> again<00:03:36.939> I've<00:03:37.030> had<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.329> pitch<00:03:37.510> shots<00:03:37.749> there

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
and again I've had to pitch shots there

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.199 
and again I've had to pitch shots there
they've<00:03:39.069> gone<00:03:39.189> pretty<00:03:39.489> much<00:03:39.640> down<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:39.969> target

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
they've gone pretty much down the target

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.149 
they've gone pretty much down the target
line<00:03:40.329> maybe<00:03:40.900> slightly<00:03:41.290> left<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.799> that<00:03:41.920> line

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
line maybe slightly left of that line

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.910 
line maybe slightly left of that line
but<00:03:42.340> if<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.329> walked<00:03:43.569> up<00:03:43.749> to<00:03:43.780> where<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.680> would<00:03:44.799> be

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
but if I walked up to where it would be

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.349 
but if I walked up to where it would be
on<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.099> green<00:03:45.249> had<00:03:45.430> be<00:03:45.519> only<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:46.030> left<00:03:46.239> of

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
on the green had be only just left of

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.429 
on the green had be only just left of
the<00:03:46.450> hole<00:03:46.599> so<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.930> wouldn't<00:03:47.139> be<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.230> bad<00:03:47.409> thing

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
the hole so that wouldn't be a bad thing

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.679 
the hole so that wouldn't be a bad thing
so<00:03:47.889> just<00:03:48.120> understanding<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.299> lesson

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
so just understanding in this lesson

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.629 
so just understanding in this lesson
we're<00:03:49.810> swinging<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.139> golf<00:03:50.319> club<00:03:50.560> along<00:03:51.489> the

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
we're swinging the golf club along the

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.440 
we're swinging the golf club along the
plane<00:03:51.909> in<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.959> gentle<00:03:53.319> arc<00:03:53.939> back<00:03:54.939> and<00:03:55.209> through

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
plane in the gentle arc back and through

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.229 
plane in the gentle arc back and through
now<00:03:56.409> you<00:03:56.680> shouldn't<00:03:57.219> do<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.549> yourself

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
now you shouldn't do this yourself

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.030 
now you shouldn't do this yourself
this<00:03:59.019> would<00:03:59.139> be<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.230> bit<00:03:59.349> dangerous<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.889> hit

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
this would be a bit dangerous to hit

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.830 
this would be a bit dangerous to hit
shots<00:04:00.310> like<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:00.760> but<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.510> hope<00:04:01.689> you

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
shots like this but I hope you

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.020 
shots like this but I hope you
understand<00:04:02.319> by<00:04:02.500> looking<00:04:02.530> at<00:04:02.919> this<00:04:03.099> and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
understand by looking at this and

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.390 
understand by looking at this and
understanding<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.109> when<00:04:05.829> next<00:04:06.040> time<00:04:06.249> you're

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
understanding it when next time you're

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.920 
understanding it when next time you're
playing<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.760> shot<00:04:07.030> you're<00:04:07.569> going<00:04:07.689> to<00:04:07.780> hit<00:04:07.900> a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
playing a shot you're going to hit a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.589 
playing a shot you're going to hit a
shot<00:04:08.139> towards<00:04:08.919> a<00:04:09.010> green<00:04:09.310> try<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.209> keep<00:04:10.450> the

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
shot towards a green try to keep the

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.869 
shot towards a green try to keep the
golf<00:04:10.810> shaft<00:04:11.139> on<00:04:11.469> its<00:04:11.859> original<00:04:12.340> plane<00:04:12.549> as<00:04:12.790> it

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
golf shaft on its original plane as it

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.129 
golf shaft on its original plane as it
goes<00:04:13.000> back<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.419> through<00:04:13.599> even<00:04:13.840> if<00:04:13.930> it's<00:04:14.049> only

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
goes back and through even if it's only

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.080 
goes back and through even if it's only
a<00:04:14.260> chip<00:04:14.500> shot<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.219> if<00:04:15.340> it's<00:04:15.489> only<00:04:15.609> a<00:04:15.699> shot<00:04:15.969> that

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
a chip shot so if it's only a shot that

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.460 
a chip shot so if it's only a shot that
goes<00:04:16.150> back<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.449> small<00:04:16.750> distance<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.229> through<00:04:17.440> a

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
goes back a small distance and through a

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.800 
goes back a small distance and through a
short<00:04:18.009> distance<00:04:18.310> make<00:04:19.180> sure<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.660> it's

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
short distance make sure that it's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.449 
short distance make sure that it's
maintain<00:04:20.229> its<00:04:20.380> relationship<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.009> the<00:04:21.160> plane

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
maintain its relationship to the plane

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.330 
maintain its relationship to the plane
and<00:04:21.699> you'll<00:04:22.240> hit<00:04:22.479> a<00:04:22.720> lot<00:04:23.620> better<00:04:23.830> golf<00:04:24.070> shots

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and you'll hit a lot better golf shots

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.520 
and you'll hit a lot better golf shots
more<00:04:24.490> consistently<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.020> direction<00:04:26.349> of

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
more consistently in the direction of

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.659 
more consistently in the direction of
the<00:04:26.650> target<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.070> you'll<00:04:27.160> certainly<00:04:27.340> hit<00:04:27.580> it

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
the target and you'll certainly hit it

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.240 
the target and you'll certainly hit it
more<00:04:27.759> solidly
