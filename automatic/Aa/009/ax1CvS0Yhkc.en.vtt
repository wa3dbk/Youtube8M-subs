00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.710
 Good morning guys in this video you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.440
 I explain how the steering wheel works like 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.849
 must be shot there are various 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 technical 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.480
 let's see what they are and then see 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.220
 a moment how it works specifically 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 first of all the hands are always held 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.800
 at 9:00 , so that you can 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.170
 arrive immediately to make a flash on the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.849
 case of immediate danger to the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 right arrow can put the arrow a 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.450
 left or national i 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.460
 wipers ok well the steering wheel 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 right when my hands are 9 15 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.450
 and the emblem of the citroen here are the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.870
 hairpins upwards and above all yes 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.440
 reads the word airbag 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.370
 ok you do n't leave and to be able to shoot 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.070
 steering wheel as I said before there are 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.289
 let's say two techniques 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.660
 one that must be used 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.970
 in reverse parking maneuvers 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.720
 or for very narrow spaces is that of the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.229
 arm crossing technique ok is 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.229
 the following 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:23.090
 the face was filmed everything and for 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.719
 be discharged right 1 ok let's see 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.329
 do it again 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:34.189
 through the left 1234 we have 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.060
 shot all completely 1 2 3 and 4 for 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.250
 turn right 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 same thing we put the arrow 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.429
 things see us 1 2 3 and 4 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.549
 I turned it around to put it straight 1 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.929
 2 3 and 4 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.849
 ok this is the crossover technique 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.530
 arms obviously to turn it 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.020
 well you have to try to maneuver the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.509
 hands and to move them is always in the part 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.429
 in the upper half of the steering wheel and le 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.989
 my hands never fall below are 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.989
 always above look again 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:14.989
 1234 I shot it all 1234 will be 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.359
 damned with his hands on the steering wheel 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.970
 with his thumbs in here with his arms 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.380
 9 15 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.709
 the other technique for turning the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.109
 flying is the one they use 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.319
 let's say the slightly older versions 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:32.510
 so ok your arms instead of moving 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.819
 in the upper part they move in the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.900
 half right or left 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.900
 so and so 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.750
 until that island came to an end e 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.010
 then the same is resigned 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.600
 identical move and then descend to the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.050
 hands at 9 15 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:57.540
 this time we relive to the right 1234 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.230
 and it turned around when I owe myself 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:07.319
 resign right to 123 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:10.250
 4 this type of movement usually does not 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.750
 I'll have it done for you personally 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.250
 as I said before it is more used 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.370
 we are all old people 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.319
 beautiful jovanotti and snav quote steering wheel 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.720
 with the other technique that of the crossing 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:27.150
 of the bank arms and then there is the place 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.470
 common saying and school arms 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.170
 driving does not cross is not 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:37.500
 absolutely true 1234 to put back 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.160
 straight 12 I see inside three I see inside 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.329
 four ok 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.849
 what you never have to do though is 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.579
 stay with your arms crossed 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.269
 so this should not be done at all 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.420
 those who say are right here 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.370
 the arms do not cross however 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.750
 arms should not be left crossed 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.879
 so if he should stay in one 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.370
 situation like that died right away with 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.920
 hands at 9 15 to put back straight 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.440
 so but stay with your hands so if 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:15.470
 should I stay so I get my hands on it 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.470
 straight of the 12 34 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:23.650
 there was the car 12 34 then at the end 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:31.830
 the important thing is to turn it and if necessary 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:35.110
 you have to turn it too fast 4 5 6 7 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.830
 so your hands never leave it crossed 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.600
 on the steering wheel you can turn the whole head 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.970
 to the left but do not leave your hands 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:48.340
 crossed on the steering wheel 123456 ok then 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.690
 This did not make me so to get their 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.690
 hands so 12 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.690
 ok
