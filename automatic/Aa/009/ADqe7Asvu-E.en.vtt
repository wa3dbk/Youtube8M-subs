00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
test I wanted to do today was to get the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.670 
test I wanted to do today was to get the
mod<00:03:08.299> waking<00:03:08.690> obviously<00:03:09.079> so<00:03:09.230> I've<00:03:09.319> got<00:03:09.440> half<00:03:09.620> a

adapt<00:06:03.240> because<00:06:03.660> basically<00:06:04.380> what<00:06:04.650> you<00:06:04.710> have<00:06:04.770> to

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
adapt because basically what you have to

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.800 
adapt because basically what you have to

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
do is you have to adapt to survive so I

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.720 
do is you have to adapt to survive so I
