 hired eggs web is worth first 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.650

 present myself in time or anything barrilaco 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.490
 what do you eat 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.100

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.900
 the kidnapping begins 30-0 against all 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.400
 yes sir yes sir 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.050
 with a little bit of concentration I'm going 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.650
 streak of 5 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.650
 we go 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.850
 I'm a specialist, let's go 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.070
 son of a bitch son of a bitch for one almost 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.420
 that it's even good for me 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.830
 killed because I wanted to explain you 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.780
 in what consists the truth is that 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.330
 there is also no need to explain much 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.030
 it's just a 30-0 against all 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.590
 I hope you do not have much this series on 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.720
 abduction of brave I think it lasted three 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.670
 episodes this I hope will last around 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.170
 but for me personally I think 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.280
 much more complicated this one than the other one 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.990
 I know how you will see it 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.550
 at the moment I 'm going to do it with widths of 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.300
 specialist what does that mean that 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.730
 how does he get me 30 but also good 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.290
 what a barrilaco does not mean that if 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.290
 I hear the specialist and think with 30 0 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.920
 also but good if I see that I'm going 23 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.920
 episodes yes 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.170
 in that martyrdom forgive forgive mother 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.690
 what luck do I have, well, yes, yes 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.550
 I see that today 223 episodes and I do not 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.170
 saco with specialist and I'll start 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.460
 try with assault dragons or is it is 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.130
 an echo with predictor charges and those things 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.240
 I bastard has given me cough and everything 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.320
 the slice he has committed 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.320
 I was there 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.730
 well I'm playing with the account 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.930
 silenced it's going very well to be wrong now 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.960
 is that it has surprised me how you see the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.340
 I have in the autumn you already know that take 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.860
 weapons in autumn pretty easy what is 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.180
 fucked is then removed in gold 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.180
 in the end to see if at least I can 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:24.359
 win this game 2 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.620
 killer hard line and scavenger and of 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:29.150
 primary express and fingering 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.150
 unsheathed and aim 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.890
 good 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.760
 as you see the yellow of the p 90 is not 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.230
 it's a big thing but 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.480
 good uncle he does is macho 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.610
 the bushes called that kid a 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.819
 good good good good that once 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.340
 I said, I'm not surprised anymore about the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.560
 corner and that's who and software me 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.290
 the measure of the ether ap 90 is quite 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.099
 bad but buffet like peta 'starbuck' 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.060
 lack that damage that charger or 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.010
 incredible mental grief 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.300
 with two accessories with point sight 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.190
 red and muffler can go pretty 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.620
 well but I take it with scope that the 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.760
 truth is that you already see with reach goes to 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.150
 be practically as an assault rifle 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.860
 It is normal 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.700
 has ambiguities in his rifle that more 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.739
 scope has to answer that rifle or 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.569
 more scope has then already with reach neither 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.890
 I'm not telling you, although I'm saying good, 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.040
 when you need me you can quite 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.040
 all right 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.170
 and a blinding plus some blinding more 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.070
 please good how difficult native 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.070
 be send male 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.709
 I carry the radar this laptop that against 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.709
 all is the key 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.040
 prettier 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.790
 if it looks like I'm going to win the game and 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.790
 I will win the game 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.550
 here 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.170
 I have three left if I'm not wrong 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.980
 1 - another minus let's see the chemistry of 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.130
 the chemistry 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.540

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.239

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.110
 won 38 is not bad 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.260
