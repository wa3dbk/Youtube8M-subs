00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.330 
and down on us so quick but there's no
not<00:01:39.640> much<00:01:39.759> thinking<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.990> we<00:01:41.170> honor<00:01:41.649> a<00:01:41.829> new

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
not much thinking just we honor a new

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.910 
not much thinking just we honor a new
frontiers<00:01:42.970> I<00:01:43.240> have<00:01:43.539> even<00:01:44.229> available<00:01:44.530> security

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
frontiers I have even available security

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
frontiers I have even available security
receiver

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.859 

yes<00:01:49.600> but<00:01:49.899> I<00:01:49.929> think<00:01:50.439> every<00:01:51.270> every<00:01:52.270> proto<00:01:52.689> race

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
yes but I think every every proto race

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.469 
yes but I think every every proto race
is<00:01:53.340> significant<00:01:54.340> enough<00:01:54.429> whatever<00:01:55.090> like<00:01:55.450> a

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
is significant enough whatever like a

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.360 
is significant enough whatever like a
tree<00:01:55.719> or<00:01:55.899> place<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.350> is

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
tree or place it is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.950 
tree or place it is
