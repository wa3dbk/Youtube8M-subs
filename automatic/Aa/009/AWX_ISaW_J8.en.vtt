00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.330
 the word shark that caused shivers well understood by many 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.250
 diamonds that few of them are without a doubt the most 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.250
 of the planet 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.890
 sharks effraim days 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.010
 when we speak in shark the first image that comes to mind 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.239
 is the spassini beast immortalized by Spielberg with his sharp teeth and a 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.739
 insatiable thirst for blood but truth contradicts fiction 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.640
 to observe the white shark 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.970
 these are baked session 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.490
 but hold we're in a safe hour of protection 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.950
 it feeds on adventures and marine mammals in which category 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.110
 we fit perfectly when we dive 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.380
 to attract the great white expeditions use excellent bait 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.380
 very sure 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.020
 there are few regions where it can usually be found with 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.190
 such as in southern california and south australia 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.510
 approached these regions in search of sea lions one of their prey 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.040
 preferred 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.490
 after eating enough I tried to be aggressive 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.490
 but who would venture out of the cage 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.870
 the great shark 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.430
 White is one of the most fascinating predators on the planet. 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.960
 its meaning is all clear well the fact the vision passing through the capacity 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.420
 small magnetic fields emitted by 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.129
 potential 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.219
 despite the reputation of being lonely 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.599
 at 15 the visit of relatives by small groups 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.790
 another hierarchical position is directly proportional to the size of the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.879
 animal
