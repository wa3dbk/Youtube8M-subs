this<00:00:02.129> tutorial<00:00:02.280> we're<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.790> have<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.000> look

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
this tutorial we're going to have a look

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.110 
this tutorial we're going to have a look
at<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.360> organ<00:00:03.780> encaustic<00:00:04.140> 3<00:00:04.730> the<00:00:05.730> organ<00:00:06.000> is

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
at the organ encaustic 3 the organ is

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.820 
at the organ encaustic 3 the organ is
meant<00:00:06.299> as<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.540> loose<00:00:06.839> emulation<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
meant as a loose emulation of the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.150 
meant as a loose emulation of the
Hammond<00:00:08.730> series<00:00:09.120> b3<00:00:09.719> drawbar<00:00:10.469> organs<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
Hammond series b3 drawbar organs of the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.970 
Hammond series b3 drawbar organs of the
past<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.509> way<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.750> works<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.320> you've<00:00:13.740> got

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
past and the way it works is you've got

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.860 
past and the way it works is you've got
a<00:00:14.009> series<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.519> draw<00:00:14.790> bars<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.299> each<00:00:15.570> one

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
a series of draw bars and each one

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
a series of draw bars and each one
corresponds<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.859> harmonic<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> note

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
corresponds to a harmonic on the note

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.939 
corresponds to a harmonic on the note
you're<00:00:18.119> playing<00:00:18.199> by<00:00:19.199> pulling<00:00:19.619> down<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
you're playing by pulling down on the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.300 
you're playing by pulling down on the
drawbar<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:21.150> give<00:00:21.390> more<00:00:21.930> power<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.560> that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
drawbar you give more power of that

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.769 
drawbar you give more power of that
harmonic<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.090> make<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.359> into<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> output

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
harmonic to make it into the output

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.050 
harmonic to make it into the output
sound<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.949> by<00:00:26.099> default<00:00:26.430> we've<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.820> got<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
sound so by default we've just got the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.060 
sound so by default we've just got the
basic<00:00:27.390> sound<00:00:27.660> coming<00:00:27.930> out<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> bass

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
basic sound coming out this is the bass

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.389 
basic sound coming out this is the bass
tone<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.359> sine<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:33.380> as<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:35.130> pull

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
tone so it's just a sine and as we pull

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.740 
tone so it's just a sine and as we pull
down<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.940> drawbars

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
down on drawbars

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
down on drawbars
we<00:00:37.200> increase<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.860> other<00:00:38.070> harmonics<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.730> how

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
we increase the other harmonics and how

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.010 
we increase the other harmonics and how
they<00:00:39.030> mix<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> final<00:00:39.930> sound

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.780 

we've<00:00:49.020> also<00:00:49.170> got<00:00:49.440> lower<00:00:49.680> harmonics<00:00:50.310> here<00:00:50.580> for

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
we've also got lower harmonics here for

00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:03.020 
we've also got lower harmonics here for
sub<00:00:50.970> bass<00:00:51.270> sounds

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.630 

so<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.150> organ<00:01:04.420> is<00:01:04.510> polyphonic<00:01:05.340> so<00:01:06.340> this<00:01:06.460> one's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
so the organ is polyphonic so this one's

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.950 
so the organ is polyphonic so this one's
not<00:01:06.730> very<00:01:06.790> complicated<00:01:07.450> but<00:01:07.600> let's<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:07.930> a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
not very complicated but let's have a

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.290 
not very complicated but let's have a
look<00:01:08.200> at<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.470> controls<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.100> get<00:01:09.250> on<00:01:09.370> it<00:01:09.520> this

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
look at the controls you get on it this

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.630 
look at the controls you get on it this
is<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.540> percussion<00:01:10.990> control<00:01:11.640> percussion

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
is the percussion control percussion

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.480 
is the percussion control percussion
gives<00:01:12.910> a<00:01:13.210> slight<00:01:13.780> boost<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.500> either<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.250> first

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
gives a slight boost in either the first

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.660 
gives a slight boost in either the first
or<00:01:15.760> second<00:01:16.300> harmonic<00:01:16.810> into<00:01:17.560> your<00:01:17.710> sound<00:01:18.010> for<00:01:18.640> a

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
or second harmonic into your sound for a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.900 
or second harmonic into your sound for a
very<00:01:18.910> short<00:01:18.940> duration<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:21.310> tone<00:01:21.610> knob

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
very short duration so this tone knob

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.090 
very short duration so this tone knob
controls<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.780> mix<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.080> balance<00:01:23.380> between<00:01:23.500> the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
controls the mix of balance between the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.470 
controls the mix of balance between the
first<00:01:24.310> harmonic<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.030> second<00:01:25.330> harmonic

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
first harmonic and the second harmonic

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.870 
first harmonic and the second harmonic
and<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:26.590> this<00:01:26.710> would<00:01:26.830> be<00:01:26.860> fully<00:01:27.370> on<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.700> first

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
and so this would be fully on the first

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.190 
and so this would be fully on the first
harmonic<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.420> this<00:01:28.510> would<00:01:28.630> be<00:01:28.750> on<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:28.960> second

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
harmonic and this would be on the second

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.270 
harmonic and this would be on the second
harmonic<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:29.620> you<00:01:29.710> can<00:01:29.830> also<00:01:29.980> set<00:01:30.250> it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
harmonic but you can also set it

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.530 
harmonic but you can also set it
somewhere<00:01:30.580> in<00:01:30.670> between<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.090> get<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.210> mix<00:01:31.420> of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
somewhere in between and get a mix of

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.990 
somewhere in between and get a mix of
the<00:01:31.630> two<00:01:31.750> harmonics<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:33.160> decay<00:01:33.460> time<00:01:33.490> is

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
the two harmonics and the decay time is

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.150 
the two harmonics and the decay time is
the<00:01:34.150> time<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.390> lasts<00:01:35.380> at<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.800> beginning<00:01:36.100> of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
the time it lasts at the beginning of

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.780 
the time it lasts at the beginning of
the<00:01:36.250> note<00:01:36.400> now<00:01:36.880> because<00:01:37.330> it's<00:01:37.979> polyphonic<00:01:38.979> the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
the note now because it's polyphonic the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.890 
the note now because it's polyphonic the
way<00:01:39.940> percussion<00:01:40.390> works<00:01:40.570> on<00:01:40.750> these

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
way percussion works on these

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.900 
way percussion works on these
instruments<00:01:41.080> is<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.770> only<00:01:41.890> applies<00:01:42.310> for<00:01:42.820> the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
instruments is it only applies for the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.580 
instruments is it only applies for the
first<00:01:43.180> note<00:01:43.450> that's<00:01:43.690> played<00:01:43.960> as<00:01:44.200> long<00:01:44.410> as

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
first note that's played as long as

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.830 
first note that's played as long as
other<00:01:44.740> notes<00:01:45.010> are<00:01:45.220> kind<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.760> tied<00:01:46.000> together<00:01:46.180> so

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
other notes are kind of tied together so

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.870 
other notes are kind of tied together so
if<00:01:47.020> you're<00:01:47.170> playing<00:01:47.380> separate<00:01:48.040> notes<00:01:48.250> the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
if you're playing separate notes the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.580 
if you're playing separate notes the
percussion<00:01:49.330> will<00:01:49.479> play<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.840> either<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.260> each

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
percussion will play on either on each

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.680 
percussion will play on either on each
note<00:01:50.890> but<00:01:51.310> if<00:01:51.430> you're<00:01:51.550> playing<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.970> series<00:01:52.660> of

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
note but if you're playing a series of

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.390 
note but if you're playing a series of
notes<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.200> they<00:01:53.290> all<00:01:53.410> follow<00:01:53.650> each<00:01:53.830> other<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
notes and they all follow each other the

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.920 
notes and they all follow each other the
percussion<00:01:54.729> will<00:01:55.030> only<00:01:55.180> apply<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.720> first

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
percussion will only apply to the first

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.450 
percussion will only apply to the first
note<00:01:56.140> this<00:01:56.320> was<00:01:56.470> just<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.710> feature<00:01:56.860> of<00:01:57.040> the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
note this was just a feature of the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.810 
note this was just a feature of the
original<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.210> it's<00:01:58.360> been<00:01:58.509> emulated<00:01:58.960> here<00:01:59.820> so

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
original and it's been emulated here so

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.980 
original and it's been emulated here so
let's<00:02:01.060> just<00:02:01.210> turn<00:02:01.300> up<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.570> time<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:01.930> the

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
let's just turn up the time on the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.260 
let's just turn up the time on the
percussion<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.590> maybe<00:02:03.430> set<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.790> tone<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.180> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
percussion and maybe set the tone to the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:14.070 
percussion and maybe set the tone to the
higher<00:02:04.450> second<00:02:05.260> harmonic<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.840> kind

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
higher second harmonic so you can kind

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.420 
higher second harmonic so you can kind
of<00:02:14.110> hear<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.560> makes<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.860> sound<00:02:15.010> like<00:02:15.190> it's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
of hear that it makes it sound like it's

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.670 
of hear that it makes it sound like it's
you<00:02:15.940> know<00:02:16.060> hitting<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.390> little<00:02:16.540> wooden<00:02:17.470> block

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
you know hitting a little wooden block

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.370 
you know hitting a little wooden block
or<00:02:17.890> something<00:02:18.040> right<00:02:18.280> at<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.459> beginning<00:02:18.550> I

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
or something right at the beginning I

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.670 
or something right at the beginning I
take<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.470> away

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
take it away

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.270 
take it away
oh<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:26.110> if<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.290> change<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.620> tone<00:02:29.100> here<00:02:30.100> it's<00:02:30.220> a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
oh and if I change the tone here it's a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.750 
oh and if I change the tone here it's a
lower<00:02:30.430> tone<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.980> yeah<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.190> only<00:02:33.310> applies<00:02:33.610> on

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
lower tone so yeah it only applies on

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:44.240 
lower tone so yeah it only applies on
the<00:02:33.820> first<00:02:34.030> note<00:02:34.209> if<00:02:34.330> you're<00:02:34.450> doing<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.690> series

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.890 

down<00:02:45.250> here<00:02:45.489> is<00:02:45.700> Leslie<00:02:46.030> control<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:46.750> was

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
down here is Leslie control so this was

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.930 
down here is Leslie control so this was
a<00:02:46.930> rotary<00:02:47.290> speaker<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.860> usually<00:02:48.190> accompany

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
a rotary speaker that usually accompany

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.420 
a rotary speaker that usually accompany
this<00:02:49.209> organ<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:49.989> it's<00:02:50.860> got<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.040> very<00:02:51.250> nice

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
this organ and it's got a very nice

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.039 
this organ and it's got a very nice
sound<00:02:51.700> it's<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.940> bit<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.209> lush<00:02:52.540> chorus

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
sound it's a bit of a lush chorus

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.080 
sound it's a bit of a lush chorus
flanger<00:02:53.380> kind<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.799> thing<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:54.940> you've

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
flanger kind of thing and so if you've

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.530 
flanger kind of thing and so if you've
got<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.510> set<00:02:55.540> up<00:02:56.670> playing<00:02:57.670> your<00:02:57.850> sound<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.390> you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
got it set up playing your sound and you

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.030 
got it set up playing your sound and you
can<00:02:58.690> adjust<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.110> speed<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.860> they<00:02:59.980> were

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
can adjust the speed of it so they were

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.670 
can adjust the speed of it so they were
rotary<00:03:00.880> horns<00:03:01.390> actually<00:03:01.780> physically<00:03:02.260> turning

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
rotary horns actually physically turning

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.670 
rotary horns actually physically turning
inside<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.070> cabinet<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.900> control<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
inside a cabinet so you can control the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.140 
inside a cabinet so you can control the
speed<00:03:05.980> at<00:03:06.070> which<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.310> horns<00:03:06.639> are<00:03:07.030> turning

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
speed at which the horns are turning

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.210 
speed at which the horns are turning
and<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.629> depth<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.200> kind<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.739> amount<00:03:10.069> of

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
and the depth is kind of the amount of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.420 
and the depth is kind of the amount of
the<00:03:10.310> effect<00:03:10.610> that<00:03:10.670> goes<00:03:10.879> into<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.209> final<00:03:11.390> mix

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
the effect that goes into the final mix

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.050 
the effect that goes into the final mix
so<00:03:13.430> let's<00:03:13.579> turn<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.909> up<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.319> play<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.349> note

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
so let's turn that up and play a note

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:33.380 
so let's turn that up and play a note
and<00:03:17.060> turn<00:03:17.329> up<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.450> speed

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.540 

so<00:03:34.390> that's<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.750> Leslie<00:03:35.080> down<00:03:36.070> here<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.460> the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
so that's the Leslie down here in the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.800 
so that's the Leslie down here in the
amp<00:03:36.670> section<00:03:36.940> you've<00:03:37.270> got<00:03:37.450> your<00:03:37.570> standard

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
amp section you've got your standard

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.210 
amp section you've got your standard
volume<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:40.390> bit<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.600> an<00:03:40.690> overdrive

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
volume and a bit of an overdrive

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.040 
volume and a bit of an overdrive
parameter<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:43.330> is<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.480> very<00:03:43.780> mild

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
parameter and this is a very mild

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.550 
parameter and this is a very mild
distortion<00:03:44.770> and<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:46.000> good<00:03:46.180> for<00:03:46.560> higher

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
distortion and it's good for higher

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.920 
distortion and it's good for higher
sounds<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:48.640> bluesy<00:03:49.420> kind<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.750> lead

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
sounds and for bluesy kind of lead

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:00.000 
sounds and for bluesy kind of lead
sounds<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.959> it's<00:03:59.080> just<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.320> slight<00:03:59.560> edge<00:03:59.740> it's

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
sounds so it's just a slight edge it's

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.370 
sounds so it's just a slight edge it's
nothing<00:04:00.310> really<00:04:00.900> exaggerated<00:04:01.900> if<00:04:02.020> you<00:04:02.140> want

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
nothing really exaggerated if you want

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.840 
nothing really exaggerated if you want
more<00:04:02.530> distortion<00:04:02.950> on<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.160> you're<00:04:03.310> free<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.700> put

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
more distortion on it you're free to put

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.100 
more distortion on it you're free to put
an<00:04:03.970> insert<00:04:04.209> on<00:04:04.330> top<00:04:04.570> but<00:04:04.780> this<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.020> just

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
an insert on top but this is just

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.390 
an insert on top but this is just
something<00:04:05.260> that's<00:04:05.500> built<00:04:05.709> into<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.100> as<00:04:06.190> part

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
something that's built into it as part

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.520 
something that's built into it as part
of<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.640> emulation<00:04:07.060> there's<00:04:07.840> also<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.170> bit<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.380> a

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
of the emulation there's also a bit of a

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.650 
of the emulation there's also a bit of a
cabinet<00:04:09.010> emulation<00:04:09.640> that's<00:04:09.820> built<00:04:10.240> into<00:04:10.420> this

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
cabinet emulation that's built into this

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.690 
cabinet emulation that's built into this
which<00:04:11.170> gives<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.560> sort<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.040> more<00:04:12.220> realistic

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
which gives it sort of a more realistic

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.990 
which gives it sort of a more realistic
feel<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.390> bit<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.260> cabinet<00:04:14.620> echo<00:04:14.950> let's<00:04:15.880> give

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
feel a bit of cabinet echo let's give

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.590 
feel a bit of cabinet echo let's give
this<00:04:16.180> this<00:04:16.870> organ<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.560> special<00:04:18.190> sound<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:22.450> like

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
this this organ a special sound so like

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.840 
this this organ a special sound so like
all<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.870> other<00:04:22.990> synths<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:24.700> set

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
all the other synths you can set

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.610 
all the other synths you can set
everything<00:04:24.940> up<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.840> can<00:04:26.020> automate<00:04:26.440> your

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
everything up you can automate your

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.110 
everything up you can automate your
knobs<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.070> can<00:04:27.220> automate<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.610> drawbars<00:04:27.970> if

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
knobs you can automate the drawbars if

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.780 
knobs you can automate the drawbars if
you<00:04:28.210> want<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:29.040> once<00:04:30.040> you've<00:04:30.190> got<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.370> preset

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
you want and once you've got a preset

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.200 
you want and once you've got a preset
you<00:04:30.910> like<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.630> can<00:04:31.840> save<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.230> out<00:04:33.060> give<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
you like you can save it out give it the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.540 
you like you can save it out give it the
name<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.480> want<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.010> hit<00:04:36.010> done<00:04:36.190> when<00:04:36.400> you're

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550
