00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
at the back team because the last one

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.930 
at the back team because the last one
actually<00:00:07.830> seemed<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.370> go<00:00:08.460> down<00:00:08.610> pretty<00:00:08.820> well

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
actually seemed to go down pretty well

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.430 
actually seemed to go down pretty well
for<00:00:09.179> some<00:00:09.360> reason<00:00:09.389> i<00:00:09.719> was<00:00:09.840> expecting<00:00:10.170> people

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
for some reason i was expecting people

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.990 
for some reason i was expecting people
to<00:00:10.620> be<00:00:10.830> angry<00:00:11.190> at<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.460> fact<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.730> i<00:00:11.849> was<00:00:11.969> using

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
to be angry at the fact that i was using

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.730 
to be angry at the fact that i was using
a<00:00:12.360> five<00:00:12.540> at<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.719> back<00:00:12.780> team<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.290> then<00:00:13.710> i

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
a five at the back team and then i

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.010 
a five at the back team and then i
remembered<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.519> isn't<00:00:14.820> fifa<00:00:15.179> 13<00:00:15.210> anymore

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
remembered that it isn't fifa 13 anymore

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.260 
remembered that it isn't fifa 13 anymore
and<00:00:16.230> that's<00:00:16.410> not<00:00:16.590> really<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:17.070> crime<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.850> guess

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
and that's not really a crime I guess

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.450 
and that's not really a crime I guess
the<00:00:18.449> game<00:00:18.720> itself<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.010> where<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the game itself is kind of one where a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.609 
the game itself is kind of one where a
lot<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.240> styles<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.720> people<00:00:22.080> use<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.529> be

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
lot of the styles that people use can be

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.960 
lot of the styles that people use can be
incredibly<00:00:22.859> frustrating<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.699> come<00:00:23.850> up

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
incredibly frustrating to come up

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580 
incredibly frustrating to come up
against<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.359> having<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> weapon<00:00:25.019> against<00:00:25.439> that

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
against so having a weapon against that

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.529 
against so having a weapon against that
can<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.279> pretty<00:00:26.519> effective<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.330> without

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
can be pretty effective but without

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.439 
can be pretty effective but without
further<00:00:27.900> ado<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.400> how<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.849> team<00:00:30.150> looks

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
further ado this is how this team looks

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.330 
further ado this is how this team looks
as<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.109> see<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.410> two<00:00:31.679> informs<00:00:32.160> in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
as you can see it has two informs in

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.729 
as you can see it has two informs in
there<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.730> Diego<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.600> Schneider<00:00:34.200> upstairs

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
there in Diego and Schneider upstairs

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.850 
there in Diego and Schneider upstairs
manager<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.870> defense<00:00:37.170> itself<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.710> pretty

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
manager and the defense itself is pretty

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.860 
manager and the defense itself is pretty
solid<00:00:38.129> we've<00:00:38.399> got<00:00:38.550> Gabrielle<00:00:39.030> at<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> center

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
solid we've got Gabrielle at the center

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.540 
solid we've got Gabrielle at the center
of<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.170> who<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.440> packed<00:00:40.800> he's<00:00:41.070> got<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> high

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
of it who I packed he's got a high

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
of it who I packed he's got a high
attacking<00:00:42.149> work<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.050> find<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> be

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
attacking work right which I find to be

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.680 
attacking work right which I find to be
quite<00:00:43.739> useful<00:00:43.950> when<00:00:44.640> he's<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
quite useful when he's the one in the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.119 
quite useful when he's the one in the
middle<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> back<00:00:46.230> tree<00:00:46.500> I've<00:00:46.649> always<00:00:46.860> found

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
middle of a back tree I've always found

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.069 
middle of a back tree I've always found
that<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> tree<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> back

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that if you have a tree at the back

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.479 
that if you have a tree at the back
formation<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.800> say<00:00:50.010> you're<00:00:50.160> playing<00:00:50.340> true

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
formation like say you're playing true

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.430 
formation like say you're playing true
52<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.120> basically<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.989> you've<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.260> true

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
52 like basically if you've got true

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.600 
52 like basically if you've got true
center<00:00:52.739> backs<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> team<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.550> I'm

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
center backs and the team is what I'm

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
center backs and the team is what I'm
trying<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.850> say<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.350> middle<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.710> has

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
trying to say and if the middle one has

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.470 
trying to say and if the middle one has
a<00:00:55.890> high<00:00:56.070> attack<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> work<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.180> can

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
a high attack and work right you can

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
a high attack and work right you can
come<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.410> lot<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> counter-attacks<00:00:59.309> pretty

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
come a lot of counter-attacks pretty

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
have a whole lot of pace which is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.580 
have a whole lot of pace which is
surprising<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.510> quite<00:01:09.780> wrong<00:01:10.020> i<00:01:10.229> actually

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
surprising and quite wrong i actually

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
surprising and quite wrong i actually
feel<00:01:10.740> 81<00:01:11.189> pace<00:01:11.400> feels<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> joke

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.780 
feel 81 pace feels like a bit of a joke
for<00:01:12.450> him<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.799> top<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> i<00:01:14.310> really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
for him and on top of that i really

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.280 
for him and on top of that i really
think<00:01:14.970> he<00:01:15.150> should<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.420> five<00:01:15.720> stars<00:01:16.049> are

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290

think he should have five stars are

Emenike movement really doesn't matter

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.150 
Emenike movement really doesn't matter
cuz<00:06:23.690> schneider<00:06:24.020> did<00:06:24.350> and<00:06:24.560> that's<00:06:24.710> tree<00:06:24.980> nil

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160

and<00:06:25.310> that's<00:06:25.490> a<00:06:25.580> fucking<00:06:26.150> incredible<00:06:26.419> goal

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
and that's a fucking incredible goal

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.200 
and that's a fucking incredible goal
just<00:06:27.530> in<00:06:27.740> terms<00:06:27.860> of<00:06:28.040> how<00:06:28.190> simple<00:06:28.700> that<00:06:28.820> elbow

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
just in terms of how simple that elbow

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.820 
just in terms of how simple that elbow
and<00:06:29.270> given<00:06:29.570> goal<00:06:29.720> passing<00:06:30.169> was<00:06:30.320> to<00:06:30.470> get<00:06:30.590> into

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.290 
the last minute of the game I think my

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.659 
the last minute of the game I think my
opponent<00:07:09.770> though<00:07:09.860> I<00:07:09.889> think<00:07:10.070> he's<00:07:10.340> kind<00:07:10.550> of

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
opponent though I think he's kind of

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.640 
opponent though I think he's kind of
given<00:07:10.940> up<00:07:11.030> like<00:07:11.330> that<00:07:11.840> was<00:07:12.020> not<00:07:12.200> really<00:07:12.500> good

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
given up like that was not really good

given up like that was not really good
defender<00:07:13.070> from<00:07:13.190> him<00:07:13.340> I<00:07:13.400> think<00:07:13.460> he<00:07:13.639> was<00:07:13.760> if

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
defender from him I think he was if

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.930 
defender from him I think he was if
anything<00:07:14.479> probably<00:07:14.900> trying<00:07:15.110> to<00:07:15.169> slide<00:07:15.500> in<00:07:15.740> and

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
anything probably trying to slide in and

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.000 
anything probably trying to slide in and
crippled<00:07:16.940> my<00:07:17.090> player<00:07:17.330> because<00:07:17.930> he's<00:07:18.169> not

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.010 
crippled my player because he's not

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.740 
crippled my player because he's not

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:40.729 
notice that like he didn't really have a

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:41.950 
notice that like he didn't really have a
whole<00:07:40.880> lot<00:07:40.910> of<00:07:41.120> pace<00:07:41.300> in<00:07:41.539> there<00:07:41.720> or<00:07:41.810> whatever
