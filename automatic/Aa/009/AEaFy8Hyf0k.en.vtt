00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 I was unpacking it all now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.340
 the denomination is gtm 7000 and now 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.890
 I have to look we have to do this up here 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.009
 open the whole and I will now 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:34.330
 do it and I hope I succeed 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:37.810
 on and it sparked 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.740
 that was the pack and then I think so 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.250
 that time so down and jewelry there 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.530
 it is already the galaxy note 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.780
 a very nice big device but 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.660
 Magically big smartphones and me in the evening 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.160
 take it as a smartphone that has to 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.530
 everyone know for themselves yes it is 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.690
 quite big 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.310
 if you have it live, then 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.160
 treasures presented with great little 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:17.020
 It's just a nice device from the first one 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.370
 impression processing behind and it is 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.060
 also very easy to jack 35 millimeters 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.430
 for that had to be led and took with the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.740
 micro usb and stylist of youth 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 whether it's gorilla clear her 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.100
 I suppose that's gorilla glass is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.670
 yes, what else do we have in the box ? 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:48.760
 just a little bit of reading manuals and 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.709
 micro usb cable we have here and the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.550
 great patria this size and the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.620
 does not go into galaxy s2 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.320
 So that is already a larger battery of 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.660
 really does not have 2500 milliamps 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.070
 only 2100 as first thought but 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:10.300
 really 2 500 milliamps that's enough 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:16.030
 power ranking power adapter for and 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:21.930
 micro-usb here the normal headset 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:26.760
 3 5 mm jack and still accepted 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:33.670
 yes that was already the content 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:37.450
 earth-shattering and at the same time I have 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.480
 here the apple ipad 2 in front of me now 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.510
 lie 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:49.260
 you can see this again 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:52.500
 bigger for ipad 2 itself so slim 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.140
 it is definitely under ten 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.329
 millimeters in any case 968 were there 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.650
 I believe the data as I said 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.530
 yes also the official page 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.799
 as I said a nice device from the first 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.480
 impression as I think 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.319
 and the rest i will see then if 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.450
 I guess testing it all the time 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.670
 more information will also be with me 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.769
 find in the channel about this soon 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.400
 I thank you again feet 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.570

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.570
 so far so good
