00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
light it weighs about 130 grams so it's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.630

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.580 
pretty light it's very small as well
it's<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.480> other<00:00:42.690> lenses<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.320> get

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590

it's very very small mount plastic mount
just<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.789> kit<00:00:51.030> lens<00:00:51.270> 8<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:51.870> 55<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
just like your kit lens 8 into 55 it's a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.200 
just like your kit lens 8 into 55 it's a
plastic<00:00:53.610> mount<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.180> well<00:00:55.730> they<00:00:56.730> also<00:00:56.940> have

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
plastic mount as well they also have

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.840 
plastic mount as well they also have
your<00:00:57.360> auto<00:00:57.539> focus<00:00:57.629> mental<00:00:58.320> focus

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
your auto focus mental focus

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.830 
your auto focus mental focus
there's<00:00:59.850> no<00:01:00.090> eye<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.370> plus<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.840> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
there's no eye as to this plus for this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.230 
there's no eye as to this plus for this
is<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.170> 50<00:01:04.589> millimeter<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
is a 50 millimeter so if you have a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.890 
is a 50 millimeter so if you have a
aps-c<00:01:06.990> size<00:01:07.530> sensor<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.820> now<00:01:09.030> it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
aps-c size sensor like I have now it's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.090 
aps-c size sensor like I have now it's
about<00:01:10.110> 80<00:01:10.500> moving<00:01:12.500> if<00:01:13.500> manual<00:01:14.220> focus<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:16.100> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
about 80 moving if manual focus so you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100 
about 80 moving if manual focus so you
can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:18.090> focusing<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
can see when you are focusing at the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.980 
can see when you are focusing at the
extent<00:01:19.759> but<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.850> doesn't<00:01:21.180> rotate<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.810> with

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
extent but it doesn't rotate so with

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.770 
extent but it doesn't rotate so with
using<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.530> filter<00:01:22.920> polarizing<00:01:23.729> filter<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.390> as

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
using a filter polarizing filter it as

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.039 
using a filter polarizing filter it as
an<00:01:24.930> effect<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.159> result<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:27.630> doesn't<00:01:27.930> rotate

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
an effect the result it doesn't rotate

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.679 
an effect the result it doesn't rotate
it<00:01:28.439> only<00:01:28.619> extends<00:01:29.189> itself<00:01:29.640> won't<00:01:30.119> rotate<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it only extends itself won't rotate so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
it only extends itself won't rotate so
it's<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> good<00:01:30.990> thing<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:34.040> well<00:01:35.060> yeah

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it's a good thing and well yeah

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.719 
it's a good thing and well yeah
basically<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> usm<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> makes

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
basically this is not a usm so makes

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.870 
basically this is not a usm so makes
quite<00:01:42.329> loud<00:01:43.259> noise<00:01:43.710> when<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> focus

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
quite loud noise when you go to focus

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.920 
quite loud noise when you go to focus
and<00:01:45.470> then<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.310> switch<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.299> manner<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.780> order

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and then the switch the manner in order

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.730 
and then the switch the manner in order
focus<00:01:49.290> switch<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:50.130> pretty<00:01:50.399> annoying

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
focus switch it's pretty annoying

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.010 
focus switch it's pretty annoying
take<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.860> zoom<00:01:53.189> in

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
take it zoom in

but overall it's a very good lens it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
but overall it's a very good lens it's
very<00:02:09.929> sharp<00:02:10.349> very<00:02:10.730> sharp<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:15.769> um<00:02:16.769> yeah<00:02:17.700> it's

very cool in spin it sorry um it's a 1.8

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.199 
very cool in spin it sorry um it's a 1.8
so<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.290> can<00:02:25.470> capture<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:26.069> low-light<00:02:26.489> situation

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
so we can capture in low-light situation

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.890 
so we can capture in low-light situation
very<00:02:27.630> good<00:02:27.930> lens<00:02:28.140> I've<00:02:28.349> tried<00:02:28.650> it

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
very good lens I've tried it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.199 
very good lens I've tried it
the<00:02:30.900> diameter<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.799> 52<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.670> if<00:02:32.849> you're<00:02:33.030> using

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
the diameter is 52 so if you're using

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.440 
the diameter is 52 so if you're using
any<00:02:33.560> filters<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.280> right<00:02:35.459> here<00:02:35.489> we're

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
any filters like I have right here we're

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.420 
any filters like I have right here we're
gonna<00:02:36.569> find<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.989> 52<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.010> diameter

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
gonna find a 52 in diameter

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.600 
gonna find a 52 in diameter
unlike<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.730> kit<00:02:42.420> lenses<00:02:42.870> 58<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:43.829> 52<00:02:46.610> well

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
unlike the kit lenses 58 this is 52 well

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.580 
unlike the kit lenses 58 this is 52 well
I'm<00:02:47.760> gonna<00:02:47.880> compare<00:02:48.420> how<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.900> sounds<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
I'm gonna compare how it sounds the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.280 
I'm gonna compare how it sounds the
autofocus<00:02:49.950> sounds<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:51.049> they're<00:02:52.049> gonna<00:02:52.170> be

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290
