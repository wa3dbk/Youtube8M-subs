hey<00:00:02.070> everybody<00:00:02.750> so<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:03.780> thought<00:00:04.049> I'd<00:00:04.140> just<00:00:04.259> go

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
hey everybody so I thought I'd just go

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.810 
hey everybody so I thought I'd just go
over<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:05.359> components<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:07.080> my<00:00:07.460> flower<00:00:08.460> pot

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
over the components to my flower pot

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.339 
over the components to my flower pot
smoker<00:00:09.590> first<00:00:10.590> we'll<00:00:10.769> start<00:00:10.860> off<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:12.349> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
smoker first we'll start off with the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.290 
smoker first we'll start off with the
burner<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:14.070> took<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.490> out<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:16.310> hot<00:00:17.310> plate<00:00:17.640> just

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
burner I took it out of a hot plate just

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.170 
burner I took it out of a hot plate just
took<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.630> backing<00:00:19.230> plate<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.850> there's<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
took the backing plate here there's the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.689 
took the backing plate here there's the
element<00:00:21.720> obviously<00:00:22.550> and<00:00:23.550> then<00:00:23.760> bought<00:00:23.939> from

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
element obviously and then bought from

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
element obviously and then bought from
ceramic<00:00:28.429> insulators<00:00:30.019> some<00:00:31.019> kind<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
ceramic insulators some kind of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.729 
ceramic insulators some kind of
electrical<00:00:31.830> insulators<00:00:32.369> off<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.669> ebay<00:00:33.739> holes

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
electrical insulators off of ebay holes

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.580 
electrical insulators off of ebay holes
are<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.010> satin<00:00:35.460> right<00:00:35.579> box<00:00:36.290> which<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.559> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
are like satin right box which kind of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.490 
are like satin right box which kind of
goes<00:00:37.770> against<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> whole<00:00:38.399> budget<00:00:38.640> nature<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
goes against the whole budget nature of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.569 
goes against the whole budget nature of
this<00:00:40.890> project<00:00:41.719> anyway<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.219> salvaged<00:00:44.219> be

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
this project anyway so I salvaged be

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
this project anyway so I salvaged be
insulated<00:00:47.579> high<00:00:47.910> temp<00:00:48.239> wires<00:00:48.690> from<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:51.500> from

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
insulated high temp wires from the from

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.290 
insulated high temp wires from the from
the<00:00:52.620> flower<00:00:52.860> pot<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.460> I've<00:00:53.520> hooked<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:54.000> some

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the flower pot and I've hooked up some

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.130 
the flower pot and I've hooked up some
mom<00:00:55.879> insulated<00:00:56.879> blade<00:00:57.180> connectors<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.899> can

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.860 

undestroyed<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.480> plug<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.809> you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
undestroyed into the a plug in here you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.000 
undestroyed into the a plug in here you
can<00:01:03.989> probably<00:01:04.140> put<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.680> into<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
can probably put this right into the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
can probably put this right into the
wall<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> wouldn't<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.290> that

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
wall but I wouldn't do that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
wall but I wouldn't do that
so<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.180> plugs<00:01:09.390> into<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:11.540> PID<00:01:12.540> controller<00:01:13.229> so

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so this plugs into the PID controller so

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.120 
so this plugs into the PID controller so
it<00:01:13.860> would<00:01:13.979> go<00:01:14.990> right<00:01:15.990> into<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> PID

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it would go right into that and the PID

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.240 
it would go right into that and the PID
controller<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.700> PID<00:01:17.909> controller<00:01:18.450> goes<00:01:18.659> into

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
controller and PID controller goes into

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.289 
controller and PID controller goes into
your<00:01:20.250> outlet<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.280> there's<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.759> face<00:01:24.030> of

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
your outlet and so there's the face of

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.560 
your outlet and so there's the face of
it<00:01:24.890> I've<00:01:25.890> got<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> prior<00:01:26.369> video<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.150> I'm

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it I've got a prior video on this I'm

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.399 
it I've got a prior video on this I'm
testing<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> um<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:30.600> works<00:01:30.810> pretty<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.290> as

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
testing it um it works pretty good as

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.469 
testing it um it works pretty good as
the<00:01:31.590> brains<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> brains<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the brains and the brains of the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.039 
the brains and the brains of the
operation

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
operation

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.830 
operation
a<00:01:34.979> little<00:01:35.670> heat<00:01:35.790> sink<00:01:36.030> back<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.570> pretty

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
a little heat sink back there is pretty

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.870 
a little heat sink back there is pretty
cool<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.380> built<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.549> built<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.549> hard

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
cool I built it I built this the hard

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.999 
cool I built it I built this the hard
box<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.399> pretty<00:01:44.640> fun<00:01:44.939> pretty<00:01:45.149> fun<00:01:45.600> process

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
box it was pretty fun pretty fun process

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
box it was pretty fun pretty fun process
and<00:01:47.009> here's<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:49.729> thermocouple<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> right

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
and here's the thermocouple so right

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.840 
and here's the thermocouple so right
there<00:01:53.210> it's<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.390> some<00:01:54.570> smoke<00:01:54.869> deuce<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.380> it

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
there it's got some smoke deuce on it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.929 
there it's got some smoke deuce on it
it's<00:01:56.850> pretty<00:01:57.149> cool<00:01:57.740> reads<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.610> reads<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> little

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it's pretty cool reads it reads a little

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.469 
it's pretty cool reads it reads a little
bit<00:02:00.180> slower<00:02:00.509> than<00:02:01.939> then<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> cooking

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
bit slower than then like a cooking

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.080 
bit slower than then like a cooking
thermometer<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.729> which<00:02:05.729> i<00:02:05.820> think<00:02:05.880> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
thermometer but which i think is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.789 
thermometer but which i think is
actually<00:02:06.210> good<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.840> doesn't<00:02:07.079> go<00:02:07.170> haywire

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
actually good so it doesn't go haywire

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.630 
actually good so it doesn't go haywire
when

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
when

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.600 
when
when<00:02:09.539> things<00:02:09.780> change<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.530> little<00:02:10.680> bit<00:02:10.920> better

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
when things change a little bit better

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.390 
when things change a little bit better
for<00:02:11.880> consistency<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.600> think<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:14.010> anyway

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
for consistency I think so anyway

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.000 
for consistency I think so anyway
there's<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:16.670> here's<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.880> pot<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.360> god<00:02:19.010> this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
there's that here's the pot of god this

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.530 
there's that here's the pot of god this
is<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.910> handle<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:23.370> cabinet<00:02:23.850> handle

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
is a the handle is just a cabinet handle

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.520 
is a the handle is just a cabinet handle
that<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> drill<00:02:25.320> holes<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.770> there<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.160> then

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
that I drill holes in there and then

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.910 
that I drill holes in there and then
bolts<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.860> nuts<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.640> bolt<00:02:29.820> there's<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
bolts on nuts and bolt there's the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.010 
bolts on nuts and bolt there's the
there's<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.070> rubber<00:02:33.350> washer<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:36.660> been

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
there's a rubber washer and it's been

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.540 
there's a rubber washer and it's been
good<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.470> far<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.800> hasn't<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.250> know<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.459> not

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
good so far it hasn't you know it's not

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.630 
good so far it hasn't you know it's not
hot<00:02:38.790> enough<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.120> burn<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:40.830> burn<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.190> rubber<00:02:41.400> up

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
hot enough to burn to burn the rubber up

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.140 
hot enough to burn to burn the rubber up
so<00:02:42.030> I'm<00:02:42.090> happy<00:02:42.750> with<00:02:42.870> that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
so I'm happy with that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.830 
so I'm happy with that
okay<00:02:45.150> oh<00:02:46.970> there's<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> inside<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.570> smoker

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
okay oh there's the inside and smoker

that<00:02:57.030> sits<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.739> on<00:02:58.739> top<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.280> burner<00:03:01.040> what<00:03:02.040> I

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
that sits on on top of the burner what I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.870 
that sits on on top of the burner what I
found<00:03:02.370> was<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:08.040> get<00:03:08.220> up<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> temperature

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
found was the to get up the temperature

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.670 
found was the to get up the temperature
that<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.450> PID<00:03:09.870> controller<00:03:10.230> will<00:03:10.380> just<00:03:10.560> go

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
that the PID controller will just go

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.490 
that the PID controller will just go
full-bore<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.520> on<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.780> burner<00:03:12.989> until<00:03:13.410> it

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
full-bore on the on the burner until it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.990 
full-bore on the on the burner until it
gets<00:03:13.620> up<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.799> temperature<00:03:14.070> about<00:03:14.489> like<00:03:14.760> 10

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
gets up to temperature about like 10

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.660 
gets up to temperature about like 10
degrees<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.690> want<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> get<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.670> like

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
degrees so if you want to get it to like

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.520 
degrees so if you want to get it to like
200<00:03:18.090> degrees<00:03:18.330> with<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.720> full<00:03:18.989> bore<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.380> won't

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
200 degrees with a full bore I won't

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.160 
200 degrees with a full bore I won't
even<00:03:19.680> feather<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:21.330> power<00:03:21.570> go<00:03:21.870> into<00:03:22.080> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
even feather the the power go into the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.400 
even feather the the power go into the
burner<00:03:22.380> until<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.310> hits<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:23.640> 190<00:03:24.299> or<00:03:25.110> so

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
burner until it hits like 190 or so

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.830 
burner until it hits like 190 or so
about<00:03:25.860> 10<00:03:26.070> degrees<00:03:26.370> lower<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.940> then<00:03:27.720> it'll

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
about 10 degrees lower and then it'll

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.539 
about 10 degrees lower and then it'll
start<00:03:28.200> turning<00:03:28.500> off<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:28.920> until<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.400> gets

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
start turning off and on until it gets

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.330 
start turning off and on until it gets
to<00:03:29.700> about<00:03:30.690> 200<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.260> what<00:03:31.410> happens<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:34.340> even

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
to about 200 so what happens is even

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.550 
to about 200 so what happens is even
though<00:03:35.430> even<00:03:35.580> if<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.850> soak<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.360> wood<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.320> catch

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
though even if I soak the wood and catch

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.840 
though even if I soak the wood and catch
it<00:03:37.739> fire<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.700> what<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.910> do<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.459> cover

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
it fire so what I do is I just cover

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.729 
it fire so what I do is I just cover
this<00:03:42.000> with<00:03:42.650> aluminum<00:03:43.650> foil<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.130> then<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.880> leave

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
this with aluminum foil and then I leave

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.600 
this with aluminum foil and then I leave
at<00:03:46.739> opposite<00:03:47.190> ends<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.670> leave<00:03:48.620> an<00:03:49.620> open<00:03:50.010> spot<00:03:50.280> in

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
at opposite ends I leave an open spot in

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.570 
at opposite ends I leave an open spot in
the<00:03:50.850> foil<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.480> still<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:53.130> doesn't<00:03:53.370> catch

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
the foil and it still it doesn't catch

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.130 
the foil and it still it doesn't catch
fire<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.880> still<00:03:54.239> get<00:03:54.360> plenty<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.690> smoke<00:03:54.900> that
