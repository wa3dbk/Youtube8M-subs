00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 a true back in time so it was 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.740
 Sunday at the pinheirinho kart track 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.469
 in araraquara the club of vehicles 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.679
 the untouchables promoted the second 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.320
 stage of the challenge of scooters and the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.080
 was invaded by lambret wasps in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 a beautiful race like it was around 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 40 years old 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 the last race that I was clear there was 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.500
 40 years ago as for campinas in a 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.439
 Scooter race, I decided to do it there. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 here in our city and with the scooters 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.680
 from outside too 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.050
 the event also served to honor 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.870
 old city runners who during the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.510
 years participated in street competitions 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.690
 in the abode of the sun is the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.500
 most of the old corridors 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.960
 guardian of the youth together that this 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.020
 makes it grow even more 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.530
 but I was very happy to see everything 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.180
 I figured this would not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.970
 there was more 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 Is there any other moped walking around? 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 by the street but no, but the business here is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.780
 You're taking it seriously and I'm very 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.430
 Happy birthday and congratulations 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.009
 It's very exciting and I 'm feeling 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.650
 How well can you do that, my father? 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.150
 he is no longer here now so no 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.860
 I'm sure he's seeing a lot 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 happy to see this mound of scooter 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.689
 wasp riding the engines two times there 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.939
 He is very happy indeed. 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.400
 city drivers joined other 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.070

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 flushing 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.710
 and wells, for example 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.500
 have brought a good audience to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.590
 the crowded kart track and a 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.740

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.530
