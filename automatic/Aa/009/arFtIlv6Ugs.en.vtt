 it's for peace in the 90's Brazilians were real runners 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.380
 and in the expansion added with the noise of the engines we will start with force in this 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.439
 league of sao paulo 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.230
 according to him for the cars 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.230
 so does the hands 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.769
 developed by the service 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.769

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.919
 in the virtual environment 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.919
 last week 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.320
 This is because motorcycles simply 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.660
 three times more because cars because most civilian deaths 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.310
 today are paul even allies who are manufactured to work with 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.680
 carb and can not be ignored Sergio says 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.210
 I think the girl singer madonna the 2 suffered in são paulo the magazine exam of 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 order the number of deaths per day 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 with the approval by the numbers of this measurement of polluting gases 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.859
 while a car with electronic injection and catalyst emission 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.680
 carbon monoxide does not reach 20% as the mobile communication bike 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.320
 participated and a half over 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.440
 only in são paulo almost nine hundred thousand motorcycles in the rains 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.700
 ten years ago did not reach the truth so there was not so much concern about 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.770
 they 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.030
 there were with the charges in the case of motorcycle accompanied the number is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.910
 if you are going to be sidetracked by dissent 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.180
 it is clear that I cadres involve another type of bike that does not close the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.760
 account of pollution apotheosis fuel 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.240
 more and more this type of questioning will be accepted by the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.220
 consumer 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.230
 and the automotive industry is already worried about presenting solutions 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.630
 to reach the market for example the first electric sculpture made 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.390
 in Brazil it's like an ordinary bike but one thing does not make noise benite com 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.120
 patients 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.350
 today it leaves for 5 thousand seven hundred reais 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.120
 four batteries provide enough power to run 50 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.439
 miles and can be charged in any outlet. 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.470
 but each recharge 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.290
 it takes six hours 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.610
 in compensation 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.490
 the cost of this fuel 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.410
 it's tempting 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.139
 when you put the numbers that with the real leads and holy the being 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.499
 carries the considered battery 50 kilometers one way 2 60 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:21.230
 in the kilometer rotated and all the arguments of environment that it 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.719
 justifies what has led her to meet the need for air
