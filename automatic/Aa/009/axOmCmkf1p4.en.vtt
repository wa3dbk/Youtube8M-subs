that's not necessarily a flaw with
Herschel<00:01:37.320> supply<00:01:37.590> company<00:01:37.890> I've<00:01:38.009> had<00:01:38.159> this

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
Herschel supply company I've had this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.950 
Herschel supply company I've had this
backpack<00:01:38.729> over<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.390> year<00:01:39.720> now

backpack over a year now

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960 
backpack over a year now
I<00:01:40.140> don't<00:01:40.860> feel<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.310> flaw<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.549> them

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
I don't feel like it's a flaw with them

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
I don't feel like it's a flaw with them
and<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.020> only<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.229> certain<00:01:43.530> spots

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and because it's only in certain spots

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.639 
and because it's only in certain spots
and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.310> feel<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.970> an<00:01:45.299> issue<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:46.140> where

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and I feel like it's an issue of where

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.399 
and I feel like it's an issue of where
I've<00:01:46.829> been<00:01:47.009> setting<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:49.140> been

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
I've been setting this down at it's been

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
I've been setting this down at it's been
on<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.829> pretty<00:01:49.979> rough<00:01:50.220> surfaces<00:01:50.790> at<00:01:50.970> times

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
on some pretty rough surfaces at times

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.690 
on some pretty rough surfaces at times
so<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.350> necessarily<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.100> flaw<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
