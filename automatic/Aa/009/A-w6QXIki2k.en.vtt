00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
that you'll have access to the yarn

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.330 
that you'll have access to the yarn
after<00:02:17.250> you've<00:02:17.730> rolled<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.209> center<00:02:18.599> pole<00:02:18.810> ball

after you've rolled the center pole ball

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.809 
after you've rolled the center pole ball
next<00:02:20.340> step<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:21.590> holding<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.980> narrow<00:02:23.310> end<00:02:23.640> of

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
next step is holding the narrow end of

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.600 
next step is holding the narrow end of
the<00:02:23.910> tricky<00:02:24.300> baster<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.160> taking<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> yarn

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
the tricky baster and taking the yarn

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.430 
the tricky baster and taking the yarn
from<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.690> wide<00:02:27.870> end<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:29.400> want<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:30.200> wind<00:02:31.200> it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
from the wide end you want to wind it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.530 
from the wide end you want to wind it
around<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.840> center<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.370> turkey<00:02:36.300> baster

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.550 

and<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.590> start<00:02:40.890> gets<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.280> little<00:02:42.170> hard<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.410> do

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
and the start gets a little hard to do

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.140 
and the start gets a little hard to do
because<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.069> yarn<00:02:44.220> wants<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.640> slide<00:02:44.910> all<00:02:45.120> over

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
because the yarn wants to slide all over

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.660 
because the yarn wants to slide all over
the<00:02:45.420> place

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
the place

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.610 
the place
just<00:02:47.670> take<00:02:47.940> them<00:02:48.120> yarn<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:49.220> wind<00:02:50.220> it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
just take them yarn and wind it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.370 
just take them yarn and wind it
completely<00:02:52.620> flat<00:02:52.819> push<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.030> yarn<00:02:54.900> together

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.430 

just<00:02:58.380> keep<00:02:58.620> winding<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.400> little<00:02:59.640> bit<00:02:59.819> here

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
just keep winding for a little bit here

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.550 
just keep winding for a little bit here
this<00:03:01.440> creates<00:03:01.950> your<00:03:02.130> inner<00:03:02.459> tube<00:03:03.260> inside<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
this creates your inner tube inside the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.410 
this creates your inner tube inside the
center<00:03:05.160> profile<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:06.739> stabilizing<00:03:08.030> core<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.209> you

center profile a stabilizing core if you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.250 
center profile a stabilizing core if you
