00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
started choreographing this show I

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.089 
started choreographing this show I
approached<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.930> music<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.410> differently<00:02:21.830> than

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.119 
I had anything else I listen to the
music<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.489> literally<00:02:26.480> at<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.989> moment<00:02:27.379> as<00:02:27.500> I

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
music and literally at the moment as I

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.610 
music and literally at the moment as I
would<00:02:28.670> start<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.120> move<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.810> started<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
would start to move I started to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.100 
would start to move I started to
actually<00:02:30.830> process<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.180> choreography<00:02:32.870> I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
actually process the choreography I

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.710 
actually process the choreography I
wanted<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.280> be<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.030> moment<00:02:35.209> almost

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
wanted it to be in the moment almost

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.920 
wanted it to be in the moment almost
like<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.739> was<00:02:37.040> all<00:02:37.310> being<00:02:37.760> improvised<00:02:38.480> and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
like it was all being improvised and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.309 
like it was all being improvised and
then<00:02:39.260> captured<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.810> very<00:02:42.079> difficult

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
then captured it's a very difficult

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.009 
then captured it's a very difficult
process<00:02:42.980> because<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.579> have<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:44.000> be<00:02:44.150> so

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
process because you have to be so

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.680 
process because you have to be so
present<00:02:45.890> with<00:02:46.400> each<00:02:46.610> note<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.180> then<00:02:47.420> be<00:02:47.569> able

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
present with each note and then be able

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.910 
present with each note and then be able
to<00:02:49.209> forget<00:02:50.209> what<00:02:50.510> you've<00:02:50.660> just<00:02:50.690> done<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.590> move

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
to forget what you've just done and move

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.350
