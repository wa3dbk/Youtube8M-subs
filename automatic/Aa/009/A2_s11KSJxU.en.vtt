which means if you're in New York that's

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.240 
which means if you're in New York that's
9<00:01:54.720> o'clock<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.320> night<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.159> Hawaii

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.840 
Pacific time I think I could be I could
be<00:02:03.780> wrong<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:04.320> don't<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.860> everything<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.520> don't

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
