they living improved just because I had
the<00:02:03.060> ability<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.320> go<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.860> my<00:02:04.950> own

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the ability to get up and go on my own

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.370 
the ability to get up and go on my own
in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> pen

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
in the pen

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.010 
in the pen
and<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.310> had<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.670> idea<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.509> know<00:02:08.660> that

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
and so I had the idea that you know that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.770 
and so I had the idea that you know that
nobody<00:02:09.470> else<00:02:09.709> was<00:02:10.000> manufacturing<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.510> so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
nobody else was manufacturing it and so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.860 
nobody else was manufacturing it and so
I<00:02:11.810> thought<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.230> could<00:02:12.380> do<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:13.790> share<00:02:14.360> this

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
I thought I could do that and share this

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.229 
I thought I could do that and share this
with<00:02:15.260> other<00:02:15.560> people<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:16.069> wheelchairs<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.790> went

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
with other people in wheelchairs I went

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.650 
with other people in wheelchairs I went
ahead<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.750> applied<00:02:18.020> for<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:19.010> state<00:02:19.280> grant<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
ahead and applied for a state grant the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.470 
ahead and applied for a state grant the
Department<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.410> vocational<00:02:22.480> rehabilitation

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
Department of vocational rehabilitation

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.699

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
and so governor Lingle and Joe Cordova

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.479 
and so governor Lingle and Joe Cordova
they<00:02:28.280> aided<00:02:29.000> me<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.500> acquiring<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.800> grant<00:02:31.220> which
