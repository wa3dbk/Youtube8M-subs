00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.990
 most smarty dirty are actual you must be smart and some are even 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.549
 downright stupid 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.379
 there are implementation that can also make you work make a single smart tv bite 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.490
 basically the ease we know of our tablets and phones 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.670
 the service what eltjo late for each other with the with your wiimote that it still 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.560
 most resembles an animal in need 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.899
 but the menus and interface could actually have been a bit smarter 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.509
 on this they introduce the series in las vegas a new and strong one 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:31.880
 simplified interface 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.880
 based on the poiesz 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.620
 the porsche was originally a mobile operating system developed by palm 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.480
 based on links 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.610
 it did not go so well anymore with how we do not have a diva for a while 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.050
 More designer traps sold 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.900
 last year and that he was taken over for that 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.190
 this year as many as three hours out of 70 percent of all smarter visions will be corus 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.870
 to learn 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.570
 only that the entry level a smart division will be delivered without weapons 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.610
 and that must do it with the old interface 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.440
 the most important reason for the whole of 2011 being an athlete who can be turned over 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.390
 the fact that many people do not have the smart wi fi features of a television 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.610
 use it once 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.900
 some people have not even kept television on the internet 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.359
 that has to do with the fact that many people find the installation difficult 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.359
 and the use of them sometimes just a little too difficult 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.760
 all matters that you hold up can be viewed considerably 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.050
 are presented as maps on the Norwegian language bar 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.660
 no distinction is made between live television 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.479
 ms 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.680
 or, for example, an external input running game could handle the attic 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.710
 even it's just now looks like a normal ebb 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.710
 so that everything works in the same and simple way 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.930
 the horizontal bar that is shown over the active image can actually be seen as 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.580
 see some sort of alignment 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.720
 if you press the home button of the with your wiimote your own child will get the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.610
 active to see the most used and what's on fear today that kind 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.509
 Affairs 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.429
 go to the left and you will actually see the past the service centers opened abs 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.729
 and in brushing and things like that 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.779
 If you go to the right, you will actually see a collection of all and died 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:23.829
 have installed 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.849
 and that is a small interesting point because yes if you go over a hundred of 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.669
 that you have installed will then be on the set of huge row behind 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:31.389
 each other 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.449
 maybe they can look at it even better in the future 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.799
 the interface looks really beautiful 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.099
 it's all animations that luckily don't last too long so they don't go 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.459
 disturb in the long run 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.870
 what is also nice to see is the first whole installation of the smart wi fi 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.680
 but they have a cartoon character 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.340
 ten turn and it goes through all sorts of steps to turn your television on 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.350
 convert think of things such as heavily experienced sending search and so on 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.269
 if you do things well for you all end up with beautiful animations 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.579
 once it succeeded and television was installed as new 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.010
 birnback not back so he will not be bored like the well-known 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.010
 paper clip of macs or 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.049
 a number of things from the auti smart tv interface that are still here on the exhibition floor 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.899
 cannot be seen when we are full of top settings like that 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:24.229
 but the first impressions are really very positive 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.229
 the most important ebs such as netflix the youtube facebook 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.789
 are available at poor's 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:33.769
 and because the clubs run on html5 it was awful for that task 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.499
 easy 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.609
 omelet train to get on riot smart tv platform 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.399
 want you have a little name to make good hardware with just design 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.269
 but thanks to became poor s, that seems to be changing now
