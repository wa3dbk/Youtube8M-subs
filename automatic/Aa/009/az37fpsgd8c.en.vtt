00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
this doesn't really have anything to do

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.110 
this doesn't really have anything to do

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.790 
whatnot it runs at a perfect 60 frames a
second

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.250 

I<00:03:27.860> mean<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.820> look<00:03:29.000> at<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.180> no<00:03:29.660> slowdowns

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
I mean just look at that no slowdowns

00:03:30.260 --> 00:04:10.240 
I mean just look at that no slowdowns
whatsoever

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.479 

60<00:04:11.250> frames<00:04:11.970> per<00:04:12.980> second<00:04:14.750> in<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.920> palm<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.250> your

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
60 frames per second in the palm of your

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.650 
60 frames per second in the palm of your
hand<00:04:18.890> more<00:04:19.890> or<00:04:20.070> less<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:20.820> hope<00:04:21.180> it's<00:04:21.450> been

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
hand more or less so I hope it's been

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.920 
hand more or less so I hope it's been
fairly<00:04:22.019> simple<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.950> easy<00:04:23.480> for<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.630> to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
fairly simple and easy for you to

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.520 
fairly simple and easy for you to
clearly<00:04:25.410> see<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.880> EPP<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:28.080> a<00:04:28.140> much

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
clearly see that the EPP is a much

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.590 
clearly see that the EPP is a much
better<00:04:28.560> gaming<00:04:29.430> platform<00:04:30.180> than<00:04:30.660> say<00:04:31.460> the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
better gaming platform than say the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.680 
better gaming platform than say the
Pandora<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:34.200> mean<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:35.070> doesn't<00:04:35.430> have<00:04:35.690> gaming

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
Pandora I mean it doesn't have gaming

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.580 
Pandora I mean it doesn't have gaming
controls<00:04:37.290> but<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.550> open<00:04:39.540> source<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.140> it

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
controls but it is open source and it

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.920 
controls but it is open source and it

much better than anything else you know
here<00:05:40.590> it<00:05:40.680> is<00:05:40.830> there's<00:05:41.310> my<00:05:41.430> laptop<00:05:41.910> battery<00:05:43.490> for

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
here it is there's my laptop battery for

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.920 
here it is there's my laptop battery for
whatever<00:05:44.850> reason<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.240> not<00:05:45.270> telling<00:05:45.630> me<00:05:45.750> how

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
whatever reason is not telling me how

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.260 
whatever reason is not telling me how
much<00:05:46.080> time<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.440> got<00:05:46.590> left<00:05:48.380> but<00:05:49.380> yeah<00:05:50.270> definitely

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
much time I got left but yeah definitely

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.080 
much time I got left but yeah definitely
a<00:05:51.390> lot<00:05:51.750> better<00:05:52.229> than<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.830> Pandora<00:05:53.340> in<00:05:53.669> every

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
a lot better than the Pandora in every

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.420 
a lot better than the Pandora in every
possible<00:05:54.510> way<00:05:54.900> that<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.350> can<00:05:55.590> think<00:05:55.800> of<00:05:58.430> it

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
possible way that I can think of it

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.240 
possible way that I can think of it
doesn't<00:05:59.850> take<00:06:00.030> very<00:06:00.180> long<00:06:00.330> to<00:06:00.510> charge<00:06:00.990> and<00:06:01.530> the

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
doesn't take very long to charge and the

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.360 
doesn't take very long to charge and the
battery<00:06:02.640> stays<00:06:03.080> pretty<00:06:04.080> solid<00:06:06.110> for<00:06:07.340> quite<00:06:08.340> a

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
battery stays pretty solid for quite a
