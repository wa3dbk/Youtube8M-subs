Silver Edition i believe just by looking
at<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.610> tell<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.710> they<00:01:25.710> also<00:01:26.040> come

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
at it I can tell that and they also come

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.039 
at it I can tell that and they also come
in<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.640> different<00:01:26.790> versions<00:01:27.570> aside<00:01:27.869> from
