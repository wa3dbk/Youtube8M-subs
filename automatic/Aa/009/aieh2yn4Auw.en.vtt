so<00:00:02.310> what<00:00:02.520> actually<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:03.389> muscle<00:00:04.230> cramp<00:00:04.500> we're

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
so what actually is muscle cramp we're

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.760 
so what actually is muscle cramp we're
going<00:00:05.370> on<00:00:05.549> inside<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.210> body<00:00:06.540> results<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
going on inside the body results in the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.330 
going on inside the body results in the
pain<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.370> debility<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.480> muscle<00:00:09.960> cramp<00:00:10.340> to

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
pain of debility of muscle cramp to

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.890 
pain of debility of muscle cramp to
understand<00:00:11.820> what's<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.570> first

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
understand what's going on this first

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
understand what's going on this first
have<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> look<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.040> action<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.670> voluntary

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
have a look at the action of voluntary

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.330 
have a look at the action of voluntary
muscles<00:00:15.660> like<00:00:15.960> those<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.890> car<00:00:17.310> for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
muscles like those in the car for

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.000 
muscles like those in the car for
example<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.260> voluntary<00:00:19.260> muscle<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:19.859> you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
example a voluntary muscle is one you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.580 
example a voluntary muscle is one you
can<00:00:20.160> control<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:21.060> where<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.539> how<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.320> moves

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
can control to where and how it moves

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.130 
can control to where and how it moves
unlike<00:00:23.550> muscles<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> heart<00:00:24.689> which

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
unlike muscles like in the heart which

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
unlike muscles like in the heart which

muscle contracts without you wishing it
to<00:00:57.260> class<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.469> anywhere<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> few<00:00:59.370> seconds

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.930 
to class from anywhere for a few seconds
to<00:01:00.090> our<00:01:00.510> debt<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.780> our<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.949> also<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.399> reoccur

to our debt and our and also can reoccur

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.390 
to our debt and our and also can reoccur
the<00:01:03.420> same<00:01:03.660> location<00:01:04.290> shortly<00:01:04.769> after<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the same location shortly after the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.240 
the same location shortly after the
first<00:01:05.700> incident<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> cramp<00:01:07.159> because<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
first incident of the cramp because the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
first incident of the cramp because the
contraction<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> involuntary<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.930> nothing

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
contraction is involuntary is nothing

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.370 
contraction is involuntary is nothing
you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.560> actually<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:11.310> about<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.790> immediately

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
you can actually do about it immediately

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.620 
you can actually do about it immediately
so<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> appears<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.950> muscle<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.490> joint<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
so it appears the muscle and joint it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
so it appears the muscle and joint it
operates<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.229> actually<00:01:16.439> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> locked<00:01:17.220> in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
operates I actually kind of locked in

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.200 
operates I actually kind of locked in
position<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:19.650> isn't<00:01:19.890> unusual<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.790> everybody

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
position it isn't unusual then everybody

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.670 
position it isn't unusual then everybody
gets<00:01:21.390> muscle<00:01:21.869> cramps<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.200> time<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> time

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
gets muscle cramps from time to time

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.070 
gets muscle cramps from time to time
they<00:01:23.430> also<00:01:23.580> tend<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> become<00:01:24.210> more<00:01:24.780> frequent

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
they also tend to become more frequent

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.710 
they also tend to become more frequent
as<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.920> older<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:27.090> good<00:01:27.270> news<00:01:27.479> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
as you get older the good news is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
as you get older the good news is
generally<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.530> don't<00:01:28.560> cause<00:01:28.950> any<00:01:29.220> permanent

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
generally they don't cause any permanent

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.359 
generally they don't cause any permanent
damage<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.600> body<00:01:30.750> whatsoever<00:01:31.369> however

damage to your body whatsoever however
there<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:32.970> minimizing<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.290> ways<00:01:34.470> actually

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
there are minimizing the ways actually

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.499 
there are minimizing the ways actually
it<00:01:35.430> happening<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.470> cramp<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.799> caused<00:01:38.100> by

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
it happening a cramp can be caused by

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.640 
it happening a cramp can be caused by
nerves<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.720> muscles<00:01:39.869> getting<00:01:40.259> overexcited

nerves and muscles getting overexcited
when<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.820> cause<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.299> muscle<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> contract

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
when they cause the muscle to contract

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.370 
when they cause the muscle to contract
as<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> result<00:01:44.570> alternatively<00:01:45.570> vigorous
