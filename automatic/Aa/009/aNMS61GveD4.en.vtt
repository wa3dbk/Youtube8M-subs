00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
we define ourselves a lot by how we

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.319

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
and I think this new technological age

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.590 
and I think this new technological age
that<00:01:25.369> we're<00:01:25.520> living<00:01:25.640> in<00:01:25.939> we're<00:01:26.390> evolving

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
that we're living in we're evolving

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.060 
that we're living in we're evolving
differently<00:01:27.350> in<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.649> arena<00:01:29.799> my<00:01:30.799> first

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
differently in that arena my first

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.639 
differently in that arena my first
reaction<00:01:31.250> was<00:01:31.729> only<00:01:32.479> Jason<00:01:33.020> Reitman<00:01:33.320> could

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
reaction was only Jason Reitman could

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.100 
reaction was only Jason Reitman could
pull<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:33.950> off<00:01:34.159> he<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:34.789> always<00:01:35.119> finding<00:01:35.780> funny

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
pull this off he is always finding funny

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.350 
pull this off he is always finding funny
and<00:01:36.350> kind<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.860> black<00:01:37.189> comedy<00:01:37.549> way<00:01:37.939> that's

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
and kind of a black comedy way that's

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.149 
and kind of a black comedy way that's
why<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.570> think<00:01:38.750> it'll<00:01:39.140> resonate<00:01:39.320> for<00:01:39.830> longer

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
why I think it'll resonate for longer

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.039 
why I think it'll resonate for longer
and<00:01:40.429> with<00:01:40.549> more<00:01:40.759> people<00:01:41.149> because<00:01:41.509> it<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.659> funny
