this and should look different something
like<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.930> would<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> standard<00:01:49.560> cable

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
hold I think and to the right it's no to

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.680 
hold I think and to the right it's no to
the<00:05:39.070> right<00:05:39.250> its<00:05:39.490> hold<00:05:39.760> and<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.270> left<00:05:40.480> its

the right its hold and to the left its
power<00:05:41.500> on<00:05:41.740> but<00:05:42.130> it<00:05:42.250> doesn't<00:05:42.520> have<00:05:42.840> any<00:05:43.840> charge

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
power on but it doesn't have any charge

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.140 
power on but it doesn't have any charge

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
meant yet so that's it on the other side

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.720 
meant yet so that's it on the other side
it's<00:05:46.390> empty<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:47.230> on<00:05:47.410> the<00:05:47.530> bottom<00:05:47.860> this<00:05:48.520> is

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
it's empty and on the bottom this is

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.480 
it's empty and on the bottom this is
probably<00:05:49.330> the<00:05:50.010> microphone<00:05:51.010> but<00:05:51.220> you're<00:05:51.340> not

probably the microphone but you're not

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.170 
probably the microphone but you're not

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
compared to a 8 inch Sony Vaio Pierre

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.050 
compared to a 8 inch Sony Vaio Pierre
this<00:05:58.030> is<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.330> size<00:05:59.070> so<00:06:00.070> when<00:06:00.190> hate<00:06:00.490> it's<00:06:00.760> about

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
this is the size so when hate it's about

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.540 
this is the size so when hate it's about
the<00:06:01.360> same<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:02.260> little<00:06:02.470> bit<00:06:02.710> smaller<00:06:03.280> of<00:06:03.400> course

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
the same a little bit smaller of course

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.570 
the same a little bit smaller of course
and<00:06:04.120> in<00:06:05.050> this<00:06:05.169> place<00:06:05.440> size<00:06:05.740> this<00:06:06.040> would<00:06:06.220> be<00:06:06.370> 8

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
and in this place size this would be 8

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.810 
and in this place size this would be 8
inch<00:06:06.880> this<00:06:07.060> is<00:06:07.120> 7<00:06:07.570> inch<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:08.669> yeah<00:06:09.669> so

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
inch this is 7 inch and yeah so

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.670 
inch this is 7 inch and yeah so
Yop<00:06:12.820> is<00:06:13.150> bigger<00:06:13.390> but<00:06:13.960> of<00:06:14.110> course<00:06:14.380> it<00:06:14.470> has<00:06:14.650> a

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
Yop is bigger but of course it has a

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.100 
Yop is bigger but of course it has a
huge<00:06:15.160> keyboard<00:06:15.520> it's<00:06:16.150> not<00:06:16.360> that<00:06:16.570> much<00:06:16.750> heavier

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
huge keyboard it's not that much heavier

grams with a big battery right now I

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.330 
grams with a big battery right now I
already<00:06:22.450> showed<00:06:22.750> you<00:06:22.870> the<00:06:22.990> PSP<00:06:23.380> with<00:06:23.530> a<00:06:23.650> 4.3

already showed you the PSP with a 4.3

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.630 
already showed you the PSP with a 4.3
inch<00:06:24.580> display<00:06:25.570> so<00:06:26.440> this<00:06:26.680> is<00:06:26.740> a<00:06:26.800> 7-inch<00:06:27.340> still

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
inch display so this is a 7-inch still

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.860 
inch display so this is a 7-inch still
4.3<00:06:28.630> inch<00:06:28.870> that's<00:06:29.830> a<00:06:30.010> big<00:06:30.220> size<00:06:30.870> changement

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
4.3 inch that's a big size changement

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.090 
4.3 inch that's a big size changement
but<00:06:32.610> you'll<00:06:33.610> see<00:06:33.850> if<00:06:34.030> this<00:06:34.300> fits<00:06:34.600> in<00:06:34.780> my<00:06:34.870> pocket

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
but you'll see if this fits in my pocket

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.660 
but you'll see if this fits in my pocket
then<00:06:37.060> of<00:06:37.180> course<00:06:37.420> we<00:06:37.540> have<00:06:37.630> 10-inch<00:06:38.370> can<00:06:39.370> come

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
then of course we have 10-inch can come

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.340 
then of course we have 10-inch can come
really<00:06:39.880> compare<00:06:40.390> that<00:06:40.600> because<00:06:41.020> that's<00:06:41.260> a

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
really compare that because that's a

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.460 
really compare that because that's a
netbook<00:06:41.650> and<00:06:41.860> this<00:06:41.980> is<00:06:42.100> a<00:06:42.130> tablet<00:06:42.520> so<00:06:43.470> yeah

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
netbook and this is a tablet so yeah

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.710 
netbook and this is a tablet so yeah
that's<00:06:44.830> probably<00:06:45.340> the<00:06:45.490> I<00:06:45.520> the<00:06:46.120> size<00:06:46.390> of<00:06:46.630> the

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
that's probably the I the size of the

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.780 
that's probably the I the size of the
iPad<00:06:47.110> but<00:06:47.260> I'm<00:06:47.380> only<00:06:47.530> getting<00:06:48.190> that<00:06:48.340> next<00:06:48.610> week

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
iPad but I'm only getting that next week

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.050 
iPad but I'm only getting that next week
so<00:06:49.030> more<00:06:49.750> comparison<00:06:50.470> soon<00:06:50.770> and<00:06:51.070> I<00:06:51.490> think<00:06:51.850> this

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
so more comparison soon and I think this

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.330 
so more comparison soon and I think this
has<00:06:52.270> bluetooth<00:06:52.750> so<00:06:53.590> I<00:06:53.650> can<00:06:53.860> use<00:06:54.010> it<00:06:54.190> with<00:06:54.310> a

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
has bluetooth so I can use it with a

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.500 
has bluetooth so I can use it with a
Bluetooth<00:06:54.520> keyboard<00:06:54.970> so<00:06:55.960> compared<00:06:56.530> to<00:06:56.620> a

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
Bluetooth keyboard so compared to a

Bluetooth keyboard so compared to a
Apple<00:06:58.510> keyboard<00:06:59.410> this<00:06:59.710> is<00:07:00.010> how<00:07:00.250> big<00:07:00.520> that<00:07:00.790> is

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
Apple keyboard this is how big that is

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.750 
Apple keyboard this is how big that is
this<00:07:02.020> is<00:07:02.170> wireless<00:07:02.590> Bluetooth<00:07:03.130> keyboard<00:07:03.550> so

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
this is wireless Bluetooth keyboard so

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.530 
this is wireless Bluetooth keyboard so
you'll<00:07:04.360> see<00:07:04.630> if<00:07:04.750> I<00:07:04.840> can<00:07:04.990> use<00:07:05.140> it<00:07:05.430> and<00:07:06.430> yeah<00:07:06.670> it

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
you'll see if I can use it and yeah it

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.440 
you'll see if I can use it and yeah it
from<00:07:07.810> the<00:07:07.930> aqua<00:07:08.320> 7<00:07:08.680> home<00:07:08.830> tablet<00:07:09.100> the<00:07:10.000> next<00:07:10.300> few
