gone get checked out

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.279 
gone get checked out
it's<00:00:56.219> embarrassing<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.879> little<00:00:57.149> bit<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.510> yeah

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
it's embarrassing a little bit but yeah

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.860 
it's embarrassing a little bit but yeah
that<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.649> could<00:00:59.250> save<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.609> life

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
that it they could save your life

that it they could save your life
aim<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.559> enhance<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> patient's<00:01:02.609> recovery

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
aim is to enhance the patient's recovery

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.030 
aim is to enhance the patient's recovery
from<00:01:03.210> major<00:01:03.809> surgery<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.619> case<00:01:04.830> its

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
from major surgery and in this case its

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.700 
from major surgery and in this case its
prostate<00:01:05.460> cancer<00:01:05.790> surgery<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.530> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
prostate cancer surgery so what we do we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
prostate cancer surgery so what we do we
place<00:01:08.040> robotic<00:01:08.760> instruments<00:01:08.880> inside<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
place robotic instruments inside the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.230 
place robotic instruments inside the
patient<00:01:10.140> along<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> 3d<00:01:11.240> high-definition

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
patient along with a 3d high-definition

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.969 
patient along with a 3d high-definition
camera<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.229> those<00:01:13.439> instruments<00:01:13.770> are

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
camera and those instruments are

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.800 
camera and those instruments are
controlled<00:01:14.310> from<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.640> console<00:01:15.150> within<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
controlled from a console within the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.560 
controlled from a console within the
theater<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:17.970> touching<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
theater so I'm not actually touching the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.820 
theater so I'm not actually touching the
patient<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> touch<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.229> instruments<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
patient a touch of instruments the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
patient a touch of instruments the
robots<00:01:20.220> controls<00:01:21.090> instruments<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
robots controls instruments that I

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.109 
robots controls instruments that I
controller<00:01:22.290> through<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.590> console<00:01:23.119> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
controller through the console the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
controller through the console the
advantage<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.960> gives<00:01:25.110> us<00:01:25.340> 3d

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
advantage of this it gives us 3d

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
advantage of this it gives us 3d
excellent<00:01:26.970> vision<00:01:27.270> inside<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> patient<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
excellent vision inside the patient and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.399 
excellent vision inside the patient and
also<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.909> allows<00:01:29.970> us<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.570> greater<00:01:31.049> degree

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
also it allows us to have greater degree

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.590 
also it allows us to have greater degree
of<00:01:31.439> movement<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:32.040> instruments<00:01:32.549> inside<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of movement of instruments inside and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.880 
of movement of instruments inside and
the<00:01:33.720> robotic<00:01:34.110> instruments<00:01:34.259> actually<00:01:34.770> have

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the robotic instruments actually have

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.620 
the robotic instruments actually have
more<00:01:35.460> range<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.880> movement<00:01:36.150> than<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> human

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
more range of movement than the human

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560 
more range of movement than the human
hand<00:01:36.659> don't<00:01:37.470> worry<00:01:37.820> you'll<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.939> replaced<00:01:39.329> by

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
hand don't worry you'll get replaced by

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.240 
hand don't worry you'll get replaced by
robot<00:01:40.170> everyone<00:01:40.590> asked<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.860> question

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
robot everyone asked this question

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.450 
robot everyone asked this question
straight<00:01:42.150> answer<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.990> no<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:44.070> love<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> be

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
straight answer is no I would love to be

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.370 
straight answer is no I would love to be
replaced<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:45.000> prostate<00:01:45.450> cancer<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
replaced when prostate cancer is

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.300 
replaced when prostate cancer is
eliminating<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.899> robot<00:01:49.259> per<00:01:49.470> se<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
eliminating the robot per se is just a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
eliminating the robot per se is just a
surgical<00:01:50.729> tool<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.869> control<00:01:52.439> from<00:01:52.770> from

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
surgical tool that I control from from

surgical tool that I control from from
the<00:01:53.130> console<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> doesn't<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.750> anything

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the console so it doesn't do anything

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.289 
the console so it doesn't do anything
autonomously<00:01:55.710> everything<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.700> do

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
autonomously everything I do

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.289 
autonomously everything I do
controls<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.320> robot<00:01:58.649> within<00:01:59.520> six<00:01:59.880> months
