that money at the beginning of this

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.030 
that money at the beginning of this

for<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.430> farmer<00:05:23.730> to<00:05:23.820> have<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.120> money<00:05:24.300> anyway

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
for the farmer to have the money anyway

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.260 
for the farmer to have the money anyway
I<00:05:25.250> think<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.370> there's<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.610> gregorio

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
I think that there's a gregorio

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.910 
I think that there's a gregorio
opportunities<00:05:27.960> not<00:05:28.440> just<00:05:28.710> in<00:05:28.860> the

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
opportunities not just in the

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.130 
opportunities not just in the
countryside<00:05:29.310> also<00:05:29.850> but<00:05:30.000> in<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.210> city<00:05:30.420> as<00:05:30.600> well
