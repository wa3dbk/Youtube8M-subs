00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
dependent upon three things first each

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.599 
dependent upon three things first each
individual<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.719> different<00:01:01.100> for<00:01:02.100> example

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
individual is different for example

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.600 
individual is different for example
everyone's<00:01:03.300> metabolism<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.379> genetic<00:01:05.220> makeup

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
everyone's metabolism and genetic makeup

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
everyone's metabolism and genetic makeup
is<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.030> different<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.659> responds<00:01:07.140> differently

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
is so different and responds differently

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.670 
is so different and responds differently
to<00:01:07.799> different<00:01:08.580> types<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.420> drugs<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.200> well<00:01:10.500> as

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
to different types of drugs as well as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.460 
to different types of drugs as well as
food<00:01:10.920> types<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:12.210> know<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.570> wish<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.229> every

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
food types you know I wish that every

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
food types you know I wish that every
product<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:14.070> work<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.549> every<00:01:14.790> individual

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
product would work for every individual

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
product would work for every individual
but<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> case<00:01:17.119> for

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
but that's really not the case for

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
but that's really not the case for
