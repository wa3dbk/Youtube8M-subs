drawing a manga face and throughout the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
book I make an effort to include

different<00:00:55.739> drawing<00:00:56.190> styles<00:00:56.789> now<00:00:58.489> sometimes

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
different drawing styles now sometimes

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.119 
different drawing styles now sometimes
you'll<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.210> step-by-step<00:01:00.960> lesson<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you'll see a step-by-step lesson in a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.740 
you'll see a step-by-step lesson in a
book<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.760> begins<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.539> something

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
book that that begins with something

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.299 
book that that begins with something
like<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.589> makes<00:01:05.070> these

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
like this and then makes these

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
like this and then makes these
incredible<00:01:05.820> leaps<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.500> next

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
incredible leaps from one to the next

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
incredible leaps from one to the next
which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.939> frustrating<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
which is very frustrating for the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
which is very frustrating for the
beginning<00:01:10.290> students<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.950> wanted<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> make

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
beginning students so I wanted to make

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.039 
beginning students so I wanted to make
sure<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.000> didn't<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
sure that I didn't have that kind of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.679 
sure that I didn't have that kind of
thing<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.439> my<00:01:13.890> book<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.460> fact<00:01:14.939> even<00:01:15.150> just

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
thing in my book and in fact even just

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
thing in my book and in fact even just
drawing<00:01:15.960> something<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.159> an

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
drawing something like this for an

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
drawing something like this for an
absolute<00:01:17.640> beginner<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.360> quite

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
absolute beginner can be quite

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.080 
absolute beginner can be quite
challenging<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.619> my<00:01:19.770> approach<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.939> begin

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
challenging so my approach was to begin

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.320 
challenging so my approach was to begin
always<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.229> simple<00:01:22.860> circle<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> then

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
always with a simple circle and then

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.179 
always with a simple circle and then
gradually<00:01:24.960> build<00:01:25.259> towards<00:01:25.740> something<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
gradually build towards something that

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.010 
gradually build towards something that
gets<00:01:26.580> us<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> shape<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> head<00:01:27.659> where<00:01:27.900> we

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
gets us the shape of the head where we

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.830 
gets us the shape of the head where we
can<00:01:28.170> place<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.680> eyes<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:30.180> course<00:01:30.450> there

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
can place the eyes and of course there

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
can place the eyes and of course there
is<00:01:30.869> always<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> bit<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> leap

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
is always going to be a bit of a leap

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770 
is always going to be a bit of a leap
when<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.610> move<00:01:32.790> into<00:01:33.000> drawing<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> hair

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
when you move into drawing the hair

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
when you move into drawing the hair
that's<00:01:33.990> probably<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> most<00:01:34.860> challenging

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that's probably the most challenging

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.039 
that's probably the most challenging
part<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.700> any<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> my<00:01:36.119> exercises<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.020> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
part of any one of my exercises but I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
part of any one of my exercises but I

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
one two and three point perspectives and

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.480 
one two and three point perspectives and
here's<00:05:35.930> a<00:05:36.020> kind<00:05:36.139> of<00:05:36.259> a<00:05:36.349> fun<00:05:36.589> thing<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:36.979> I<00:05:37.129> did

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
here's a kind of a fun thing that I did

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.730 
here's a kind of a fun thing that I did
I<00:05:37.520> did<00:05:37.819> a<00:05:37.849> reference<00:05:38.300> page<00:05:38.569> for<00:05:38.870> each<00:05:39.050> one<00:05:39.710> of

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
I did a reference page for each one of

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.070 
I did a reference page for each one of
the<00:05:39.979> different<00:05:40.400> styles<00:05:40.879> of<00:05:41.000> perspective<00:05:41.960> so

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
the different styles of perspective so

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.290 
the different styles of perspective so
this<00:05:42.199> is<00:05:42.379> one<00:05:42.710> point<00:05:43.069> and<00:05:43.310> I<00:05:43.669> want<00:05:43.909> to<00:05:44.000> kind<00:05:44.180> of

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
this is one point and I want to kind of

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.999 
this is one point and I want to kind of
zoom<00:05:44.360> in<00:05:44.810> here<00:05:45.080> for<00:05:45.319> a<00:05:45.349> second<00:05:45.710> on<00:05:45.830> this

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
zoom in here for a second on this

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.719 
zoom in here for a second on this
illustration<00:05:46.699> of<00:05:46.909> the<00:05:47.029> chair<00:05:48.699> because<00:05:49.699> I

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
illustration of the chair because I

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.149 
illustration of the chair because I
thought<00:05:50.029> what<00:05:50.270> better<00:05:50.300> way<00:05:50.599> to<00:05:51.159> illustrate

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
thought what better way to illustrate

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.279 
thought what better way to illustrate
the<00:05:52.279> difference<00:05:52.729> between<00:05:53.449> these<00:05:53.870> three

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
the difference between these three

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.010 
the difference between these three
different<00:05:54.860> perspective<00:05:55.819> systems<00:05:56.240> would<00:05:56.509> then

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
different perspective systems would then

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.379 
different perspective systems would then
to<00:05:57.169> show<00:05:57.409> the<00:05:57.620> exact<00:05:57.949> same<00:05:58.159> object<00:05:58.430> drawn<00:05:59.120> in

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
to show the exact same object drawn in

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.269 
to show the exact same object drawn in
the<00:05:59.509> three<00:05:59.779> different<00:06:00.439> styles<00:06:00.830> so<00:06:00.860> here's<00:06:01.159> the

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:01.279 
the three different styles so here's the

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.240 
the three different styles so here's the
one-point<00:06:01.819> perspective<00:06:02.979> here's<00:06:03.979> the

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
one-point perspective here's the

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.899 
one-point perspective here's the
two-point<00:06:04.789> perspective<00:06:05.270> and<00:06:06.669> here's<00:06:07.669> the

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
two-point perspective and here's the

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.909 
two-point perspective and here's the
three-point<00:06:08.509> perspective<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.560> of<00:06:09.680> course

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
three-point perspective and of course

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.890 
three-point perspective and of course
