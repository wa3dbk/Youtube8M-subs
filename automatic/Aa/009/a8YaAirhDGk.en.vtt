here now one issue that I do have is

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.310 
here now one issue that I do have is
with<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> silicone<00:01:02.730> band<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.660> really

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
with the silicone band it's really

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960 
with the silicone band it's really
flimsy<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> break

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
flimsy not that it's going to break

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.660 
flimsy not that it's going to break
easily<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.720> any<00:01:06.750> point<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.380> course<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.369> really

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
easily at any point of course but really

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
easily at any point of course but really
it<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.790> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> doesn't<00:01:09.720> feel<00:01:09.900> quite<00:01:10.409> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it just kind of doesn't feel quite that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
it just kind of doesn't feel quite that
sturdy<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.400> necessarily<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.240> high

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
sturdy not necessarily have a very high

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
sturdy not necessarily have a very high
quality<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.549> do<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.000> also<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.979> charging

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
quality but we do have also the charging

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.230 
quality but we do have also the charging
cable<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.210> looks

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
cable that is right here and it looks

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.880 
cable that is right here and it looks
like<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.259> bit<00:01:19.470> different

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
like it's just a little bit different

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
like it's just a little bit different
from<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> previous<00:01:20.250> ones<00:01:20.790> from<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> original

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
from the previous ones from the original

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
from the previous ones from the original
pebble<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.530> also<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> pebble<00:01:23.189> steel<00:01:23.369> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
pebble and also the pebble steel that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
pebble and also the pebble steel that
came<00:01:23.790> after<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.750> those<00:01:24.960> are<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
came after it so those are just the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.289 
came after it so those are just the
contents<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.189> box<00:01:26.369> itself<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.090> then

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
contents of the box itself and then

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.289 
contents of the box itself and then
we're<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.900> into<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.380> actual<00:01:28.710> setup

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
we're going to go into the actual setup

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.810 
we're going to go into the actual setup
for<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.689> pebble<00:01:30.960> time<00:01:31.250> but<00:01:32.250> before<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.610> turn

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
for the pebble time but before we turn

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030

around<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.119> actual<00:01:42.570> display<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.530> are

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
around the actual display but we are

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.690 
around the actual display but we are
going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.950> dealing<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.340> color<00:01:44.610> display

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
going to be dealing with a color display

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.249 
going to be dealing with a color display
which<00:01:45.210> will<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.479> able<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
which will be able to see in just a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
which will be able to see in just a
second<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.250> various<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.939> pins<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.930> are

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
second the various little pins that are

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.830 
second the various little pins that are
down<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.479> replacement

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
down here and if you have a replacement

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 
down here and if you have a replacement
strap<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:52.829> case<00:01:53.009> i'd<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.490> wide

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
strap in my case i'd like to have wide

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.030 
strap in my case i'd like to have wide
replacement<00:01:54.329> straps<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.680> should<00:01:55.860> work

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
replacement straps then it should work

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.469 
replacement straps then it should work
pretty<00:01:56.250> well<00:01:56.399> right<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> i'll<00:01:57.270> probably

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
pretty well right here and i'll probably

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
pretty well right here and i'll probably
show<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> end<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.320> video<00:01:58.500> look

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
show that the end of this video look

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.499 
show that the end of this video look
over<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> back<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> can

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
over to the back right here and you can

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
over to the back right here and you can
see<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> pebble<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.469> definitely<00:02:02.040> this

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
see that the pebble is definitely this

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.280 
see that the pebble is definitely this
is<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> kickstarter<00:02:03.149> backer<00:02:03.420> version<00:02:03.960> now

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
is the kickstarter backer version now

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.630 
is the kickstarter backer version now
it's<00:02:04.469> possible<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> version<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it's possible that the version that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.039 
it's possible that the version that
makes<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> retail<00:02:06.450> stores<00:02:06.659> might<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
makes it to retail stores might be a

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.719 
makes it to retail stores might be a
little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.590> different<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.280> at<00:02:08.399> least<00:02:08.489> for

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
little bit different but at least for

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
little bit different but at least for
now<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> clear<00:02:09.780> indication<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
now we do have a clear indication that

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.309 
now we do have a clear indication that
this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.920> I

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
this is the one that I

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.289 
this is the one that I
edged<00:02:11.469> for<00:02:11.680> on<00:02:11.829> their<00:02:12.040> kickstarter<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.790> then

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
edged for on their kickstarter and then

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.390 
edged for on their kickstarter and then
some<00:02:13.480> pins<00:02:13.719> up<00:02:13.959> here<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.319> what<00:02:14.499> might<00:02:14.769> be<00:02:15.099> and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
some pins up here for what might be and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.970 
some pins up here for what might be and
hopefully<00:02:15.639> will<00:02:16.060> be<00:02:16.260> various<00:02:17.260> smart<00:02:17.709> straps

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
hopefully will be various smart straps

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.250 
hopefully will be various smart straps
that<00:02:18.129> go<00:02:18.189> on<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> pebble<00:02:19.120> otherwise<00:02:20.049> we

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
that go on to the pebble otherwise we

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.289 
that go on to the pebble otherwise we
have<00:02:20.499> the<00:02:20.859> various<00:02:21.310> buttons<00:02:21.579> here<00:02:21.939> on<00:02:22.120> the

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:07.449 
from the app as usual we go through the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
settings screen and we have to make sure

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.289 
settings screen and we have to make sure
that<00:03:09.010> pebble<00:03:09.159> time<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.639> available<00:03:10.060> for

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
that pebble time is available for

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.830 
that pebble time is available for
notification<00:03:11.049> access<00:03:12.449> and<00:03:13.449> we<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.659> choose<00:03:13.810> a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
notification access and we can choose a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.240 
notification access and we can choose a
different<00:03:14.079> watch<00:03:14.349> face<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:14.949> these<00:03:15.069> are<00:03:15.189> all

applications from the original pebble
will<00:03:37.150> work<00:03:37.359> on<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:37.840> pebble<00:03:38.109> time<00:03:38.409> it's<00:03:38.739> just

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:39.009 
will work on the pebble time it's just

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:40.649

then<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.669> pebble<00:04:33.970> time<00:04:34.240> forward<00:04:35.080> and

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
then the pebble time forward and

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.809 
then the pebble time forward and
backward<00:04:35.680> is<00:04:35.800> really<00:04:36.069> going<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.250> be<00:04:36.400> useful

few applications for use with my pebble
time<00:04:46.270> as<00:04:47.139> may<00:04:47.949> be<00:04:48.180> expected<00:04:49.180> already<00:04:49.539> some<00:04:49.840> of

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
time as may be expected already some of

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.960 
time as may be expected already some of
the<00:04:50.199> applications<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:51.430> were<00:04:51.550> available<00:04:51.669> for

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
the applications that were available for

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.640 
the applications that were available for
the<00:04:52.150> original<00:04:52.479> pebble<00:04:52.750> may<00:04:52.900> not<00:04:53.139> be<00:04:53.440> fully

the original pebble may not be fully

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.260 
the original pebble may not be fully
updated<00:04:54.250> for<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.460> pebble<00:04:54.789> time<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.120> take

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
updated for the pebble time to take

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.210 
updated for the pebble time to take
advantage<00:04:55.479> for<00:04:56.110> example<00:04:56.500> of<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.919> color

screen for example nav me is one of them
you<00:04:59.349> can<00:04:59.440> see<00:04:59.620> it's<00:04:59.770> still<00:04:59.949> black<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.250> white

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
you can see it's still black and white

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.950 
you can see it's still black and white
but<00:05:00.909> that's<00:05:01.060> not<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.300> big<00:05:01.449> of<00:05:01.569> a<00:05:01.659> deal<00:05:01.810> or

still remains functional which is the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.089 
still remains functional which is the
biggest<00:05:03.699> and<00:05:03.970> most<00:05:04.389> important<00:05:04.930> thing<00:05:05.169> but<00:05:05.979> if

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
biggest and most important thing but if

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.620 
biggest and most important thing but if

more functionality and some better

of the pebble ecosystem so naturally I'm
pretty<00:05:49.900> excited<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.440> use<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.039> pebble<00:05:51.310> time

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
pretty excited to use the pebble time

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.010 
pretty excited to use the pebble time
and<00:05:51.759> bring<00:05:51.880> you<00:05:52.000> my<00:05:52.120> full<00:05:52.270> review<00:05:52.449> in<00:05:52.659> the<00:05:52.750> next

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
number of days or so it's not that

Android<00:05:55.449> wear<00:05:55.719> is<00:05:55.750> really<00:05:56.229> behind<00:05:56.380> or<00:05:57.039> worse

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
Android wear is really behind or worse

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.610 
Android wear is really behind or worse
than<00:05:57.759> pebble<00:05:58.180> by<00:05:58.360> any<00:05:58.539> means<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:58.960> just<00:05:59.409> sort<00:05:59.560> of

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
than pebble by any means I just sort of

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.080 
than pebble by any means I just sort of
like<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.949> way<00:06:00.099> that<00:06:00.279> pebble<00:06:00.460> presents<00:06:00.940> its

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
like the way that pebble presents its

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.969 
like the way that pebble presents its
smartwatches<00:06:01.599> especially<00:06:02.319> with<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:02.529> tactile

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
smartwatches especially with the tactile

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.309 
smartwatches especially with the tactile
buttons<00:06:03.039> that<00:06:03.550> are<00:06:03.580> on<00:06:03.819> the<00:06:04.029> actual<00:06:04.300> unit<00:06:04.750> it's

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
buttons that are on the actual unit it's

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:06.839 
buttons that are on the actual unit it's
a<00:06:05.409> little<00:06:05.620> bit<00:06:05.710> easier<00:06:06.009> for<00:06:06.159> me<00:06:06.219> to<00:06:06.250> navigate

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
a little bit easier for me to navigate

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.610 
a little bit easier for me to navigate
among<00:06:06.969> the<00:06:07.360> different<00:06:07.569> elements<00:06:07.840> of<00:06:08.169> the<00:06:08.289> OS

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
among the different elements of the OS

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.529 
among the different elements of the OS
without<00:06:09.039> having<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.699> really<00:06:09.909> look<00:06:10.180> at<00:06:10.360> the

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
without having to really look at the

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.180 
without having to really look at the
watch<00:06:10.719> in<00:06:11.050> certain<00:06:11.500> situations<00:06:11.680> if<00:06:12.099> I

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
watch in certain situations if I

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.589 
watch in certain situations if I
remember<00:06:12.490> how<00:06:12.520> many<00:06:12.759> presses<00:06:13.150> it<00:06:13.270> takes<00:06:13.449> to

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
remember how many presses it takes to

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.149 
remember how many presses it takes to
get<00:06:13.719> to<00:06:13.779> an<00:06:13.930> application<00:06:14.440> it's<00:06:14.620> easy<00:06:14.830> for<00:06:15.039> me

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
get to an application it's easy for me

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.730 
get to an application it's easy for me
