00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
hey guys and welcome to today's tutorial

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.170 
hey guys and welcome to today's tutorial
it's<00:00:06.200> how<00:00:06.349> to<00:00:06.410> set<00:00:06.710> up<00:00:06.740> a<00:00:07.069> multiplayer<00:00:08.059> server

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
it's how to set up a multiplayer server

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.410 
it's how to set up a multiplayer server
using<00:00:08.900> a<00:00:09.080> software<00:00:09.530> piece<00:00:10.280> called<00:00:10.610> evolve<00:00:11.120> and

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
using a software piece called evolve and

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.570 
using a software piece called evolve and
this<00:00:12.110> is<00:00:12.290> an<00:00:12.440> alternative<00:00:12.980> to<00:00:13.040> him<00:00:13.250> actually<00:00:13.370> I

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
this is an alternative to him actually I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.160 
this is an alternative to him actually I
think<00:00:13.730> it's<00:00:14.059> easier<00:00:14.480> than<00:00:14.570> I'm<00:00:14.750> actually<00:00:14.900> to

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
think it's easier than I'm actually to

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.560 
think it's easier than I'm actually to
be<00:00:15.260> honest<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.010> that's<00:00:16.219> a<00:00:16.400> benefit<00:00:17.150> in<00:00:17.270> itself

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
be honest so that's a benefit in itself

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.260 
be honest so that's a benefit in itself
just<00:00:17.930> using<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:19.760> other<00:00:19.880> benefit<00:00:20.240> is

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
just using this and the other benefit is

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.450 
just using this and the other benefit is
you<00:00:20.539> can<00:00:20.900> use<00:00:21.110> it<00:00:21.140> for<00:00:21.440> any<00:00:21.650> other<00:00:21.770> game<00:00:22.220> not

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
you can use it for any other game not

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.170 
you can use it for any other game not
just<00:00:22.730> minecraft<00:00:23.690> any<00:00:23.930> like<00:00:24.230> Call<00:00:24.440> of<00:00:24.470> Duty

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
how you do it and it may seem really

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.810 
how you do it and it may seem really
complicated<00:06:33.110> but<00:06:33.950> as<00:06:34.010> soon<00:06:34.250> as<00:06:34.340> you<00:06:34.490> know<00:06:34.639> what

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
complicated but as soon as you know what

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.000 
complicated but as soon as you know what
you're<00:06:34.940> doing<00:06:35.210> it<00:06:35.450> really<00:06:35.750> is<00:06:36.020> easy<00:06:36.409> as<00:06:36.770> that

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
you're doing it really is easy as that

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.830 
you're doing it really is easy as that
it<00:06:37.190> like<00:06:37.340> if<00:06:37.940> I<00:06:38.090> wasn't<00:06:38.330> doing<00:06:38.479> this<00:06:38.630> in<00:06:38.780> a

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
it like if I wasn't doing this in a

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.740 
it like if I wasn't doing this in a
tutorial<00:06:39.169> I<00:06:39.440> could<00:06:39.650> set<00:06:39.860> up<00:06:39.950> a<00:06:40.070> server<00:06:40.340> in<00:06:40.750> five

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
tutorial I could set up a server in five

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.430 
tutorial I could set up a server in five
minutes

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
minutes

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.410 
minutes
absolute<00:06:42.800> maximum<00:06:43.250> get<00:06:43.700> all<00:06:43.820> my<00:06:43.970> friends<00:06:44.300> in

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
absolute maximum get all my friends in

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.750 
absolute maximum get all my friends in
and<00:06:44.540> we<00:06:44.600> could<00:06:44.720> be<00:06:44.780> playing<00:06:45.580> absolutely<00:06:46.580> no

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
and we could be playing absolutely no

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.450 
and we could be playing absolutely no
time<00:06:46.970> so<00:06:47.410> you<00:06:48.410> can<00:06:48.530> see<00:06:48.620> it's<00:06:48.740> bad<00:06:48.890> FPS<00:06:49.280> because

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
time so you can see it's bad FPS because

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.860 
time so you can see it's bad FPS because
I'm<00:06:49.670> recording<00:06:49.790> with<00:06:50.120> a<00:06:50.240> full<00:06:50.540> screen

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
I'm recording with a full screen

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.100 
I'm recording with a full screen
recorder<00:06:51.800> not<00:06:52.010> in<00:06:52.670> game<00:06:52.910> recorder<00:06:53.360> but<00:06:53.930> that

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
recorder not in game recorder but that

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.360 
recorder not in game recorder but that
is<00:06:54.290> basically<00:06:55.250> how<00:06:55.640> you<00:06:55.670> set<00:06:55.880> up<00:06:56.240> a<00:06:57.370> private

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
is basically how you set up a private

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.490 
is basically how you set up a private
server<00:06:58.610> on<00:06:58.850> minecraft<00:06:59.360> without<00:06:59.900> hamachi<00:07:00.290> and

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
server on minecraft without hamachi and

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.890 
server on minecraft without hamachi and
I<00:07:00.710> think<00:07:00.950> this<00:07:01.070> is<00:07:01.220> a<00:07:01.250> lot<00:07:01.520> better<00:07:01.700> because<00:07:01.900> as

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
I think this is a lot better because as

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.020 
I think this is a lot better because as
you<00:07:03.080> see<00:07:03.290> here<00:07:03.530> with<00:07:03.860> my<00:07:04.010> game<00:07:04.250> it<00:07:04.700> doesn't

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
you see here with my game it doesn't

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.850 
you see here with my game it doesn't
have<00:07:05.180> to<00:07:05.300> be<00:07:05.420> minecraft<00:07:05.870> it<00:07:06.020> can<00:07:06.110> be<00:07:06.200> dayz<00:07:06.440> it

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
have to be minecraft it can be dayz it

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.470 
have to be minecraft it can be dayz it
can<00:07:07.040> be<00:07:07.190> leak<00:07:07.550> legends<00:07:07.880> like<00:07:08.030> I<00:07:08.060> said<00:07:08.270> it<00:07:08.390> could

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
can be leak legends like I said it could

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.510 
can be leak legends like I said it could
be<00:07:08.570> anything<00:07:09.200> anything<00:07:09.530> you<00:07:09.830> want<00:07:10.040> to<00:07:10.160> set<00:07:10.430> up
