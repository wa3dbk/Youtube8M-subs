00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hi guys 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.069
 so I'm here just to talk to 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.269
 You are a little on the frosting of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 condensed milk 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.840
 a lot of people are in doubt a lot of people 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.759
 still wrong 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.529
 So this is what I'm going to show you. 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.320
 he beat 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.710
 here it is if it does not stay in this texture 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.519
 you can see that it does not fall off the spoon 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.539
 he is firm in the then something gave 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.850
 wrong 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.300
 the texture of it is that it will stay 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.340
 firmly and does not fall off the spoon and you can 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.040
 quiet 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.910
 about any cupcakes you want 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.559
 're the ingredients I use to hit 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.800
 hemosul know we're hook up ice cream 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.420
 even you will put a spoonful of 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.710
 soup to show a full tablespoon 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.699
 that I speak 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 It would not be this way, I'll say it full. 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.930
 even with that I always repeat there 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.470
 a full tablespoon would be one 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.560
 Spoon 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.729
 so full 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.549
 Okay, you're going to put a woman on this. 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.159
 together with a condensed milk a 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.070
 395 grams carton 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.479
 I really like the firmness and the firmness I 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.799
 I get the impression that it leaves a 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.280
 a little firmer 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.020
 I prefer she also has the nestlÃ© girl 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.380
 which is also very good 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.619
 what will you do you will put the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.250
 condensed milk inside the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.210
 mixer and will then add a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.729
 tablespoon back of a spoon 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.430
 soup filled with a signifier 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.540
 You'll leave it beating at speed. 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.210
 maximum until you are firm you do not have the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.810
 Right time is until it's settled it goes 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.540
 stay 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.780
 increase in volume and go 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.149
 to stay this way it would look like this 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.110
 on the mixer 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.980
 Can you see the IMF? 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.570
 it's a frosting son is very tasty 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.040
 nobody ever complained about the taste 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:22.040
 a lot of people talking and having it 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.900
 I like the smell of the emulsifier I do not 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.440
 I know I never had any complaints 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.530
 here it stands to reason he will not stay 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.380
 with condensed milk taste is because 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.650
 is a mixture is not condensed milk 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.300
 Here they are but it will get sweet 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.600
 getting white will become a frosty 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.410
 very easy to do and without 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.610
 secrets 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.770
 Other thing I do not usually leave the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.739
 condensed milk in the refrigerator 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.010
 actually I never let it 's temperature 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.560
 environment of both condensed milk and 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.480
 as the right hook up hemosul hit 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.050
 is ready 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.560
 it is with this cancer you can mix 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.510
 dyes both liquid gel and you can 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.690
 add if you want cancer 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.560
 crescent chocolate 4 tablespoons 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.690
 chocolate powder never chocolate 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.519
 Why chocolate is he going to do? 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.860
 he will create and it's a polka dot 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.160
 sugar then it's time you hit 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.320
 He will not get that nutty cream . 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.320
 same as it stays here because the texture 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.060
 sure of him is the one here is lisinho and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.940
 bright right 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.700
 then you just use your creativity 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.700
 put a nozzle and do not give 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.750
 see the way you want in all 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.120
 your recipes 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.040
 I love for Portuguese, do not exchange it. 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.150
 for nothing on top of cupcakes he is 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.650
 resistant 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.730
 looks beautiful and has a texture 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.180
 wonderful that does not fall 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.510
 another detail is that a lot of people also 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.489
 speaking is that they are pounding or 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.250
 leaving in refrigerator or leaving 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.400
 rest not people acronyms is a little 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.489
 delicate in the only point you have to 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.070
 beat and already confetti in this way he does not 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.340
 get angry and it will not dissolve 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.160
 no way 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.590
 He'll be just the way you are. 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.479
 put in the spout and then 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:30.510
 to adorn it another great detail is has 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.790
 people who are putting aromas can 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.400
 put I never put I do not see 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.040
 need but if you want you can 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.610
 Put in no problem 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.780
 It's what I wanted to talk about him most about. 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.960
 doubts 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.479
 I think that would be it so you can 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.240
 use and abuse what you want is a 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.260
 easy recipe practical recipe does not have 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.389
 secret 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.060
 and good luck if you still have any questions 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.950
 you can contact me, you can speak 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.500
