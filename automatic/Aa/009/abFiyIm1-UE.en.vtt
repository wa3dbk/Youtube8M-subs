it really does Michael it's a simple
process<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.650> aluminum<00:01:41.130> frame<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
process we have aluminum frame that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.539 
process we have aluminum frame that
simply<00:01:42.540> attaches<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> walls<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.040> then

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
simply attaches to the walls and then

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.789 
simply attaches to the walls and then
you<00:01:44.640> simply<00:01:45.030> insert<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.450> glass<00:01:45.750> blocks<00:01:46.200> yeah

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
aluminium grid glass block and sealant
okay<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.860> had<00:01:55.950> mortar<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:57.000> would

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
okay so if we had mortar then we would

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.670 
okay so if we had mortar then we would
just<00:01:57.210> go<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.540> few<00:01:57.719> rows<00:01:57.930> we'd<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.439> stop

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
just go up a few rows we'd have to stop

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440 
just go up a few rows we'd have to stop
the<00:01:58.860> whole<00:01:59.009> construction<00:01:59.520> process<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.180> day

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the whole construction process for a day

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
the whole construction process for a day
we<00:02:00.689> let<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.140> drive<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:01.770> walk<00:02:02.100> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we let it drive because they walk so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.920 
we let it drive because they walk so
heavy<00:02:02.580> in<00:02:02.820> most<00:02:03.000> cases<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.750> have

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
heavy in most cases that's what you have

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
heavy in most cases that's what you have
to<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> let<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.159> set<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.610> before

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
to do you have to let it set up before

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.640 
to do you have to let it set up before
you<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.150> continue<00:02:06.330> into<00:02:06.810> order<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.500> looks

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
you can continue into order it looks

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.779 
you can continue into order it looks
like<00:02:07.799> these<00:02:07.920> guys<00:02:08.130> are<00:02:08.160> gonna<00:02:08.340> finish<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
like these guys are gonna finish the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.240 
like these guys are gonna finish the
whole<00:02:08.910> thing<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.300> half<00:02:09.479> an<00:02:09.660> hour<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.110> would<00:02:11.039> say

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
whole thing in half an hour I would say

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.610 
whole thing in half an hour I would say
so<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.819> doesn't<00:02:12.180> it's<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.840> pretty<00:02:12.870> fast<00:02:13.290> as

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
so it doesn't it's going pretty fast as

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
so it doesn't it's going pretty fast as
you<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.489> simply<00:02:15.180> put<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.630> vinyl

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
you can see it's simply put the vinyl

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.900 
you can see it's simply put the vinyl
boot<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.349> block<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:17.250> helps<00:02:17.550> hold<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.819> in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
boot on the block that helps hold it in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.300 
boot on the block that helps hold it in
place<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.540> simply<00:02:18.780> shoved<00:02:19.080> into

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
place and it's just simply shoved into

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.040 
place and it's just simply shoved into
into<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> grid<00:02:20.610> system<00:02:20.910> I've<00:02:21.600> seen<00:02:21.870> this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
into the grid system I've seen this

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.340 
into the grid system I've seen this
system<00:02:22.290> before<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:23.250> Windows<00:02:24.030> except<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.110> grid

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
system before on Windows except the grid

itself<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.580> flange<00:02:26.910> here<00:02:27.120> was<00:02:27.269> much<00:02:27.510> much

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
itself the flange here was much much

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.410 
itself the flange here was much much
wider<00:02:28.019> life<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.220> narrow<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.700> well<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.300> we

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
wider life is so narrow now well what we

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.820 
wider life is so narrow now well what we
did<00:02:30.599> was<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.840> took<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.200> lot<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.349> feedback<00:02:31.590> from

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
did was we took a lot of feedback from

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.400 
did was we took a lot of feedback from
consumers<00:02:32.670> builders<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.450> architects<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
consumers builders and architects and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.440 
consumers builders and architects and
they<00:02:34.920> wanted<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.280> see<00:02:35.459> less<00:02:35.730> metal<00:02:36.030> they<00:02:36.209> liked

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
they wanted to see less metal they liked

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.729 
they wanted to see less metal they liked
the<00:02:36.660> metal<00:02:36.959> they<00:02:37.050> liked<00:02:37.260> all<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> different

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the metal they liked all the different

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.559 
the metal they liked all the different
colors<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.010> we<00:02:38.190> offer<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> metal<00:02:38.970> but

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
colors that we offer in the metal but

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.890 
colors that we offer in the metal but
they<00:02:39.989> didn't<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:41.130> 3/4<00:02:41.940> inch<00:02:41.970> grid<00:02:42.690> so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
they didn't like the 3/4 inch grid so

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.949 
they didn't like the 3/4 inch grid so
we've<00:02:43.049> reduced<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.620> 3/8<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.430> same

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
we've reduced it to 3/8 the same

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.350 
we've reduced it to 3/8 the same
distance<00:02:45.959> as<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:46.410> are<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> same<00:02:46.739> width<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
distance as they are the same width as a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.090 
distance as they are the same width as a
mortar<00:02:48.690> joint<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.380> now<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.560> have<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.769> clean

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
mortar joint and so now you have a clean

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.039 
mortar joint and so now you have a clean
symmetrical<00:02:50.819> look<00:02:51.030> well<00:02:51.510> Steve<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.840> looks

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
symmetrical look well Steve this looks

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.220 
symmetrical look well Steve this looks

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.860 
why is that well what we've done is is
that<00:03:27.030> we<00:03:27.120> wanted<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.420> speed<00:03:27.630> up<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that we wanted to speed up the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.539 
that we wanted to speed up the
installation<00:03:28.200> process<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.430> we've

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
installation process and we've

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.069 
installation process and we've
eliminated<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.180> foam<00:03:30.420> tape<00:03:30.690> which<00:03:30.900> you're

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
eliminated the foam tape which you're

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.840 
eliminated the foam tape which you're
familiar<00:03:31.230> with<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
familiar with and that's the the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.490 
familiar with and that's the the
adhesive<00:03:33.299> on<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> back<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.930> closed<00:03:34.260> cell

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
adhesive on the back of the closed cell

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.250 
adhesive on the back of the closed cell
foam<00:03:34.530> tape<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.280> we've<00:03:35.400> designed<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.450> vinyl

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
foam tape and we've designed a vinyl

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.410 
foam tape and we've designed a vinyl
boot<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.859> use<00:03:38.220> instead<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:39.090> slide<00:03:39.269> it

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
boot to use instead so just slide it

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.520 
boot to use instead so just slide it
around<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.690> block<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.079> then<00:03:40.170> slide<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
around the block and then slide the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.330 
around the block and then slide the
block<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.920> that's<00:03:41.459> correct<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:43.130> like<00:03:44.130> that

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
block in that's correct I like that

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.460 
block in that's correct I like that
that's<00:03:44.640> simple<00:03:45.000> okay<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:45.870> once<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.230> blocks

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that's simple okay now once the blocks

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.050 
that's simple okay now once the blocks
are<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.680> place<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.190> our<00:03:47.280> shower<00:03:47.489> what<00:03:47.760> do<00:03:47.819> we<00:03:47.910> do

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
are in place on our shower what do we do

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.670 
are in place on our shower what do we do
to<00:03:48.269> keep<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.660> neat<00:03:48.810> water<00:03:49.079> from<00:03:49.290> coming<00:03:49.590> out

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
to keep a neat water from coming out

ever break one of these blocks it's got
to<00:04:18.660> be<00:04:18.720> easy<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.139> replace<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:20.070> truly<00:04:20.370> is

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
to be easy to replace it truly is

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.700 
to be easy to replace it truly is
Michael<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.329> simply<00:04:21.720> cut<00:04:21.930> away<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.259> sealant

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
Michael you simply cut away the sealant

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.650 
Michael you simply cut away the sealant
and<00:04:22.889> then<00:04:23.009> push<00:04:23.250> out<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.610> block<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.449> just

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
and then push out the block and you just

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.969 
and then push out the block and you just
knock<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.870> through<00:04:25.169> from<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.440> side<00:04:25.620> that's

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
knock it through from that side that's

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.180 
knock it through from that side that's
correct<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.900> like<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.139> with<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.830> boot<00:04:29.009> it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
correct I like that with the boot it

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.950 
correct I like that with the boot it
just<00:04:29.340> slides<00:04:29.580> out<00:04:29.759> you<00:04:30.210> need<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.389> new<00:04:30.570> boot<00:04:30.750> or

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
just slides out you need a new boot or

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.689 
just slides out you need a new boot or
can<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.199> reuse<00:04:31.349> this<00:04:31.650> no<00:04:31.889> you<00:04:31.949> can<00:04:32.160> reuse<00:04:32.340> that

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
can you reuse this no you can reuse that

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.610 
can you reuse this no you can reuse that
boot<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.389> replace<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.870> block<00:04:34.050> okay<00:04:34.380> now

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
boot and just replace the block okay now

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.900 
boot and just replace the block okay now
it<00:04:34.770> would<00:04:34.889> have<00:04:34.949> been<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.099> lot<00:04:35.340> more<00:04:35.490> trouble

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
it would have been a lot more trouble

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.860 
it would have been a lot more trouble
though<00:04:36.030> if<00:04:36.150> we<00:04:36.270> would<00:04:36.389> have<00:04:36.479> had<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.599> mortar

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
though if we would have had a mortar

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.450 
though if we would have had a mortar
system<00:04:37.050> what<00:04:37.410> absolutely<00:04:37.919> because<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.310> have

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
system what absolutely because you have

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.010 
system what absolutely because you have
to<00:04:38.550> tear<00:04:38.789> out<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.030> block<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.599> a<00:04:39.660> lot<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.870> times

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
to tear out the block and a lot of times

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.300 
to tear out the block and a lot of times
you'll<00:04:40.169> break<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.440> blocks<00:04:40.680> next<00:04:41.039> to<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:41.190> when

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
you'll break the blocks next to it when

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.950 
you'll break the blocks next to it when
you<00:04:41.370> do<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.610> process<00:04:41.849> I<00:04:42.360> like<00:04:42.599> this<00:04:42.750> one<00:04:42.900> a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
you do that process I like this one a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.279 
you do that process I like this one a
lot<00:04:43.080> better<00:04:44.750> well<00:04:45.750> Steve<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> looks<00:04:46.169> like

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
lot better well Steve it looks like

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.420 
lot better well Steve it looks like
there's<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.530> lot<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.710> different<00:04:46.979> patterns<00:04:47.160> and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
there's a lot of different patterns and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.430 
there's a lot of different patterns and
colors<00:04:47.520> also<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.120> choose<00:04:48.389> from<00:04:48.630> yes<00:04:49.259> they're

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
colors also to choose from yes they're

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.200 
colors also to choose from yes they're
ours<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.919> can<00:04:50.039> see<00:04:50.220> here<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.580> Solaris
