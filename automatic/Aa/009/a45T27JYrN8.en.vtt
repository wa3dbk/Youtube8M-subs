00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.280
 Hello Musashino acupuncture manipulative Kim Sung clinic 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:13.470
 It is Kimari 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:13.470
 This time I asked about the patient with chronic pancreatitis recently 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:26.430
 I would like to talk a little bit about chronic pancreatitis and carbonated drinks 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.360
 The other day the patient received a question like this 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.280
 I know that you should not drink a teacher or alcohol 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.530
 Say what has become of Tteyuu carbonated beverages 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.090
 I heard that 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 The person who is not drinking alcohol instead of alcohol 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.560
 beer 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.600
 The 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.620
 It looks like I was drinking so that kind of question 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.640
 Though I have been to me 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.649
 I'm not sure Nde is not when you leave I was beer of alcohol probably carbonate 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.150
 I think I think that is quite something 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.449
 To de you of carbonated beverages 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.010
 People with chronic pancreatitis 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.310
 We are a little I talk when the good of whether play drinking 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.310
 Yes 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.040
 Speaking of carbonation, is it 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.730
 At first it is this beer 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.730
 Because the feel is alcohol 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.180
 Course of chronic pancreatitis person to the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.180
 Do not drink 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:43.090
 The eel looks like shell and so on 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.090
 Though there are various carbonated drinks 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:54.850
 Recently, I'm doing good with carbonated water 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:56.590
 Break the carbonated water with something yeah it's so cool it is cut 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.229
 When you receive 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.229
 I listen to that kind of story 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:14.260
 As a result , it is not only beer but also Dan 's other carbonated drinks 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.640
 You should not drink 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.640
 It is and say why 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.470
 Carbonated Schwashwa 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.010
 This is it is it good to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.000
 Then I will go to Iwake Isupi Station 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.000
 I will start 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.060
 Though secretion of stomach fluid becomes strong 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.060
 Iejo is a strong acid 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 Because it is 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:54.480
 It is to try to let the individual in favor of that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:59.440
 Strong digestive enzymes is still + why I'm out the expectations I water station because the pancreas 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.720
 Nde it can not be in otherwise the strong acidic liquid 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.310
 For example Well 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.680
 Just like other sound symbols or duodenum 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.440
 If gastric juice gets in 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:19.650
 12 cities and towns is neutralized with I water station because that would bear the damage 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:24.450
 Who also ne chronic pancreatitis have but is distinguished service When this becomes so 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.910
 More than just raw 2 is selfishly burdened again and it becomes easy to get pain 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.330
 That's why 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.680
 Yes 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.680
 That's right 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:42.600
 When you drink carbonated beverages 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:45.660
 In order to neutralize it because the gastric juice tilts to full out to acidic 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.200
 Manufacturing will also release pancreatic juice 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.200
 If you do so, it will cause pain again 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:02.930
 Carbonated beverages may cause the symptoms of the house to be accelerated . 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:07.459
 Let's not produce 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.420
 What it a non-alcoholic beer if there is that you must go absolutely it in the evening of sake 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.420
 Say 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.280
 Or certainly but the feeling is I can see 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:23.780
 Well if you can 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.900
 A less irritating non- carbonated alcohol-free drink 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.020
 On the spot 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.249
 Spear Rio 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:36.539
 Please get used to it 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:36.539
 Thank you for watching until today's end
