00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:12.130
if you ask someone to name a remarkable
car chances are they'll mention a

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.870
Ferrari or Lamborghini those brands do
make special cars but argue that

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.190
toyota's prius is also remarkable
because it can comfortably carry five

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.280
adult passengers and get 50 miles per
gallon

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.000
it's been around in this form for five
years now but it's still an automotive

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.650
Marvel one of the smartest things turned
it did with the previous was given a

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.880
unique design which came about with the
second-generation car the hatchback

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.650
shape became synonymous with efficiency
and eco-friendliness and toyota sold a

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.920
ton of them with the third-generation
car we have here the styling was

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.960
sharpened a bit but the overall profile
stayed much the same as a practical side

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.360
to this look too though as the car has a
low drag coefficient of just . 25 so it

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.300
uses less energy to overcome wind
resistance

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.960
the thing I like about the prius is that
you don't have to change your driving

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.920
style to get great gas mileage is rated
at 50 miles per gallon combined

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.300
according to EPA estimates and during my
driving the trip computer was always

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.680
reading more than 50 miles per gallon
with efficiency like that you can really

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.030
put some time between stops at the gas
station while the previous is great at

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.560
saving gas it comes up short in other
areas road entire noise or bothersome

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.479
ride quality could be better in the eco
modes lethargic gas pedal is maddening

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.640
some efficient cars trade interior
roominess for great MPG but the previous

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.720
isn't one of them

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.900
the front of the cabin is roomy and it's
also easy to see out of one checking

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.860
your blind spots the bar separating the
upper and lower section of the rear

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.680
window is always visible in your
rear-view mirror which is a little

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.939
annoying but it doesn't significantly
restrict your views the prius is

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.180
sweeping futuristic dashboard is
starting to look a little dated

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.110
especially the green on black instrument
layout in the middle of it

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.830
I'm really surprised that Toyota hasn't
introduced a full-color read out because

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.659
they're becoming more commonplace and
make a big impact right here the

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.109
roominess story continues in the
backseat as the prius is large enough to

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.139
comfortably see two adults and three in
a pinch

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.690
it's comparable to what you'd find in a
midsize car

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.300
turned his own camry the cargo area
measures 21.6 cubic feet and the split

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.710
folding back seat is nicely executed
because it folds flat with the cargo

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.430
floor in the seats down but because of
the sloping hatchback roofline there's

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.140
less height to the cargo area that you'd
find a small crossover the previous

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.430
starts around $25,000 including the
destination charge and even though there

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.810
are subcompact cars that get good gas
mileage and midsize cars that offer

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.280
similar levels of interior space there's
not much else out there that combines

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.200
the interior room and fuel efficiency
that the prius does at this price it may

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.570
not turn heads like a Ferrari but it's
no less remarkable
