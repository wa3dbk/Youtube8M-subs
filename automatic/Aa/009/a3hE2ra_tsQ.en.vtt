about<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.610> world<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.180> he<00:01:48.510> thinks<00:01:48.540> about

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
about the world and he thinks about

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.240 
about the world and he thinks about
what's<00:01:49.050> going<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> world<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.010> then<00:01:50.159> he

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
what's going on in the world and then he

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.340
