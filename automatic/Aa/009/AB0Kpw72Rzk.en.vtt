00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.950
 for two years a triumph work 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.380
 hard to renew its range 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.050
 of motorcycles with new models like 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.270
 touring trophy where the maxi trail tiger 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.950
 explore but triumph in forget 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.700
 not so much his target heart 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.170
 to know the street triple that is skin 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.910
 new for 2013 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.670
 so if the street triple was started in 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.070
 2007 she received two brand new 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.140
 lighthouses in 2011 that did a lot 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.120
 talk ended the two little lighthouses have 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.179
 now these are double optics 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.640
 almond and therefore for 2013 against 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:52.039
 this new street tripple innovates on 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.170
 many elements triumphantly redone 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.269
 a bit the general line of the bike while 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.460
 new tank the arrival of news 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.519
 side scoops that reminds a little the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.019
 triple speed 1050 cubic centimeter is 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.309
 also a new 1 to of 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.369
 new parts and rear a saddle 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.740
 monobloc a rear shell reviewed with 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.399
 a new back loop that allowed 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.690
 to lighten the bike and especially 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.929
 the arrival of an exhaust in position 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.069
 low 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:21.080
 here the optional arrow model that has 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.950
 allowed to refocus the masses and 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 to lower the center of gravity 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.070
 so with the arrival of this new 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.800
 exhaust triumph has refair 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.140
 also its alloy swingarm 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.290
 of aluminum but it also allowed 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.310
 redo a little the geometry of the bike 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.250
 triumph wanted better motor skills 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.240
 an easier bike lighter 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 yet it was not a bike that 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.220
 lack and agility but triumph 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.760
 announced a full weight made in 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.190
 withdrawal of 6 kg novelty also for 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.020
 2013 the street triple of the model 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.700
 standard will be able to receive the optional BS 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.590
 for 2013 triumph did not upset the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.509
 motor with the arrival of the new 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.429
 exhaust placed in low position 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.079
 it was necessary to do a little work between 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.600
 intake and exhaust but the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.429
 base remains identical to the previous model 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.330
 so much better would one be tempted to say so 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.489
 the engine is successful against lyon has 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.799
 equipped with its strict ripoll optional of a 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.930
 shifter to be able to shift 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.629
 without needing to touch the lever 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.819
 clutch 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.620
 the street triple r will be available with 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.080
 a back loop painted in red 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.090
 and especially other suspensions more 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.549
 performing a cylinder damper 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.230
 separate fully adjustable the same 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.140
 for the fork the settings directly 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.299
 accessible at the top of the handlebar is at the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.530
 base of the fork and new 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.510
 radial brake calipers 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.349
 the reverse of the classic stirrups of the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.030
 street triple standard for 2013 ce 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.650
 triumph chose to take a small 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.360
 little risk to renew its 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.269
 strict ripoll that had remained almost 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.209
 unchanged since the beginning of his career 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.160
 with the new pot in a low position 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.230
 trion changes the look of his bike a little 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.849
 but he also counts on improving 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.099
 performance that will go through 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.440
 lowering the weight and so that 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.900
 will remain a very agile little roadster 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.849
 very strong then triumphs account 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.150
 enormously about the renewal of this 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.230
 model because it is undoubtedly one of 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.879
 his best sellers since these 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.440
 past years and we go very quickly 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.290
 learn how this behaves 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.269
 new triumph street triple because she 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.920
 spell had introduced early November is 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.639
 so very quickly to test on motorcycle 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.639
