I call it Cohen traps it's shaped like a
cone<00:00:17.740> on<00:00:18.009> both<00:00:18.700> ends<00:00:19.060> and<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.660> way<00:00:22.840> it<00:00:22.989> works

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
cone on both ends and the way it works

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.740 
cone on both ends and the way it works
is<00:00:23.619> I<00:00:24.989> open<00:00:25.989> this<00:00:26.140> up<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:28.720> right<00:00:29.320> in<00:00:29.470> there

so and I throws in the water

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.330 
so and I throws in the water
let's<00:00:35.110> latched<00:00:35.380> it<00:00:35.710> it<00:00:35.890> won't<00:00:36.040> come<00:00:36.220> loose

it's latched I'm going to throw in the
water<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.920> we're<00:00:39.070> hold<00:00:39.280> on<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.520> it<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.700> string

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
water and we're hold on to it the string

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.840 
water and we're hold on to it the string
I'm<00:00:40.060> going<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.240> tie<00:00:40.540> it<00:00:40.600> up<00:00:40.750> on<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.230> shore

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
I'm going to tie it up on the shore

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.360 
I'm going to tie it up on the shore
while<00:00:42.850> this<00:00:42.970> is<00:00:43.090> underwater<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.690> fish

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
while this is underwater the fish

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.470 
while this is underwater the fish
whatever<00:00:45.370> critters<00:00:45.850> in<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.060> water<00:00:46.240> are<00:00:46.420> going

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
whatever critters in the water are going

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.670 
whatever critters in the water are going
to<00:00:46.600> swim<00:00:46.930> into<00:00:47.470> this<00:00:48.220> cone<00:00:48.550> they're<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:50.620> to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
to swim into this cone they're going to

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.950 
to swim into this cone they're going to
go<00:00:50.800> inside<00:00:51.510> they're<00:00:52.510> not<00:00:52.660> going<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.810> be<00:00:52.900> able

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
go inside they're not going to be able

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.780 
go inside they're not going to be able
to<00:00:53.050> get<00:00:53.230> out<00:00:53.380> because<00:00:53.920> they<00:00:54.280> can't<00:00:54.520> find<00:00:54.640> the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
to get out because they can't find the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.400 
to get out because they can't find the
exit<00:00:55.090> because<00:00:55.210> exits<00:00:55.690> basically<00:00:55.989> floating<00:00:56.350> in

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
exit because exits basically floating in

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.250 
exit because exits basically floating in
the<00:00:56.470> middle<00:00:56.590> here<00:00:56.860> so<00:00:57.480> basically<00:00:58.480> once<00:00:59.020> they

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
the middle here so basically once they

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.840 
the middle here so basically once they
go<00:00:59.410> in<00:00:59.590> I<00:00:59.800> mean<00:01:00.040> it's<00:01:00.160> easy<00:01:00.280> enough<00:01:00.400> to<00:01:00.520> go<00:01:00.730> in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
go in I mean it's easy enough to go in

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.760 
go in I mean it's easy enough to go in
you<00:01:00.940> just<00:01:01.120> got<00:01:01.210> follow<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.899> cone<00:01:02.110> inwards<00:01:02.500> and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
you just got follow the cone inwards and

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.829 
you just got follow the cone inwards and
then<00:01:03.180> once<00:01:04.180> they're<00:01:04.360> inside<00:01:04.600> they're

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
then once they're inside they're

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.899 
then once they're inside they're
basically<00:01:05.170> too<00:01:06.070> stupid<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.490> find<00:01:06.610> their<00:01:06.820> way

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
basically too stupid to find their way

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.750 
basically too stupid to find their way
out<00:01:06.939> and<00:01:07.979> regardless<00:01:08.979> say<00:01:09.220> a<00:01:09.250> food<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.640> there

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
out and regardless say a food in there

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.130 
out and regardless say a food in there
so<00:01:10.000> they're<00:01:10.270> going<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.479> enjoy<00:01:10.690> their<00:01:10.840> time<00:01:10.870> in

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
so they're going to enjoy their time in

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.640 
so they're going to enjoy their time in
there<00:01:11.320> then<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.450> want<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.170> come<00:01:14.320> check<00:01:14.500> my

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
there then when I want to come check my

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.149 
there then when I want to come check my
trap<00:01:14.890> all<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.190> do<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.490> pull<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.820> rope<00:01:15.970> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
trap all I do is pull in the rope and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.840 
trap all I do is pull in the rope and
see<00:01:18.159> what<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.310> caught<00:01:18.490> all<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:21.400> guys<00:01:21.549> it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
see what I caught all right guys it's

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.110 
see what I caught all right guys it's
been<00:01:21.940> um<00:01:22.270> it's<00:01:22.930> been<00:01:23.049> about<00:01:23.229> two<00:01:23.500> days<00:01:23.820> since<00:01:24.820> I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
been um it's been about two days since I

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.050 
been um it's been about two days since I
put<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.630> cone<00:01:25.870> trap<00:01:26.140> in<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:27.430> right<00:01:27.820> there's

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
put the cone trap in but right there's

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.859 
put the cone trap in but right there's
micro<00:01:28.360> trap<00:01:28.690> at<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.110> end<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.470> line<00:01:29.620> and<00:01:29.860> I

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
micro trap at the end of the line and I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.320 
micro trap at the end of the line and I
tied<00:01:31.869> it<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.200> dock<00:01:32.350> right<00:01:32.560> there<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.270> I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
tied it to the dock right there so I

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.859 
tied it to the dock right there so I
mean<00:01:34.720> if<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.590> can<00:01:35.799> see<00:01:36.040> right<00:01:36.220> now<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.430> mean

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
mean if you can see right now I mean

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.180 
mean if you can see right now I mean
this<00:01:37.869> little<00:01:38.080> bluegill<00:01:38.290> swimming<00:01:38.799> around<00:01:38.979> it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
this little bluegill swimming around it

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.399 
this little bluegill swimming around it
so<00:01:39.369> I'm<00:01:39.640> assuming<00:01:40.119> there's<00:01:40.960> some<00:01:41.020> sort<00:01:41.350> of

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
so I'm assuming there's some sort of

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.770 
so I'm assuming there's some sort of
fish<00:01:41.560> in<00:01:41.710> there<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:42.330> mean<00:01:43.330> if<00:01:43.390> there's<00:01:43.540> fishing

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
fish in there I mean if there's fishing

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.060 
fish in there I mean if there's fishing
around<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.200> now<00:01:44.290> then<00:01:44.470> this<00:01:44.560> guy<00:01:44.710> be<00:01:44.890> fish

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
around it now then this guy be fish

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.560 
around it now then this guy be fish
inside<00:01:45.400> it's<00:01:45.760> been<00:01:45.909> in<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.090> water<00:01:46.180> for<00:01:46.420> two

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
inside it's been in the water for two

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:58.630 
inside it's been in the water for two
days<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.049> let's<00:01:47.260> see<00:01:48.159> what<00:01:48.280> we<00:01:48.369> got

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640

little fish will be this trap obviously
catches<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> little<00:02:09.180> fish<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:10.820> get<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.940> rock

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
catches a little fish so get the rock

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.050 
catches a little fish so get the rock
out<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.270> there<00:02:13.040> um<00:02:14.900> look<00:02:15.900> at<00:02:16.110> right<00:02:16.350> there

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
out of there um look at right there

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:26.320 
out of there um look at right there
that's<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.180> fish<00:02:19.820> see<00:02:23.420> looks<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> um<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
that's a fish see looks like a um a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.850 
that's a fish see looks like a um a
little<00:02:27.330> sunfish<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.050> some<00:02:28.230> sort<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.710> mean

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
little sunfish of some sort but I mean

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.770 
little sunfish of some sort but I mean
that's<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:29.940> proof<00:02:30.210> right<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.570> this

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
that's just proof right there that this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.740 
that's just proof right there that this
trap<00:02:31.020> does<00:02:31.230> work<00:02:31.440> um<00:02:32.240> unfortunately<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.690> only

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
trap does work um unfortunately I only

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.860 
trap does work um unfortunately I only
caught<00:02:34.080> one<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:35.360> usually<00:02:36.360> catch<00:02:36.510> more<00:02:36.750> than

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
caught one but usually catch more than

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.930 
caught one but usually catch more than
that<00:02:37.020> but<00:02:37.280> yeah<00:02:38.280> that's<00:02:38.430> proof

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that but yeah that's proof

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.910 
that but yeah that's proof
so<00:02:39.240> these<00:02:39.450> cone<00:02:39.690> traps<00:02:39.960> do<00:02:40.170> work<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.620> mean<00:02:40.770> if

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
so these cone traps do work I mean if

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.550 
so these cone traps do work I mean if
you<00:02:41.040> put<00:02:41.070> them<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> swamp<00:02:42.020> you're<00:02:43.020> bound<00:02:43.440> to

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
you put them in a swamp you're bound to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.690 
you put them in a swamp you're bound to
catch<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.890> lot<00:02:44.010> more<00:02:44.160> there's<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> lot<00:02:44.460> more

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
catch a lot more there's a lot more

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030 
catch a lot more there's a lot more
small<00:02:45.260> wildlife<00:02:46.260> from<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> swamp<00:02:46.770> in<00:02:46.920> there
