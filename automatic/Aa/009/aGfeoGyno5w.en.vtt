00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:09.007
 x with 

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:35.034
 White snow gray ice 

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:38.071
 On cracked earth 

00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:43.120
 Quilt patchwork on her 

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.000
 City in the road loop 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.097
 Clouds float above the city 

00:00:51.097 --> 00:00:55.000
 Closing heavenly light 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.000
 Yellow smoke over the city 

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.000
 The city is two thousand years old 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.515
 Lived under the light of a star 

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:10.000
 By the name of the Sun 

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:25.006
 Today we will analyze the song 

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:30.100
 Viktor Tsoi Cinema group called Star named Sun 

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.074
 I already played the verse 

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:36.101
 Here what chords are present 

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:42.007
 A minor am 

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:43.024
 C major 

00:01:43.087 --> 00:01:44.164
 or "C" 

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:49.132
 D Minor or Dm 

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.149
 G major 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.092
 Or G is also called this chord 

00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:58.111
 Well again D minor 

00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:04.059
 Here it is. Fight is played 

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:06.123
 Thus, by the way, you can take the barre 

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:10.942
 You can take here simple chords 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:16.223
 You can take La, Do, D, Salt ... 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:23.889
 It is played like this fight 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.590
 You hold down, up 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.278
 And down the stub 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 that is, you repeat down two times up 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.041
 And between them one more time up 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.239
 I will show you slowly again 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.006
 Play 

00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:24.006
 A minor take bet and play 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:36.049
 All twice 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.655
 I apologize for the frustrated guitar 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:50.440
 Now I will not tune it, so as not to waste time 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:51.568
 So ... 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.868
 Chords again, go around the circle 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:57.296
 White snow 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.992
 Gray ice 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.026
 On cracked earth 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.811
 Patchwork Blanket 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.670
 On her 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.960
 City in the road loop 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:22.000
 Clouds float above the city 

00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:28.897
 Closing heavenly light 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.800
 Yellow smoke over the city 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.858
 The city is two thousand years old 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:48.569
 Living under the light of a star named Sun 

00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:54.096
 Now proceed to the loss between the couplets 

00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:56.543
 From the very beginning 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.669
 What is the loss or entry 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.684
 Chord D minor or Dm. Same as this chord 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.061
 only on barre. 

00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:06.900
 It is taken as follows 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.464
 Put your index finger 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.696
 On the fifth fret, press the whole fret 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.027
 then put the middle finger 

00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:18.946
 on the sixth fret on the second string 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:23.191
 Then you put your little finger on the third string and ... 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.036
 Ring finger put on the fourth string 

00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:31.435
 on the seventh fret 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.777
 The fight remains the same 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.998
 Only without a stub already 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:43.542
 If you drowned here 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:49.068
 There is no need to lose here 

00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:52.207
 Playing ... 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:57.004
 And when you pick up the second time 

00:05:57.004 --> 00:06:00.633
 Then on the bottom and let go of your finger. 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:02.027
 To the top 

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:09.027
 this let go 

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:26.527
 You just play down-up, down-up, 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.374
 Down up. 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:31.870
 And at the same time at each time, here you are down 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.900
 do 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:38.171
 Once lost without down-up 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:39.952
 Without finger 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:46.342
 Losing just 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.641
 And here you start 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:52.707
 For every movement you have to pinch your finger 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:55.053
 Specific string 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:56.874
 In this case it is 

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.497
 The little finger pinches the first string on the eighth fret 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:06.036
 Then let go 

00:07:06.036 --> 00:07:07.685
 Then let go 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.053
 The second string on the sixth fret 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:13.482
 We clamp it again 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.792
 Then we pin the little finger on the eighth fret 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:23.909
 First string 

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:41.050
 note with
