00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.760
 Hey guys, right virtue 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.980
 our painting series there I have refined 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.400
 the touches here are much more localized 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.619
 Alright, I left it with a fine sandpaper. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.369
 punctually at the points where I had 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.169
 exposure of the mass and applied the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.369
 beauty ink 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:35.700
 trying to show and from different angles 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.700
 that you see overspray in this region 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 already knows how to spend the finger already shots by 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.789
 spray what beauty 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:50.519
 the retouch is well located even 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:52.829
 right in the parachute has other points that 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.899
 I returned 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.760
 this machine that I think this 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.620
 hard to catch but I replied right 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 had a background exposure here as well 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.519
 Light 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.280
 It gives only to notice the black merss not 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.340
 be sure to pick up the feminine 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 I had a few stone balls 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.200
 here it is 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.579
 good people are here with the result 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.979
 At the end of my painting, I did some 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.830
 dots here 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.299
 here's a point I made a book 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:42.229
 stone beat painting 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.250
 Okay, this speck here has a micro 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:49.759
 waist 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.979
 just above him here this machine has 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.569
 another point of micro painting but is 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:01.190
 It's difficult for me to show you here. 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:04.310
 There's a tap of rock that I 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.069
 I said that I was at the end of the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.950
 smell a can but it was in the background 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:12.920
 was the tone in the background here is right 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.130
 here is one more dot that was made 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.130
 also 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.859
 is 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.189
 one more point that was made the same 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:32.769
 painting was also the same situation 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:32.769
 on the other and is a fan 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.579
 here I had a place that had arrived 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:48.579
 in the bottom of the can can I get it 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:48.579
 I had arrived at night here 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.310
 finally after years of bus inserÃ£ 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.049
 giving them a polish in that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.790
 which may not give due 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.760
 Attention to this machine I was almost 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.760
 reaching deep in that area that beauty 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.970
 ae 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.080
 good the stone hits always appear 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.640
 Ok, you can see from far away 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.060
 stone bass 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 It's something that I've done here is 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.950
 title of availing the service was 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.170
 with her in the same ready and I knew 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.489
 enjoy it to make all the points 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.080
 an entire book I had in his 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.080
 ask what beauty 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.430
 eventually white gives a difference 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.280
 to cut 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.680
 although ink has been set ink is 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.450
 that are in your car and 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.450
 gives a difference of cut right 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.000
 is here 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.299
 The point that most upset people 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.540
 I had to tell you very big that 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.720
 had another strong risk here 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:32.580
 here in this area that had another okay 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:38.610
 that underneath is also in that second 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.320
 application solve the problem you could 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.100
 have solved in the first rain had 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.250
 Wrong, did not you? 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:53.970
 I had not done more than 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:56.130
 should the tac with the look to buy 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.370
 light a sun anyway you'll get some 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.470
 difference here is right is white still 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.780
 more in this area that you hardly 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.750
 will hit paint in a way that 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.760
 you have a complete leveling of the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.860
 surface has completely eliminated 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.990
 defects in doing a retouch is because it is 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.290
 hard you inlude ink with hero 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.290
 OK 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.949
 the difference of tonality I spoke to 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.879
 You guys that really happens happens. 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:40.909
 a bit ok but depending on the size of the 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:45.759
 retouching the risk of how it is there in 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.759
 area is very subtle right 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:56.469
 from a distance you do not realize a good 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:58.819
 food always manual tapa tapa sun is 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.500
 using the trash if necessary to 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.819
 remove once I will have another as I already 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.860
 I have shown earlier is what is the 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.189
 scene that I tell you in the videos here 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.069
 that be okay here I use plus 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:16.069
 painting for me has a 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.180
 mild and in the area of beauty and 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.360
 mainly for me is a reference 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.339
 water it has in its composition has 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.469
 some cleaning agents then she already 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:30.169
 help in cleaning the part after using the 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:34.009
 mass of politics the mass of politics 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:37.039
 I use the same brand name, I do not want 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:39.680
 make apology brand but is the best 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.599
 brand already worked manually 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:46.689
 I did not work with the machine yet 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:52.099
 I do not know if I will work the hit because 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:54.189
 uses different mechanisms to 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:56.750
 chance to clean the part is 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:58.189
 always changing their own support 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.649
 movement 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.779
 eventually a taco the other judges 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:04.189
 required 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:06.919
 This is it, I hope you guys have 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:09.680
 Did you like the series there? 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:14.870
 I liked it, I took time to post the video 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.520
 Right, and I'm staying here if 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:20.199
