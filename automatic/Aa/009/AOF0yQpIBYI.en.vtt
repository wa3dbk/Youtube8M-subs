00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.820 

I<00:00:02.800> don't<00:00:03.400> think<00:00:03.460> so<00:00:04.620> especially<00:00:05.620> for<00:00:05.800> a

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:05.830 
I don't think so especially for a

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.740 
I don't think so especially for a
pitcher

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 
pitcher

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:26.380 
pitcher
every<00:00:08.750> time<00:00:08.960> should

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:40.549 

it's<00:00:27.390> always<00:00:27.539> nice<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:39.410> was<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it's always nice but I think was there a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.470 
it's always nice but I think was there a
point<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.890> came<00:00:41.040> where<00:00:41.220> you<00:00:41.339> didn't<00:00:41.910> think<00:00:42.030> 9

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
point that came where you didn't think 9

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.640 
point that came where you didn't think 9
was<00:00:42.690> gonna<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.930> possible<00:00:43.080> you<00:00:43.290> had<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
was gonna be possible you had a lot of

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.200 
was gonna be possible you had a lot of
pitches<00:00:43.920> through<00:00:44.220> 5<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:46.760> how<00:00:47.760> important<00:00:48.120> was

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
pitches through 5 and how important was

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.100 
pitches through 5 and how important was
that<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.600> -<00:00:48.720> yeah<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.220> it's<00:00:51.079> one<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that to you - yeah you know it's one of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:07.820 
that to you - yeah you know it's one of
those<00:00:52.199> things<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:06.290> put<00:01:07.290> myself<00:01:07.439> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
those things you know put myself in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.550 
those things you know put myself in
tough<00:01:08.040> count<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.810> there<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.260> bit<00:01:10.439> of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
tough count so there was a little bit of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.910 
tough count so there was a little bit of
both<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.920> as

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
both but you know I think you just go as

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.910 
both but you know I think you just go as
long<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.760> regardless<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.920> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
long as you can go regardless and it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.670 
long as you can go regardless and it
just<00:01:17.130> happened<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> work<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.150> once

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
just happened to work out you know once

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.740 
just happened to work out you know once
got<00:01:19.680> cut<00:01:20.189> into<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> six<00:01:20.880> things<00:01:21.210> sped<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
got cut into the six things sped up a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.700 
got cut into the six things sped up a
little<00:01:21.900> bit<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.470> six<00:01:25.470> runs

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little bit and you know the six runs

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.200 
little bit and you know the six runs
makes<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> lot<00:01:26.400> easier<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
makes it a lot easier to go off the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.779 
makes it a lot easier to go off the
aggressive<00:01:27.630> let<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> good<00:01:27.990> fall<00:01:28.579> take<00:01:29.579> your

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
aggressive let a good fall take your

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.110 
aggressive let a good fall take your
chances

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
chances

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.210 
chances
you<00:01:32.900> know<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.200> definitely<00:01:33.380> conscious<00:01:34.070> it

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
you know you definitely conscious it

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.600 
you know you definitely conscious it
you're<00:01:34.340> throwing<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.610> lot<00:01:34.760> of<00:01:34.790> pitches<00:01:34.970> but<00:01:35.420> I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
you're throwing a lot of pitches but I

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:52.890 
you're throwing a lot of pitches but I
think<00:01:37.610> your<00:01:37.730> jobs<00:01:39.310> possible<00:01:51.520> quickly<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.550> mean

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
think your jobs possible quickly I mean

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:04.890 
think your jobs possible quickly I mean
that's<00:01:53.900> played<00:01:54.200> up<00:01:54.380> too<00:01:54.560> much<00:01:54.770> at<00:01:54.950> times

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.450 

you're<00:02:05.900> pitching<00:02:06.680> out<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:06.950> trouble<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.430> whole

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
you're pitching out of trouble the whole

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.570 
you're pitching out of trouble the whole
time<00:02:08.350> you<00:02:09.350> know<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.500> think<00:02:09.619> those<00:02:09.950> games<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.460> be

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
time you know I think those games can be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.040 
time you know I think those games can be
a<00:02:10.610> little<00:02:10.820> more<00:02:10.910> taxing<00:02:11.420> sometimes<00:02:11.840> when

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
a little more taxing sometimes when

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.360 
a little more taxing sometimes when
you're<00:02:12.200> baserunners<00:02:12.710> all<00:02:12.830> over<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.130> place

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
you're baserunners all over the place

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.480 
you're baserunners all over the place
and<00:02:13.670> you're<00:02:14.600> counseling<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:16.010> know<00:02:16.040> making

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
and you're counseling you know making

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.640 
and you're counseling you know making
big<00:02:17.060> pitches<00:02:22.210> but

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
big pitches but

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.780 
big pitches but
you<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.739> kind<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.040> how<00:02:25.189> you<00:02:25.250> got<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.670> those

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
you know kind of how you got to those

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.559 
you know kind of how you got to those
numbers<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.799> think<00:02:27.799> is<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:29.030> something<00:02:29.420> that's

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
numbers I think is was something that's

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.649 
numbers I think is was something that's
taken<00:02:30.019> into<00:02:30.290> into<00:02:30.799> account<00:02:31.099> but<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:33.310> chance<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
taken into into account but a chance to

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.259 
taken into into account but a chance to
keep<00:02:35.659> them<00:02:35.870> felt<00:02:36.739> good<00:02:36.859> it<00:02:37.069> felt<00:02:37.189> like<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.879> had

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
keep them felt good it felt like I had

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:52.360 
keep them felt good it felt like I had
the<00:02:38.420> chance<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.719> be<00:02:38.840> aggressive<00:02:50.859> yeah<00:02:51.859> I<00:02:51.889> think

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
the chance to be aggressive yeah I think

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.470 
the chance to be aggressive yeah I think
you<00:02:52.459> look<00:02:52.609> forward<00:02:52.909> to<00:02:52.969> going<00:02:53.120> out<00:02:53.269> there

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
you look forward to going out there

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.129 
you look forward to going out there
every<00:02:53.750> five<00:02:54.650> regardless<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.870> know<00:02:56.989> my

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
every five regardless you know my

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.690 
every five regardless you know my
preference<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:57.829> always<00:02:58.129> keep<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.430> winning

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
preference is to always keep a winning

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.250 
preference is to always keep a winning
streak<00:02:59.170> impossible<00:03:00.170> but<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:02.109> know<00:03:03.109> I<00:03:03.139> think

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
streak impossible but you know I think

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.280 
streak impossible but you know I think
to<00:03:04.540> be<00:03:05.540> able<00:03:05.629> to<00:03:05.720> go<00:03:05.870> out

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
to be able to go out

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.709 
to be able to go out
you<00:03:07.709> know<00:03:07.829> seems<00:03:08.099> like<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> lot<00:03:08.610> lately<00:03:09.090> we've

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
you know seems like a lot lately we've

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.530 
you know seems like a lot lately we've
kind<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:09.959> been<00:03:10.110> playing<00:03:10.260> from<00:03:10.590> behind<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.540> it's

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
kind of been playing from behind so it's

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.899 
kind of been playing from behind so it's
important<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.189> try<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:14.340> minimize<00:03:14.549> as<00:03:14.879> much

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
important to try and minimize as much

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.149 
important to try and minimize as much
that<00:03:15.359> could<00:03:15.540> give<00:03:15.959> us<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.109> chance<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.530> kind<00:03:17.129> of

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
that could give us a chance to kind of

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:34.970 
that could give us a chance to kind of
get<00:03:17.280> into<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.549> game<00:03:33.500> did<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.530> feel<00:03:34.769> like<00:03:34.889> you

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
get into the game did you feel like you

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:44.630 
get into the game did you feel like you
got<00:03:35.099> stronger<00:03:35.459> as<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.819> game<00:03:35.849> wore<00:03:36.180> on

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:04:07.010 

I<00:03:45.080> think<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.170> always<00:03:46.290> feel<00:03:46.560> strong<00:04:05.720> as<00:04:06.720> far<00:04:06.930> as

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
I think you always feel strong as far as

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.199 
I think you always feel strong as far as
how<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.200> feel<00:04:07.440> strength-wise

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209
