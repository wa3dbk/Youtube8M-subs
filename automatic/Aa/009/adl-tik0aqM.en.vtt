00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
after he was released from the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.840 
after he was released from the
internment<00:02:08.899> into<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.770> American<00:02:10.250> army<00:02:10.580> yeah

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
internment into the American army yeah

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.630 
internment into the American army yeah
yeah<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.480> he<00:02:11.870> served<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.380> Europe<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.890> went<00:02:13.490> on

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
yeah and he served in Europe and went on

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.250 
yeah and he served in Europe and went on
to<00:02:13.850> be<00:02:14.000> kid<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.480> get<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.660> doctorate<00:02:15.080> in

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
to be kid to get a doctorate in

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.930 
to be kid to get a doctorate in
chemistry<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.920> think<00:02:16.160> became<00:02:16.460> a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
chemistry and I think became a

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.880 
chemistry and I think became a
college<00:02:17.150> professor<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.780> chemistry<00:02:18.080> yeah<00:02:18.650> so

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
college professor in chemistry yeah so

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.410 
college professor in chemistry yeah so
this<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.070> obviously<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.910> ceremonial

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
this is obviously just a ceremonial

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.150 
this is obviously just a ceremonial
thing<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:20.840> really<00:02:21.110> cool<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.010> said

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
thing but really cool and like you said

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.720 
thing but really cool and like you said
it<00:02:22.310> involves<00:02:22.790> our<00:02:22.910> episode<00:02:23.420> where

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
it involves our episode where

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.770 
it involves our episode where
japanese-americans<00:02:25.730> forced<00:02:26.450> into

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
japanese-americans forced into

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.480 
japanese-americans forced into
internment<00:02:27.320> camps<00:02:27.650> yeah<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.010> think<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
internment camps yeah I think is the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.450 
internment camps yeah I think is the
title<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.180> answer<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.450> yes<00:02:29.660> yeah<00:02:30.460> spoiler

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
title and the answer is yes yeah spoiler

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.000 
title and the answer is yes yeah spoiler
alert<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:33.140> what<00:02:33.290> else<00:02:33.410> do<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:33.530> have<00:02:33.740> this<00:02:33.830> week

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
alert so what else do we have this week

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.190 
alert so what else do we have this week
oh<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.430> know<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.730> had<00:02:34.940> something<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:36.050> did

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
oh I know you had something on we did

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.460 
oh I know you had something on we did
our<00:02:36.320> show<00:02:36.530> recently<00:02:36.770> on<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:38.180> Mo's<00:02:38.780> project<00:02:39.350> in

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
our show recently on the Mo's project in

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.100 
our show recently on the Mo's project in
Venice<00:02:39.770> yeah<00:02:40.520> with<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> idea<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.480> Venice<00:02:41.960> is

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
Venice yeah with the idea is Venice is

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.200 
Venice yeah with the idea is Venice is
flooding<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:42.890> sinking<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.880> they<00:02:44.000> built

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
flooding and it's sinking so they built

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.300 
flooding and it's sinking so they built
these<00:02:44.330> big<00:02:44.600> gates<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.260> shut<00:02:45.680> off<00:02:45.710> high<00:02:46.040> tide

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
these big gates that shut off high tide

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.970 
these big gates that shut off high tide
essentially<00:02:46.940> saving<00:02:47.630> Venice<00:02:48.050> on<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.590> daily

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
essentially saving Venice on a daily

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.790 
essentially saving Venice on a daily
basis<00:02:49.370> right<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.960> segment<00:02:51.170> by<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.560> way

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
basis right in this segment by the way

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.160 
basis right in this segment by the way
is<00:02:52.070> called<00:02:52.540> stuck<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.720> should<00:02:53.990> know

is called stuck you should know

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.880 
is called stuck you should know
prescient<00:02:56.080> because<00:02:57.080> sometimes<00:02:57.590> we<00:02:57.740> talk

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
about things and the next day it'll be

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.510 
about things and the next day it'll be
in<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.200> news<00:03:00.380> right<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.280> that's<00:03:01.430> what

in the news right and that's what
happened<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.850> this<00:03:01.940> case<00:03:02.120> literally<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.200> next

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
happened in this case literally the next

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.100 
happened in this case literally the next
day<00:03:03.560> yeah<00:03:03.890> we<00:03:04.340> talked<00:03:04.640> about<00:03:04.790> Venice<00:03:05.330> first<00:03:06.020> of

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
day yeah we talked about Venice first of

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.390 
day yeah we talked about Venice first of
all<00:03:06.170> we<00:03:06.260> should<00:03:06.290> probably<00:03:06.560> say<00:03:06.800> we're<00:03:07.220> well

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
fine it felt self it does feel south

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.360 
fine it felt self it does feel south
yeah<00:03:14.660> right<00:03:15.020> but<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:15.740> project<00:03:16.250> this

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
yeah right but with this project this

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.000 
yeah right but with this project this
multi-billion<00:03:17.210> dollar<00:03:17.600> project<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:18.770> were

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
multi-billion dollar project we were

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.010 
multi-billion dollar project we were
like<00:03:19.190> well<00:03:19.430> there's<00:03:20.060> got<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.420> be<00:03:20.450> some<00:03:20.750> sort<00:03:20.870> of
