reading in an interview online that
Professor<00:05:09.280> wanted<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.210> make<00:05:10.419> this<00:05:10.690> DLC<00:05:11.380> very

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
Professor wanted to make this DLC very

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.000 
Professor wanted to make this DLC very
substantial<00:05:13.000> very<00:05:13.389> big<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:14.260> equivalent<00:05:14.830> to

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
substantial very big the equivalent to

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.670 
substantial very big the equivalent to
what<00:05:15.220> we<00:05:15.820> would<00:05:16.090> consider<00:05:16.270> an<00:05:16.720> expansion<00:05:17.440> pack

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
what we would consider an expansion pack

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.820 
what we would consider an expansion pack
for<00:05:17.710> other<00:05:18.070> games<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:19.260> I<00:05:20.260> commend<00:05:20.590> them<00:05:20.800> for

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
for other games and I commend them for

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.740 
for other games and I commend them for
doing<00:05:21.190> this<00:05:21.490> rather<00:05:22.030> than<00:05:22.180> bringing<00:05:22.450> out<00:05:22.600> an

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
doing this rather than bringing out an

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.570 
doing this rather than bringing out an
expansion<00:05:23.320> pack<00:05:23.350> they've<00:05:23.770> made<00:05:23.979> it<00:05:24.010> DLC

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
expansion pack they've made it DLC

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.430 
expansion pack they've made it DLC
obviously<00:05:25.360> this<00:05:25.510> explains<00:05:26.020> why<00:05:26.169> it's<00:05:26.380> a

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
obviously this explains why it's a

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.100 
obviously this explains why it's a
little<00:05:26.680> bit<00:05:26.830> expensive<00:05:27.220> but<00:05:27.639> then<00:05:28.539> again<00:05:28.630> it's

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
little bit expensive but then again it's

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.339 
little bit expensive but then again it's
not<00:05:29.380> that<00:05:29.590> expensive<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.990> probably<00:05:31.990> for<00:05:32.080> what

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
not that expensive and probably for what

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.870 
not that expensive and probably for what
we're<00:05:32.500> getting<00:05:32.680> it's<00:05:33.099> going<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.400> be<00:05:33.490> worth<00:05:33.669> the

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
we're getting it's going to be worth the

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.940 
we're getting it's going to be worth the
money<00:05:34.030> so<00:05:34.599> I<00:05:34.630> can't<00:05:35.110> wait<00:05:35.260> to<00:05:35.289> get<00:05:35.470> my<00:05:35.620> hands<00:05:35.800> on

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
money so I can't wait to get my hands on

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.529 
money so I can't wait to get my hands on
it<00:05:36.010> in<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.669> meantime<00:05:36.849> I'm<00:05:37.210> probably<00:05:37.389> gonna
