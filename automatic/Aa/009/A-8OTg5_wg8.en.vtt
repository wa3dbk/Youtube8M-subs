00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
what is up guys I am back with another

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.860 
what is up guys I am back with another
video<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.490> basically<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.420> about<00:00:12.630> new

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
video and basically this is about new

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.200 
video and basically this is about new
tf2<00:00:13.380> engineer<00:00:14.040> building<00:00:14.400> ideas<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.059> people

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
tf2 engineer building ideas that people

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.359 
tf2 engineer building ideas that people
have<00:00:15.450> put<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> workshop<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:17.100> think

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
have put in the workshop and I think

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.010 
have put in the workshop and I think
that<00:00:17.760> are<00:00:17.850> awesome<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.600> think<00:00:18.869> could

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that are awesome that I think could

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
that are awesome that I think could
because<00:00:19.350> they<00:00:19.590> were<00:00:19.650> entered<00:00:20.189> into<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> game

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
because they were entered into the game

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.460 
because they were entered into the game
obviously<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.539> there<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.810> sort<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.050> made<00:00:22.260> more

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
obviously if there was sort of made more

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.019 
obviously if there was sort of made more
balanced<00:00:23.039> well<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.369> least<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.730> know<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:23.939> they

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
balanced well at least you know if they

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.210 
balanced well at least you know if they
put<00:00:24.060> me<00:00:24.300> into<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> game<00:00:24.630> it'd<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.900> awesome<00:00:25.350> so

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
put me into the game it'd be awesome so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.769 
put me into the game it'd be awesome so
the<00:00:26.310> first<00:00:26.550> first<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.210> want<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> talk<00:00:27.660> about

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the first first one I want to talk about

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.370 
the first first one I want to talk about
is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.640> sentry<00:00:29.640> gun<00:00:29.670> suction<00:00:30.330> cup<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.260> this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
is the sentry gun suction cup so this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.840 
is the sentry gun suction cup so this
the<00:00:31.590> creators<00:00:31.920> reason<00:00:32.250> behind<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.669> was

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the creators reason behind this was

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.690 
the creators reason behind this was
basically<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.710> normal<00:00:35.040> century<00:00:35.430> spots

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
basically so the normal century spots

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.830 
basically so the normal century spots
have<00:00:35.820> become<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.360> obvious<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
have become really obvious and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.060 
have become really obvious and
predictable<00:00:37.320> everyone<00:00:37.649> knows<00:00:37.860> where

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
predictable everyone knows where

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.150 
predictable everyone knows where
essential<00:00:38.430> nest<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.730> gonna<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
essential nest is gonna be so with of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790 
essential nest is gonna be so with of
the<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> suction<00:00:42.420> cup<00:00:42.629> century<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.680> can

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the the suction cup century you can

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.170 
the the suction cup century you can
place<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> side<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> walls<00:00:44.940> in

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
place it on the side of the walls in

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.910 
place it on the side of the walls in
different<00:00:45.539> places<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.770> just

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
different places so it's just it's just

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
different places so it's just it's just
harder<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.250> predict<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.879> thought<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.660> an

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
harder to predict I thought that was an

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
harder to predict I thought that was an
awesome<00:00:49.050> idea<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.980> mean<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.370> can't<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.879> him<00:00:51.000> make

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
awesome idea I mean I can't see him make

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
awesome idea I mean I can't see him make
making<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.079> overpowered<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.219> only

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
making them really overpowered the only

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.889 
making them really overpowered the only
problem<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.730> spies<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.600> hardest<00:00:54.870> for

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
problem is spies but the hardest for

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
problem is spies but the hardest for
spice<00:00:55.199> exactly<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.829> guess<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.730> maybe<00:00:56.879> also

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
spice exactly my guess but maybe also

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.939 
spice exactly my guess but maybe also
you<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.989> could<00:00:58.109> implement<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.649> weapon

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you know they could implement a weapon

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.830 
you know they could implement a weapon
that<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.100> spy<00:00:59.430> could<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.180> could<00:01:00.329> there

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that a spy could use that could there

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.549 
that a spy could use that could there
was<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> things<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:01.949> far<00:01:02.219> away<00:01:02.899> when<00:01:03.899> if

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
was that things I from far away when if

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
was that things I from far away when if
it<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> suction<00:01:05.460> cup<00:01:05.700> century<00:01:06.090> or

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it is like a suction cup century or

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.370 
it is like a suction cup century or
something<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.140> could<00:01:07.290> be

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
something like that so it could be

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
something like that so it could be
counteracted<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.250> easy<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:08.790> it'd<00:01:09.060> be

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
counteracted really easy I think it'd be

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
counteracted really easy I think it'd be
awesome<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.510> put<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> game<00:01:10.580> yeah<00:01:11.580> I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
awesome to put in the game yeah I

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.039 
awesome to put in the game yeah I
thought<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> was<00:01:12.299> awesome<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.720> created

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
thought I was awesome that was created

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.320 
thought I was awesome that was created
by<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> guy<00:01:13.409> called<00:01:13.439> mad<00:01:13.950> meatball<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.850> it's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
by a guy called mad meatball and it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.910 
by a guy called mad meatball and it's
one<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.570> favorite<00:01:15.900> ideas<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.470> far<00:01:16.740> because

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
one of my favorite ideas so far because

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
one of my favorite ideas so far because
it<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.729> true<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.030> everyone<00:01:18.689> knows<00:01:18.869> where

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it is so true like everyone knows where

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.719 
it is so true like everyone knows where
centralist<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.830> gonna<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> map<00:01:20.580> they

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
centralist is gonna be on a map they

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.200 
centralist is gonna be on a map they
play<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.650> give<00:01:23.159> give<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.909> sort<00:01:24.180> of

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
play so I just give give this sort of

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.240 
play so I just give give this sort of
engineer<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.110> options<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.770> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
engineer more options and I think I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.850 
engineer more options and I think I
think<00:01:26.340> that'd<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.670> called<00:01:27.060> put<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> game

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
think that'd be called put in the game

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.929 
think that'd be called put in the game
and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> second<00:01:29.310> favorite<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.759> that

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and the second favorite one like that

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.719 
and the second favorite one like that
found<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> mini<00:01:31.049> dispenser<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
found so it was a mini dispenser so this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
found so it was a mini dispenser so this
is<00:01:32.850> basically<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> Spencer<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> deployed

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
is basically the Spencer that deployed

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
is basically the Spencer that deployed
quickly<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> battlefield<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
quickly on there on the battlefield so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
quickly on there on the battlefield so
you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.329> get<00:01:36.479> sort<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.720> health<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> your

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you can get sort of health to you your

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
you can get sort of health to you your
team<00:01:38.189> players<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.090> downside<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.689> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
team players the downside of this it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.319 
team players the downside of this it
also<00:01:39.990> takes<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.470> weapon<00:01:40.829> slot<00:01:41.070> off<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.369> well<00:01:41.549> so

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
also takes a weapon slot off as well so

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.870 
also takes a weapon slot off as well so
you<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.100> maybe<00:01:44.220> chakra

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you know you have to take maybe chakra

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.280 
you know you have to take maybe chakra
or<00:01:45.030> something<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
or something like that out or then you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980 
or something like that out or then you
get<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> mini<00:01:46.680> dispenser<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.490> think<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
get a mini dispenser I think this is a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.139 
get a mini dispenser I think this is a
pretty<00:01:49.229> awesome<00:01:49.439> idea<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> -<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.000> only

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
pretty awesome idea to - the only

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.350 
pretty awesome idea to - the only
problem<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> action<00:01:52.350> sources<00:01:53.360> engine

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
problem with the action sources engine

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.660 
problem with the action sources engine
is<00:01:54.479> spamming<00:01:54.930> them<00:01:55.110> down<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.950> they're

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
is spamming them down it like they're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
is spamming them down it like they're
not<00:01:56.759> being<00:01:56.939> much<00:01:57.600> metal<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.770> sort<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:58.979> put

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
not being much metal to just sort of put

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.130 
not being much metal to just sort of put
them<00:01:59.310> down<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.790> they<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.049> go

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
them down and they can be they can go

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
them down and they can be they can go
back<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> sort<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:04.729> where<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.939> ammo

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
back to sort of the where you get ammo

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.850 
back to sort of the where you get ammo
from<00:02:06.329> at<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.600> start<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.500> deploy

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
from at the start and just just deploy

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.410 
from at the start and just just deploy
it<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.190> way<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.489> keep<00:02:08.789> doing<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> which<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
it that way and keep doing it which I

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
it that way and keep doing it which I
think<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.899> could<00:02:10.170> possibly<00:02:10.410> be<00:02:10.709> overpowered

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
think it could possibly be overpowered

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.880 
think it could possibly be overpowered
if<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.330> was<00:02:12.420> some<00:02:12.569> way<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.750> limit<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.349> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
if there was some way to limit that and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.640 
if there was some way to limit that and
the<00:02:14.160> actual<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.880> like<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.020> amount<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.319> can<00:02:16.440> put

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
the actual I like the amount you can put

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.930 
the actual I like the amount you can put
down<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.069> I'd<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.460> awesome<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:17.819> they

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
down I think I'd be awesome if they

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.030 
down I think I'd be awesome if they
actually<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:19.020> know<00:02:19.140> put<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.470> into<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.800> game

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
actually you know put that into the game

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.640 
actually you know put that into the game
the<00:02:21.030> final<00:02:21.240> engineer<00:02:21.780> building<00:02:22.260> there's<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> be

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the final engineer building there's a be

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.020 
the final engineer building there's a be
around<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.010> somewhere<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:23.580> really<00:02:23.790> made

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
around here somewhere it's really made

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.449 
around here somewhere it's really made
me<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:25.080> final<00:02:25.410> engineering<00:02:25.560> building<00:02:26.160> idea

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
me the final engineering building idea

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.550 
me the final engineering building idea
I'm<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.240> talking<00:02:27.540> about<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> is

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
I'm going to be talking about is a is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.160 
I'm going to be talking about is a is
the<00:02:28.770> spine<00:02:29.100> body<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.120> even<00:02:30.480> though<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.930> was

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
the spine body so even though the I was

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.540 
the spine body so even though the I was
looking<00:02:31.380> at<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.709> modern<00:02:32.190> texture<00:02:32.490> is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
looking at this the modern texture is

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.670 
looking at this the modern texture is
not<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> best<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.630> concept<00:02:34.380> behind<00:02:34.440> this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
not the best but the concept behind this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.040 
not the best but the concept behind this
is<00:02:34.800> awesome<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.750> called

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
is awesome so it's like a it's called

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.570 
is awesome so it's like a it's called
the<00:02:37.200> spine<00:02:37.500> buddy<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.010> basically<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:38.520> a

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
the spine buddy and basically it's a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.820 
the spine buddy and basically it's a
little<00:02:38.850> helicopter<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.320> can<00:02:40.560> sort<00:02:40.770> of

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
little helicopter that you can sort of

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.479 
little helicopter that you can sort of
fly<00:02:41.070> around<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:42.560> spy<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> enemy<00:02:43.800> with<00:02:44.190> I

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
fly around and spy on the enemy with I

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.580 
fly around and spy on the enemy with I
mean<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.209> think<00:02:45.720> that's<00:02:45.870> actually<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.170> simple

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
mean I think that's actually a simple

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.960 
mean I think that's actually a simple
idea<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:46.980> it'd<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.250> cool<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.550> have<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
idea but it'd be cool to have in the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.330 
idea but it'd be cool to have in the
game<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.200> know<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:49.650> they<00:02:49.890> put<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.100> in

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
game and you know if they put that in

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.150 
game and you know if they put that in
the<00:02:50.400> game<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.470> would<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.769> balanced

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
the game I think it would be balanced

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.100 
the game I think it would be balanced
because<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.670> his<00:02:54.060> description<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.690> weapon

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
because on his description of the weapon

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.840 
because on his description of the weapon
he<00:02:55.230> said<00:02:55.470> as<00:02:56.010> soon<00:02:56.220> as<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.370> takes<00:02:56.550> any<00:02:56.760> damage

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
he said as soon as it takes any damage

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.600 
he said as soon as it takes any damage
you<00:02:57.330> know<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.570> falls<00:02:58.410> down<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.010> gone<00:02:59.280> it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
you know it falls down it is gone it

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.940 
you know it falls down it is gone it
can't<00:02:59.880> stay<00:03:00.090> up<00:03:00.180> for<00:03:00.360> long<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.320> know<00:03:01.590> it's

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
can't stay up for long so you know it's

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.410 
can't stay up for long so you know it's
just<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.160> get<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> sneak<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.910> might<00:03:03.180> not

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
just to get like a sneak you might not

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.600 
just to get like a sneak you might not
be<00:03:03.540> able<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.690> see<00:03:04.080> where<00:03:04.290> an<00:03:04.500> engineer<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.400> or

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
be able to see where an engineer is or

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.030 
be able to see where an engineer is or
see<00:03:05.820> where<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.450> sort<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.050> team's<00:03:07.590> playing

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
see where like sort of a team's playing

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400 
see where like sort of a team's playing
something<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.580> know<00:03:08.670> it'd<00:03:09.360> just<00:03:09.510> be<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:10.170> cool

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
something you know it'd just be a cool

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.830 
something you know it'd just be a cool
idea<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.890> have<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.310> yeah<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.180> think<00:03:12.480> that'd<00:03:12.720> be

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
idea to have so yeah I think that'd be

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.180 
idea to have so yeah I think that'd be
