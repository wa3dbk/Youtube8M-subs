late<00:00:33.640> i<00:00:33.700> think<00:00:33.850> i<00:00:34.300> wouldn't<00:00:34.900> have<00:00:34.989> a<00:00:35.020> chance<00:00:35.170> to

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
late i think i wouldn't have a chance to

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.369 
late i think i wouldn't have a chance to
really<00:00:35.470> flesh<00:00:36.160> them<00:00:36.340> out<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.840> that's<00:00:38.290> how

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
really flesh them out and so that's how

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.310 
really flesh them out and so that's how
we're<00:00:38.559> doing<00:00:38.650> for<00:00:38.829> halo<00:00:39.010> 3<00:00:43.110> nailing<00:00:44.110> the

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
lot of times the direction just gets

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.979 
lot of times the direction just gets
narrow<00:02:09.519> down<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.790> can<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.479> make<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.750> look

shoulder pads and armor on them well the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.730 
shoulder pads and armor on them well the
interesting<00:05:24.870> thing<00:05:25.229> with<00:05:25.349> some<00:05:25.500> of<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.650> ideas

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
interesting thing with some of the ideas

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.760 
interesting thing with some of the ideas
that<00:05:25.979> we<00:05:26.250> came<00:05:26.400> up<00:05:26.460> with<00:05:26.789> is<00:05:27.320> not<00:05:28.320> only<00:05:28.530> do<00:05:28.680> we

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
that we came up with is not only do we

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.050 
that we came up with is not only do we
need<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:28.979> figure<00:05:29.130> out<00:05:29.220> how<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.460> Brutes

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
need to figure out how the Brutes

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.180 
need to figure out how the Brutes
interact<00:05:30.659> with<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.930> other<00:05:31.020> covenant<00:05:31.590> but

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
interact with the other covenant but

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.100 
interact with the other covenant but
also<00:05:32.340> how<00:05:32.550> brutes<00:05:32.820> interact<00:05:33.270> with<00:05:33.479> brutes<00:05:33.870> and

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
also how brutes interact with brutes and

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.080 
also how brutes interact with brutes and
we<00:05:34.919> developed<00:05:35.099> the<00:05:35.370> idea<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:35.849> brute<00:05:36.090> pack

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
we developed the idea of the brute pack

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.250 
we developed the idea of the brute pack
what<00:05:39.090> makes<00:05:39.240> it<00:05:39.330> feel<00:05:39.510> like<00:05:39.540> two<00:05:39.870> characters

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
what makes it feel like two characters

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.900 
what makes it feel like two characters
are<00:05:40.380> aware<00:05:40.560> of<00:05:40.620> each<00:05:40.770> other<00:05:40.980> deciding<00:05:41.610> to<00:05:41.760> do

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
are aware of each other deciding to do

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.510 
are aware of each other deciding to do
the<00:05:42.030> same<00:05:42.270> thing<00:05:42.510> at<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.690> same<00:05:42.750> time<00:05:43.520> maybe

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
the same thing at the same time maybe

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.890 
the same thing at the same time maybe
you're<00:05:44.760> gonna<00:05:44.970> come<00:05:45.180> around<00:05:45.390> a<00:05:45.510> corner<00:05:45.540> and

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
you're gonna come around a corner and

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.510 
you're gonna come around a corner and
see<00:05:46.200> them<00:05:46.380> doing<00:05:46.680> some<00:05:46.950> sort<00:05:47.130> of<00:05:47.160> an<00:05:47.280> activity

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
see them doing some sort of an activity

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.520 
see them doing some sort of an activity
that<00:05:47.730> that<00:05:48.630> has<00:05:48.870> nothing<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.260> do<00:05:49.380> with

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
that that has nothing to do with

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.720 
that that has nothing to do with
fighting<00:05:49.740> but<00:05:49.980> it's<00:05:50.130> going<00:05:50.250> to<00:05:50.310> give<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.520> sort

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
fighting but it's going to give you sort
