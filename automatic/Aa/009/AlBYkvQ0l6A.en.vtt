00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.719
 hello everyone with you djen for no one 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.040
 the secret is that day z optimization is lame 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.860
 developers are writing that trying to improve 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.990
 fps in the game but so far optimization in day z 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.630
 you can say no, we are left 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.670
 optimize it yourself in this guide i 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.340
 tell and show you how to set up the game 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.140
 for better performance 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.699
 probably you have already read and watched the video 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 where they show you need to edit 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.750
 and what settings I use 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.360
 show additional options 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.450
 optimization we start with the setting itself 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.579
 games we need a video tab in the second 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.129
 line view 3d screen resolution 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.969
 the value must match the resolution 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.219
 your screen 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.870
 if it does not coincide with him then 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.500
 the picture will be blurred and you will not see 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.390
 how let's say someone runs gave on the way 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.699
 brightness range can be set is any 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.649
 will not affect fps 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.989
 vertical sync if you have 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.379
 monitor with a scan rate of less than 120 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.390
 then you should disable this option 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.250
 go to the interface tab lines 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 permissions you need to choose your 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.310
 screen resolution 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.200
 3d choice will depend on it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.240
 permissions parameter 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.630
 aspect ratio will be selected 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.270
 automatically dependent on resolution 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.229
 example if your resolution is 1920 on 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.299
 1080 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.759
 then the value of this parameter will be 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.549
 be a ratio of 16 to 9 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.439
 go to the texture stitch tab 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.119
 video memory you need to select the parameter 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.009
 auto 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.390
 texture detail the value of this 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.390
 parameter must be selected depending on 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 from your iron if it is you powerful then 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.549
 choose a setting high or very 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.770
 high if you have a weak computer then 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.350
 you should choose low or 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.750
 very low texture filtering 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 The value of this parameter is recommended. 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.299
 set the normal go to tab 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.259
 quality parameter value objects 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.299
 should be put 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.600
 very low it will worsen the quality 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.060
 objects but add fps value 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.490
 parameter of the landscape must be set too 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.009
 to very low settings but value 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.440
 cloud and shadow parameters need to be set 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.410
 high or very high 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.880
 This will improve the picture in the game in the tab. 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.650
 render should be disabled 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.530
 either put on very low settings 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.880
 all options but if you have a powerful yet 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.910
 then you can put the value 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.580
 the parameter smoothing the fx face is very 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.770
 high in the render tab should 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.180
 disable or put on very low 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.580
 settings all parameters 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.980
 but if you are powerful yet you can 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.640
 set the value of the smoothing parameter 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.320
 facets of fox are very high we set up 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.480
 the game itself will proceed to the setting 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.450
 startup parameters configure config to 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.580
 from this we go into the documents folder where 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.470
 and z and open the dejzr file the value of these 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.100
 two parameters need to be put on 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.570
 unit 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.790
 this will increase the fps folder and z is also there. 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.130
 two files that bears the name of your 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.610
 personal we need a file without 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.830
 extensions you open the file we will see 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.430
 the parameters that we have already configured in 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.110
 the game so we need to go down 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.850
 below we need these five 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.050
 lines 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.660
 the first parameter is responsible for the quantity 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.720
 polygons in the game I set the value 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.840
 This parameter is 100000 second value 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.670
 Parameter I set the 53 parameter 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.350
 responsible for drawing distance 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.810
 I set the value of this parameter 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.480
 one and a half kilometers fourth parameter 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.590
 responsible for drawing houses and cars 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.769
 other objects 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.570
 I set its value to the thousand parameter 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.670
 terrain grid is responsible for the range 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.310
 drawing trees of bushes and the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.280
 like plants I put the value 3 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.370
 meters a little higher there are two more 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.100
 parameter shading colitis and shadow 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.620
 call the value of the shading parameter 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.330
 quality should be set to 0 in order 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.340
 to change startup options to out 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.820
 it will click on it right mouse button 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 properties and launch of shells go 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.370
 the very beginning parameter win xp allows 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.430
 run game us direct x9 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.239
 this will significantly increase the fps next 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.400
 high parameter 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.400
 With this parameter, the game will be 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.200
 run high priority following 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.020
 three parameters but splash 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.540
 intro but pauses allows the game to start 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.790
 much faster the next four 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.250
 Parameters have become the most popular in 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.980
 On the Internet, I think you've heard how 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.260
 tune so we set up yes and z i 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.210
 I think you helped my guide and you stayed 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.240
 satisfied after watching this movie I 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.660
 I really hope that your fps cities are now 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.340
 1000 and more Ivan is now very nice 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.990
 play thanks for watching 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.420
