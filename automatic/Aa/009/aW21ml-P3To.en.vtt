00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.800
 get I know they already talk about this seen 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.689
 a lot is a boxing different from that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.279
 solar but I did not want to let the 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.099
 opportunity so let's do the 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.860
 boxing with here tells us we find in 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.989
 the default crisis samsung galaxy s 4 of 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.489
 this side then a label that by 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.980
 seem to have this create since the priest 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.190

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.589
 reached but says with lte yes 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.210
 comes with lte 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.520
 we found that it's what they have 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.620
 16 gigs of internal storage that 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.629
 it has a quad-core processor at 1.9 and 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.180
 chivas hertz has a full hd screen 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.190
 super amoled of an association of 1900 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.289
 by 1080 the screen changes from 5 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.050
 Inch serious repros and videos in full 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.000
 hd the camera by exterior is 13 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.180
 megapixels and the front is 2 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.899
 megapixels capable of recording the subsequent 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.910
 and the frontal in full hd feels with the 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.090
 universal remote control and a battery 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.689
 of 2,600 thousand species has full hd in 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.490
 The amoled Android operating system 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.000
 4.2.2 geli well has the bluetooth and the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.409
 wifi that we are going to cut less this I 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.210
 I want to cut so we have not 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.650
 we use this so let's cut it 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.840
 with the knife that time that does not 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.750
 I used him 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 and many searches nothing else is 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.310
 agreed that one here 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.789
 I feel it would have been better with the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.789
 hand 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:55.220
 now we are going to open the box 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.220
 of samsung galaxy s 4 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.400
 The truth is that I really like the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.790
 design since it is very organic and 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.770
 all of that samsung is taking out 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.890
 good here we have a small sticker 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.630
 white that says it wherever and well 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.870
 it's black, in case I did not mention it 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.910
 we have here the sim that is obviously 4g 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.660
 lte microchip 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.260
 but leave it out here a few moments 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.240
 here is the samsung galaxy s 4 in those 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.240
 hands let's get it out 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.590
 let's put it aside the cell 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.060
 let's check what else it contains in the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.060
 box takes away a little bit 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.660
 so from a bag thing we are going to leave a 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.850
 side 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.300
 well in the respective few days of 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.300
 quick start 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.489
 as you can see very ecological we are in 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.489
 the truth with this of his things 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.530
 and quick here some ideas that the truth 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.340
 nobody nobody use being sincere 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.860
 to work 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.860
 to get these two out 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.860
 we find 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.700
 the guarantee policy is very important 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.700
 save it because there are two dates 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.130
 the manual is a girl's manual with 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.360
 your samsung galaxy 3 and millionaire 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.620

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.090
 cartoon is the manual 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.400

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.349
 tensions and with your pc your little 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.190

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.140
 usb micro usb 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.390
 we find 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:13.880
 what is the charger the adapter for 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.880
 connect it to an outlet 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:22.000
 the pacifiers that you use to put 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.210
 how big is your boy's ear 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.700
 large and therefore the respective 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.890
 headphones that this samsung carries 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.890

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.700
 plastic on your cell phone but the truth is 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.290
