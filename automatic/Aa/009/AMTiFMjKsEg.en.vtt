00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
like that I would say that this video is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.220 
like that I would say that this video is
the<00:00:26.250> crux<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:28.080> void<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:29.570> everyone<00:00:30.570> feels

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the crux of the void that everyone feels

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.729 
the crux of the void that everyone feels
to<00:00:32.040> varying<00:00:32.489> degrees<00:00:32.690> and<00:00:33.690> until<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.469> deal

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
to varying degrees and until you deal

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.380 
to varying degrees and until you deal
with<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.489> walk<00:00:35.700> through<00:00:35.969> some<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
with this and walk through some of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.020 
with this and walk through some of the
steps<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.780> I'm<00:00:36.930> gonna<00:00:37.050> walk<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.290> through<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
steps that I'm gonna walk you through I
don't<00:00:39.030> think<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.540> void<00:00:39.600> will<00:00:40.230> ever<00:00:40.469> be

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
don't think that that void will ever be

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.360 
don't think that that void will ever be
filled<00:00:41.520> or<00:00:41.820> go<00:00:42.090> away<00:00:42.410> I'm<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.070> cover<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
filled or go away I'm going to cover a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.940 
filled or go away I'm going to cover a
lot<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> ground<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.270> video<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.829> up

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
lot of ground in this video and it's up

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.979 
lot of ground in this video and it's up
to<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.309> how<00:00:47.579> much<00:00:47.760> work<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.239> want<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.719> on

to you how much work you want to do on
each<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.320> these<00:00:49.410> steps<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.160> also<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
each of these steps I also think that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.880 
each of these steps I also think that
some<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.829> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
some of you are going to think this is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.330 
some of you are going to think this is
too<00:00:53.399> low<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.750> okay<00:00:55.320> those<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
too low and that's okay those of you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.400 
too low and that's okay those of you
that<00:00:56.579> choose<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.910> stay<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.420> me<00:00:57.870> throughout

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that choose to stay with me throughout

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.920 
that choose to stay with me throughout
this<00:00:58.739> video<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.399> work<00:00:59.609> these<00:00:59.820> steps<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.449> think

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
this video and work these steps I think
