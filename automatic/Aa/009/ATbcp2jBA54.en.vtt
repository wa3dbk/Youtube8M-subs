00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.470
 special movement was not well in the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.080
 first match 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.730
 the killer instinct released before had 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.380
 brought about this type of movement 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.470
 but that's not what I want to talk now 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.940
 too much nonsense has brought the fatalities 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.260
