00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 everything 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.490
 GDP 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.279
 not 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.169
 I was born in Moscow 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.169
 nothing remember those times 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.239
 no one really thought 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.930
 I was still quite small 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 out of ten million inhabitants of Moscow 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.090
 only saved 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.880
 40 thousand 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.760
 among them was 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.629
 survivors 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.629
 two persons at stations of the Moscow metro 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.480
 since passed 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.890
 we are with you 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.890
 on earth will never be suitable 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.480
 only a few begs 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.230
 police 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.900
 surface 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.880
 government is our only trend 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.100
 our last resort 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.130
 I am now in the world so that now 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.110
 the future 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.360
 local councils 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.130
 we turned into fortresses 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.850
 this year 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.850
 the last 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.770
 Until recently 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.400
 we kept hope that once 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.430
 we can return to the ring 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.250
 but there was a new terrible threat 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 and the very survival of humanity 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.270
 questioned 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 tons 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.410
 when you lost your native older think 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.039
 that we will be in this position 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.729
 that you won't even know if lice are saving 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.729
 we find or condemn him forever 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.869
 hold on 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:23.159
 caught 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.299
 to rise to the surface to us 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.959
 will have to get through the abandoned 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.959
 Artyomov's checkpoint 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.049
 there is something next room 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.049
 open the turnover I'll cover 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.639
 fire brigades 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.339
 only the beginning of May 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.869
 will have to open manually by doing 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.309
 Pasha more this box suddenly comes that 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:49.319
 is useful 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.419
 ready to part 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.169
 value 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.169
 at 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.349
 here 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.089
 at 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.349
 so it seems there was nobody 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.839
 dissatisfaction urgent 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.459
 going to the surface 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.019
 his debt 1 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.389
 in this 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.119
 for this concert 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.039
 at the same time to add not 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.699
 read out 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.949
 to 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.949
 same role 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.379
 but with kings 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
 in the race 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:54.969
 program 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.909
 if earlier and in favor of the stove stove 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.609
 let's piano 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.609
 tea to him in despair 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.159
 not yet together 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.779
 ready 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.779
 in the reality 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.709
 my advice is 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.629
 first 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.509
 here she is 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.509
 finally on 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.300
 Poltavchenko 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.400
 company sells goods 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 the second 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:50.570
 notarized 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.419
 earlier saying that approaching the tower 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.340
 in Paris 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.340
 nice i never blame itar tass 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.210
 p apoel 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.339
 but I do not believe 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.919
 the king says colonel 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.110
 so much noise 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.110
 Christmas tree 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.889
 war 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.759
 so saying 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.800
 first energy 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.380
 It was I believe that such a phenomenon 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.860
 was 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.960
 m 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:23.599
 GDP 

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:29.669
 pace
