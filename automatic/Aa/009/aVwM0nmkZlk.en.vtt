00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to review my cloak off because I think

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.320 
to review my cloak off because I think
he<00:00:26.070> looks<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.460> much<00:00:26.519> better<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.060> without

it<00:00:28.189> it<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> difficult<00:00:30.740> job<00:00:31.740> trying<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> get

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it it was a difficult job trying to get

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.190 
it it was a difficult job trying to get
the<00:00:32.790> cloak<00:00:33.030> off<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.780> did<00:00:33.960> come<00:00:34.110> off

the cloak off but it did come off
eventually<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:35.149> I<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.390> he<00:00:36.480> looks<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.719> lot

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840
