00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:11.610
 It's such a self as a teacher of 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.799
 retired math wanted to build 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.230
 one thing I wanted with a pleasure 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.930
 a part of a building that was 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.640
 feasible for all people of all ages. 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.160
 social classes 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.910
 we are rethinking the following 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 there were people who sometimes want 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.040
 living alone goes from the course to live 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.070
 alone raise them we create is this that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.010
 project already with the lowest load of the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.010
 world 13 meters and 78 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.470
 and here we have how the system a 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.890
 mobile system 21 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.500
 so it's not what we think is let's 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.320
 working with articles may be 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.019
 that is disassembled and foldable if 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.690
 put it anywhere you can 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.000
 Put in cit farm chakra that can 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.040
 take the building up if you can put it 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.070
 on the garage 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.490
 this is called here with 11 is that it is 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.280
 to fold the door for those who 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.070
 works with locksmith and here we 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.920
 we set up a kitchen for the Pizarro 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.830
 architecture beyond mathematical 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.410
 we signed architecture 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:31.729
 We set up a kitchen, right? 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.810
 what was the idea is a mt or a 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.940
 war on model or a practical dwelling 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.180
 Does not have the refrigerator. 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.539
 that the stove is instilled into a 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:49.899
 washing machine and here is a small table 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.899
 picture a little fight down here 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.640
 the strip of the place and here we and me as is 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.399
 made with the walls is on the outside a 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.030
 boring that lasts more than 30 years 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.380
 the automotive painting is a painting 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.140
 of quarrels and has as an example the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.319
 mdf which is a type conforming in the middle 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.300
 alan glass wool né 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.790
 and here we have the idea was to make a 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.489
 thing and work all day and at 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.160
 Sometimes you do not want to have a break. 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.200
 too big that only work here 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.459
 Do you solve this kind of problem? 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.519
 so we have here I can 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.610
 work the size you have 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.950
 So how are the corners made? 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.890
 made in modules 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.400
 and you have for example the rest are 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.610
 Miguel is four screws each corner 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.769
 that high pressure and how you work 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.700
 the truck guard system 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.760
 we made some adaptations of enjoyment and 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:12.430
 here we have teaching to participate 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:16.880
 keep part of the fourth clothes right 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.010
 division brings us a bath and who 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.910
 You do not want more like Mac by a meter and 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.890
 meter and sixty and we have here 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.609
 also takes care of lies from 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:33.350
 sewage and everything under the house and here 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:36.079
 we also have here we have 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.489
 part of the bathroom is the one that removes the 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:46.069
 arduino author's bathrooms and retreat 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:48.829
 arditti this is reservation in the system 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:53.450
 after having tested a few years this 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:57.370
 then we come to a next 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.730
 it is antipymal, it is antipyretic 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.640
 antirruído and here has a double bed 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.970
 that the project already exists in the chamber 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.370
 the wardrobe has a double bed and here 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.860
 at the bottom has been around for project 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.030
 put the computer on the television 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.030
 on 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:24.470
 the part of the stand is to observe if not not 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.419
 It's the bed too if you realize this is a thing. 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.419
 for who is starting life a 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.300
 person two but if you have a child 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:37.010
 you can put make one that already exists 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:40.010
 the design make a bed also in bed 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:45.020
 bunk in the cane of house the floor of 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:48.080
 and we plan to do this. 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.110
 to work or be poor series is 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.220
 work as well as a factory 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.889
 every run is you sell is put this 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.350
 for you to sell for example a store 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.389
 understand you already bought a wardrobe 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.970
 I want to buy a house 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:10.520
 The price of it is practically equivalent to 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.260
 Most popular car at least she 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.380
 also 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:21.200
 moreover, it can be dismantled with wheels 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:27.889
 We have here wheels here. 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:31.970
 The best we are is even 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:35.300
 looking for a businessman then this 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.490
 Only house you can bathe in it 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.610
 that's when it comes a little bit and it's going to 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.530
 bath as if you are putting the bath 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.340
 and car right? 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.820
 we have there a water tank 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.570
 distribute isaac to the bathroom 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.940
 the computer washes and the sewer 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.480
 from here can be linked here in our 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.400
 if it is switched on and off in the 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.960
 backyard street 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.660
 is this the type joking if you are can 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.300
 take bread which deals almost put in 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.020
 buildings can put on top of garage 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.210
 that you can put in a corner of the yard is 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.780

 get rid of it already goes my 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.290
 grandson who already promised a cover for him 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:34.300
 lose right 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:36.700
 about the two times and the school that 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.680
 What is this? This is the idea. 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.020
 following can be done for any 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.110
 place in the world 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.110
 you can for example in Piauí Teresina 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.530
 which is very hot which can increase the 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.390
 alan size of life is not this here is the 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:58.300
 plate provided is made of iron 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:04.350
 then in mid-deland video after 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.350
 that mpf if you have
