00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
something that looks like this now this

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.179 
something that looks like this now this
right<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.560> random<00:01:13.560> access<00:01:13.920> memory<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:16.189> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
right here is random access memory it it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.179 
right here is random access memory it it
up<00:01:17.310> closing<00:01:17.640> series<00:01:18.150> um<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.710> will<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:20.009> these

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
up closing series um there will be these

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.490 
up closing series um there will be these
little<00:01:20.460> metal<00:01:20.820> clamps<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:21.869> that's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
little metal clamps right here that's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.990 
little metal clamps right here that's
what's<00:01:22.799> holding<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.939> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
what's holding it so when you want to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.899 
what's holding it so when you want to
remove<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.479> what<00:01:24.689> you're<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.909> she's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
remove it what you're going to do she's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.289 
remove it what you're going to do she's
going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.330> ahead<00:01:28.220> take<00:01:29.220> these<00:01:29.700> metal

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
going to go ahead take these metal

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
going to go ahead take these metal
clamps<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.990> pull<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> side<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
clamps and pull them to the side and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.920 
clamps and pull them to the side and
this<00:01:33.420> will<00:01:33.600> pop<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.380> random<00:01:35.100> access<00:01:35.460> memory

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
this will pop your random access memory

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.200 
this will pop your random access memory
up<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.280> remove<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:41.030> go<00:01:42.030> ahead

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
up so that we will remove it so go ahead

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:53.230 
up so that we will remove it so go ahead
and<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> few<00:01:51.299> tries

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
and do this so it can take a few tries

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:11.520 
and do this so it can take a few tries
sometimes<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.600> wants<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:54.960> stingy

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.650 

so<00:02:12.530> there's<00:02:13.490> one<00:02:13.850> stick<00:02:16.240> now<00:02:17.240> you're<00:02:17.450> going<00:02:17.540> to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
so there's one stick now you're going to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.760 
so there's one stick now you're going to
take<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.320> other<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.620> below<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:20.260> no<00:02:21.260> move<00:02:21.590> this

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
take the other one below it no move this

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.340 
take the other one below it no move this
to<00:02:23.800> open<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.130> out<00:02:25.570> or<00:02:26.570> it's<00:02:26.750> popped<00:02:26.990> out<00:02:27.200> it

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
to open it out or it's popped out it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.820 
to open it out or it's popped out it
should<00:02:27.440> look<00:02:27.740> something<00:02:27.800> like<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:29.830> slanted

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
should look something like that slanted

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.150 
should look something like that slanted
agency<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.080> going<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.320> pull<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.650> up<00:02:33.920> very

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
agency you just going to pull it up very

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.330 
agency you just going to pull it up very
carefully<00:02:34.550> grabbing<00:02:35.390> each<00:02:35.540> side<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.620> do

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
carefully grabbing each side of it do

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.390 
carefully grabbing each side of it do
not<00:02:37.580> pull<00:02:37.940> from<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.590> front<00:02:39.590> or<00:02:39.800> back<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.280> it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
not pull from the front or back of it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.320 
not pull from the front or back of it
because<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.790> can<00:02:41.270> mess<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.810> or<00:02:43.060> stash<00:02:44.060> it

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
because this can mess it up or stash it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:53.140 
because this can mess it up or stash it
in<00:02:44.390> your<00:02:44.570> computer<00:02:45.700> somehow<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:50.290> al<00:02:52.150> agency
