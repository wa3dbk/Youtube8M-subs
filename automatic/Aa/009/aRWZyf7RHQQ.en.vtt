tester one of the Celestials of the
fourth<00:00:35.810> host<00:00:36.670> now<00:00:37.670> if<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:37.880> look<00:00:38.030> at<00:00:38.120> their

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
fourth host now if you look at their

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.569 
fourth host now if you look at their
look<00:00:39.379> just<00:00:39.680> look<00:00:39.800> at<00:00:39.890> them<00:00:40.010> they<00:00:40.129> kind<00:00:40.280> of<00:00:40.399> look

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
look just look at them they kind of look

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.340 
look just look at them they kind of look
similar<00:00:40.789> that's<00:00:41.539> why<00:00:41.719> I<00:00:41.750> kind<00:00:41.899> of<00:00:41.989> picked<00:00:42.230> them

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
similar that's why I kind of picked them

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.650 
similar that's why I kind of picked them
cuz<00:00:42.559> they're<00:00:42.649> I<00:00:42.920> think<00:00:43.399> Z<00:00:44.120> round<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.329> testier

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
cuz they're I think Z round the testier

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.689 
cuz they're I think Z round the testier
kind<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:45.019> kind<00:00:45.410> of<00:00:45.469> has<00:00:45.649> like<00:00:45.679> a<00:00:45.800> Galactus<00:00:46.399> type

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
kind of kind of has like a Galactus type

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.310 
kind of kind of has like a Galactus type
look<00:00:47.059> ripoff<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.219> so<00:00:50.019> Galactus<00:00:51.019> doesn't

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
look ripoff and so Galactus doesn't

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.169 
look ripoff and so Galactus doesn't
really<00:00:51.440> need<00:00:51.589> an<00:00:51.710> introduction<00:00:52.160> Galactus<00:00:53.149> the

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
really need an introduction Galactus the

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.270 
really need an introduction Galactus the
Devourer<00:00:53.539> world's<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.559> last<00:00:54.769> survivor<00:00:55.160> of

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
Devourer world's the last survivor of

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.369 
Devourer world's the last survivor of
the<00:00:55.670> previous<00:00:56.210> universe

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
the previous universe

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.739 
the previous universe
what's<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.249> Big<00:00:58.399> Bang<00:00:58.609> happened<00:00:58.749> Galactus

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
what's the Big Bang happened Galactus

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.889 
what's the Big Bang happened Galactus
was<00:01:00.280> basically<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.519> a<00:01:01.609> cosmic<00:01:02.089> egg<00:01:02.269> type<00:01:02.600> thing

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
was basically in a cosmic egg type thing

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.760 
was basically in a cosmic egg type thing
then<00:01:03.109> he<00:01:03.230> was<00:01:03.379> released<00:01:03.820> then<00:01:04.820> uh<00:01:05.210> he<00:01:06.140> hungered

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
then he was released then uh he hungered

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.670 
then he was released then uh he hungered
and<00:01:06.980> he<00:01:07.580> now<00:01:07.790> feeds<00:01:08.210> on<00:01:08.420> planets<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.200> sustain

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
and he now feeds on planets to sustain

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.700 
and he now feeds on planets to sustain
him<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:11.780> even<00:01:12.080> though<00:01:12.170> there<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:12.470> not

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
him and so even though there is not

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.230 
him and so even though there is not
enough<00:01:12.980> planets<00:01:13.490> in<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.730> universe<00:01:13.760> to

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
enough planets in the universe to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.030 
enough planets in the universe to
sustain<00:01:14.690> him<00:01:14.900> he<00:01:15.080> will<00:01:15.260> eventually<00:01:15.620> in

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
sustain him he will eventually in

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.610 
sustain him he will eventually in
billions<00:01:17.000> or<00:01:17.240> however<00:01:17.480> years<00:01:18.050> he<00:01:18.560> will

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
billions or however years he will

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.560 
billions or however years he will
eventually<00:01:18.920> die<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.580> they<00:01:20.240> thought<00:01:20.390> he

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
eventually die and they thought he

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.450 
eventually die and they thought he
fulfilled<00:01:20.900> his<00:01:20.990> destiny<00:01:21.230> and<00:01:21.740> Marvel

with intelligence

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.990 
with intelligence
they<00:02:11.300> are<00:02:11.540> both<00:02:11.750> off<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:13.250> scale<00:02:13.580> when<00:02:13.879> it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.690 
they are both off the scale when it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
comes to intelligence they are so smart

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.800 
comes to intelligence they are so smart
it<00:02:16.850> probably<00:02:17.330> cannot<00:02:17.510> be<00:02:17.660> calculated

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
it probably cannot be calculated

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.150 
it probably cannot be calculated
Galactus<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:21.209> just<00:02:22.209> billions<00:02:22.989> be<00:02:23.590> as<00:02:23.739> old<00:02:23.980> as

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
Galactus is just billions be as old as

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.850 
Galactus is just billions be as old as
time<00:02:24.190> itself<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.480> way<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.380> Celestials

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
time itself in a in a way the Celestials

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.100 
time itself in a in a way the Celestials
have<00:02:27.130> practically<00:02:27.880> been<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.330> too<00:02:28.569> as<00:02:28.810> old

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
have practically been there too as old

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.020 
have practically been there too as old
it's<00:02:29.319> time<00:02:29.410> they<00:02:30.099> don't<00:02:30.280> exactly<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.910> an

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
it's time they don't exactly have an

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.589 
it's time they don't exactly have an
origin<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.830> want<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.849> I<00:02:34.030> have<00:02:34.420> another

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
origin if you want to I I have another

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.729 
origin if you want to I I have another
video<00:02:34.780> about<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.170> Celestials<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.650> might

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
video about the Celestials you might

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.290 
video about the Celestials you might
want<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.920> check<00:02:36.040> them<00:02:36.160> out<00:02:36.250> they<00:02:37.060> don't

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
want to check them out they don't

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.600 
want to check them out they don't
exactly<00:02:37.599> have<00:02:37.930> an<00:02:38.019> origin<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:39.280> it's<00:02:39.400> hard<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
exactly have an origin so it's hard to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.100 
exactly have an origin so it's hard to
say<00:02:39.760> how<00:02:39.880> exactly<00:02:40.420> old<00:02:40.540> they<00:02:40.630> are<00:02:40.660> they<00:02:40.900> are

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
say how exactly old they are they are

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.839 
say how exactly old they are they are
billions<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:41.920> billions<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.280> years<00:02:42.340> old<00:02:42.670> that

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
billions and billions of years old that

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.440 
billions and billions of years old that
is<00:02:42.970> basically<00:02:43.510> that's<00:02:43.989> all<00:02:44.110> we<00:02:44.290> know<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:46.000> but

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
is basically that's all we know so but

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.000 
is basically that's all we know so but
for<00:02:46.630> intelligence<00:02:47.200> it's<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.830> go<00:02:47.950> to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
for intelligence it's going to go to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.720 
for intelligence it's going to go to
Galactus<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:50.410> because<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> Galactus<00:02:51.130> has<00:02:51.370> I

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
Galactus just because a Galactus has I

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.850 
Galactus just because a Galactus has I
think<00:02:52.480> probably<00:02:53.080> showed<00:02:53.230> more<00:02:53.410> intelligence

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
think probably showed more intelligence

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.520 
think probably showed more intelligence
feats<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.610> Celestials<00:02:55.600> have<00:02:55.810> shown<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.410> know

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
feats the Celestials have shown you know

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.130 
feats the Celestials have shown you know
their<00:02:56.680> armor<00:02:57.100> their<00:02:57.549> all<00:02:57.700> their<00:02:57.850> technology

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
their armor their all their technology

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.570 
their armor their all their technology
but<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.170> think<00:02:59.470> when<00:02:59.860> it<00:02:59.920> comes<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.220> technology

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
but I think when it comes to technology

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.289 
but I think when it comes to technology
like<00:03:01.150> one<00:03:01.299> on<00:03:01.390> one<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.600> think<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> lactis<00:03:02.260> has<00:03:02.470> it

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
like one on one I think a lactis has it

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.800 
like one on one I think a lactis has it
now<00:03:04.299> when<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.019> comes<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.290> strength<00:03:06.810> either

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
now when it comes to strength either

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.259 
now when it comes to strength either
both<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:08.410> if<00:03:08.950> they<00:03:09.730> want<00:03:09.970> they<00:03:10.209> could

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
both you know if they want they could

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.420 
both you know if they want they could
probably<00:03:10.450> physically<00:03:11.110> fight<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.560> out<00:03:11.650> but<00:03:12.190> it

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
probably physically fight it out but it

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.880 
probably physically fight it out but it
probably<00:03:12.580> won't<00:03:12.880> make<00:03:13.269> um<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.890> slightly

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
probably won't make um to that slightly

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.740 
probably won't make um to that slightly
but<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:15.489> physical<00:03:16.269> strength<00:03:16.480> they're

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
but in physical strength they're

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.970 
but in physical strength they're
probably<00:03:16.900> just<00:03:17.049> about<00:03:17.200> even<00:03:17.590> they're<00:03:17.860> both

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
probably just about even they're both

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.680 
probably just about even they're both
incalculable<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.940> can't<00:03:19.209> there's<00:03:19.510> no

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
incalculable you can't there's no

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.690 
incalculable you can't there's no
possible<00:03:20.080> way<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.290> see<00:03:21.190> how<00:03:21.310> much<00:03:21.459> they<00:03:21.640> can

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
possible way to see how much they can

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.050 
possible way to see how much they can
you<00:03:21.970> know<00:03:22.060> how<00:03:22.330> strong<00:03:22.660> they're<00:03:23.850> but<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:24.940> know

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
you know how strong they're but you know

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.390 
you know how strong they're but you know
it<00:03:25.180> comes<00:03:25.690> down<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.950> most<00:03:26.950> probably<00:03:27.280> their

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
it comes down to most probably their

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.490 
it comes down to most probably their
energy<00:03:27.790> projections<00:03:28.390> well<00:03:28.989> they're<00:03:29.170> their

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
energy projections well they're their

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.160 
energy projections well they're their
abilities<00:03:29.920> now<00:03:30.760> Galactus<00:03:31.570> wields<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.079> power

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
abilities now Galactus wields the power

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.349 
abilities now Galactus wields the power

caught the entire power cosmic he can

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.240 
caught the entire power cosmic he can
use<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.569> however<00:03:34.660> he<00:03:34.900> wants<00:03:35.290> absorption

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
use it however he wants absorption

use it however he wants absorption

at<00:03:53.950> his<00:03:54.069> disposal<00:03:54.340> he<00:03:54.850> could<00:03:55.600> practically<00:03:55.870> do

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
at his disposal he could practically do

you go on the marble like wiki pages and

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.460 
you go on the marble like wiki pages and
all<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.600> they<00:04:07.870> actually<00:04:08.200> don't<00:04:08.290> have<00:04:08.410> a

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
all that they actually don't have a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.319 
all that they actually don't have a
complete<00:04:08.889> set<00:04:09.160> of<00:04:09.190> their<00:04:09.400> abilities<00:04:09.760> like

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
complete set of their abilities like

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.680 
complete set of their abilities like
they<00:04:10.480> say<00:04:10.750> basically<00:04:11.549> they<00:04:12.549> do<00:04:12.609> possess<00:04:13.269> near

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
they say basically they do possess near

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.960 
they say basically they do possess near
limitless<00:04:14.109> amounts<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.889> powers<00:04:15.760> and

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
limitless amounts of powers and

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.379 
limitless amounts of powers and
abilities<00:04:16.389> like<00:04:16.600> cosmic<00:04:17.049> powers<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.970> various

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
abilities like cosmic powers and various

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.270 
abilities like cosmic powers and various
other<00:04:19.570> abilities<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.229> but<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.709> think<00:04:21.130> matter

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
other abilities so but I think matter

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.879 
other abilities so but I think matter
matter<00:04:21.729> manipulation<00:04:22.539> reality<00:04:23.289> warping<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.830> do

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
matter manipulation reality warping I do

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.909 
matter manipulation reality warping I do
believe<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.539> mean<00:04:25.539> their<00:04:25.810> powers<00:04:26.200> just<00:04:26.530> are

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
believe I mean their powers just are

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.990 
believe I mean their powers just are
insane

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
insane

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.760 
insane
now<00:04:30.000> salute<00:04:30.270> tough<00:04:30.480> part<00:04:30.720> their<00:04:31.380> durability

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
now salute tough part their durability

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.080 
now salute tough part their durability
who<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.390> more<00:04:33.600> durable<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:35.730> so<00:04:35.910> that's

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
who is the more durable it so that's

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.860 
who is the more durable it so that's
very<00:04:36.210> difficult<00:04:36.480> uh<00:04:39.530> Galactus<00:04:41.660> does<00:04:42.660> have<00:04:42.840> a

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
very difficult uh Galactus does have a

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.480 
very difficult uh Galactus does have a
durability<00:04:43.200> when<00:04:43.590> he<00:04:43.710> fights<00:04:43.980> he<00:04:44.250> does

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
durability when he fights he does

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.580 
durability when he fights he does
actually<00:04:44.760> lose<00:04:45.420> power<00:04:45.720> due<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.110> fact<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.380> he

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
actually lose power due the fact that he

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.100 
actually lose power due the fact that he
is<00:04:46.680> going<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:46.980> start<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.120> know<00:04:48.240> he's<00:04:48.660> okay<00:04:48.990> no

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
is going to start you know he's okay no

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.400 
is going to start you know he's okay no
Galactus<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.590> always<00:04:49.890> hungry<00:04:50.160> he<00:04:50.370> wants<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:51.410> he

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
Galactus is always hungry he wants to he

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.620 
Galactus is always hungry he wants to he
needs<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.680> feed<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:52.980> planets<00:04:53.400> therefore<00:04:53.880> he<00:04:54.300> he

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
needs to feed on planets therefore he he

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.000 
needs to feed on planets therefore he he
will<00:04:54.720> probably<00:04:54.990> he<00:04:55.410> will<00:04:55.470> could<00:04:55.650> be<00:04:55.740> getting

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
will probably he will could be getting

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.060 
will probably he will could be getting
weaker<00:04:56.340> as<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.730> battle<00:04:57.000> goes<00:04:57.450> on<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.740> would

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
weaker as the battle goes on so I would

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.680 
weaker as the battle goes on so I would
probably<00:04:59.340> give<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.580> durability<00:04:59.940> edge<00:05:00.330> to

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
probably give the durability edge to

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.420 
probably give the durability edge to
zero<00:05:00.960> on<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.170> tester<00:05:01.500> now<00:05:02.010> when<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.250> comes<00:05:02.310> to

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
zero on the tester now when it comes to

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.050 
zero on the tester now when it comes to
invulnerability<00:05:03.060> again<00:05:04.050> it's<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.800> tough<00:05:04.980> one

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
invulnerability again it's a tough one

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.800 
invulnerability again it's a tough one
Galactus<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:06.870> technically<00:05:07.500> is<00:05:07.770> pure<00:05:08.160> energy

because made that are made of vibranium
I'm<00:05:24.060> not<00:05:24.210> sure<00:05:24.360> if<00:05:24.450> it's<00:05:24.570> in<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:24.810> know<00:05:24.930> six<00:05:25.170> one

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
I'm not sure if it's in you know six one

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.530 
I'm not sure if it's in you know six one
six<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:26.340> when<00:05:26.700> it<00:05:26.790> comes<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.060> invulnerability

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
six so when it comes to invulnerability

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.540 
six so when it comes to invulnerability
I'll<00:05:27.870> probably<00:05:28.020> give<00:05:28.200> it's<00:05:28.460> probably<00:05:29.460> the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
I'll probably give it's probably the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.600 
I'll probably give it's probably the
Galactus<00:05:30.090> due<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.390> fact<00:05:30.480> that<00:05:30.600> he<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:30.870> energy

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
Galactus due the fact that he is energy

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
and if and if he can just break Zeron

and if and if he can just break Zeron
suit<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.210> just<00:05:36.330> rip<00:05:36.510> him<00:05:36.630> apart<00:05:36.690> if<00:05:37.140> he<00:05:37.260> can<00:05:37.410> if
