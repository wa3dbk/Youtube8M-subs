that is you so first up let's discuss
what<00:05:05.490> metabolism<00:05:06.270> is<00:05:06.450> and<00:05:06.840> does<00:05:07.170> then<00:05:08.010> we'll

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
what metabolism is and does then we'll

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.070 
what metabolism is and does then we'll
look<00:05:08.370> at<00:05:08.520> some<00:05:08.550> common<00:05:08.970> misconceptions<00:05:09.300> about
