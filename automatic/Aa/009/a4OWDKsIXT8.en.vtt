00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
type of thing that annoys you like that

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.570 
type of thing that annoys you like that
where<00:02:49.410> things<00:02:49.650> are<00:02:49.770> falling<00:02:50.040> out<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:50.430> not

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
where things are falling out and I'm not

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.949 
where things are falling out and I'm not
getting<00:02:50.760> penalized<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:51.270> them<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
getting penalized for them but the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.350 
getting penalized for them but the
bouncy<00:02:52.290> ball<00:02:52.470> there<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.950> falls<00:02:53.250> out<00:02:53.430> fine<00:02:54.060> I

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
bouncy ball there that falls out fine I

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.180 
bouncy ball there that falls out fine I
think<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.080> bouncy<00:02:55.380> ball<00:02:55.500> falling<00:02:55.799> out<00:02:56.040> with<00:02:56.160> a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
think a bouncy ball falling out with a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.100 
think a bouncy ball falling out with a
lot<00:02:56.459> less<00:02:56.790> hazardous<00:02:57.180> than<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.660> teeth<00:02:57.900> of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
lot less hazardous than the teeth of

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.140 
lot less hazardous than the teeth of
walkins<00:02:58.680> falling<00:02:59.100> out<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.310> know<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.120> a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
walkins falling out you know so it's a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.640 
walkins falling out you know so it's a
bit<00:03:00.269> odd<00:03:00.420> how<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.600> game<00:03:00.810> works<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.440> think

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
bit odd how the game works but I think

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.570 
bit odd how the game works but I think
it's<00:03:01.739> one<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.950> those<00:03:02.010> things<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.310> if<00:03:02.459> it's

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
it's one of those things that if it's

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.550 
it's one of those things that if it's
partially<00:03:03.030> smash<00:03:03.330> then<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.690> kinda<00:03:04.380> doesn't

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
partially smash then it kinda doesn't

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.440 
partially smash then it kinda doesn't
count<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.220> either<00:03:05.610> way<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.120> fallout

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
count but either way of the fallout

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.150 
count but either way of the fallout
system<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:07.350> be<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.530> best<00:03:07.799> friend<00:03:08.040> or<00:03:08.100> your

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
system can be a best friend or your

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.229 
system can be a best friend or your
worst<00:03:08.280> train<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.150> those

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
worst train because it's one of those

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.210 
worst train because it's one of those
things<00:03:09.330> where<00:03:09.660> you'll<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.200> begging<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:10.890> it

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
things where you'll be begging that it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.740 
things where you'll be begging that it
doesn't<00:03:11.519> count<00:03:11.730> but<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.299> course<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.660> will

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
doesn't count but of course it will

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.270 
doesn't count but of course it will
count<00:03:13.019> in<00:03:13.170> your<00:03:13.200> field<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.650> fast<00:03:15.980> most<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.130> all

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
count in your field and fast most of all

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.860 
count in your field and fast most of all
five<00:03:17.549> stages<00:03:17.820> doesn't<00:03:18.299> seem<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> lot<00:03:18.840> of

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
five stages doesn't seem like a lot of

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.660 
five stages doesn't seem like a lot of
other<00:03:19.200> did<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> versus<00:03:20.250> mode<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.640> a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
other did see but a versus mode on a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.009 
other did see but a versus mode on a
mission<00:03:21.000> board<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.600> basically<00:03:21.870> the

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
mission board this is basically the

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.080 
mission board this is basically the
versus<00:03:22.380> mode<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.220> quite<00:03:23.370> fun<00:03:23.670> and

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
versus mode and it can be quite fun and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.250 
versus mode and it can be quite fun and
in<00:03:24.269> case<00:03:24.420> you're<00:03:24.540> wondering<00:03:24.600> where<00:03:24.989> all<00:03:25.019> our

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
in case you're wondering where all our

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.900 
in case you're wondering where all our
waters<00:03:25.739> coming<00:03:26.010> from<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.430> should<00:03:26.790> probably

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
waters coming from I should probably

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.940 
waters coming from I should probably
explain<00:03:27.329> some<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.049> well<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.650> suppose

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
explain some of the well I suppose

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.560 
explain some of the well I suppose
hazards<00:03:29.400> on<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.549> game<00:03:29.700> itself<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.090> back<00:03:30.299> you

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
hazards on the game itself I back you

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.720 
hazards on the game itself I back you
can<00:03:31.049> get<00:03:31.170> fire<00:03:31.500> which<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:31.890> pretty<00:03:32.040> cold<00:03:32.430> and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
can get fire which is pretty cold and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.310 
can get fire which is pretty cold and
the<00:03:32.790> fire<00:03:32.940> actually<00:03:33.150> works<00:03:33.540> well<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.170> it

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
the fire actually works well and it

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.080 
the fire actually works well and it
works<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.709> advantage<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.519> water<00:03:35.760> therefore

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
works the advantage the water therefore

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.070 
works the advantage the water therefore
doesn't

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
doesn't

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.660 
doesn't
and<00:03:37.380> its<00:03:37.560> crew<00:03:37.740> is<00:03:37.890> your<00:03:38.100> book<00:03:38.250> tom<00:03:38.490> seaver

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
and its crew is your book tom seaver

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.970 
and its crew is your book tom seaver
fire<00:03:38.940> then<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:40.050> going<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> put<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> fight

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
fire then it's going to put the fight

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.320 
fire then it's going to put the fight
like<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.610> water<00:03:41.790> that's<00:03:41.970> gonna<00:03:42.150> put

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
like that on the water that's gonna put

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.760 
like that on the water that's gonna put
a<00:03:42.360> fire<00:03:42.570> out<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.200> it's<00:03:43.440> one<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.590> those<00:03:43.710> things

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
a fire out and it's one of those things

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.350 
a fire out and it's one of those things
although<00:03:44.160> if<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.370> get<00:03:44.490> enough<00:03:44.700> fire<00:03:44.940> then<00:03:45.240> it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
although if you get enough fire then it

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.970 
although if you get enough fire then it
can<00:03:45.540> actually<00:03:45.720> evaporate<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.560> water<00:03:46.590> which

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
can actually evaporate the water which

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.220 
can actually evaporate the water which
is<00:03:47.010> cool<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.480> if<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.600> build<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.900> big<00:03:49.050> enough

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
is cool so if you build a big enough

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.740 
is cool so if you build a big enough
like<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.710> well<00:03:50.130> sing<00:03:50.640> of<00:03:50.760> wardens<00:03:51.210> all<00:03:51.450> here

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
like it well sing of wardens all here

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.180 
like it well sing of wardens all here
for<00:03:51.780> an<00:03:51.990> all-out<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.350> then<00:03:52.440> set<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.620> fire<00:03:52.800> then

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
for an all-out and then set on fire then

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.460 
for an all-out and then set on fire then
it<00:03:53.280> can<00:03:53.400> help<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:53.670> out<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.600> they're<00:03:54.750> also

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
it can help you out you can they're also

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.870 
it can help you out you can they're also
not<00:03:56.100> on<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.220> versus<00:03:56.520> mode<00:03:56.550> here

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
not on the versus mode here

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.580 
not on the versus mode here
unfortunately<00:03:57.600> we<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.870> put<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.110> trash<00:03:58.320> can

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
unfortunately we can put the trash can

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.130 
unfortunately we can put the trash can
lid<00:03:58.770> on<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.820> lead<00:03:59.970> basically<00:04:00.540> helps<00:04:00.900> for

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
lid on and the lead basically helps for

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.570 
lid on and the lead basically helps for
when<00:04:01.260> for<00:04:01.590> example<00:04:01.620> slamming<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.310> bouncy

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
when for example slamming the bouncy

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.100 
when for example slamming the bouncy
balls<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:02.970> if<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.180> quickly<00:04:03.390> summa<00:04:03.810> on

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
balls in if you quickly summa on

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.710 
balls in if you quickly summa on
then<00:04:04.470> it's<00:04:04.620> not<00:04:04.710> gonna<00:04:04.800> bounce<00:04:05.070> out<00:04:05.310> yeah<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
then it's not gonna bounce out yeah the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.970 
then it's not gonna bounce out yeah the
other<00:04:06.840> thing<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.110> do<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.560> might<00:04:07.710> notice

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
other thing to do is you might notice

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.920 
other thing to do is you might notice
the<00:04:08.250> screen<00:04:08.520> gone<00:04:08.730> berserk<00:04:08.930> basically

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
the screen gone berserk basically

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.530 
the screen gone berserk basically
shaking<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.440> sixaxis<00:04:10.800> can<00:04:11.580> cause<00:04:11.880> things<00:04:12.450> to

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
shaking the sixaxis can cause things to

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.210 
shaking the sixaxis can cause things to
voyage<00:04:12.870> around<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.470> basically<00:04:13.620> inspire

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
voyage around and basically inspire

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.980 
voyage around and basically inspire
their<00:04:14.490> it<00:04:14.940> can<00:04:15.150> cause<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.480> fire<00:04:15.630> has<00:04:15.840> spread

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
their it can cause the fire has spread

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.009 
their it can cause the fire has spread
or<00:04:16.470> if<00:04:17.010> its<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.250> Lords<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.700> large<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.870> heavy

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
or if its the Lords of large and heavy

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.690 
or if its the Lords of large and heavy
items<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.530> top<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.799> fragile<00:04:19.950> items<00:04:20.340> are

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
items on top of fragile items are

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.880 
items on top of fragile items are
already<00:04:21.330> partially<00:04:21.600> cracked<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.380> can<00:04:22.560> smash

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
already partially cracked it can smash

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.650 
already partially cracked it can smash
the<00:04:23.160> smaller<00:04:23.430> items<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.970> therefore

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
the smaller items and therefore

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.570 
the smaller items and therefore
obviously<00:04:25.020> give<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.830> more<00:04:26.010> room<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.370> trash

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
obviously give you more room the trash

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.440 
obviously give you more room the trash
can<00:04:26.850> more<00:04:27.150> play<00:04:27.420> with<00:04:27.630> but<00:04:28.760> anyway<00:04:29.760> although

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
can more play with but anyway although

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.790 
can more play with but anyway although

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
what you saw on the multiplayer on board

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.050 
what you saw on the multiplayer on board

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060

so I'm not least massive trash Vania
and<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.510> challenges<00:04:59.870> are<00:05:00.020> good<00:05:00.050> enough<00:05:00.320> to

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
and the challenges are good enough to

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.659 
and the challenges are good enough to
keep<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.740> game<00:05:00.919> going<00:05:00.950> for<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.400> little<00:05:01.520> bit

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
keep the game going for a little bit

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.520 
keep the game going for a little bit
basically<00:05:02.180> because<00:05:02.660> it's<00:05:02.960> not<00:05:03.080> exactly<00:05:03.410> the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
basically because it's not exactly the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.710 
basically because it's not exactly the
most<00:05:03.650> expensive<00:05:04.070> p.m.<00:05:04.460> on<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.700> air<00:05:04.850> PSN<00:05:05.450> and

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
most expensive p.m. on the air PSN and

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.050 
most expensive p.m. on the air PSN and
for<00:05:06.530> that<00:05:06.620> it's<00:05:06.830> not<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.100> largest<00:05:07.310> but<00:05:07.790> what

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
for that it's not the largest but what

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.850 
for that it's not the largest but what
you<00:05:08.150> do<00:05:08.270> get<00:05:08.480> is<00:05:08.660> really<00:05:08.960> good<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.680> also

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
you do get is really good and it is also

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.760 
you do get is really good and it is also
really<00:05:10.280> fun<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.850> addictive<00:05:11.389> game<00:05:11.660> because<00:05:12.470> as

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
really fun and addictive game because as

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.680 
really fun and addictive game because as
I<00:05:12.830> see<00:05:13.070> it<00:05:13.100> this<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:13.730> what<00:05:13.850> i<00:05:13.880> mean<00:05:14.060> by<00:05:14.270> its<00:05:14.450> kind

more MORE I ended up putting it on and
after<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.910> first<00:05:23.210> five<00:05:23.360> minutes<00:05:23.419> of<00:05:23.660> play

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
after the first five minutes of play

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.210 
after the first five minutes of play
let's<00:05:24.020> thinking<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.440> here<00:05:24.650> at<00:05:24.740> this<00:05:24.830> games<00:05:25.040> I

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
let's thinking I here at this games I

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.680 
let's thinking I here at this games I
don't<00:05:25.370> know<00:05:25.430> what<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.639> hell's<00:05:25.820> going<00:05:25.970> on<00:05:26.180> I'll

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690
