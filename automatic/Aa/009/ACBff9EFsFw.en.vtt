um<00:00:00.089> about<00:00:00.930> a<00:00:01.469> good<00:00:01.970> 99.9%<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.570> last<00:00:03.750> video

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
um about a good 99.9% of the last video

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.200 
um about a good 99.9% of the last video
was<00:00:04.290> all<00:00:04.500> based<00:00:04.770> on<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.310> kind<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.609> thing<00:00:05.850> the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
was all based on this kind of thing the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.299 
was all based on this kind of thing the
OL<00:00:06.359> through<00:00:07.140> no<00:00:07.230> purse-string<00:00:10.130> kinda<00:00:11.130> like

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
OL through no purse-string kinda like

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.530 
OL through no purse-string kinda like
picking<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.910> know<00:00:11.940> alternate<00:00:12.389> picking

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
picking you know alternate picking

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.560 
picking you know alternate picking
starting<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.990> downstroke<00:00:17.330> kind<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.390> thing

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
starting with a downstroke kind of thing

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.689 
starting with a downstroke kind of thing
millions<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.590> variations<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.580> it's

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
millions of variations on that and it's

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.650 
millions of variations on that and it's
all<00:00:20.939> based<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.930> being<00:00:22.260> able<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.980> lick

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
all based on being able to do that lick

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.849 
all based on being able to do that lick
you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.779> cleanly<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.529> some<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.710> them

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you know cleanly and with some of them

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.270 
you know cleanly and with some of them
out<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.039> control

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.450 

but<00:00:34.570> one<00:00:35.570> thing<00:00:35.809> that<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:36.620> pretty<00:00:37.040> easy<00:00:37.130> to

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
but one thing that is pretty easy to

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.420 
but one thing that is pretty easy to
forget<00:00:37.879> or<00:00:38.120> must<00:00:38.600> because<00:00:38.989> I've<00:00:39.890> seen<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.190> bunch

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
forget or must because I've seen a bunch

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.549 
forget or must because I've seen a bunch
of<00:00:40.520> people<00:00:40.730> doing<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.379> forgetting<00:00:42.379> about

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
of people doing it is forgetting about

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.210 
of people doing it is forgetting about
things<00:00:42.980> like<00:00:43.100> dynamics<00:00:43.970> and<00:00:44.620> control<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:46.070> the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
things like dynamics and control of the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.939 
things like dynamics and control of the
general<00:00:46.579> tone<00:00:46.940> of<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.269> string<00:00:47.739> by<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:48.920> I

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
general tone of the string by that I

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.619 
general tone of the string by that I
mean<00:00:49.190> like<00:00:49.370> being<00:00:49.790> able<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:50.000> mute<00:00:50.269> it<00:00:50.390> when<00:00:50.510> you

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
mean like being able to mute it when you

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.660 
mean like being able to mute it when you
want<00:00:50.839> to<00:00:50.900> or<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.830> know<00:00:51.920> they<00:00:52.040> have<00:00:52.190> it<00:00:52.280> open

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
want to or you know they have it open

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.150 
want to or you know they have it open
and<00:00:53.000> by<00:00:53.540> dynamics<00:00:54.080> being<00:00:54.290> it'll<00:00:54.410> play<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.680> real

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
and by dynamics being it'll play it real

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.310 
and by dynamics being it'll play it real
light<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.640> muted<00:00:56.150> if<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.330> want<00:00:56.510> or<00:00:56.690> real<00:00:56.930> open

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
light and muted if you want or real open

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.970 
light and muted if you want or real open
and<00:00:57.410> loud<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:59.199> basic<00:01:00.199> way<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.350> practice<00:01:00.829> this

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
and loud and basic way to practice this

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.150 
and loud and basic way to practice this
is<00:01:01.190> just<00:01:01.460> by<00:01:02.020> doing<00:01:03.020> that<00:01:03.320> exact<00:01:03.649> thing<00:01:03.739> a

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
is just by doing that exact thing a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.889 
is just by doing that exact thing a
clean<00:01:04.729> tone<00:01:04.910> helps<00:01:05.270> I<00:01:05.330> mean<00:01:05.449> if<00:01:05.509> you<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.780> let

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
clean tone helps I mean if you to let

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.880 
clean tone helps I mean if you to let
move<00:01:05.960> on<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.140> little<00:01:06.229> bit<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.530> get<00:01:06.649> it<00:01:06.680> like<00:01:06.830> a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
move on a little bit and get it like a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.010 
move on a little bit and get it like a
twinning<00:01:07.160> you<00:01:07.280> kind<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.520> clean<00:01:08.509> tone<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.899> can

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
twinning you kind of clean tone you can

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.010 
twinning you kind of clean tone you can
hear<00:01:09.259> it<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> lot<00:01:09.470> better<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.899> initially<00:01:11.899> just

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
hear it a lot better so initially just

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.700 
hear it a lot better so initially just
try<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.410> that<00:01:12.680> lick<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:17.080> but<00:01:18.080> do<00:01:18.289> it<00:01:18.320> real

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
try that that lick that but do it real

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.680 
try that that lick that but do it real
quiet<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.310> muted<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:19.910> try<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.210> do<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.479> at<00:01:20.570> a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
quiet and muted and try to do it at a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.270 
quiet and muted and try to do it at a
tempo<00:01:21.050> where<00:01:21.410> it's<00:01:21.530> pretty<00:01:21.680> quick<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.190> know

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
tempo where it's pretty quick you know

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.350 
tempo where it's pretty quick you know
that<00:01:22.429> you're<00:01:22.550> comfortable<00:01:22.700> with<00:01:22.970> something

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
that you're comfortable with something

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.870 
that you're comfortable with something
like<00:01:26.560> then<00:01:27.560> try<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.830> same<00:01:28.070> thing<00:01:28.369> but<00:01:28.550> hit<00:01:28.789> it

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
like then try the same thing but hit it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.310 
like then try the same thing but hit it
real<00:01:29.090> hard<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.509> don't<00:01:29.660> mute<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:32.140> then<00:01:33.140> try

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
real hard and don't mute it and then try

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.210 
real hard and don't mute it and then try
to<00:01:33.350> go<00:01:33.530> between<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.860> two<00:01:33.979> different<00:01:34.310> fields

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.690 

if<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.340> can<00:01:43.459> play<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.700> quicker<00:01:43.910> Gregg

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.160 

this<00:01:51.700> takes<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.970> lot<00:01:52.150> more<00:01:52.360> control<00:01:52.720> than<00:01:53.020> just

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
this takes a lot more control than just

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.410 
this takes a lot more control than just
hitting<00:01:53.350> everything<00:01:53.830> with<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.100> same<00:01:54.420> attack

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
hitting everything with the same attack

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.510 
hitting everything with the same attack
in<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.720> same<00:01:55.930> volume<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:57.190> will<00:01:57.310> really

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
in the same volume and this will really

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.469 
in the same volume and this will really
help<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.880> give<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.510> more<00:01:58.720> musical<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
help you to give it a more musical and

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.150 
help you to give it a more musical and
it's<00:02:01.630> put<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:01.930> context<00:02:02.500> musically<00:02:02.950> better

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
it's put it in context musically better

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.550 
it's put it in context musically better
in<00:02:03.610> any<00:02:04.119> way<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.420> play<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:04.960> song<00:02:05.229> or<00:02:05.470> an

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
in any way you play it in a song or an

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.990 
in any way you play it in a song or an
unaccompanied<00:02:06.220> soul<00:02:06.430> give<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.850> lot<00:02:06.970> more

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
unaccompanied soul give you a lot more

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.969 
unaccompanied soul give you a lot more
control<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.020> lot<00:02:08.110> more<00:02:08.229> expressive<00:02:08.679> that

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
control it's a lot more expressive that

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.130 
control it's a lot more expressive that
way<00:02:09.130> with<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.060> store<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.420> with<00:02:10.570> distortion

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
way with the store it with distortion

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.449 
way with the store it with distortion
it'll<00:02:11.260> sound<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.500> little<00:02:11.590> bit<00:02:11.770> more<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:12.100> this

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
it'll sound a little bit more like this

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.740 
it'll sound a little bit more like this
let<00:02:12.880> me<00:02:12.940> try<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.180> like<00:02:13.420> this

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
let me try it like this

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.210 
let me try it like this
I'll<00:02:14.290> hit<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.620> real<00:02:14.800> light<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.220> muted<00:02:15.490> fur

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
I'll hit it real light and muted fur

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:26.850 
I'll hit it real light and muted fur
so<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.280> isn't<00:02:18.430> harder

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.809 

now<00:02:27.860> if<00:02:27.980> you're<00:02:28.099> not<00:02:28.189> comfortable<00:02:28.610> with<00:02:28.700> this

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
now if you're not comfortable with this

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.809 
now if you're not comfortable with this
lick<00:02:29.090> yet<00:02:29.299> or<00:02:29.810> any<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.950> know<00:02:31.040> picking<00:02:31.400> fast

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
lick yet or any you know picking fast

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.089 
lick yet or any you know picking fast
picking<00:02:32.120> things<00:02:32.299> just<00:02:33.079> try<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.379> with<00:02:33.620> maybe<00:02:34.010> a

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
picking things just try it with maybe a

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.759 
picking things just try it with maybe a
single<00:02:34.430> note<00:02:34.790> take<00:02:35.120> like<00:02:35.329> an<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.200> note<00:02:36.409> on<00:02:36.439> the<00:02:36.560> D

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
single note take like an a note on the D

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.250 
single note take like an a note on the D
string<00:02:36.799> or<00:02:37.129> something<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.049> just<00:02:39.049> practice

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
string or something and just practice

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.399 
string or something and just practice
playing<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.129> one<00:02:40.370> note<00:02:41.079> real<00:02:42.079> lightly

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
playing that and one note real lightly

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.530 
playing that and one note real lightly
and<00:02:42.680> real<00:02:42.920> muted<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.400> quiet<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.269> get

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
and real muted and quiet and then get

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.940 
and real muted and quiet and then get
real<00:02:44.810> loud<00:02:45.049> with<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.439> you<00:02:45.560> know<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.650> can<00:02:45.799> take

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
real loud with it you know you can take

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.229 
real loud with it you know you can take
any<00:02:46.099> temp<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.459> want<00:02:46.670> maybe<00:02:46.819> start<00:02:47.090> off<00:02:47.120> with

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
any temp you want maybe start off with

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.000 
any temp you want maybe start off with
something<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:49.150> get<00:02:50.150> louder<00:02:50.420> not<00:02:50.959> faster<00:02:51.500> but

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
something like get louder not faster but

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.039 
something like get louder not faster but
louder<00:02:56.319> now<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.379> actual<00:02:57.650> technique<00:02:58.040> for<00:02:58.189> this

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
louder now the actual technique for this

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.629 
louder now the actual technique for this
isn't<00:03:00.049> necessarily<00:03:00.500> hitting<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.069> much<00:03:01.310> harder

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
isn't necessarily hitting it much harder

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.000 
isn't necessarily hitting it much harder
with<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.790> pick<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:02.510> using<00:03:03.260> more<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.709> pick

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
with a pick but using more of the pick

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.220 
with a pick but using more of the pick
to<00:03:04.609> hit<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.909> which<00:03:05.540> ends<00:03:05.900> up<00:03:05.959> hitting<00:03:06.079> the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
to hit it which ends up hitting the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.259 
to hit it which ends up hitting the
string<00:03:06.500> harder<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:07.189> other<00:03:07.370> words<00:03:07.579> I'm<00:03:07.790> sort<00:03:08.209> of

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
string harder in other words I'm sort of

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.589 
string harder in other words I'm sort of
lowering<00:03:08.769> my<00:03:09.769> my<00:03:10.430> pick<00:03:10.700> into<00:03:10.939> the<00:03:11.150> string<00:03:11.419> when

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
lowering my my pick into the string when

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.789 
lowering my my pick into the string when
I<00:03:11.629> when<00:03:11.870> I'm<00:03:11.959> picking<00:03:12.079> it<00:03:12.230> lightly<00:03:12.409> I'm<00:03:12.590> still

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
I when I'm picking it lightly I'm still

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:13.750 
I when I'm picking it lightly I'm still
putting<00:03:12.919> it<00:03:13.069> pretty<00:03:13.250> hard<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:13.579> you<00:03:13.669> just

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
putting it pretty hard but you just

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.830 
putting it pretty hard but you just
using<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.120> very<00:03:14.299> tip<00:03:14.629> of<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.870> pick<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:16.220> know

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
using the very tip of the pick you know

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.240 
using the very tip of the pick you know
and<00:03:17.840> then<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.049> lower<00:03:18.349> the<00:03:18.530> pick<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.889> to<00:03:19.040> hit<00:03:19.159> it

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
and then I lower the pick in to hit it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.129 
and then I lower the pick in to hit it
harder<00:03:19.519> because<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.760> uses<00:03:19.879> a<00:03:20.030> larger<00:03:20.900> part<00:03:21.109> of

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
harder because it uses a larger part of

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.869 
harder because it uses a larger part of
the<00:03:21.230> pick<00:03:21.439> so<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.739> whacks<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.609> little<00:03:22.760> bit

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
the pick so it whacks it a little bit

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.060 
the pick so it whacks it a little bit
better
