00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello I am your shadow amen today I am going to 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.059
 show how to cut an orange a lot 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.619
 people when it comes to citrus 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.840
 they choose singles like 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.180
 tangerines but the oranges are not so 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.430
 difficult to cut I will show two 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.619
 ways first please do not use a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.390
 giant knife because I see people who 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.699
 he does this all the time and the knife 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.949
 it really should be adequate to the size 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.320
 of the fruit that is cutting so 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.739
 put it on its side I cut one end and the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.989
 another and be careful with your fingers now with 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.120
 very careful slices the skin I've 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.360
 seen people trying to peel an orange 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.220
 with your mouth and teeth and with your nails 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.220
 because they do not like to cut it 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.920
 but this is very easy 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.810
 so you're going to slice around a 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.000
 inch away in this way 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.740
 and what I usually do if I take it from 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.080
 lunch packed her like this 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.780
 and then when I get to work and I want to 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.640
 eat my hair alone so once 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.300
 that you have done this you can easily 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.830
 removing the shell is not a big thing I do not know 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.570
 why people make a scandal 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.150
 when it comes to peeling an orange 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.760
 now remove that and once you've 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.130
 done that you have an option you can 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.070
 open it and you can separate it into sections 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.370
 and it's ready so you can do 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.500
 that 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.290
 now the other way to cut the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.600
 orange is the old way as when 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.820
 the children were playing soccer that is 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.130
 just cut the ends and cut 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.530
 the orange in as many pieces as you want 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.110
 and in this way the orange can be 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.450
 eat directly from the shell it 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.820
 can eat well and the other thing that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.740
 I want to point out is that this white part 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.690
 that many people do not like because they say 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.940
 which is a bit bitter should I try 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.310
 to eat it because that's a good 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.500
 source of healthy fiber in water like this 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.300
 to treat that the other thing of course 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.760
 is that an orange is full of 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.980
 vitamin c an orange provides you 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.050
 all the vitamin c for the day also 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.850
 is a good source of potassium so 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.070
 the next time you are looking 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.510
 citrus pick an orange are 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.510
 really easy to peel
