00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
decided to drop a lightning spell on one

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
decided to drop a lightning spell on one
of<00:00:54.840> my<00:00:55.020> mortars<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> attack<00:00:56.399> from<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> left

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of my mortars and attack from the left

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.420 
of my mortars and attack from the left
side<00:00:57.260> but<00:00:58.260> he<00:00:58.680> still<00:00:58.890> has<00:00:59.010> yet<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> realize

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
side but he still has yet to realize

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
side but he still has yet to realize
that<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> max<00:01:00.270> dragon<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.809> clan

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that I have a max dragon in my clan

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.770 
that I have a max dragon in my clan
castle<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.730> he<00:01:02.789> probably<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.690> his

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
castle and now he probably just his

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.929 
castle and now he probably just his
pants<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:04.920> even<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.339> clan<00:01:05.580> right<00:01:05.760> now

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
pants I'm not even in a clan right now

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.300 
pants I'm not even in a clan right now
so<00:01:06.420> he<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.200> probably<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.619> even<00:01:07.740> expecting

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so he was probably not even expecting

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.500 
so he was probably not even expecting
any<00:01:08.490> troops<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> come<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> clan

he's going to take out this dragon

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
he's going to take out this dragon
because<00:01:16.409> he's<00:01:16.920> got<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> few<00:01:17.340> archers<00:01:17.670> over<00:01:17.850> here

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
