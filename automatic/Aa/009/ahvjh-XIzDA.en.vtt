me but I still two in the relay so he

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
me but I still two in the relay so he
had<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> fight<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> little<00:01:55.860> more<00:01:55.979> okay<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.729> you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
had to fight a little more okay so you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.899 
had to fight a little more okay so you
still<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.210> he<00:01:57.540> has<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> earn<00:01:58.500> his<00:01:58.770> status<00:01:59.579> as

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
still think he has to earn his status as

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
still think he has to earn his status as
the<00:01:59.939> king<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.509> orienteering<00:02:01.020> before<00:02:01.649> he<00:02:01.770> can

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the king of orienteering before he can

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.740 
the king of orienteering before he can
say<00:02:02.219> he's<00:02:02.430> really<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.939> overall<00:02:03.210> king<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.630> all

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.069 
say he's really the overall king of all
time<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:05.700> compare<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.540> all<00:02:06.810> times

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
time I think to compare with all times

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
time I think to compare with all times
is<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.439> little<00:02:07.680> hard<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.310> he's<00:02:08.849> definitely<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
is a little hard but he's definitely a

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.960 
is a little hard but he's definitely a
king<00:02:09.989> or<00:02:10.140> endearing<00:02:10.590> he's<00:02:10.800> been

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
king or endearing he's been

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.290

lifting the sport new heights with this

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.810 
left and it was really diffused so I
stop<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.210> look<00:04:33.540> at<00:04:33.780> my<00:04:34.020> compass<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.820> couldn't

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
stop and look at my compass and couldn't

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.780 
stop and look at my compass and couldn't
see<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.180> but<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:37.560> was<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:37.980> deep<00:04:38.370> inside<00:04:38.760> that

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
see and but it was this deep inside that

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.810 
see and but it was this deep inside that
I<00:04:39.060> had<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.570> go<00:04:39.750> left<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.710> control<00:04:41.400> was<00:04:41.550> just

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
I had to go left and control was just

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.460 
I had to go left and control was just
there<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:43.800> then<00:04:44.120> from<00:04:45.120> there<00:04:45.420> it<00:04:46.170> was<00:04:46.410> a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
there so so then from there it was a

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.910 
there so so then from there it was a
very<00:04:46.860> long<00:04:47.360> leg<00:04:48.360> beginning<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:49.560> leg<00:04:49.770> was

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
very long leg beginning of this leg was

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.430 
very long leg beginning of this leg was
pretty<00:04:50.460> simple<00:04:50.730> but<00:04:51.510> then<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.900> was<00:04:52.080> diffused

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
pretty simple but then it was diffused

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.090 
pretty simple but then it was diffused
and<00:04:52.740> lot<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.100> grain<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.380> immediately<00:04:55.380> saw

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
and lot of grain so I immediately saw

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.800 
and lot of grain so I immediately saw
that<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:56.520> was<00:04:56.700> that

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
that it was that

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.700 
that it was that
so<00:04:58.410> as<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.620> was<00:04:59.160> going<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.700> be<00:05:00.120> play<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:03.710> follow

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
so as I was going to be play so I follow

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.910 
so as I was going to be play so I follow
my<00:05:04.980> compass<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.760> look<00:05:05.910> at<00:05:06.410> small<00:05:07.410> controls

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
my compass and look at small controls

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.230 
my compass and look at small controls
and<00:05:08.220> I<00:05:08.310> think<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:09.740> managed<00:05:10.740> quite<00:05:11.010> well<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.580> was

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
and I think I managed quite well and was

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.440 
and I think I managed quite well and was
it<00:05:12.450> between<00:05:12.780> Chicago<00:05:13.260> sometime<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:14.450> didn't

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
it between Chicago sometime that didn't

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.710 
it between Chicago sometime that didn't
slow<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.990> pace<00:05:16.170> and<00:05:17.180> from<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.360> control

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
slow the pace and from the control

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.350 
slow the pace and from the control
perfectly<00:05:19.340> so<00:05:20.340> then<00:05:20.840> rice<00:05:21.840> was<00:05:23.090> much<00:05:24.090> more

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
perfectly so then rice was much more

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.690 
perfectly so then rice was much more
easier<00:05:24.630> I<00:05:24.720> think<00:05:25.040> when<00:05:26.040> when<00:05:26.310> did<00:05:26.430> you<00:05:26.550> know

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
easier I think when when did you know

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.240 
easier I think when when did you know
when<00:05:27.330> that<00:05:27.570> that<00:05:28.290> this<00:05:28.440> was<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.860> could<00:05:29.040> enough

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
when that that this was I could enough

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.080 
when that that this was I could enough
for<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:30.330> gold<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:31.500> never<00:05:31.770> know<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.970> never

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
for the gold you never know you never

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.060 
for the gold you never know you never
know<00:05:33.240> because<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:36.120> always<00:05:36.780> difficult<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.530> I

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
know because it's always difficult to I

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.630 
know because it's always difficult to I
felt<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.330> a<00:05:39.360> good<00:05:39.600> day<00:05:39.750> but<00:05:39.990> someone<00:05:40.770> asked<00:05:40.980> can

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
felt in a good day but someone asked can

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.130 
felt in a good day but someone asked can
also<00:05:41.790> be<00:05:42.390> in<00:05:42.450> a<00:05:42.600> good<00:05:42.810> day

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
also be in a good day

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.490 
also be in a good day
so<00:05:45.350> only<00:05:47.270> one<00:05:48.270> control<00:05:48.600> before<00:05:48.780> suspected

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
so only one control before suspected

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.180 
so only one control before suspected
ablaze<00:05:49.830> hired<00:05:50.280> that<00:05:50.720> crow<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:51.750> sharing<00:05:52.380> for

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
ablaze hired that crow a sharing for

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.360 
ablaze hired that crow a sharing for
Novikov<00:05:53.640> so<00:05:53.910> I<00:05:54.200> immediately<00:05:55.200> notice<00:05:56.190> that<00:05:56.220> I

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
Novikov so I immediately notice that I

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.100 
Novikov so I immediately notice that I
had<00:05:57.030> a<00:05:57.060> good<00:05:57.540> position<00:05:58.280> but<00:05:59.720> right<00:06:00.720> after<00:06:00.870> the

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
had a good position but right after the

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.580 
had a good position but right after the
speak<00:06:01.890> to<00:06:01.980> talk<00:06:02.130> control<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:02.670> felt<00:06:03.480> bit<00:06:04.230> I<00:06:04.410> read

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
speak to talk control I felt bit I read

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.970 
speak to talk control I felt bit I read
but<00:06:05.190> look<00:06:05.640> at<00:06:05.790> the<00:06:06.300> whole<00:06:06.450> course<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:07.110> so<00:06:07.830> it

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
but look at the whole course and so it

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.420 
but look at the whole course and so it
was<00:06:08.160> pretty<00:06:08.610> easy<00:06:08.850> n<00:06:09.890> so<00:06:10.890> I<00:06:11.610> just<00:06:12.420> I<00:06:13.250> said<00:06:14.250> it

was<00:06:14.610> mix<00:06:15.360> of<00:06:15.510> feeling<00:06:15.930> because<00:06:16.740> I<00:06:16.770> tried<00:06:17.460> to<00:06:17.670> to

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
was mix of feeling because I tried to to

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.530 
was mix of feeling because I tried to to
stay<00:06:18.570> focused<00:06:18.990> but<00:06:19.170> my<00:06:19.920> mind<00:06:20.190> was<00:06:20.400> a<00:06:20.540> little

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
stay focused but my mind was a little

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.720 
stay focused but my mind was a little
bit<00:06:22.100> Woodside<00:06:23.100> again<00:06:23.460> but<00:06:23.760> it<00:06:24.240> was<00:06:24.450> both<00:06:25.730> nice

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:40.499 
to wake up during the night and think a

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:42.679 
to wake up during the night and think a
lot<00:07:40.650> about<00:07:40.830> this<00:07:41.580> myth<00:07:41.759> mistake<00:07:42.360> had<00:07:42.539> the

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:42.689 
lot about this myth mistake had the

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:44.149 
lot about this myth mistake had the
force<00:07:42.900> control<00:07:43.259> so<00:07:43.500> now<00:07:43.710> I'm<00:07:43.889> pretty

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 
force control so now I'm pretty

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:46.909 
force control so now I'm pretty
satisfied<00:07:44.580> because<00:07:45.120> I<00:07:45.589> think<00:07:46.589> there<00:07:46.770> will<00:07:46.860> be

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 
satisfied because I think there will be

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:49.790 
satisfied because I think there will be
less<00:07:47.610> and<00:07:47.639> less<00:07:47.909> people<00:07:48.089> we<00:07:48.870> will<00:07:49.050> remember

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 
less and less people we will remember

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.399 
less and less people we will remember

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:52.409 
this force control and less and less

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:57.740 
this force control and less and less
people<00:07:52.710> will<00:07:53.960> say<00:07:55.460> 2006<00:07:56.460> was<00:07:56.819> a<00:07:56.849> disaster<00:07:57.539> for
