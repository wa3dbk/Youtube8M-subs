00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.009
 hi everyone this is anais and 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.440
 today we find ourselves for a tutorial 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.110
 I was really excited to start 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.239
 it is of course techland makeup 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.809
 are in american horror story season 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.030
 a 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.050
 so for those who do not know 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.650
 concretely already I do not address you 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.410
 more speech 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.420
 american horror story it's my bible by 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.339
 excellence I loved the season a 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.280
 I loved the season 2 I 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.710
 loved the season 3 the 4 just enormously 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.440
 I really advise you to go see 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 this series because it is or a dock 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.339
 role of dog makeup was not 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 created directly through the series they 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.790
 were simply inspired by a 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.950
 man called rick youth and who 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.240
 is fully tattooed from this 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.560
 way and you probably know him 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.869
 under another name since that's all 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.890
 just zombie boy this is a 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.689
 makeup that is relatively 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.540
 difficult to do since it is 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.159
 very detailed from everywhere you have 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.200
 a lot of shadows you have the 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.210
 shot also that is extremely detailed 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.080
 with all his sons and again the addition 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.880
 soft effects 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.290
 Basically the real makeup there is 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.119
 everywhere and also what I have a lot 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.460
 loved dance makeup is we do not 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.940
 do not think of the anti the power of the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.410
 melanin 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.000
 as usual all the products that 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.370
 I use are displayed in the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.560
 description and of course you can like 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.320
 commented share it will not do the most 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.730
 great pleasure to start this makeup 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.470
 we do not forget that two basses and one 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.790
 tattoo so I'm just going to clear up 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.050
 my complexion using a stick 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.350
 slightly lighter than my skin tone 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.350
 natural 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.220
 the beauty that's that it's done then I 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.050
 distributed all of the material on 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.729
 my face and I finish this step with 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.290
 a pre-cut sponge to clear the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.820
 marks caused by the brush one sets the 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.410
 all with a loose powder and of course 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.700
 we avoid to restore them so as not to 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.530
 die to success to help me in the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.730
 realization of our fake tattoos I 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.440
 use a sketch I made 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.510
 shortly before and some photos 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.650
 taken on the internet and then I started 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.540
 black kohl pencil 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.770
 so concretely I will not show 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.209
 every time the steps if we are 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.739
 still there in two hours you put 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.540
 although I'm doing exactly the same 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.720
 thing on the right and left side of my 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.720
 face 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.410
 and please stay logical 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.880
 do not hesitate to spend your jaws 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.739
 to locate the location of your 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.270
 teeth your result will be much more 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.489
 beautiful and especially much more realistic 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.320
 is the same with their density makes enough 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.970
 to avoid teething the squirrel is 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.150
 not too much either pull mecca teeth 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.150
 of the sea 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.690
 with the dead vintage color I fill the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.340
 empty spaces and when the areas 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.870
 asks for a little more precision like 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.620
 usually I prefer to use a 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.620
 brush liner 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.170
 I slightly erase the features in the center 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.760
 of my teeth to give volume to 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.650
 this one is against to create the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.700
 volumes within my face I use 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.700
 matte gray eyeshadow 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.090
 for the ears you're going to shit it 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.439
 there is no other term trying to do 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.939
 a pseudo cobweb to 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.069
 inside one of them is 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.060
 a horror so I confess I bac the 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.169
 do not leave something that I 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.669
 will keep very long on the 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.400
 consciousness because it is a little 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.990
 important so we do not care 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.669
 patience because now attacks 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.469
 cookies and filled with details 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.300
 in any kind more complex ones than 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.830
 the others as for the face we do 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.430
 be careful to stay logical with her 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.500
 anatomy 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.360
 and if we are wrong we use instead to 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.099
 count stems to clear the error to 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.389
 the place of our fingers at any other 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.509
 something that could aggravate the 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.509
 situation 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.720
 we take the dead crime color for 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.100
 to go back on the vertebrae and besides 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.800
 I want to apologize because they are 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.920
 really his how would i say 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.540
 they are ignoble thank you so I 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.160
 apologize to science as well as 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.720
 all my old bio teachers I 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.190
 continue to iron on the pencils 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.660
 kohl and once the plots are 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.900
 finished I also fill the spaces 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.900
 empty 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.889
 in terms of muscle to stern 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.389
 early daumas customers indian and no i did not 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.949
 not learned this name for the sake of the 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.449
 bring out that is not exciting 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.520
 he just traumatized me during 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.169
 my studies we use the technique of 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.000
 the snatch which is to make hatching 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.349
 to mimic muscle fibers and 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.160
 for that we equip ourselves with makeup 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.160
 brumath eyelids 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.990
 with this lighthouse we catch up with the trifecta 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.920
 vertebrae by constituting a set of shadows 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.920
 on each of them 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.690
 and as you know a tattoo of 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.610
 many years is never 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.440
 completely black so we're getting older 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.360
 color by depositing a brown lighthouse 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.500
 you put on a pretty black T-shirt 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.720
 close to the shot to hide the 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.220
 demarcation of makeup we add 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.690
 then hooded you lake and your 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.120
 hair back and you take 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:18.110
 pleasure to be the exact copy of head 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.400
