have a Windows 8 desktop or notebook

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.700 
have a Windows 8 desktop or notebook
when<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.389> turn<00:00:09.600> on<00:00:09.750> Windows<00:00:10.080> 8<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.650> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
when you turn on Windows 8 it's going to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.770 
when you turn on Windows 8 it's going to
look<00:00:10.800> like<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.760> is<00:00:12.059> essentially<00:00:12.630> what

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
look like this this is essentially what

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.330 
look like this this is essentially what
you're<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> see<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:14.070> is

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
you're going to see and what you have is

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.269 
you're going to see and what you have is
a<00:00:15.090> series<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.890> tiles<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.099> there<00:00:17.220> are

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
a series of tiles and there are

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.519 
a series of tiles and there are
essentially<00:00:17.610> shortcuts<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.360> apps<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.990> email

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
essentially shortcuts to apps to email

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.029 
essentially shortcuts to apps to email
to<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> Internet<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.720> they<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.529> reside<00:00:22.710> in

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
to the Internet and they all reside in

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.160 
to the Internet and they all reside in
this<00:00:23.190> space<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:23.699> Microsoft<00:00:24.660> used<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> call

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
this space now Microsoft used to call

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.380 
this space now Microsoft used to call
this<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.500> Metro<00:00:25.920> interface<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.180> been

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
this the Metro interface that have been

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.380 
this the Metro interface that have been
some<00:00:27.570> coffee<00:00:27.840> white<00:00:28.080> copyright<00:00:28.830> claims<00:00:29.390> made

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
some coffee white copyright claims made

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.000 
some coffee white copyright claims made
against<00:00:30.660> Microsoft<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.350> now<00:00:31.529> they've<00:00:31.769> just

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
against Microsoft so now they've just

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.460 
against Microsoft so now they've just
calling<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.519> Windows<00:00:32.760> 8<00:00:33.000> desktop<00:00:33.660> or

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
calling it the Windows 8 desktop or

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.950 
calling it the Windows 8 desktop or
Windows<00:00:34.739> 8<00:00:35.040> interface<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.809> very

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
Windows 8 interface and it's very

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.299 
Windows 8 interface and it's very
similar<00:00:37.199> to<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.409> you<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.800> Windows<00:00:38.070> Phone

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
similar to what you see on Windows Phone

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
similar to what you see on Windows Phone
7<00:00:38.760> Windows<00:00:39.059> Phone<00:00:39.239> 8<00:00:39.479> the<00:00:39.780> new<00:00:39.900> xbox<00:00:40.350> dashboard

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
7 Windows Phone 8 the new xbox dashboard

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.590 
7 Windows Phone 8 the new xbox dashboard
so<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.549> really<00:00:41.699> the<00:00:41.820> Microsoft's<00:00:42.390> look

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
so this is really the Microsoft's look

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450 
so this is really the Microsoft's look
going<00:00:43.019> forward<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.159> see<00:00:44.190> it's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
going forward and as you can see it's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.890 
going forward and as you can see it's
very<00:00:44.519> swipe<00:00:45.030> friendly<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.720> big

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
very swipe friendly these are big

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.860 
very swipe friendly these are big
colorful<00:00:46.350> icons<00:00:46.879> now<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.120> users<00:00:48.420> who<00:00:48.449> prefer

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
colorful icons now for users who prefer

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.899 
colorful icons now for users who prefer
the<00:00:49.019> traditional<00:00:49.170> desktop<00:00:49.979> that's<00:00:50.519> there<00:00:50.760> as

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
the traditional desktop that's there as

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.280 
the traditional desktop that's there as
well<00:00:51.089> they'll<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.659> tucked<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
well they'll be tucked here in the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.799 
well they'll be tucked here in the
corner<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.799> again<00:00:53.400> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:54.030> open<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.510> say

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
corner and again you can open up say

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.590 
corner and again you can open up say
office<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.589> Internet<00:00:56.580> Explorer<00:00:56.970> through<00:00:57.330> here

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
office or Internet Explorer through here

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600 
office or Internet Explorer through here
just<00:00:58.290> as<00:00:58.409> you<00:00:58.530> would<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> Windows<00:00:59.250> 7

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
just as you would with a Windows 7

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.299 
just as you would with a Windows 7
machine<00:01:00.019> but<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.140> big<00:01:01.290> thing<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.530> that's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
machine but the big thing is that's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.219 
machine but the big thing is that's
missing<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> start<00:01:03.390> button<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.049> used

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
missing is that start button that used

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
missing is that start button that used
to<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.440> right<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.860> where<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.369> would<00:01:05.519> scroll

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to be right there where it would scroll

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.490 
to be right there where it would scroll
up<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> could<00:01:06.510> see<00:01:06.719> all<00:01:06.869> your<00:01:07.020> apps<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
up and you could see all your apps and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
up and you could see all your apps and
shortcuts<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.100> apps<00:01:08.250> instead<00:01:09.060> that's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
shortcuts to your apps instead that's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.560 
shortcuts to your apps instead that's
been<00:01:09.689> replaced<00:01:10.079> by<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:11.039> right<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.579> so<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
been replaced by this right here so the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.760 
been replaced by this right here so the
big<00:01:12.719> thing<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.649> be<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
big thing is this is going to be a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.990 
big thing is this is going to be a
learning<00:01:14.130> curve<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.399> is<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.820> tough

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
learning curve this is going to be tough

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
learning curve this is going to be tough
for<00:01:15.149> people<00:01:15.329> to<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.259> get<00:01:16.380> used<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
for people to to get used to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
for people to to get used to
particularly<00:01:17.579> if<00:01:17.729> they're<00:01:17.850> used<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> Windows

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
particularly if they're used to Windows

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.889 
particularly if they're used to Windows
XP<00:01:18.719> or<00:01:18.869> Windows<00:01:19.200> 7<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.429> I<00:01:20.579> said<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.539> very

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
XP or Windows 7 but as I said it is very

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.630 
XP or Windows 7 but as I said it is very
touch<00:01:22.170> friendly<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.039> tablet<00:01:23.460> friendly

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
touch friendly is very tablet friendly

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
touch friendly is very tablet friendly
you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.750> navigate<00:01:24.929> this<00:01:25.289> with<00:01:25.469> cursor<00:01:25.829> keys

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you can navigate this with cursor keys

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.410 
you can navigate this with cursor keys
or<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.520> mouse<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.329> more

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
or with the mouse it's a little more

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.690 
or with the mouse it's a little more
clumsy<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.079> Microsoft<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.979> seriously

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
clumsy but Microsoft is seriously

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.849 
clumsy but Microsoft is seriously
looking<00:01:30.149> at<00:01:30.359> tablets<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.020> touch<00:01:31.170> devices<00:01:31.530> as

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
looking at tablets and touch devices as

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.219 
looking at tablets and touch devices as
the<00:01:32.009> future<00:01:32.399> of<00:01:32.549> computing<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.270> that's<00:01:34.049> why

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the future of computing and that's why

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.440 
the future of computing and that's why
we<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
we have this right here so the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.999 
we have this right here so the
interesting<00:01:36.899> thing<00:01:37.289> here<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> there's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
interesting thing here is there's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.340 
interesting thing here is there's
basically<00:01:38.280> two<00:01:38.549> levels<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.210> applications<00:01:39.840> now

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
basically two levels of applications now

through apps just by swiping and of
course<00:04:02.949> you<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.400> always<00:04:03.519> go<00:04:03.729> back<00:04:03.759> by<00:04:04.060> swiping

course you can always go back by swiping
that<00:04:04.599> way<00:04:04.750> it's<00:04:05.199> a<00:04:05.290> very<00:04:05.470> swipe<00:04:05.799> centric

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
that way it's a very swipe centric

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.129 
that way it's a very swipe centric
design<00:04:06.250> which<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:06.970> why<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.150> mines<00:04:07.689> itself<00:04:08.019> to

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
design which is why it mines itself to

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.349 
design which is why it mines itself to
tablets<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:09.400> also<00:04:09.699> if<00:04:09.909> you<00:04:09.970> have<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.090> really

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
tablets on and also if you have a really

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.360 
tablets on and also if you have a really
good<00:04:10.479> track<00:04:10.599> pad<00:04:10.900> on<00:04:11.049> your<00:04:11.079> notepad<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:12.220> could

good track pad on your notepad you could

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.069 
good track pad on your notepad you could
probably<00:04:12.549> mimic<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.329> swipes<00:04:13.569> that<00:04:13.750> way<00:04:13.930> as

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
probably mimic the swipes that way as
