00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.180
 in this video he speaks to them in the nerve 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.970
 engine our team is conformed 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.250
 shape and in red lara and will make jiménez 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.760
 ramirez 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.070
 good with an engine is part of the 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.420
 cranial nerves and their nomenclature in 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.120
 Roman numerals that number 3 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.600
 first we will start to see you a little 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.600
 of its history 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.050
 hippocrates in a very old task 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.720
 classify the nerves together with 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.179
 ligaments and tendons as elements 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.609
 corresponding to water 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:42.129
 later Aristotle was the one who 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:46.079
 separated saying that some were 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.079
 brain ducts 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.450
 later the off and distinguished him 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.740
 the sensitive nerves 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.740
 of motor nerves 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.460
 the parent channels were named 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.309
 mainly with Roman numerals and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.650
 they carry an order of full phallus to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.410
 exception of the first and the second pair 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.410
 which are extensions of the brain 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.610
 Well, now we'll talk about 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.470
 development of the locomotor nerve from the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.470
 normal embryonic development 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.560
 during the fifth to the sixth week it 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.140
 form the twelve appear in alex that 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.860
 classify 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.510
 in three according to its neurological origin 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.500
 These are divided into 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.720
 different somatic cranial nerves 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.780
 nerves of the pharynx and nerves 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.820
 sensitive us this time 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.800
 we will focus on the origin of the two 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.800
 different somatic channels 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.939
 the blacks blowing is eye motor 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.939
 external hypoglossal in most of the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.479
 motor and common cure are homologous to 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.519
 roots windows of the spinal nerves 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.180
 this is because the nerves from where 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:18.660
 originate these nerves are in the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.150
 somatic deferential column and this one 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.150
 derives from the basal plates 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.769
 their shares are distributed in the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.950
 muscles that are derived in children 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.019
 you take the middle of the head or with the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.359
 rotor and minerva therefore the biggest 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.010
 part of the muscles that are derived in 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.010
 the first minute optical mapre 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.910
 and we can see the nuclei 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.440
 and good 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.390
 the large motor mass located in the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.550
 peduncles at the level of 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.530
 tubers cuadre twins 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.420
 previous and in front of the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.440
 producer of the serva 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.370
 the parasympathetic nucleus an engine 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.269
 this is the core of 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.790
 hellinger shows a pupillary nucleus that 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.319
 is without all to be and therefore of the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.409
 I presented 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:22.099
 this is a sad core is a core 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.099
 photon motor and photo accumulator 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.410
 well, it means the path that 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.780
 that follows this to create the engine or 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.060
 play common after the trunk emerges 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.690
 of the brain is directed outwards 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.820
 up and down through the artery 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.240
 posterior brain and artery 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.330
 superior cerebellar then penetrate the 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.560
 outer wall of the cavernous sinus 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.530
 being located above the area a 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.750
 pathetic and the ophthalmic goes to the wall 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.030
 external for the portion before vélez in a 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.240
 cavernous and penetrates into the orbits 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.810
 going through the espanyol dividing in 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.590
 two terminal branches that cross the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.590
 i mean 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.209
 that is one of the most popular and is the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.120
 responsible for the size of the pupil 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.070
 being this its function for sympathetic the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.650
 black is responsible for giving an invasion to 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.870
 the muscles of the eye 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.110
 takes the levator palpebrae muscles 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.830
 superior the world rectus muscle or 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.880
 internal rectus superior rectus inferior and 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.880
 I lower public 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.330
 there we can see an image of the 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.660
 muscles to which it innervates this to 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.660
 grow 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.380
 and good finally we will see that the 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.420
 examination of the correct of the correct 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.600
 operation is performed in a manner 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.800
 very simple which is done 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.750
 the patient without an object with sight 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.490
 moving the muscle value as it is 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.490
 see in the present image 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.120
 and then this is all
