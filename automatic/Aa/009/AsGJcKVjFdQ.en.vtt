skipping<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.420> radiance<00:01:27.869> step<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:29.159> going

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
skipping the radiance step and I'm going

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
skipping the radiance step and I'm going
to<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> radius<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.909> by<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.540> /

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
to do the radius that by now so you /

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.969 
to do the radius that by now so you /
guard<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.210> pick<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:34.710> amount

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
guard this and then you pick the amount

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.130 
guard this and then you pick the amount
of<00:01:35.100> blocks<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.030> radius<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.720> want<00:01:36.990> the

name<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.979> mob<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.269> would<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690

attack<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:11.540> kill<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.930> out<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.620> search<00:02:13.860> for

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
attack and kill go out and search for

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.140 
attack and kill go out and search for
that<00:02:14.250> mob<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.150> killing<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:19.940> didn't<00:02:20.940> give<00:02:21.060> them

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
that mob and killing I didn't give them

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640 
that mob and killing I didn't give them
a<00:02:21.180> weapon<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.599> he's<00:02:21.690> not<00:02:21.840> very<00:02:22.019> effective<00:02:22.260> but

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
a weapon so he's not very effective but

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.400 
a weapon so he's not very effective but
it's<00:02:22.799> working<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:27.410> once<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.709> got<00:02:29.370> that

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
it's working and so once you got that

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.449 
it's working and so once you got that
down<00:02:32.810> another<00:02:33.810> thing<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.349> do<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.280> like

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
down another thing you can do it is like

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.479 
down another thing you can do it is like
this<00:02:35.640> /<00:02:36.420> guard<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:39.319> like<00:02:40.319> here's<00:02:41.250> how<00:02:41.400> this

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
this / guard and like here's how this

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.289 
this / guard and like here's how this
works<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:42.650> flag<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.950> something<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> guard

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
works a flag is something that the guard

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.059 
works a flag is something that the guard
will<00:02:45.360> pay<00:02:45.480> attention<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.769> type<00:02:46.890> any

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
will pay attention to you can type any

my<00:03:05.069> tramp<00:03:05.400> thought<00:03:05.670> now

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.819 

oh<00:03:09.849> yeah<00:03:11.430> priori<00:03:12.430> now<00:03:13.030> one<00:03:13.629> priority<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
oh yeah priori now one priority is the

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.089 
oh yeah priori now one priority is the
most<00:03:14.980> important<00:03:15.400> for<00:03:15.549> example<00:03:15.909> if<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.840> add<00:03:17.109> 2

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
most important for example if you add 2

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.699 
most important for example if you add 2
flex<00:03:18.489> we've<00:03:18.909> got<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.420> sheep<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.200> chicken<00:03:20.469> and

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
flex we've got a sheep and a chicken and

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.679 
flex we've got a sheep and a chicken and
they're<00:03:21.129> standing<00:03:21.400> beside<00:03:21.549> each<00:03:21.700> other<00:03:21.909> one

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
they're standing beside each other one

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.539 
they're standing beside each other one
of<00:03:22.719> them<00:03:22.900> has<00:03:23.079> level<00:03:23.349> one<00:03:23.469> priority<00:03:23.920> one<00:03:24.280> is

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
of them has level one priority one is

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.490 
of them has level one priority one is
level<00:03:24.790> two<00:03:24.969> which<00:03:25.569> everyone<00:03:25.930> has<00:03:26.079> level<00:03:26.379> one

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
level two which everyone has level one

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.750 
level two which everyone has level one
priorities<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.220> one<00:03:27.340> who's<00:03:27.459> going<00:03:27.579> to<00:03:27.640> get

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
priorities the one who's going to get

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.280 
priorities the one who's going to get
intact<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.329> want<00:03:31.569> to<00:03:31.840> set<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.019> priority

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
intact so if you want to set a priority

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.170 
intact so if you want to set a priority
it's<00:03:32.680> not<00:03:32.859> necessary<00:03:33.340> but<00:03:33.519> if<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.730> do<00:03:33.939> then

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
it's not necessary but if you do then

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.339 
it's not necessary but if you do then
you'll<00:03:34.329> attack<00:03:34.569> something<00:03:34.870> first<00:03:35.109> for

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
you'll attack something first for

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.899 
you'll attack something first for
example<00:03:35.799> if<00:03:35.889> you<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.069> a<00:03:36.159> bodyguard<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.760> can

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
example if you have a bodyguard you can

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.099 
example if you have a bodyguard you can
make<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.359> those<00:03:37.540> ripped<00:03:37.870> clothes

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
make it so that those ripped clothes

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.500 
make it so that those ripped clothes
he'll<00:03:38.530> attack<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:39.010> first<00:03:39.250> then<00:03:39.849> second<00:03:40.389> thing

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
he'll attack you first then second thing

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.530 
he'll attack you first then second thing
and<00:03:40.629> I'll<00:03:40.689> attack<00:03:40.900> his<00:03:41.079> fighters<00:03:41.500> then

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
and I'll attack his fighters then

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.679 
and I'll attack his fighters then
there's<00:03:43.540> no<00:03:43.689> spiders<00:03:44.049> around<00:03:44.170> go<00:03:44.409> attack

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
there's no spiders around go attack

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.780 
there's no spiders around go attack
skeletons<00:03:46.689> you<00:03:47.409> get<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.709> idea<00:03:47.739> will<00:03:48.549> you<00:03:48.639> do

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
skeletons you get the idea will you do

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.379 
skeletons you get the idea will you do
as<00:03:48.939> a<00:03:48.970> slash<00:03:49.530> guard<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.129> let<00:03:51.819> you<00:03:52.000> type<00:03:52.209> in<00:03:52.359> the

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
as a slash guard and let you type in the

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.530 
as a slash guard and let you type in the
priority<00:03:52.900> here<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.230> was<00:03:53.409> between<00:03:53.590> 1<00:03:54.359> 320<00:03:55.359> lat

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
priority here this was between 1 320 lat

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.420 
priority here this was between 1 320 lat
I<00:03:55.780> believe<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:57.010> Priority<00:03:57.639> One<00:03:57.669> will<00:03:58.389> be<00:03:58.659> a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
I believe so Priority One will be a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.500 
I believe so Priority One will be a
monster<00:04:00.430> or<00:04:00.930> river<00:04:01.930> now<00:04:03.209> there's<00:04:04.209> ever<00:04:04.419> a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
monster or river now there's ever a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.909 
monster or river now there's ever a
creeper<00:04:04.810> inner<00:04:05.019> body<00:04:05.230> no<00:04:05.470> matter<00:04:05.590> what

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
creeper inner body no matter what
