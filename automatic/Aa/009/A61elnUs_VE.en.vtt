00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
actually first pretty well in pvp as

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.160 
actually first pretty well in pvp as
well<00:03:18.520> but<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.300> like<00:03:19.420> over<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:20.050> know

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
well but it's not like over you know

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.320 
well but it's not like over you know
standing<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:20.860> sense<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:22.090> i<00:03:22.120> would

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
standing in that sense so i would

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.120 
standing in that sense so i would
definitely<00:03:22.360> pick<00:03:22.810> up<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.080> veil<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.560> if<00:03:23.890> i<00:03:23.980> had

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
definitely pick up the veil as if i had

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.710 
definitely pick up the veil as if i had
to<00:03:24.280> pick<00:03:24.430> between<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:25.180> one<00:03:25.299> now<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.660> i

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
to pick between that one now that i

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.180 
to pick between that one now that i
think<00:03:25.750> i<00:03:25.959> would<00:03:26.019> highly<00:03:26.410> recommend<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:27.130> to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
think i would highly recommend is to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.370 
think i would highly recommend is to
always<00:03:27.790> check<00:03:28.180> your<00:03:28.239> veil<00:03:28.630> with<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.170> one<00:03:29.350> you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
always check your veil with the one you

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.080 
always check your veil with the one you
currently<00:03:29.799> have<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.190> for<00:03:30.670> example<00:03:30.760> i<00:03:31.060> have

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
currently have so for example i have

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
change the one I have but one 21 is that

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.410

that<00:03:50.410> far<00:03:50.620> off<00:03:50.650> for<00:03:51.010> 130<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:51.790> i<00:03:52.000> would

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
that far off for 130 so i would

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
and upgrading its i would probably hold

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.199 
and upgrading its i would probably hold
back<00:03:55.989> but<00:03:56.260> if<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.340> do<00:03:57.519> plan<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.880> picking<00:03:58.150> this

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
back but if you do plan to picking this

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.660 
back but if you do plan to picking this
one<00:03:58.390> i'll<00:03:58.810> probably<00:03:59.709> first<00:04:00.160> pick<00:04:00.400> up<00:04:00.549> the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
one i'll probably first pick up the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.330 
one i'll probably first pick up the
exotic<00:04:01.090> ingram<00:04:01.420> first<00:04:01.780> before<00:04:02.739> picking<00:04:03.070> up

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
exotic ingram first before picking up

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.430 
exotic ingram first before picking up
the<00:04:03.489> eating<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:03.970> Veil<00:04:04.239> just<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:05.080> double

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.890 
probably can get it off an exotic ingram
and<00:04:09.130> waste<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.880> month<00:04:10.090> instead<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.630> wasting
