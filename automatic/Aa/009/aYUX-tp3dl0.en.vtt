alright<00:00:02.620> since<00:00:02.860> last<00:00:03.100> time<00:00:03.399> I<00:00:03.429> took<00:00:03.760> the<00:00:03.909> video

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.210 
alright since last time I took the video

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.809 
alright since last time I took the video
I<00:00:04.480> went<00:00:05.259> ahead<00:00:05.350> and<00:00:05.680> installed<00:00:05.950> the<00:00:06.279> shelves

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:06.819 
I went ahead and installed the shelves

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:08.970 
I went ahead and installed the shelves
that<00:00:06.970> you<00:00:07.089> see<00:00:07.359> there<00:00:07.600> as<00:00:07.959> well<00:00:08.740> as<00:00:08.860> the<00:00:08.950> e

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
that you see there as well as the e

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.240 
that you see there as well as the e
chain<00:00:09.840> well<00:00:10.840> it's<00:00:11.620> kind<00:00:11.769> of<00:00:11.830> getting<00:00:11.950> a<00:00:12.160> little

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
chain well it's kind of getting a little

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.829 
chain well it's kind of getting a little
bit<00:00:12.429> closer<00:00:12.639> so<00:00:12.820> you<00:00:13.059> can<00:00:13.179> see<00:00:13.389> how<00:00:13.480> I<00:00:13.509> did<00:00:13.719> that

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:13.839 
bit closer so you can see how I did that

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.590 
bit closer so you can see how I did that
connection<00:00:14.879> pretty<00:00:15.879> much<00:00:16.000> similar<00:00:16.270> to<00:00:16.420> what<00:00:16.570> I

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
connection pretty much similar to what I

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.690 
connection pretty much similar to what I
talked<00:00:16.840> about<00:00:17.050> before<00:00:17.200> with<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:17.700> angle

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
talked about before with the angle

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.850 
talked about before with the angle
bracket<00:00:19.090> tree<00:00:19.300> and<00:00:20.080> everything<00:00:20.650> is<00:00:20.740> getting

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
bracket tree and everything is getting

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.860 
bracket tree and everything is getting
run<00:00:21.130> through<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.490> grommet<00:00:22.120> that<00:00:22.240> I<00:00:22.270> cut<00:00:22.540> into

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:22.870 
run through the grommet that I cut into

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.890 
run through the grommet that I cut into
the<00:00:23.560> side<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.850> other<00:00:24.940> side<00:00:25.240> is<00:00:25.480> pretty<00:00:25.660> much

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
the side the other side is pretty much

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.630 
the side the other side is pretty much
exactly<00:00:26.260> the<00:00:26.500> same<00:00:26.740> thing<00:00:27.040> I'll<00:00:27.310> walk<00:00:27.490> over

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
exactly the same thing I'll walk over

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.060 
exactly the same thing I'll walk over
there<00:00:27.880> real<00:00:28.030> quick<00:00:28.240> so<00:00:28.420> you<00:00:28.510> can<00:00:28.690> see<00:00:31.920> I've<00:00:32.920> got

the<00:01:09.700> machine<00:01:09.790> I<00:01:10.300> also<00:01:11.080> went<00:01:11.440> ahead<00:01:11.500> and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
the machine I also went ahead and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.190 
the machine I also went ahead and
upgraded<00:01:12.280> my<00:01:12.490> limit<00:01:12.790> switches<00:01:13.030> before<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:13.780> was

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
upgraded my limit switches before I was

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.060 
upgraded my limit switches before I was
going<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.409> use<00:01:14.650> these<00:01:14.860> smaller<00:01:15.220> switches<00:01:16.180> of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
going to use these smaller switches of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.920 
going to use these smaller switches of
unknown<00:01:18.070> origin<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.210> decided<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.690> go<00:01:19.780> get

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
unknown origin and I decided to go get

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.910 
unknown origin and I decided to go get
some<00:01:20.110> Japanese<00:01:20.560> made<00:01:20.940> Emraan<00:01:21.940> switches<00:01:22.920> not

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
some Japanese made Emraan switches not

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.100 
some Japanese made Emraan switches not
terribly<00:01:24.280> expensive<00:01:24.549> couple<00:01:25.390> bucks<00:01:25.600> got

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
terribly expensive couple bucks got

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
here in the linear carriage and I've

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.280 
here in the linear carriage and I've
used<00:02:03.189> a<00:02:03.310> linear<00:02:03.610> carriage<00:02:04.030> for<00:02:04.330> all<00:02:04.869> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
contact point and then down here

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.680 
contact point and then down here
on<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.220> X<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:14.629> very<00:02:14.840> end<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.349> machine<00:02:15.709> I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
on the X the very end of the machine I

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.890 
on the X the very end of the machine I
got<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:19.120> limit<00:02:20.120> switch<00:02:20.300> right<00:02:20.480> there<00:02:20.510> which

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
got the limit switch right there which

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.190 
got the limit switch right there which
is<00:02:20.930> going<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.260> run<00:02:21.440> into<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:23.569> linear<00:02:23.780> carriage

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
is going to run into the linear carriage

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.530 
is going to run into the linear carriage
there<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.680> that's<00:02:25.220> how<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.430> setup<00:02:25.910> works<00:02:26.180> and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
there so that's how that setup works and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.190 
there so that's how that setup works and
I<00:02:27.379> plan<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.739> running<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.160> wiring<00:02:28.610> through<00:02:29.510> as

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
I plan on running the wiring through as

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.660 
I plan on running the wiring through as
much<00:02:30.530> cable<00:02:30.799> management<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.519> I've

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
much cable management that I've

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.640 
much cable management that I've
installed<00:02:31.849> as<00:02:32.330> possible<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.049> keep<00:02:33.200> everything

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
installed as possible to keep everything

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.789 
installed as possible to keep everything
out<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.890> way<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:36.019> a<00:02:36.260> quick

I<00:02:39.010> ran<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.280> line<00:02:40.580> here<00:02:41.049> but<00:02:42.049> um<00:02:42.340> I'm<00:02:43.340> running

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
I ran this line here but um I'm running

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.160 
I ran this line here but um I'm running
what<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.819> can<00:02:44.120> through<00:02:44.330> all<00:02:44.420> my<00:02:44.450> cable<00:02:44.930> track

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
what I can through all my cable track

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.620 
what I can through all my cable track
this<00:02:45.950> coming<00:02:46.310> off<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.670> limits<00:02:47.060> which<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.390> just

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
this coming off the limits which I just

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.089 
this coming off the limits which I just
showed<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:47.810> runs<00:02:48.140> all<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.319> way<00:02:48.410> down<00:02:48.500> here

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
showed you runs all the way down here

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.190 
showed you runs all the way down here
and<00:02:49.250> actually<00:02:49.910> does<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.239> loop<00:02:50.510> at<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.750> end<00:02:50.989> and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
and actually does a loop at the end and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.470 
and actually does a loop at the end and
comes<00:02:51.380> back<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.400> feeds<00:02:52.970> out<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.239> side<00:02:53.450> of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
comes back and feeds out the side of

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.830 
comes back and feeds out the side of
this<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.739> all<00:02:54.920> going<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.630> glued<00:02:56.630> in

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
this this is all going to be glued in

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.330 
this this is all going to be glued in
you<00:02:57.049> can<00:02:57.170> see<00:02:57.349> I<00:02:57.379> cut<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.680> notch<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.190> there

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
you can see I cut a notch in there

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.740 
you can see I cut a notch in there
originally<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.000> cable<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.390> going<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.599> lay

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
originally and the cable is going to lay

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.500 
originally and the cable is going to lay
nice<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.489> tight<00:03:01.489> down<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.910> there<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.390> won't

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
nice and tight down in there and won't

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.569 
nice and tight down in there and won't
interfere<00:03:02.810> with<00:03:03.079> this<00:03:03.200> track<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:04.099> then<00:03:04.489> this

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
interfere with this track and then this

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.720 
interfere with this track and then this
comes<00:03:04.849> around<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.390> loops<00:03:05.569> up<00:03:05.750> into<00:03:06.079> this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
comes around and loops up into this

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.400 
comes around and loops up into this
terminal<00:03:07.730> block<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.079> where<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.260> got

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
terminal block and this is where I got

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.589 
terminal block and this is where I got
all<00:03:09.530> my<00:03:09.560> other<00:03:09.940> connections<00:03:10.940> going<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.420> can

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
all my other connections going so I can

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.809 
all my other connections going so I can
wire<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.019> series<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.010> next<00:03:13.370> limit

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
wire it in series to the next limit

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.210 
wire it in series to the next limit
switch<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.390> as<00:03:15.049> it's<00:03:15.260> flown<00:03:15.769> through<00:03:16.040> one

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
switch and as it's flown through one

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.740 
switch and as it's flown through one
line<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.639> comes<00:03:16.760> back<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.329> flows<00:03:17.510> through

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
line it comes back and flows through

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.110 
line it comes back and flows through
that<00:03:17.930> other<00:03:18.079> line<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.590> everything<00:03:19.579> just<00:03:19.850> runs

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
that other line and everything just runs

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.259 
that other line and everything just runs
in<00:03:20.299> series<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:20.840> one's<00:03:21.079> going<00:03:21.380> down<00:03:22.000> run<00:03:23.000> into

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
in series this one's going down run into

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.809 
in series this one's going down run into
each<00:03:23.569> chain<00:03:24.069> all<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.130> way<00:03:25.310> around<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.700> loop

each chain all the way around the loop

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.979 
each chain all the way around the loop

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
underneath the shelf that I created and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.830 
underneath the shelf that I created and
just<00:03:35.930> drill<00:03:36.170> some<00:03:36.319> holes<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:36.799> I<00:03:37.010> still<00:03:37.579> gotta

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
just drill some holes and I still gotta

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.390 
just drill some holes and I still gotta
attach<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:39.079> line<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:39.799> know<00:03:39.889> tight<00:03:40.130> but

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
attach this line you know tight but

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.009 
attach this line you know tight but
right<00:03:40.579> now<00:03:40.730> I'm<00:03:40.819> just<00:03:40.940> working<00:03:41.150> with<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.599> feeds

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
right now I'm just working with it feeds

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.800 
right now I'm just working with it feeds
out<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.319> back<00:03:42.530> side<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.190> runs<00:03:44.180> into<00:03:44.389> the<00:03:44.599> last

out the back side and runs into the last
limit<00:03:45.200> switch<00:03:45.470> right<00:03:45.680> there<00:03:45.819> now<00:03:46.819> I'm<00:03:46.910> going

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
limit switch right there now I'm going

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.309 
limit switch right there now I'm going
to<00:03:47.090> have<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.359> end<00:03:47.480> up<00:03:47.599> running<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:48.019> wire<00:03:48.290> a

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
to have to end up running this wire a

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.589 
to have to end up running this wire a
little<00:03:48.620> bit<00:03:48.859> over<00:03:49.099> here<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.609> tucking<00:03:50.299> it<00:03:50.540> away

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
little bit over here and tucking it away

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.300 
little bit over here and tucking it away
because<00:03:50.959> this<00:03:51.260> key<00:03:51.470> chains<00:03:51.739> actually<00:03:51.919> going

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
because this key chains actually going

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.220 
because this key chains actually going
to<00:03:52.430> extend<00:03:52.849> out<00:03:53.150> past<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.900> end<00:03:54.079> of<00:03:54.139> the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
to extend out past the end of the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.460 
to extend out past the end of the
machine<00:03:54.560> when<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:55.549> on<00:03:55.700> its<00:03:55.910> full<00:03:56.870> swing<00:03:57.200> back

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
machine when it's on its full swing back

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.699 
machine when it's on its full swing back
but<00:03:58.459> that's<00:03:59.269> how<00:03:59.630> I'm<00:04:00.019> running<00:04:00.410> all<00:04:00.530> this

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
but that's how I'm running all this

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.890 
but that's how I'm running all this
stuff<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.250> then<00:04:01.370> from<00:04:01.579> here<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:02.630> is<00:04:02.690> the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
stuff and then from here this is the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.870 
stuff and then from here this is the
main<00:04:03.200> line<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.650> runs<00:04:03.769> down<00:04:04.069> into<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.400> gecko

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
main line that runs down into the gecko

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.330 
main line that runs down into the gecko
so<00:04:05.780> that's<00:04:05.930> pretty<00:04:06.139> much<00:04:06.319> it<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.739> I'll<00:04:06.859> go

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
so that's pretty much it and I'll go

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.490 
so that's pretty much it and I'll go
into<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.579> little<00:04:07.880> bit<00:04:08.000> more<00:04:08.840> later<00:04:09.079> if<00:04:09.290> needed

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
into a little bit more later if needed

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.860 
into a little bit more later if needed
to<00:04:09.769> but<00:04:10.040> uh<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:11.209> was<00:04:11.359> one<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.540> those<00:04:11.660> things

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
to but uh this was one of those things

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.449 
to but uh this was one of those things
that's<00:04:11.989> kind<00:04:12.139> of<00:04:12.230> confusing<00:04:12.410> until<00:04:12.889> you<00:04:13.160> do<00:04:13.340> it

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
that's kind of confusing until you do it

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.830 
that's kind of confusing until you do it
you've<00:04:13.639> been<00:04:13.730> running<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.090> on<00:04:14.239> paper<00:04:14.480> and

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
you've been running it on paper and

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.209 
you've been running it on paper and
didn't<00:04:15.230> make<00:04:15.380> sense<00:04:15.620> until<00:04:15.859> I<00:04:16.039> did<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.400> thanks
