00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.839
 Welcome to our third 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.849
 part video special 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.490
 we are now at 16 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.320
 million dollars arrived and that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.800
 here was the gamescom there has michael 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.990
 douglas hangar module revealed so to speak 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.519
 and shown or well executed and that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.080
 the people are filled, they have it there 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.480
 already seen or just clap 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.680
 only then they will be equal to ten 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 there I was probably now in the park 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.230
 announced and wants first time completely 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.780
 neat what's going on there and yes 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 you have a product to start the module 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.760
 I say you have to try it because you 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 somehow only 34 massively against wrong 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.730
 password entered then also has 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.680
 hung up and then worked 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.930
 then look exactly pretty 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 nice there are different versions 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 but that must be it is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.440
 still how to swell it out 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.629
 the playable hangar will be recognized 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.859
 that such a big treysa or not one 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.629
 may be curious but will be the same 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.629
 Just have a look 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.899
 it is still the short hook 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.579
 cryengine 3 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.990
 but modified so here comes and 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:21.909
 its the countdown the people 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.909
 celebrate the festival 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.009
 it is indeed a walk-in room where 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.229
 your ship what you have bought you already 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.820
 have not bought any brave ones 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.110
 the lick pipe in there is at his 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.670
 Starts ship or your city ships 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.700
 depending on what the bought and active 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.950
 then stands there to look at him and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.440
 einstein try my question the series 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.399
 who ever bought me there 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.200
 do you see my hangar 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.679
 oh that's your last had business 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.700
 ok i admit it i dont know 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.280
 what i bought i have him 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.569
 someday money was given and since then 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.399
 it just got too confusing for me 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:06.880
 the whole campaign, it was just so 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:10.549
 we have a lot of what I bought 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.680
 at no time like just go off the 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.209
 With the start I had a lot of money for 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.280
 mechwarrior spent online for that 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.620
 package and that was why my budget was 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.209
 exhausted and in the meantime I am even 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.799
 a little bit glad that I did 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.840
 that I did not get embarrassed 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.130
 I'm okay because I 'm starting to get scared 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.019
 get ahead of this project like you 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.489
 just 20 million called there was 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.530
 again the new round rattle okay 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.780
 we will also face it 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.680
 more the college technique almost like that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.040
 mass effect actually more action 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.410
 elements still pvp then give up 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.030
 Lawless planes exactly this whole 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.819
 surfaces history this whole 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.950
 action game setting so to speak and then 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.859
 All parts of Bavaria have goods 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.900
 one more set on new recovery 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.510
 mechanics of the farmers felix that must 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.650
 question what is the vulture is that one 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.850
 so to speak, as an explorer always one 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.799
 can build a career that really does 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.140
 So why holes discover that you old 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:12.060
 Baracke acts and 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:18.750
 again a new element 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.100
 battles the employees about what you 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.930
 you told me with mountains and before 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.060
 all this the section would be all in 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.650
 This 1 studio develops or exists 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.000
 now a studio that makes that one 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.410
 studio that does that yes there is 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.270
 Of course , several teams, so to speak 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.260
 the under the flag of roberts space 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.160
 in the ali pets and man 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.690
 has split it now 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.640
 yes there is that in austin there is 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.410
 two more three others but that too 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.930
 heinrich in the title story probably a lot 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.970
 to tell about it can wait with tension 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.900
 we on the dogfight mode gray that 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:56.790
 was moved before the yes and there will 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.239
 you actually first opposition 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.620
 At the moment you can only fly them 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.620
 then it is half that would be already 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.940
 Model will work that you if you 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.590
 really asks which ones because the weapons 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.360
 Suspension shoots away the weapon 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.510
 then in by old or such 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.310
 stories and left madness and what 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.160
 you swap local millions for me yes 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.500
 They have under more and 30 million 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.720
 is there a luxury ship which was there 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.220
 Now I can buy so I have the feeling 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.640
 that whole team together on the 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.570
 cayman islands or the 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.250
 pension fund should already be on the internet 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.840
 also joked what is that so red 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.510
 bull at 100 million that's how it is 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.040
 I also deal with all the coal 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.910
 've asked him what the dsi 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.840
 Fear has to switch 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.780
 with all these things and he has one 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.460
 has sleepless night and is willing 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.979
 because he took over but me 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.520
 mine the coal is still pure 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.520
 comes on 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.660
 The game is almost over now 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.310
 phenomenon or even an economy 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.040
 phenomena how do you manage that so much 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.570
 coal 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.370
 just that I get the curve 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.390
 could this terry computer out 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.370
 pratchetts disk world itself 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.900
 further developed and new connection 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.900
 it's easy to do the game yourself 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.690
 So really good band here 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.890
 such a kind franchise appears in 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.140
 development to be such a way 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.180
 Another second star wars yes we all know 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.430
 also in trento meanwhile she too 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.150
 for example, a tv series 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.880
 that's probably one of those 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.280
 film documentation of the clutter so everything 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.790
 Things put the 33 over the game 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.530
 in addition, the campaign scott foley 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.180
 twitter so bored with 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.650
 epic battles and whatnot 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.310
 So there is still a lot to come 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.960
 I'm just terribly curious 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.330
 how exciting to see if that is one 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.980
 big disaster is a very narrow one 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.530
 Burr and it will offer to think that 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.450
 where we say everything when we bavaria 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.680
 we were there or lamented due 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.450
 the expectations are easy now 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.450
 to be asked who the people say 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.820
 right now we're still at it 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.130
 Over 36 million have arrived 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.410
 and know what marches on the 37th 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.650
 It's about fun for millions 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.570
 we will be correct by him in any case 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.570
 especially the whole van damme gets stuck
