again I'm showing you an s5 here the s5

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.890 
again I'm showing you an s5 here the s5
has<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.670> connector<00:00:18.090> right<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
has a connector right here and this is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.349 
has a connector right here and this is
where<00:00:19.050> we're<00:00:19.199> going<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.410> connect<00:00:19.800> our<00:00:20.310> power

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
where we're going to connect our power

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.790 
where we're going to connect our power
communications<00:00:21.359> cable<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> first

communications cable so the first

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.670 
communications cable so the first
configuration<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.180> direct<00:00:24.600> connection<00:00:24.960> in

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
configuration is a direct connection in

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500 
configuration is a direct connection in
that<00:00:25.859> case<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.310> use<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.939> use<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that case I use it I use the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.269 
that case I use it I use the
user-supplied<00:00:27.990> 10<00:00:28.590> meter<00:00:28.830> power<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
user-supplied 10 meter power and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.700 
user-supplied 10 meter power and
communications<00:00:29.880> module<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.510> plug<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.529> directly

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
communications module I plug it directly

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
communications module I plug it directly
to<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> s5<00:00:32.880> or<00:00:32.910> m9<00:00:36.860> on<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.160> other<00:00:38.340> end<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.540> is

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to the s5 or m9 on the other end this is

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.330 
to the s5 or m9 on the other end this is
the<00:00:39.840> cable<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> rs-232

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the cable that this is the rs-232

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.729 
the cable that this is the rs-232
connector<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.030> use<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.540> connect<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> laptop

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
connector I use to connect to the laptop

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.880 
connector I use to connect to the laptop
I<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.180> connect<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.960> an<00:00:46.050> external<00:00:46.320> GPS

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I can also connect to an external GPS

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.060 
I can also connect to an external GPS
and<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.000> how<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> supply<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.690> power<00:00:49.070> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and this is how I supply the power so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.850 
and this is how I supply the power so
again<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.640> called<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.969> direct<00:00:51.300> connection

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
again this is called a direct connection

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.500 
again this is called a direct connection
it's<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.730> typical<00:00:54.300> type<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it's a it this typical type of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.920 
it's a it this typical type of
connection<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.320> used<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:56.070> setup<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.610> used

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
connection is used or setup is used

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.209 
connection is used or setup is used
maybe<00:00:57.930> I'm<00:00:58.109> using<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> large<00:00:58.920> vessel

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
maybe I'm using it on a large vessel

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.639 
maybe I'm using it on a large vessel
where<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.660> actually<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> laptop

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
where I have actually the laptop

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.470 
where I have actually the laptop
directly<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> boat<00:01:02.670> where<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> don't<00:01:03.270> need

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
directly on the boat where I don't need

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
directly on the boat where I don't need
remote<00:01:03.840> communications<00:01:04.680> again<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.549> 10

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
remote communications again it's 10

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.270 
remote communications again it's 10
meters<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.960> mount<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.350> system<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
meters so you can mount the system in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.950 
meters so you can mount the system in
the<00:01:08.400> water<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.299> 10<00:01:09.630> meters

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the water and you have up to 10 meters

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.510 
the water and you have up to 10 meters

most laptop these days laptops these
days<00:02:38.579> have<00:02:38.819> USB<00:02:39.299> ports<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:41.069> also<00:02:41.220> supply

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
days have USB ports so we also supply

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.470 
days have USB ports so we also supply
the<00:02:41.760> rs-232<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:43.500> USB<00:02:43.769> connector<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.269> use

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the rs-232 to USB connector so I use

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.050 
the rs-232 to USB connector so I use
that<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.959> connection<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:47.220> applies<00:02:47.879> the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.569 
differential GPS one of the intentions
for<00:03:46.079> this<00:03:46.260> development<00:03:46.590> was<00:03:47.159> to<00:03:47.340> integrate

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
for this development was to integrate

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.390 
for this development was to integrate
the<00:03:48.000> different<00:03:48.329> technologies<00:03:49.169> okay<00:03:50.099> so<00:03:50.159> in

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
the different technologies okay so in

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.939 
the different technologies okay so in
this<00:03:50.489> case<00:03:50.549> we<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.299> an<00:03:51.599> m9<00:03:52.260> or<00:03:52.290> an<00:03:52.560> s5

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
this case we have an m9 or an s5

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.879 
this case we have an m9 or an s5
acoustic<00:03:53.940> Doppler<00:03:54.239> profiler<00:03:54.750> we're<00:03:55.739> also

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
acoustic Doppler profiler we're also

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.219 
acoustic Doppler profiler we're also
integrating<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:56.970> vertical<00:03:57.599> beam<00:03:57.840> echo

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
integrating in a vertical beam echo

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.189 
integrating in a vertical beam echo
sounder<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.829> now<00:03:59.519> this<00:04:00.299> third<00:04:00.510> piece<00:04:00.870> we've

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
sounder and now this third piece we've

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.250 
sounder and now this third piece we've
integrated<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.919> GPS<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.209> in<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.629> case<00:04:03.930> it's

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
integrated a GPS and in this case it's

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.449 
integrated a GPS and in this case it's
differential<00:04:05.159> GPS<00:04:07.159> okay<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.280> last

now<00:04:34.170> when<00:04:34.350> we're<00:04:34.500> making<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:35.270> requirement<00:04:36.270> of

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
now when we're making the requirement of

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.700 
now when we're making the requirement of
RTK<00:04:36.840> measurements<00:04:37.470> which<00:04:37.590> are

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
RTK measurements which are

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.010 
RTK measurements which are
high-precision<00:04:38.130> GPS<00:04:38.480> measurements<00:04:39.480> we

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
high-precision GPS measurements we

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.110 
high-precision GPS measurements we
requires<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.800> use<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:40.980> an<00:04:41.250> onshore<00:04:41.490> base

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
requires the use of an onshore base

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.370 
requires the use of an onshore base
station<00:04:42.600> so<00:04:43.590> we've<00:04:44.310> designed<00:04:44.670> a<00:04:44.850> non

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
station so we've designed a non

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.810 
station so we've designed a non
specifically<00:04:46.380> for<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.620> GPS<00:04:47.100> or<00:04:47.400> for<00:04:47.760> the

specifically for the GPS or for the
santech<00:04:48.210> gps<00:04:48.660> solution<00:04:49.200> we've<00:04:49.740> designed<00:04:50.580> our

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
santech gps solution we've designed our

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.210 
santech gps solution we've designed our
own<00:04:50.850> RTK<00:04:51.420> base<00:04:51.660> station<00:04:52.110> in<00:04:52.260> this<00:04:52.740> case<00:04:52.980> it

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
own RTK base station in this case it

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.730 
own RTK base station in this case it
comes<00:04:53.340> with<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.580> tripod<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.390> mount<00:04:55.350> for<00:04:55.470> the

this control module this power control

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.240 
this control module this power control
module<00:04:59.850> is<00:05:00.270> very<00:05:00.630> similar<00:05:01.140> to<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:02.040> power

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
module is very similar to the power

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.280 
module is very similar to the power
control<00:05:02.520> module<00:05:02.730> you<00:05:03.090> use<00:05:03.330> connected<00:05:04.140> to<00:05:04.230> the

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
control module you use connected to the

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.770 
control module you use connected to the
ADP<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:04.980> they<00:05:05.430> use<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.790> same<00:05:05.970> power<00:05:06.510> supply

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
ADP and they use the same power supply

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.550 
ADP and they use the same power supply
okay<00:05:07.710> I'll<00:05:08.040> turn<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.400> around<00:05:08.520> here<00:05:09.320> again<00:05:10.320> big

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
okay I'll turn it around here again big

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.150 
okay I'll turn it around here again big
thumb<00:05:10.770> bolts<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:12.500> can<00:05:13.500> use<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.770> same<00:05:13.950> batteries

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
thumb bolts I can use the same batteries

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.210 
thumb bolts I can use the same batteries
on<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.790> on<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.540> connected<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.500> ADP<00:05:16.980> there

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
on the on the connected to the ADP there

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:25.340 
on the on the connected to the ADP there
as<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:17.820> can<00:05:18.030> in<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.240> RTK<00:05:18.840> base<00:05:19.410> station<00:05:24.290> now<00:05:25.290> we

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
as I can in the RTK base station now we

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.560 
as I can in the RTK base station now we
need<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.710> radio<00:05:26.070> link<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.820> go<00:05:26.970> from<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.360> base

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
need a radio link to go from the base

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.710 
need a radio link to go from the base
station<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.590> onto<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.550> boat<00:05:29.730> so<00:05:30.510> in<00:05:30.630> this

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
station to the onto the boat so in this

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.510 
station to the onto the boat so in this
case<00:05:30.960> we're<00:05:31.230> using<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.680> spread<00:05:31.950> spectrum<00:05:31.980> radio

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
case we're using a spread spectrum radio

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.790 
case we're using a spread spectrum radio
it<00:05:32.850> has<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.000> range<00:05:33.330> of<00:05:33.540> about<00:05:33.780> two<00:05:34.110> kilometers

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
it has a range of about two kilometers

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.370 
it has a range of about two kilometers
okay<00:05:35.520> usually<00:05:36.390> when<00:05:36.510> I<00:05:36.540> set<00:05:36.840> up<00:05:36.870> this<00:05:37.140> base

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
okay usually when I set up this base

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.170 
okay usually when I set up this base
station<00:05:37.530> I<00:05:37.920> want<00:05:38.040> to<00:05:38.160> set<00:05:38.340> it<00:05:38.370> up<00:05:38.550> away<00:05:38.940> from

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
station I want to set it up away from

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.030 
station I want to set it up away from
trees<00:05:39.660> right<00:05:39.960> now<00:05:39.990> I'm<00:05:40.320> along<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:40.740> shore<00:05:41.010> of

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
trees right now I'm along the shore of

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.670 
trees right now I'm along the shore of
the<00:05:41.130> Pongo<00:05:41.400> River<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.150> I'm<00:05:43.050> up<00:05:43.260> under<00:05:43.530> some

the Pongo River and I'm up under some
trees<00:05:43.950> just<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.460> be<00:05:45.300> in<00:05:45.360> some<00:05:45.510> shade<00:05:45.780> in

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
trees just to be in some shade in

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.500 
trees just to be in some shade in
reality<00:05:47.310> when<00:05:47.460> we<00:05:47.490> make<00:05:47.730> a<00:05:47.760> measurement<00:05:48.000> using

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
reality when we make a measurement using

reality when we make a measurement using
our<00:05:48.630> TK<00:05:49.020> we're<00:05:49.980> going<00:05:50.100> to<00:05:50.160> want<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.400> put<00:05:50.580> the

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
our TK we're going to want to put the

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.730 
our TK we're going to want to put the
base<00:05:50.820> station<00:05:51.300> in<00:05:51.510> a<00:05:51.720> clear<00:05:51.990> area<00:05:52.230> where<00:05:52.620> we

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
base station in a clear area where we

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.130 
base station in a clear area where we
have<00:05:52.830> a<00:05:52.860> good<00:05:53.100> view<00:05:53.280> of<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.490> sky<00:05:53.780> so<00:05:54.780> again<00:05:55.020> in

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
have a good view of the sky so again in

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.340 
have a good view of the sky so again in
the<00:05:55.230> power<00:05:55.440> control<00:05:55.800> box<00:05:56.100> here<00:05:56.640> we<00:05:57.510> comes<00:05:58.140> with

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
the power control box here we comes with

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.390 
the power control box here we comes with
the<00:05:58.440> power<00:05:58.620> supply<00:05:58.890> a<00:05:59.900> GPS<00:06:00.900> receiver

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
the power supply a GPS receiver

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.310 
the power supply a GPS receiver
connected<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.610> antenna<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.270> we<00:06:03.960> have<00:06:04.170> the

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
connected to the antenna and we have the

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.160 
connected to the antenna and we have the
data<00:06:04.530> we<00:06:04.770> have<00:06:05.310> the<00:06:05.430> data<00:06:05.640> link<00:06:05.910> right<00:06:06.150> here<00:06:06.510> so

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
data we have the data link right here so

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.410
