00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.960
 today we make a healthy ice cream 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.240
 banana or banana 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.830
 We wait 3 bananas and we chop them 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.830
 putting them in an American glass 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.860
 we throw the skim milk 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.950
 and a few drops of liquid stevia if 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.810
 you want to sweeten it 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.110
 and we cleaned it for a minute 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.110
 approximately 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.720
 look how wonderful it looks 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.640
 shake let's do it in two ways the 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.050
 The first is with a refrigerator and the 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.050
 second we will do it without a machine 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.370
 we start the hillside 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.879
 and enrique goes overturning the content of the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.879
 blender 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.310
 the ice cream is made by the cold of 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.710
 the piece that we introduced at the beginning 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.450
 the movement of souls and prevents 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.450
 ice crystals are formed 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.299
 in about 40 minutes 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.299
 will be ready turn off the refrigerator 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.119
 and we dump the contents in a container 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.380
 appropriate to store it later in the 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.990
 freezer 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.259
 we prepare the entire surface with a 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.259
 spatula 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.300
 and we cut a couple of bananas or bananas 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.580
 in slices of less than one finger 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.250
 thickness 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.870
 let's decorate the ice cream covering all 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.870
 the surface in this way 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.720
 we cover with a plastic paper in 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.610
 contact with the surface so that 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.250
 ice crystals are formed in the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.740
 freezer 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.660
 and we keep it, we have to remember 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.460
 Take it out 20 minutes before being 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.830
 consumed so that it is perfectly 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.080
 creamy now let's do it without 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.020
 Whippy or pouring liquefied 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.020
 in a container with a lid we cover it 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.140
 and we store them in the freezer 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.740
 let's put our chef for 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.140
 let us know every half hour 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.330
 let's take it out of the freezer 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.430
 we break the ice crystallites 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.920
 ice cream and we put it back in the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.530
 freezer that's why the container has 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.080
 that having a cap we will need to repeat 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.970
 this process between 6 and 8 times for 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.970
 get the desired result at the end 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.340
 do not lose like with the refrigerator but 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.340
 this trick can serve you as a fix 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.040
 ten later we take out the ice cream ones 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.870
 fifteen minutes before the exact time 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.030
 it will depend on the heat that we make 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.690
 making some balls and put them in a 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.690
 small bowl 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.290
 you can decorate them with some slices of 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.819
 freshly cut bananas 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.830
