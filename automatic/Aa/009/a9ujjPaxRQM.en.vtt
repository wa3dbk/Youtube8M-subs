especially expensive guitars is not a
great<00:02:22.769> education<00:02:23.430> because<00:02:23.879> what<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.299> will<00:02:24.690> do

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
great education because what I will do

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.199 
great education because what I will do
is<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.230> will<00:02:25.409> allow<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.890> see<00:02:26.220> okay<00:02:26.849> what

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
it is that you might be purchasing when

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.819 
it is that you might be purchasing when

one<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.640> acoustic<00:02:35.909> guitar<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.599> my<00:02:37.560> mantra

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
one on the acoustic guitar and my mantra

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.119 
one on the acoustic guitar and my mantra
is<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.489> same<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.540> if<00:02:39.840> your<00:02:40.680> budget

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
doesn't allow for it other than just

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.020 
doesn't allow for it other than just
being<00:02:43.560> educated<00:02:44.069> on<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.370> more<00:02:44.760> expensive

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
neck it's the distance this way they

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.150 
neck it's the distance this way they
typically<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.320> action<00:04:35.830> low<00:04:36.220> okay<00:04:37.180> now

that's<00:04:39.160> true<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:40.389> faster<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.620> guitar

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
that's true the faster of a guitar

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.770 
that's true the faster of a guitar
player<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.250> are<00:04:42.580> you<00:04:42.910> typically<00:04:43.240> want<00:04:43.510> that

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.020 
player you are you typically want that
action<00:04:43.960> low<00:04:44.380> because<00:04:44.740> each<00:04:45.370> movement<00:04:45.790> that

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
action low because each movement that

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.550 
action low because each movement that

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
far down it's going to slow you down

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.710 
far down it's going to slow you down
whereas<00:04:50.740> slide<00:04:51.490> players<00:04:51.820> would<00:04:52.120> want<00:04:52.389> the

action higher or rhythm players may want
the<00:04:55.240> action<00:04:55.690> higher<00:04:56.110> because<00:04:56.530> they're

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
the action higher because they're

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.290 
the action higher because they're
hitting<00:04:56.949> a<00:04:57.010> lot<00:04:57.190> of<00:04:57.310> chords<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:57.790> not<00:04:57.940> doing<00:04:58.240> a
