00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
the previous macbook air and in fact

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.029 
the previous macbook air and in fact
physically<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.779> pretty<00:00:22.050> much<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.439> same<00:00:22.680> box

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
physically it's pretty much the same box

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.910 
physically it's pretty much the same box
except<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:24.000> guy<00:00:24.210> has<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.840> backlit<00:00:25.380> keyboard

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
on the side this display port jack right
here<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> back<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.510> thunderbolt

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
here in the back is now a thunderbolt

thunderbolt peripherals if you happen to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
thunderbolt peripherals if you happen to
run<00:00:46.739> across<00:00:46.800> any<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> couple<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.969> hard

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
monitor later on in the summer that you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.010

generation of macbook air systems is the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.899 
generation of macbook air systems is the

desktop you reverse that to go back the
other<00:03:11.250> way<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:12.210> do<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.660> reverse<00:03:13.350> again

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920
