worth spending some time to read them
the<00:00:45.930> first<00:00:46.110> thing<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.469> remember<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.800> you're

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the first thing to remember when you're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
the first thing to remember when you're
making<00:00:46.950> these<00:00:47.309> type<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.700> drinks<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> milk

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
making these type of drinks is milk

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.189 
making these type of drinks is milk
first<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.399> pop<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> milk<00:00:51.050> cartridge<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
first and pop the milk cartridge in

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
first and pop the milk cartridge in
there<00:00:53.270> it's<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.629> quite<00:00:55.620> firm<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:57.329> piece

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
there it's one now quite firm that piece

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.770 
there it's one now quite firm that piece
is<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> cartridge<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.910> set<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> Machine<00:01:00.600> off

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is the cartridge and set the Machine off

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.299 
is the cartridge and set the Machine off
and<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.210> pump<00:01:03.600> boiling<00:01:04.530> water<00:01:04.739> under

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and it will now pump boiling water under

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.670 
and it will now pump boiling water under
pressure<00:01:05.600> through<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.780> milk<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.260> froth<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
pressure through that milk to froth it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.370 
pressure through that milk to froth it
up<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.210> one's<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.659> some<00:01:09.689> caramel

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
up and so this one's got some caramel

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:22.100 
up and so this one's got some caramel
flavor<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.100> well

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.610 

the<00:01:22.590> different<00:01:23.010> brands<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.690> buy<00:01:24.900> and

the different brands that you buy and

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.380 
the different brands that you buy and
it's<00:01:26.370> just<00:01:26.580> worth<00:01:26.700> checking<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.240> all

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it's just worth checking they all

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.680 
it's just worth checking they all
produce<00:01:27.600> different<00:01:28.440> fluid<00:01:29.010> amounts<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.210> if

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
produce different fluid amounts so if

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.630 
produce different fluid amounts so if
you<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> different<00:01:31.470> brand<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.100> coffee<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
you use a different brand of coffee on

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
you use a different brand of coffee on
this<00:01:33.000> you'd<00:01:33.180> find<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.690> frothing<00:01:34.140> over

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
this you'd find it's all frothing over

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
this you'd find it's all frothing over
the<00:01:34.470> side<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.670> need<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:36.000> sure

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.000 
set up the correct pressure boom down
clock<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.930> if<00:02:34.990> we're<00:02:35.140> lucky<00:02:35.170> we'll<00:02:35.680> get<00:02:35.770> some

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
clock now if we're lucky we'll get some

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.210 
clock now if we're lucky we'll get some
really<00:02:36.250> interesting<00:02:37.740> patterns<00:02:38.740> as<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
really interesting patterns as the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.960 
really interesting patterns as the
coffee<00:02:39.460> goes<00:02:39.790> into<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:41.370> milk<00:02:44.580> just<00:02:45.580> building

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
coffee goes into the milk just building

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.640 
coffee goes into the milk just building
up<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.060> pressure<00:02:46.390> now<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.990> pumping<00:02:47.500> that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
up the pressure now and pumping that

00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:23.040 
up the pressure now and pumping that
boiling<00:02:47.950> water<00:02:48.250> through<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.900> decaf<00:02:49.900> tea<00:02:50.560> disc

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.290 

so<00:03:23.590> yeah<00:03:23.710> wonderful<00:03:24.460> pattern<00:03:24.760> there<00:03:25.030> just

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
so yeah wonderful pattern there just

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.750 
so yeah wonderful pattern there just
