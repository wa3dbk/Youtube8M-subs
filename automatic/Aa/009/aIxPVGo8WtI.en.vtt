universal potting soil nothing
complicated<00:00:25.670> like<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.890> now<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> lot<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.400> people

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
complicated like so now a lot of people

complicated like so now a lot of people
like<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.630> water

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
a little bit very lightly and when

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.429 
a little bit very lightly and when
planting<00:01:42.030> seeds<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> remember<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
planting seeds you want to remember that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.679 
planting seeds you want to remember that
you<00:01:43.649> should<00:01:43.829> only<00:01:44.009> bury<00:01:44.310> them<00:01:44.549> two<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.509> three

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
you should only bury them two to three

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.420 
you should only bury them two to three
times<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.200> size<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> seeds<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.130> obviously

let's<00:02:20.709> start<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.640> largest<00:02:22.450> plant<00:02:22.780> by

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
let's start with the largest plant by

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.870 
let's start with the largest plant by
largest<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.709> don't<00:02:23.890> necessarily<00:02:23.980> mean<00:02:24.220> tallest

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
largest I don't necessarily mean tallest

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.559 
largest I don't necessarily mean tallest
I<00:02:25.150> mean<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.870> plant<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.500> thickest<00:02:27.569> stem

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
I mean the plant with the thickest stem

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.540 
I mean the plant with the thickest stem
the<00:02:29.349> one<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.010> greenest

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
the one that is the greenest

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.729 
the one that is the greenest
the<00:02:30.700> one<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.000> looks<00:02:31.390> healthy<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.440> problem

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
the one that looks healthy the problem

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:33.990 
the one that looks healthy the problem
is<00:02:32.800> growing<00:02:32.950> them<00:02:33.190> too<00:02:33.340> long<00:02:33.519> in<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.790> small

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
is growing them too long in a small

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.430 
is growing them too long in a small
container<00:02:34.269> is<00:02:34.510> you'll<00:02:34.660> actually<00:02:34.840> stunt<00:02:35.290> their

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
container is you'll actually stunt their

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.850 
container is you'll actually stunt their
worth

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
worth

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.589 
worth
so<00:02:36.069> these<00:02:36.220> could<00:02:36.430> be<00:02:36.489> much<00:02:36.790> bigger<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.420> have

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
so these could be much bigger if I have

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.790 
so these could be much bigger if I have
put<00:02:37.720> them<00:02:37.840> into<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.080> larger<00:02:38.380> container<00:02:38.620> is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
put them into a larger container is

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.960 
put them into a larger container is
cleaner<00:02:39.040> but<00:02:39.550> that's<00:02:39.700> alright<00:02:39.849> because

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
cleaner but that's alright because

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.850 
cleaner but that's alright because
they'll<00:02:40.390> catch<00:02:40.569> up<00:02:40.750> what<00:02:41.440> do<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.560> want<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.769> do

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
they'll catch up what do you want to do

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.330 
they'll catch up what do you want to do
and<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.610> just<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:43.750> underneath<00:02:44.220> move<00:02:45.220> it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
and it's just go underneath move it

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.610 
and it's just go underneath move it
around<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.670> little<00:02:45.760> bit<00:02:46.000> shake<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.870> give<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.590> a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
around a little bit shake it give it a

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.920 
around a little bit shake it give it a
good<00:02:47.739> shake<00:02:47.950> shake<00:02:48.850> shake<00:02:49.090> shake<00:02:49.269> shake<00:02:49.450> them

good shake shake shake shake shake them
all<00:02:50.110> come<00:02:50.500> dislodged<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.700> that's<00:02:51.880> alright

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
all come dislodged but that's alright

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.110 
all come dislodged but that's alright
now<00:02:53.319> people<00:02:53.799> like<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.160> say<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.370> want<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.910> hold

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
now people like to say you want to hold

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.330 
now people like to say you want to hold
your<00:02:55.390> tomato<00:02:55.840> or<00:02:56.170> any<00:02:56.380> your<00:02:56.590> plants<00:02:56.890> from<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
your tomato or any your plants from the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.180 
your tomato or any your plants from the
leaves<00:02:57.549> this<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.750> correct<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.680> want<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.010> hold

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
leaves this is correct you want to hold

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.680 
leaves this is correct you want to hold
them<00:03:00.370> from<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.760> leaves<00:03:00.940> but<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.330> find<00:03:01.630> that

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
them from the leaves but I find that

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.170 
them from the leaves but I find that
that's<00:03:01.989> very<00:03:02.170> difficult<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.430> know<00:03:03.790> avoid

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
that's very difficult so you know avoid

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.580 
that's very difficult so you know avoid
touching<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.780> stem<00:03:04.989> as<00:03:05.140> much<00:03:05.290> as<00:03:05.440> possible

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
touching the stem as much as possible

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.009 
touching the stem as much as possible
yes<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.310> makes<00:03:06.489> sense<00:03:06.549> I<00:03:06.880> like<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.690> hold<00:03:07.870> them

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
yes that makes sense I like to hold them

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.229 
yes that makes sense I like to hold them
kind<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.769> like<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:10.049> okay<00:03:11.049> so<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
kind of like this okay so that the the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.780 
kind of like this okay so that the the
tomato<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:14.170> kind<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.680> resting<00:03:15.130> between<00:03:15.280> my

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
tomato is kind of resting between my

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.120 
tomato is kind of resting between my
fingers<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.510> seeds<00:03:16.780> are<00:03:16.959> on<00:03:16.989> sorry<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
fingers the seeds are on sorry the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.710 
fingers the seeds are on sorry the
leaves<00:03:18.579> are<00:03:18.730> on<00:03:18.820> top<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.299> roots<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.660> the

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
leaves are on top of the roots on the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.440 
leaves are on top of the roots on the
bottom<00:03:19.989> nothing<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.680> getting<00:03:21.150> squished<00:03:22.150> in

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
bottom nothing is getting squished in

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.300 
bottom nothing is getting squished in
the<00:03:22.600> process<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.650> way<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:23.829> can<00:03:23.920> make<00:03:24.040> sure

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
the process and that way I can make sure

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.710 
the process and that way I can make sure
it's<00:03:24.430> standing<00:03:24.730> up<00:03:24.820> straight<00:03:25.239> without

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
it's standing up straight without

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.840 
it's standing up straight without
putting<00:03:25.989> strain<00:03:26.380> anywhere<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.609> plant

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
putting strain anywhere on the plant

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.949

gonna push the tomato as far as I can go

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.229 
gonna push the tomato as far as I can go
without<00:03:44.709> damaging<00:03:45.340> anything<00:03:45.549> I<00:03:45.790> just<00:03:45.819> want<00:03:46.150> to

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
without damaging anything I just want to

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.960 
without damaging anything I just want to
squish<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.109> there<00:03:47.290> okay<00:03:47.440> now<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.940> is

option<00:03:49.750> one<00:03:50.019> now<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.530> second<00:03:51.069> way<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:51.190> doing

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
option one now the second way of doing

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.190

it and I actually prefer to do it like
this<00:03:53.319> when<00:03:53.500> I'm<00:03:53.620> dealing<00:03:53.739> with<00:03:53.889> Tomatoes<00:03:54.370> is

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
this when I'm dealing with Tomatoes is

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.319 
this when I'm dealing with Tomatoes is
to<00:03:55.090> pre<00:03:55.329> out<00:03:55.569> my<00:03:55.810> tomato<00:03:56.170> same<00:03:56.620> as<00:03:56.769> before<00:03:57.100> just

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
to pre out my tomato same as before just

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.520 
to pre out my tomato same as before just
gently<00:03:58.329> get<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.720> out<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:01.060> point<00:04:01.299> this<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.290> an

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
gently get it out the point this is an

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.720 
gently get it out the point this is an
empty<00:04:02.799> container<00:04:02.950> I'm<00:04:03.220> going<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.400> put<00:04:03.579> the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
empty container I'm going to put the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.550 
empty container I'm going to put the
tomato<00:04:03.850> all<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.630> way<00:04:04.720> down<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.380> bottom

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
tomato all the way down in the bottom

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.789 
tomato all the way down in the bottom
now<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.459> don't<00:04:06.700> want<00:04:06.819> to<00:04:06.880> feel<00:04:07.000> past<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:08.470> bottom

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
now I don't want to feel past the bottom

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.080 
now I don't want to feel past the bottom
leaves<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:10.180> first<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:12.400> can't<00:04:12.639> put<00:04:12.819> them<00:04:12.910> on

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
leaves the first you can't put them on

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.470 
leaves the first you can't put them on
and<00:04:13.450> then<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.690> can

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
and then you can

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.259 
and then you can
actually<00:04:14.810> very<00:04:15.230> deeper<00:04:15.650> but<00:04:16.370> now<00:04:16.699> I<00:04:16.760> have<00:04:17.239> a

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
actually very deeper but now I have a

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.659 
actually very deeper but now I have a
plant<00:04:17.630> that<00:04:17.989> is<00:04:18.139> going<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.530> be<00:04:18.650> stronger<00:04:19.370> this

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
plant that is going to be stronger this

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.039 
plant that is going to be stronger this
one<00:04:19.850> this<00:04:20.060> one<00:04:20.209> will<00:04:20.269> grow<00:04:20.389> just<00:04:20.630> fine<00:04:20.840> but

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
one this one will grow just fine but

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.409 
one this one will grow just fine but
this<00:04:21.290> one<00:04:21.650> will<00:04:22.490> grow<00:04:22.639> much<00:04:22.880> better<00:04:23.180> and

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
this one will grow much better and

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.879 
this one will grow much better and
that's<00:04:23.510> because<00:04:23.750> its<00:04:23.930> stem<00:04:24.199> is<00:04:24.350> entirely

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
that's because its stem is entirely

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.620 
that's because its stem is entirely
under<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.400> soil<00:04:25.639> so<00:04:25.910> when<00:04:26.030> you're<00:04:26.210> planting

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
under the soil so when you're planting

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.820 
under the soil so when you're planting
tomatoes<00:04:26.780> or<00:04:27.169> other<00:04:27.350> deadly<00:04:27.500> nightshade

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
tomatoes or other deadly nightshade

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.950 
tomatoes or other deadly nightshade
plants<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.699> can<00:04:28.850> plant<00:04:29.120> them<00:04:29.300> as<00:04:29.540> deep<00:04:29.780> as<00:04:29.930> you

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
plants you can plant them as deep as you

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.870 
plants you can plant them as deep as you
want<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.440> can<00:04:30.650> well<00:04:31.280> not<00:04:31.430> see<00:04:31.580> what<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.729> want

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
want you can well not see what you want

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.400 
want you can well not see what you want
but<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.030> can<00:04:32.150> continuously<00:04:32.660> plant<00:04:33.050> sandpaper

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
but you can continuously plant sandpaper

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.110 
but you can continuously plant sandpaper
you<00:04:33.440> can<00:04:33.680> move<00:04:33.860> them<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.280> ground<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:35.090> can

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
you can move them in the ground you can

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.150 
you can move them in the ground you can
take<00:04:35.360> them<00:04:35.510> up<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.750> put<00:04:36.139> them<00:04:36.169> lower<00:04:36.440> remember

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
take them up and put them lower remember

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.500 
take them up and put them lower remember
that<00:04:37.310> every<00:04:37.490> time<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:37.790> transplant<00:04:38.150> something

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
that every time you transplant something

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.150 
that every time you transplant something
it's<00:04:38.600> going<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.780> take<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.930> few<00:04:39.110> days<00:04:39.290> to<00:04:39.680> recover

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
it's going to take a few days to recover

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.760 
it's going to take a few days to recover
but<00:04:40.850> you<00:04:41.660> do<00:04:41.810> want<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.050> grow<00:04:42.199> them<00:04:42.380> in<00:04:42.500> little

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
but you do want to grow them in little

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.379 
but you do want to grow them in little
pots<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.430> then<00:04:43.610> move<00:04:43.760> them<00:04:43.850> into<00:04:44.030> bigger<00:04:44.210> pots

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
pots and then move them into bigger pots

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.030 
pots and then move them into bigger pots
and<00:04:44.720> then<00:04:44.870> move<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.080> bigger<00:04:45.260> pots<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.710> one<00:04:45.919> of

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
and then move the bigger pots and one of

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.320 
and then move the bigger pots and one of
the<00:04:46.100> really<00:04:46.340> good<00:04:46.460> reasons<00:04:46.789> why<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.030> want<00:04:47.270> to

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
the really good reasons why you want to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.740 
the really good reasons why you want to
do<00:04:47.449> that<00:04:47.660> it<00:04:48.020> is<00:04:48.380> because<00:04:48.710> um<00:04:49.150> it's<00:04:50.150> very<00:04:50.270> hard

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
do that it is because um it's very hard

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.320 
do that it is because um it's very hard
to<00:04:50.810> overwater<00:04:51.440> if<00:04:52.250> you've<00:04:52.580> got<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:52.850> plant<00:04:53.180> in

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
to overwater if you've got a plant in

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.850 
to overwater if you've got a plant in
such<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:53.539> small<00:04:53.870> pot<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.530> mean<00:04:56.380> it's<00:04:57.380> even<00:04:57.470> harder

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
such a small pot I mean it's even harder

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.500 
such a small pot I mean it's even harder
when<00:04:57.889> you're<00:04:58.100> using<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.430> mixer<00:04:58.729> but<00:04:59.000> in<00:04:59.180> general

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
when you're using a mixer but in general

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.060 
when you're using a mixer but in general
it's<00:04:59.660> pretty<00:04:59.960> hard<00:05:00.169> to<00:05:00.229> overwater<00:05:00.650> it's<00:05:00.949> not

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
it's pretty hard to overwater it's not

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.740 
it's pretty hard to overwater it's not
like<00:05:01.220> you're<00:05:01.340> gonna<00:05:01.460> put<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.180> little<00:05:02.449> guy<00:05:02.539> in<00:05:02.600> a

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750
