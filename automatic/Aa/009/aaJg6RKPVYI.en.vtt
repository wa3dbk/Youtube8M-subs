00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:09.049
 they are now either on the 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.400
 product side paid the slim 25 that is 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.830
 this little quick release plate or 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.219
 for the climate and mini this is this 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.779
 part 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.309
 and that is actually for it now 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.230
 actually thought that one has just 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.140
 precisely tuned to a size to 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.910
 this fast change class that has 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.920
 attach here on this klima mini 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.850
 Of course you can on the man 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.590
 themselves and others put 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.910
 attaching plates shows that 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.530
 but now count together and depending on 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.940
 The musician does not play a role 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.190
 as I said if now for this 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.239
 Small secret cheapest plate 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.100
 you need interest 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.309
 logically also a smart and so 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.839
 can because it will make just minor 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.370
 Why do substitute plates really work 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.229
 especially in times of small 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.809
 system cameras are built 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.489
 always immediately recognize that this 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.800
 slim plate so on these little ones 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.510
 That's what makes cameras work 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.010
 Of course you can always do this too 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.210
 cameras also make quick change plates 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.010
 the bigger ones are wider 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.379
 that succeeded by ratio about so 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.809
 look but there are also people 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.970
 and then we'll talk to you about it 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.310
 example, the camera is here on the ku 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.869
 tape fasten what your system camera 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.759
 or of affordable same small ones 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.380
 make camera pictures and then directly 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.750
 again just with fast government 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.159
 then take the camera and outside to 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.119
 for example, some more photos 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.369
 want to do and the problem 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.930
 that looks stupid what actually 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.579
 can be relatively no matter but somehow 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.340
 The whole thing is a bit hakelig 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.810
 is behind over and the whole then 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.000
 still with the climb still used 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.469
 and then the face before it is 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.409
 In any case it is not optimal 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.240
 just so some comfort remained 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.469
 problem often one would like to say so 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.700
 Of course this goes but can 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.640
 anyway, but do for the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.899
 comfortable user, so to speak , we have 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.579
 just now here specifically to this 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.439
 small camera models matched this 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.780
 small quick release plate which will open 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.960
 the equally small matching wide resp 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.850
 narrow band attached to the whole 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.259
 I'll show them right away 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.609
 But again briefly for explanation why 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.840
 to plan it at all 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.999
 I have the ju plate here now 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.829
 the camera attached here's our 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.250
 climate and watch us a little bit of 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.070
 the topic and has just here 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 with things that determine helicopter we 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.170
 then we have one here 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.520
 screw in it 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.430
 it has a thread what we get out below 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.860
 Look there you can then for example this plate 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.210
 we are stuck directly on a ball head 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.100
 has on the winner or there are 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.910
 tripods and can make the head from above 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.830
 only use 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.780
 with these the select win on top 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.890
 attach tripod or just stop 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.930
 also know that here for this 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.120
 for film-making that yes just always 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.340
 is of freaks and oberprex systems 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.810
 yes, others are among themselves 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.360
 coordinated if we have this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.330
 just screw it out and have it now 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.250
 here, for example, a flying head of 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.570
 Of course, that also works 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.760
 with every other ballhead like one 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.260
 has title winning drugs and then you can 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.380
 The whole just here then needs 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.180
 fix 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.680
 Again , the great advantage of this 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.910
 small narrow system you can 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.560
 of course now on the whole 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.970
 very small ball heads are also possible 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.700
 if the ball heads are even smaller 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.480
 the muses benefit that there is 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.920
 here another plate zwd the size 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.300
 is for this quick release plate the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 accordingly afterwards with the ball head 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.980
 then you would have the problem that you 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.630
 has just partially with the angle 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.040
 can get against this de then let 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.930
 all the controls are up to 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.250
 everything does not have to reach worse 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.600
 So as I said that is now 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.269
 Deputy also Andrew Fletcher 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.459
 head and there we have the youth now 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.610
 on the whole of course is here 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.989
 fitting logically then here simply 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.480
 used bolted and how to 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.769
 sees there is nothing about everything 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.959
 exactly matched extracting a 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.940
 small cameras with the big advantage 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.739
 that if I have the camera here now, too 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.530
 for example, in this 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.820
 Angular position are indeed also one 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.850
 tripod and I want to get here now and 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.230
 So a screw something is solvent resistant 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.650
 the simple one was not the camera 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.079
 I can fix the camera with me 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.420
 I can write down the camera so and so 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.620
 to collect jÃ¼rgen soil has been there 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.970
 also a safety children of 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.160
 prevents you therefore now 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.829
 just take out the whole system 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.269
 without you have previously noticed 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.709
 completely solved says so I can 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.860
 Camera is here only take out if 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.380
 I screw which had completely dissolved 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.130
 and then 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.520
 Do everything here 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.300
 demonstration does not hurt completely 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:28.030
 Everything slipped around but it is missing 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.010
 just do not get out to solve as I said 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.450
 the whole then completely entrepreneur 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.910
 A small special feature is still there 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.410
 a small wrench at and 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.610
 makes sure that if you have them ever 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.360
 after all he can do for a while 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.950
 give cameras 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.330
 Of course you can on these texts 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.490
 plates big cameras on it ever 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.540
 after how to buy that just but it 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.460
 Of course it can happen 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.410
 that is here if it somehow 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.120
 then turn that and the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.380
 mechanics and so on always the visor 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.940
 to move as you can but the Sun 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.560
 of course that can be in the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.560
 sometime still a bit solve 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.810
 season then we have two here once 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.280
 small holes the home is felt there 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.990
 So is this safety reasons the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.310
 prevents the camera with the 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.080
 spitex partie fails as just 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.470
 showed and here is a screw 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.990
 in it 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.820
 For that, the key can be and how to 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.470
 which starts here and then you can the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.670
 make a speech then turns down on the 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.990
 On the other side, I'll tell you the same 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.270
 once again a pin out of the 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.380
 prevents that or here on 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.620
 this rubberized surface of the 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.050
 ball head that one here so the mount 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.390
 the fortification here that they are still 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.100
 turn to the side 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:34.050
 additional protection because what he's talking 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.050
 Actually, we do it all for a long time 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.920
 and this is a small one 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.920
 screw and here I found easy 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.170
 if I then with the screw around it 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.640
 screw then comes out and the 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.500
 expresses itself thus the leverage here 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.850
 down to normalization and that 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.590
 prevents also just that one to 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.750
 therefore you do not see yourself as an example 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.220
 inadvertently twisted can of course 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.140
 still accept everything when 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.000
 everything solves but as I said there you have to 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.650
 It's not great at all 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.940
 think about it so if you feel like it 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.360
 everything is always in between 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:13.050
 check and check if 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.130
 everything is really solid so here so 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.770
 as I have just demonstrated him 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.840
 once the missing plate and to that 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.700
 fitting team on everything optimally 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.569
 matched by the larger one 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.039
 from the broad can be small 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.619
 so extreme and then they come 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.330
 anyway large tripod exchange rate 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.339
 including the whole of the 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.349
 the part has just over especially for the 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:36.169
 small cameras here in our shop of 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:38.259
 novoflex the crew the climate and us this 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.259
 Not
