the<00:01:54.689> test<00:01:54.960> however<00:01:55.560> there<00:01:56.009> may<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:56.790> two

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the test however there may be one or two

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060 
the test however there may be one or two
the<00:01:57.570> biggest<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.890> be

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the biggest one is that I will be

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.590 
the biggest one is that I will be
dropping<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.579> same<00:01:59.820> phone<00:02:00.119> from<00:02:00.390> four

dropping the same phone from four

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
dropping the same phone from four
different<00:02:00.719> heights<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.340> sure<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> phone

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
different heights I'm not sure the phone

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.179 
different heights I'm not sure the phone
can<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> weekend<00:02:03.750> per<00:02:03.990> se<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.500> may<00:02:04.740> after

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
can a weekend per se but it may after

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.830 
can a weekend per se but it may after
several<00:02:05.579> drops<00:02:05.820> start<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.299> lose<00:02:06.570> its

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
several drops start to lose its

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.279 
several drops start to lose its
durability<00:02:07.409> now<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.399> second<00:02:09.090> reason<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
durability now the second reason is the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.020 
durability now the second reason is the
phone<00:02:10.500> may<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.890> make<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> end<00:02:11.790> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
phone may not make it out to the end and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.220 
phone may not make it out to the end and
if<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.180> doesn't<00:02:12.480> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
if it doesn't I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.839 
if it doesn't I
may<00:02:13.349> not<00:02:13.530> be<00:02:13.769> able<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.040> pull<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> video<00:02:14.519> off

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
may not be able to pull the video off

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.520 
may not be able to pull the video off
the<00:02:15.209> phone<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.599> I'm<00:02:15.690> gonna<00:02:15.780> try<00:02:16.050> as<00:02:16.140> hard<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.409> I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
the phone so I'm gonna try as hard as I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.740 
the phone so I'm gonna try as hard as I
can<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.950> get<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.129> video<00:02:17.489> off<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.360> phone<00:02:18.569> and

can to get that video off the phone and
into<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:19.500> video<00:02:19.799> but<00:02:20.250> if<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> don't<00:02:20.640> see<00:02:20.819> it

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
into this video but if you don't see it

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.240 
into this video but if you don't see it
that's<00:02:21.750> why<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.440> phone<00:02:22.620> didn't<00:02:22.920> survive<00:02:23.190> but

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
that's why the phone didn't survive but

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.520 
that's why the phone didn't survive but
hopefully<00:02:23.909> this<00:02:24.450> Apple<00:02:24.840> bumpers<00:02:25.140> case<00:02:25.319> will

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
hopefully this Apple bumpers case will

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.380 
hopefully this Apple bumpers case will
protect<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.220> phone<00:02:26.400> from<00:02:26.610> all<00:02:26.819> four<00:02:27.090> drops

itself<00:06:13.889> as<00:06:14.159> we<00:06:14.310> go<00:06:14.430> around<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.819> band<00:06:15.620> that's

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
itself as we go around the band that's

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.080 
itself as we go around the band that's
okay<00:06:16.979> other<00:06:17.099> than<00:06:17.189> a<00:06:17.340> little<00:06:17.490> warping<00:06:18.060> right

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
okay other than a little warping right

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.279 
okay other than a little warping right
here<00:06:19.279> but<00:06:20.279> it<00:06:20.759> will<00:06:20.879> not<00:06:21.060> even<00:06:21.300> turn<00:06:21.840> on<00:06:21.870> so

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
here but it will not even turn on so

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:23.659 
here but it will not even turn on so
that<00:06:22.439> is<00:06:22.590> not<00:06:22.860> a<00:06:22.919> good<00:06:23.189> sign

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
that is not a good sign

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.550 
that is not a good sign

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
hopefully we can get things up and

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.209 
hopefully we can get things up and
running<00:06:25.669> so<00:06:26.669> I'd<00:06:26.789> say<00:06:27.029> that<00:06:27.240> for<00:06:27.270> free<00:06:28.219> the
