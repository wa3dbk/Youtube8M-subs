00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.379
 follow from a small tutorial and in 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 this episode I would like to show you how 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.809
 one with different commands from 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.309
 coming blocks a jump'n'run yet 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.839
 can make something better 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.029
 and I always have it as a small one 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.970
 Although built not great and via 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.460
 one almost so in itself nothing except that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.050
 already seen except when you as a time 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.760
 succeeded in doing her bed and then 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.529
 wait and then jump and a long 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.170
 words, for example, fall 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.030
 once down and then save as me 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.130
 again and from the sea means if you 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.059
 here at election time and waiting so long 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.590
 then it falls underneath and yes you are called 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.320
 you have to part as fast as you can 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.920
 possible from the doctor bob hop around there ans 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.140
 to come 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.500
 and that is a consequence of his command 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 sections follow Arabic in one 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 result shows I hope that the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.739
 Most of these follow me because of me 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.449
 have the year link to it and if 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.629
 here too since then it's about here 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.399
 this triangle come this is you 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.680
 sea ​​but it is not just about one 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.020
 row because each of these rows stands for 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.479
 a blog here and we also take time 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 here is the first row and yes in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.549
 this series is about a spot 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.740
 friend so we ask if so the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.530
 So does ask is that I now 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.979
 the sensor of in a row and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 So the sensor powerpoint I had 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.530
 a spot of one person and the one in 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 the proximity of these continents so - 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.280
 242 57 and 378 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.500
 who are in these coordinates and in the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 circle of a blog then becomes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.790
 queried 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.950
 and then on these coordinates 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.510
 about that the customers set then 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.840
 but only for people then 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.520
 in here and yes that means you can 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.850
 show this in short when I am here and court 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.590
 am 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.870
 did you see back there that's the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.430
 border then it lights up briefly on the 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.160
 means if I'm on it then 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.630
 register that and then it works 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.880
 continue 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.950
 and that's the video as well as that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.850
 aha noted there is somebody far as the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.930
 object falls down 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.150
 what should with the command before 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.550
 left and I have that from here 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.520
 from explained so exactly for the mainzer 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.130
 those who want to know it and that of 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.960
 essent and it is then the blog of the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.680
 to fall on the block of the first 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.470
 then in these coordinates and yes it 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.560
 would be with the idea of ​​flock heidi 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:38.080
 Wehrmacht 90 that would be exactly that 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.270
 here and here you see 98 and yes and 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.970
 then we have to zero it 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.130
 so if he does and then do not drop 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.290
 stop without it does not work then 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.090
 it was not said a pal and drips 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.070
 nothing works but if he falls over then 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.300
 he does not think so there is 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.970
 different possibilities that if you 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.830
 that would get out of here now and then 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.580
 would not bet he would be there 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.680
 stay simple 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.560
 so we have to sit down what as 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.250
 uS troops brings and that can here a 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.920
 be a torch 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.080
 a redstone a trapdoor or a 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.500
 shield or whatever it is 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.370
 his 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.280
 whatever the house needs right here 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.870
 be happy day or anything else it can 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.310
 just to bring that as a miracle and stuff 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.170
 it falls down and then it goes on 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.520
 so minister has registered it goes 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.680
 on the next and a window down 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.690
 must author a trekkie therefore one sets 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.680
 First of all, you only have one here 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.140
 computer room 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.030
 that is, if it markets or is 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.739
 someone then it is indeed a signal 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.489
 and then it will also be a signal 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.070
 withdrawn 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.170
 then it goes on it will be down 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.450
 continues again long sits down 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.489
 again blog therefore blog command 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.500
 and here again just write 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.870
 and then just to the coordinates where 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.760
 it should be used 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.950
 and that's the idea of a blog 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.790
 that was as I said this blocked and 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.780
 that was it then already 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.459
 and that's why he just wanted a blog me 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.780
 have here a funnel blog goes here 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.239
 a block of blocks always through one after the other 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.860
 and then here again a complete way 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.150
 so that even if that goes through a signal 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.840
 then go out and then 1 5 liters then here 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.269
 the Romans goes and gets these signals 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.640
 this blog and this blog and that too 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.010
 company and with that too is 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.540
 among them 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.160
 and that is one possibility here 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.830
 you can use it so it works differently 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.870
 but and that is a possibility here 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.729
 how to make a jump run even more effective 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.020
 can make 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.400
 Of course you can also if for 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.080
 the special people also down here 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.760
 make a countdown with the medium 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.290
 that must make time with his vote 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.930
 it will be much better everything 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.250
 and yes I was only what one thing 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.970
 you wanted to show yourself when you're done 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.060
 the pattern of his admirers falls and 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.919
 that we put there is something in it 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.630
 a lot of work now for everyone a blog too 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.210
 Therefore, like to make small for rand 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.000
 but it should work and yes 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.880
 I would now have a duration 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.169
 point forward or comments and if 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.510
 you also want to know something I what 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.060
 can show you then write me vpn 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.430
 or comments or whatever 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.990
 and yes, I also wanted to say of it 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.729
 do not have a facebook page if you 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.850
 The times guide forest damage description 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.590
 and on the channel can find the time 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.810
 and yes the water for this consequence 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.740
 and yes thank you for watching one 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.740
 the next episode draws
