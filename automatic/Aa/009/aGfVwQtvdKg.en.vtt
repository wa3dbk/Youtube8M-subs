00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.320
 for many years the intelligence 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.750
 artificial was a science subject 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.610
 fiction and from the principles of 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.730
 computing was never thought to be 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.190
 would come to create a thinking being but 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.470
 Believe it or not, that has stopped being 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.920
 just a subject taken from the imagination of 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.500
 writers 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.719
 today artificial intelligence is 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.309
 something that starts to cause controversy 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.229
 among the scientific community 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.629
 mainly in the area of â€‹â€‹mechanics 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.339
 quantum that is nowadays 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.350
 working on a computer that 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.670
 far exceed the power of the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.009
 largest current computers 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.780
 although it is very difficult to imagine 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.420
 that a lot of circuits acquire 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.430
 intelligence the technological advance has 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 allowed to develop robots that have 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 a slight IQ 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.940
 intelligence of these robots is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.950
 comparable to that of insects 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.750
 according to the law of moore the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.090
 capacity of computers has been 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.400
 duplicated every 2 years and it is estimated that 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.740
 will continue like this for at least the next 20 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.020
 years this because the transistors 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.270
 current silicon generate too much 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.540
 more and more heat which makes 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.880
 impossible to continue working with them 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.340
 as I said the scientists are 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.350
 working on new computers more 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.750
 powerful this time with a technology 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.600
 that would be thousands of times more advanced 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.910
 than the current one but even though not yet 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.830
 we have that technology the signs of 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.780
 that there is a hidden intelligence 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.730
 evolving in the network has caused great 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.950
 controversy 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.530
 the world is increasingly connected to 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.690
 through computers practically 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.700
 all services such as water is 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.890
 light and the gas supply depend on 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.230
 a computer including the economy 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.220
 world is reflected in digital numbers 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.140
 controlled by computers 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.280
 that's why a cyber war 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.990
 between world powers is imminent 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.300
 this because the fear of hackers 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.460
 grows every day more if someday by 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.710
 example the computers of the pentagon 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.260
 are hacked nothing would prevent launch the 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.360
 nuclear missiles from the USA to any 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.890
 country is why the war 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.330
 cybernetics has started very 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.760
 discreetly 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.880
 but what would happen if the real enemy 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.980
 was not a hacker but an intelligence 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.220
 artificial that slowly evolves in 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.220
 the net 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.319
 in the last 10 years the internet has 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.329
 gone dominating the world and one of the 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.739
 most powerful companies on the planet has 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.629
 developed neural networks 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.030
 artificial today 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.700
 consider as artificial intelligence 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.650
 it's just amazing these networks 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.660
 neuronal have shown signs of 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.459
 interpretation of the artificial world in 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.240
 images very similar to those of the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.240
 fractal geometry 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.780
 according to google these images are 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.000
 created by artificial intelligence 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.220
 developed by these neural networks 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.410
 and it is the definitive proof that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.850
 computers can acquire awareness 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.880
 about the world they are in 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.860
 despite this the current technology 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.320
 prevents a computer from exceeding the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.150
 intelligence of a human being this 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.470
 because the transistors was 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.470
 of silicon is about to end 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.990
 but without a doubt the new way of 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.940
 computing that is found 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.950
 developing in these moments will have 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.190
 the power to acquire an intelligence 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.190
 advanced 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.950
 and quantum computing is undoubtedly the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.540
 next great advance of humanity and it 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.790
 has developed to replace the 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.639
 current technology based on transistors 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.139
 of silicon 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.219
 but how technology works 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.379
 quantum technology today is based on 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.240
 binary code called bit so that a 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:33.550
 computer can perform an operation 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.979
 requires a certain amount of bits to 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.199
 work while a normal good can 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.090
 perform four one-bit combinations 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.189
 quantum also called quabit can 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.740
 perform four times more and without generating 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.629
 the same amount of heat for which 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.610
 a few quantum bits would be 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:51.190
 enough to overcome any mega 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.680
 current computer 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.600
 it is believed that many years are still 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.670
 that we can develop a computer 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.230
 quantum and the scope that could have 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.860
 this new technology would be 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.319
 unattainable 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.090
 but to apply on this computer a 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.979
 artificial neural network like the one that has 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.900
 developed the google company would be 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.710
 something that would far surpass our 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.840
 artificial intelligence perspective 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.520
 the creation of an intelligent being has 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.680
 It has often been the subject of science 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.440
 fiction in movies like me robots 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.570
 matrix and terminator not really 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.760
 we know what intelligence would be like 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.890
 this being but considering all 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.200
 simulations have made a 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.880
 highly advanced intelligence would come 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.980
 to the conclusion that human beings 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.980
 we are dangerous for the planet 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.980
 unfortunately if a computer 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.840
 Quantum decides to end the race 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.880
 human would not take a second 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.070
 hack all the systems of the world and 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.620
 launch the nuclear missiles of countries 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.760
 like russia and usa ending the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.760
 humanity in seconds 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.370
 no no 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.180
 good friends how do you see this is a small 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.310
 special for the 40 thousand subscribers not 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.500
 I have words to thank you all for 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.050
 support I never thought I 'd reach this figure 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.820
 I want to welcome the new ones 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.250

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.530
 I hope to see you here commenting and leaving 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.020
 your opinion in my videos there's nothing that 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.060
 make me happier do not forget me 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.969
 Greetings so here they go and see you in 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.299
