episode of ask a physicist I have been a
little<00:00:13.730> recently<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.570> took<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
little recently so this one took a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.939 
little recently so this one took a
little<00:00:16.320> longer<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.619> make<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.130> expected<00:00:17.630> but

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
little longer to make and expected but

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.509 
little longer to make and expected but
enough<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.130> excuses<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.789> let's<00:00:21.420> get<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.660> on

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
enough of it excuses and let's get it on

enough of it excuses and let's get it on
Chicago<00:00:23.519> cups<00:00:25.760> 1060<00:00:26.760> asked<00:00:27.240> me<00:00:27.680> what<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
Chicago cups 1060 asked me what is the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
Chicago cups 1060 asked me what is the
most<00:00:29.099> no<00:00:29.400> gravity<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:29.970> earth<00:00:30.179> would<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.109> just

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
most no gravity on earth would we just

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.020 
most no gravity on earth would we just
slowly<00:00:31.890> float<00:00:32.189> into<00:00:32.430> outer<00:00:32.550> space

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
slowly float into outer space

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.970 
slowly float into outer space
what<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.719> stay<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.350> ground<00:00:34.500> until

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
what would we stay on the ground until

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.690 
what would we stay on the ground until
we<00:00:35.160> jumped<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> then<00:00:36.329> float<00:00:36.690> into<00:00:37.410> space<00:00:37.700> well

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
we jumped and then float into space well

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.060 
we jumped and then float into space well
I<00:00:38.730> thought<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:39.510> an<00:00:39.660> interesting

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
I thought it was an interesting

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.950 
I thought it was an interesting
hypothetical<00:00:41.070> scenario<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.780> gives

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
hypothetical scenario so so that gives

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.119 
hypothetical scenario so so that gives
us<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> try<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:44.730> ants<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.030> afraid<00:00:45.920> there<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
us a try the ants I'm afraid there is

well<00:00:50.760> let's<00:00:51.210> stop<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> start<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:53.640> I've

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
well let's stop on the start as I've

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.360 
well let's stop on the start as I've
explained<00:00:54.300> before<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.410> reason<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.980> stick<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
explained before the reason we stick to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
explained before the reason we stick to
the<00:00:56.460> ground<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.449> office<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the ground is because office of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.229 
the ground is because office of
gravitational<00:00:58.590> pull<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> earth<00:00:59.239> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
gravitational pull of the earth the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.959 
gravitational pull of the earth the
earth<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> very<00:01:00.690> massive<00:01:01.230> object<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> we

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
earth is a very massive object and we

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.929 
earth is a very massive object and we
are<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.510> close<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.140> hence<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.400> exerts<00:01:05.790> on

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
are very close to it hence it exerts on

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.679 
are very close to it hence it exerts on
us<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.240> very<00:01:06.420> strong<00:01:06.600> gravitational<00:01:07.560> force

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
us a very strong gravitational force

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.469 
us a very strong gravitational force
however<00:01:09.689> ZF<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.409> also<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.890> rotating<00:01:11.790> object<00:01:13.460> it

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
however ZF is also a rotating object it

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
however ZF is also a rotating object it
makes<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.600> full<00:01:15.840> rotation<00:01:16.020> about<00:01:16.500> every<00:01:16.860> 24

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
makes a full rotation about every 24

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030 
makes a full rotation about every 24
hours<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.420> why<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.020> night<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.710> day

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
hours which is why we have night and day

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
hours which is why we have night and day

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
essentially this means that if you stand

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.400 
essentially this means that if you stand

you<00:03:11.489> have<00:03:11.670> squared<00:03:12.380> divided<00:03:13.380> by<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.650> radius

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
of the earth and if you do the maths you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.160 
of the earth and if you do the maths you
will<00:03:17.790> see<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.360> centripetal<00:03:18.660> force

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.720 
required to keep you on the Earth's
surface<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:22.319> much<00:03:22.620> smaller<00:03:23.100> since<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
surface is much smaller since the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.870 
surface is much smaller since the
gravitational<00:03:23.880> force<00:03:24.540> due<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.079> your<00:03:25.320> mass<00:03:25.530> and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
gravitational force due to your mass and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.030 
gravitational force due to your mass and
so<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.450> will<00:03:27.810> stick<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.380> ground<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.829> not

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
so you will stick to the ground and not

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.370 
so you will stick to the ground and not
float<00:03:29.310> into<00:03:29.519> space<00:03:30.380> normally<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:33.209> that's<00:03:34.049> that

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
float into space normally so that's that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.710 
float into space normally so that's that
let's<00:03:35.130> see<00:03:35.400> what<00:03:35.609> happens<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.209> magically

let's see what happens if you magically

course to avoid such a fate you could

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.289 
course to avoid such a fate you could
simply<00:03:55.380> decide<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.890> live<00:03:56.130> at<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.670> North<00:03:56.850> or

simply decide to live at the North or

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.780 
simply decide to live at the North or
the<00:03:57.359> South<00:03:57.480> Pole<00:03:58.250> here<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.430> are<00:03:59.489> simply

the South Pole here you are simply

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.849 
the South Pole here you are simply

force<00:04:06.690> or<00:04:06.870> quite<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.470> keep<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.769> there<00:04:08.239> so<00:04:09.239> when

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
force or quite to keep you there so when

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.990 
force or quite to keep you there so when
gravity<00:04:10.500> goes<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.920> will<00:04:11.069> just<00:04:11.340> hang<00:04:11.730> there

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
gravity goes you will just hang there

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.830 
gravity goes you will just hang there
