00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
most in the green here and it works its

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.650 
most in the green here and it works its
way<00:03:25.709> out<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.280> triangle<00:03:26.910> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.120> ends<00:03:27.540> so

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
way out of the triangle on the ends so

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
do then you're going to need an extreme

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.530 
do then you're going to need an extreme
duty<00:03:40.380> tire<00:03:40.910> but<00:03:41.910> you're<00:03:42.120> not<00:03:42.209> going<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.480> be

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
duty tire but you're not going to be

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.509 
duty tire but you're not going to be
able<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.750> use<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.049> very<00:03:43.290> well<00:03:43.500> if<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:44.010> are<00:03:44.370> on

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
able to use that very well if you are on

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.039 
able to use that very well if you are on
the<00:03:44.700> road<00:03:44.880> if<00:03:45.120> you're<00:03:45.209> driving<00:03:45.420> around<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
the road if you're driving around on the

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.900 
the road if you're driving around on the
road<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> lot<00:03:46.500> it's<00:03:47.160> going<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.519> lot<00:03:47.760> of

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
road a lot it's going to have a lot of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.210 
road a lot it's going to have a lot of
noise<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.630> it's<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:49.650> going<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.829> be<00:03:49.950> really

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
noise and it's just going to be really

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.509 
noise and it's just going to be really
slick<00:03:50.549> on<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.910> road<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.980> if<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.130> live<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.459> a

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
slick on the road so if you live in a

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.000 
slick on the road so if you live in a
place<00:03:53.640> like<00:03:53.850> Moab<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.750> there's<00:03:55.079> where<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.890> go

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
place like Moab and there's where you go

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.380 
place like Moab and there's where you go
off-roading<00:03:56.400> there's<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.730> lot<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:57.090> traction

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
off-roading there's a lot of traction

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.140 
off-roading there's a lot of traction
and<00:03:58.280> when<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.430> kind<00:03:59.640> of<00:03:59.730> thing<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.060> can

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
and when that kind of thing you can

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.030 
and when that kind of thing you can
probably<00:04:00.420> go<00:04:00.630> ahead<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.049> use<00:04:01.530> an<00:04:01.680> all-terrain

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
probably go ahead and use an all-terrain

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.449 
probably go ahead and use an all-terrain
tire<00:04:02.459> because<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:04.170> don't<00:04:04.350> need<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.250> much

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
tire because you don't need so much

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.690 
tire because you don't need so much
looks<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:06.239> much<00:04:06.420> grip<00:04:06.750> because<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:08.070> the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
looks and so much grip because the the

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.520 
looks and so much grip because the the
sandstone<00:04:09.180> will<00:04:09.390> do<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:09.690> for<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.049> alright

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
sandstone will do that for you alright

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.050 
sandstone will do that for you alright
so<00:04:10.709> one<00:04:10.890> more<00:04:11.070> thing<00:04:11.100> before<00:04:11.340> we<00:04:11.730> go

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
so one more thing before we go

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.539 
so one more thing before we go
I<00:04:12.269> get<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> lot<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:12.989> questions<00:04:13.410> about<00:04:13.590> what<00:04:14.340> size
