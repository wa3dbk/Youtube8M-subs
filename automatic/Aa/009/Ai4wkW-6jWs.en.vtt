so I have a lot of different types of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.330 
so I have a lot of different types of
ammo<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.750> 22s<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> shoot<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
ammo that for my 22s that I shoot and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.810 
ammo that for my 22s that I shoot and
each<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.300> good<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.899> something<00:00:52.410> else<00:00:52.820> but

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
each one is good for something else but

over the years that I've been shooting
I've<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> leaned<00:00:58.320> towards<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.309> type<00:00:59.670> of

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I've kind of leaned towards one type of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.229 
I've kind of leaned towards one type of
ammo<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.420> has<00:01:00.690> been<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.260> favorite<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
ammo that has been my favorite and that

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.810 
ammo that has been my favorite and that
has<00:01:03.239> been<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.809> CCI<00:01:04.439> mini<00:01:04.530> mag<00:01:05.010> now<00:01:05.369> over<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
has been the CCI mini mag now over the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.270 
has been the CCI mini mag now over the
years<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:07.200> shooting<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> mini<00:01:07.860> mag<00:01:08.040> I've

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
problem with this ammo either

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.699 
problem with this ammo either
however<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.509> tests<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.020> I've<00:02:10.170> done<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
however the tests that I've done and the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.619 
however the tests that I've done and the
tests<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.009> I've<00:02:11.160> seen<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.879> all<00:02:12.120> gotten

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
tests that I've seen I have all gotten

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.250 
tests that I've seen I have all gotten
better<00:02:12.989> penetration

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
better penetration

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.770 
better penetration
and<00:02:14.349> better<00:02:15.010> expansion<00:02:15.879> out<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.659> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and better expansion out of the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.770 
and better expansion out of the
Winchester<00:02:17.379> super<00:02:17.709> axe<00:02:17.860> rounds<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:19.540> just

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
Winchester super axe rounds so you just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.380 
Winchester super axe rounds so you just
for<00:02:20.440> some<00:02:20.620> reason<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.159> travels<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.790> couple

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
for some reason it travels a couple

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.050 
for some reason it travels a couple
inches<00:02:22.540> deeper<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.980> expands<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.700> little

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
inches deeper and it expands a little

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.460 
inches deeper and it expands a little
bit<00:02:25.180> wider<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.750> if<00:02:26.470> both<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.920> these<00:02:27.250> ammo

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
bit wider so if both of these ammo

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.119 
bit wider so if both of these ammo
manufacturers<00:02:29.470> are<00:02:29.620> making<00:02:29.650> something

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
manufacturers are making something

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.309 
manufacturers are making something
that's<00:02:30.250> completely<00:02:30.700> reliable<00:02:31.360> but<00:02:32.140> one

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
that's completely reliable but one

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.259 
that's completely reliable but one
penetrates<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.890> little<00:02:33.099> bit<00:02:33.220> more<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.610> expands

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
penetrates a little bit more and expands

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.559 
penetrates a little bit more and expands
a<00:02:34.330> little<00:02:34.510> bit<00:02:34.629> better<00:02:36.180> even<00:02:37.180> though<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.299> love

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
a little bit better even though I love

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.240 
a little bit better even though I love
the<00:02:37.599> CCI<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.110> think<00:02:38.560> I'm<00:02:38.709> just<00:02:38.860> gonna<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.220> to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the CCI I think I'm just gonna have to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.949 
the CCI I think I'm just gonna have to
lean<00:02:39.549> towards<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.030> super<00:02:40.329> axe<00:02:40.480> as<00:02:40.629> being<00:02:40.840> my

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
lean towards the super axe as being my

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.690 
lean towards the super axe as being my
actual<00:02:41.260> favorite<00:02:41.470> doesn't<00:02:42.430> mean<00:02:42.519> I'm<00:02:42.579> gonna

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
actual favorite doesn't mean I'm gonna

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.520 
actual favorite doesn't mean I'm gonna
stop<00:02:42.970> buying<00:02:43.209> CCI<00:02:43.750> or<00:02:43.900> any<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.200> other

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
stop buying CCI or any of the other

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.729 
stop buying CCI or any of the other
brands<00:02:44.739> but<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.629> think<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.780> super<00:02:47.170> X<00:02:47.349> is<00:02:47.560> going

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
brands but I think the super X is going

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.660 
brands but I think the super X is going
to<00:02:47.860> be<00:02:47.980> my<00:02:48.340> new<00:02:48.900> go-to<00:02:49.920> round<00:02:50.920> when<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.489> comes

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
to be my new go-to round when it comes

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.300 
to be my new go-to round when it comes
to<00:02:51.879> my<00:02:52.060> 22<00:02:52.510> now<00:02:53.079> everything<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.099> table

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
to my 22 now everything on this table

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.910 
to my 22 now everything on this table
has<00:02:54.670> its<00:02:54.849> own<00:02:55.060> reason<00:02:55.359> for<00:02:55.569> being<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.829> I

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
has its own reason for being and and I

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.069 
has its own reason for being and and I
understand<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.549> for<00:02:58.180> instance<00:02:58.540> uh<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.989> know
