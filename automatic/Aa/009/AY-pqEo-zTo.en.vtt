00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 news for you here put in a nutshell 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.500
 I'm jean with these were headlines from 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.270
 the past week last week the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.240
 gaming industry plagued by 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.400
 multiple dls attacks and hackers group 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.740
 blizzard's genome god has all 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.449
 Claimed via Twitter 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.550
 the d huez attack is when a group 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.050
 people constantly trying to connect 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.790
 search with a server 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.739
 this can cause the overflow causing 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 the server can crash 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.160
 another one last Sunday 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.600
 battlenet from and blew out why the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.200
 in other words barcraft a hearthstone 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 turn it on 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 affected and also service of games such as 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 league of legends and paul van de excel 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.149
 were hit by these attacks but 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.800
 it was the biggest victim 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
 playstation network 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.780
 this law hit so hard until it 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 entire network was taken offline 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 with the result that playstation 3 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.699
 playstation vita 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.949
 and playstation 4 times was a day long 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.780
 not being able to play online is a problem 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 were helped fairly quickly but there 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.340
 of course, they remained with the attacks 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.200
 went through xbox live among others 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.420
 sandwich were also hit by 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.830
 similar DDOS attacks 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.390
 and for clarity for that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.860
 everyone panicked of everyone 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.150
 god and god the vet is always one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.759
 have a spot from a few years ago 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.460
 no a DDOS attack is quite different 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.619
 then in a server hacker there is there 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 absolutely no data was stolen 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.799
 so in that sense nothing is wrong 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.180
 the only thing that happens is then is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.490
 the shot has caused that 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.060
 tens of thousands of game was not for hours 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.680
 could play my favorite game online 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.680
 and that's nice 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.540
 motherfucker designers and salmon 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.370
 twitcht bought over earlier came the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.840
 posts within that google is one 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.000
 streaming things would sell for one 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.040
 billion dollars but these notifications 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.390
 were therefore found to be incorrect 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.190
 according to several sources , twitch 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.110
 not purchased by this party because 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.750
 Google a monopolistic filter 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.550
 namely as a twix 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.900
 would have bought over means 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.450
 that the company behind the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.880
 search engine and youtube both the largest 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.100
 video website from america as well 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.150
 the largest streaming service 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.470
 from America 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.270
 but that doesn't matter because 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.030
 and we will therefore have bought two 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.060
 for an amount of 900 and 70 million 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.830
 dollar had once went around claiming 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.200
 that wits will remain on its own 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.540
 function with financial support 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.730
 from bucket sun this is similar to 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.330
 the purchase of worried by facebook 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.550
 fans of the vr headsets very nice 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.230
 device have since purchased as 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.730
 nothing worked well 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.260
 we are of course still there too 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.240

 be or not and also not for nintendo 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.330
 it has also been very nice news 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.320
 last week as it is and is 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.300

 beat in the gameplay style 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.190
 how fat is this game 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.170
 developed by namco bandai 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.459
 Bandai Namco also hears up and on 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.480

 for japan and in the arcade all in 2015 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.750
 subtle hint to bring that Nintendo 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.120
 poker and we had you as soon as possible 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.510
 but you also see each other get a deal 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.879
 gladly 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.430
 new characters and 16 new jobs 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.079

 out and the casting becomes playable with 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.450
 in other words nintendo say fuck mario 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.409
 go awake 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.760
 karting is super heavy from serious to 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.799
 the switch dozen 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.629
 and the first set of amiibo figurines is 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.940
 These are his little toys 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.069
 little things skylanders like dolls 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.909
 which can on your Wii you controller 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.040
 put down 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.599

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.200
 of course it looks great on you too 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.940

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.360
 famous Nintendo characters 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.310
 American these filters on the period 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.500
 for 13 dollars each 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.930
 the expectation is that the price in europe 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.060
 around 13 euros 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.979

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.099
 so you are not in a certain position 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.020
 must keep amiibo supporters who 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.780
