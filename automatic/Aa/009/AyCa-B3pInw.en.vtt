00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.389
 good spicy sauce 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.610
 first in the america script 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 a first second position is 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.950
 directly brings them to the end of the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 grand prix champions of europe sus 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.970
 world champions 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.200
 have had a month to modify 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.770
 those things that did not have very 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.770
 settled 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 Y 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.679
 I think your 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
 75 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.130
 triple light released 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.940
 the spiral on the outer edge changes 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.940
 hand 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.250
 i 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:38.430
 how well the best in synchrony in 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.430
 technique 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.280
 and 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.980
 perfection when making the jumps 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.030
 they have done well the triple twist with a lot 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.150
 fluency and solvency doing well in 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.790
 all its phases 3 to 2 because in 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.390
 parallel the launch have chosen the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.230
 Title 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.670
 the pirouette the spiral of death in the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.230
 external soil that also affects 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.599
 you can not put any faults 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.530
 they should go head first 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.450
 position this year have had a 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.060
 score of 65 points that of being in 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.060
 house will also serve them for 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.530
 have a good 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.030
 a good performance and a good grade the 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.030
 most odd haircut has 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.490
 maxim stride 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.940
 and that's where she goes as the low 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.650
 the glasses and comes back up again 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.110
 to pick you up perfectly is that it gives 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.330
 nice to see these performances 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.990
 with a brutal technical solvency 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.580
 the trip is something perfect controlled in 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.380
 all its phases by both and the triple 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.550
 thrown out 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.370
 apart from 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.930
 well launched has taken length and in addition 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.930
 the reception has been very good 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.680
 they will only be these poor 2 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.180
 games a little equivocal I do not know if they are 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.009
 partner or they are not why 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.660
 the earth by lifting them at the time 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.430
 was a couple of the coach that is the 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.190
 sir that is on the right that I am his 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.190
 old co- worker stanislas 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.919
 defaulter but since this couple was 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:21.190
 put together I do not know if the personal couple 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.520
 between and tatiana and stanislaw broke up and 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.520
 now 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.169
 Whites are always playing a 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.779
 so a bit ambiguous 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.150
 well you have already seen the score they are going 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:37.240
 to the first position with 74 points of 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.830
 long I needed 66 to go to the 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.569
 first position and they have got it from 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.569
 long they take 8
