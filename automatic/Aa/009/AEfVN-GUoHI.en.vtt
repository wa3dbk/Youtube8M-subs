00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.340
 i 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.920
 good as they are I hope it is very good 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.960
 you should be wondering what rays 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.820
 disguised as a pirate and well this is 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.549
 It's because I just saw the movie 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.260
 Sing equinox sing at age are but 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.750
 I saw him pirates maybe to see him in 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.970
 the cinema of japan so he did not feel 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.920
 very honest let's say so I decided 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.560
 get married pirate but good to take me 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.840
 this hat and this patch because I 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.789
 they are bothering a bit to be a lot 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.739
 better alright let's start with this 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.589
 review the amount of negative reviews 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.769
 who received this movie is amazing 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:41.170
 before I saw her I knew her reputation but 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.199
 I said nothing the unit the same and give my 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.199
 opinion 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.780
 well then and the movie and if the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.280
 true that like most of the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.089
 invasion that I have seen throughout my 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.219
 life was not the big thing but so bad 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.350
 so horrible I do not think it entertained me 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.269
 but if we compare it with anime with 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.580
 the manga chingue ginocchio jim does not 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.409
 comes not even the heels because good 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.049
 let's start first that nothing that is already 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.969
 and as real as possible within this 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.009
 world where there are giant crystals 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.170
 that wants to crush us eat whatever 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.149
 but good looking to give encouragement to everything 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.189
 this as for example modifying the 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.899
 names of some characters but more 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.030
 of the roll because he wants to modify that 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.219
 but we continue with the equipment of 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.689
 this for maneuvers in 3d where 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.609
 continue almost forget it I will leave 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.229
 link to see the movie not in the 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.939
 description but in my comment of 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.950
 down here there is a comment from me though 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.390
 what has the direct link I do 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.369
 because you can put the description the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.349
 I have problems with copyright and I do not 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.060
 I want nobody to fuck so I looked in 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.390
 my comment has a link to call 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.390
 the play 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.999
 manila thank you thanks from here is going to be 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.759
 a review please there are characters that 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:03.960
 they never appear like for example where 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.459
 is the mother of eren are you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.840
 talking but there are things that if 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.879
 respect as for example hospitals 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.280
 I liked the design I liked the 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.440
 effects are not the best wow 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 super hollywood but they are very good 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.129
 instead they respected the walls 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.590
 the walls are huge that 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.540
 they resisted so many years of the odyssey that 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.849
 I can not say anything was impeccable 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.730
 music and also the factions 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.290
 military with this I have no complaints and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.000
 good movie tickets early 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.610
 how it starts so here we take 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.680
 very good until good we see my house 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.579
 that nothing to see my house that we know 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.900
 this is much more submissive let's go to 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.940
 for the culture of Japan or what but 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.680
 they changed a lot to my house and I think that 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.569
 the fans of them were disappointed 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.010
 too much is very funny because in a 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.810
 moment during the entire invasion of 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.359
 titans we have a sex scene 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.829
 out of the place if you are what you want 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.269
 is practically violating an act for 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.269
 admit a child lying around 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.879
 but good just like really the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.280
 Japanese can be very crazy sometimes 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.260
 this scene had nothing to do with it 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.659
 that we were seeing throughout the movie 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.340
 the relationship between the in my house is very 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.480
 different to the anime the truth that's why 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.879
 I do not want to compare the directly 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.500
 I feel that they are two different things and 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.120
 well basically during the test who 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.040
 what he did in my house was to stay alive 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.409
 but with this guy that would be like 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.409
 fight the ticket to a but but good 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.269
 surely graced other things and 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.799
 better not to think about that something also that 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.450
 is out of the place are the scenes of 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.310
 one way, that is, I did not laugh in almost anything 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.799
 doing that at the time to do it 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.480
 but the only one that got me laughs was 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.340
 cannes because the actress is very good 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.139
 from all these factors that the truth 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.760
 They have a lot to improve but good to 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.829
 she behaved very well I do not have to 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.109
 change smile because he 's such an idiot that 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.450
 sometimes it was what the movie was saying 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.370
 the level of idiocy let's talk about the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.980
 clumsy that can become all the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.079
 soldiers is fine are novices have 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.730
 a lot to learn but if they tell you that 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.439
 the titans have a goodbye itself no 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.849
 we have to make noise because the 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.849
 they spend talking alone 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.129
 I go quiet free that also the geek 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.379
 although in this case at least they are 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.410
 Drawings are human but it will not be 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.180
 a little drawing so 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.620
 something I would have liked is to see some 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.480
 European actor some American actor 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.300
 because yes I want to do without as already 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.640
 you will know this basically Europe is the 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.120
 place by how are the physical aspects 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.410
 and everything so start so many Japanese 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.420
 they could have invested a little training 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.460
 a quick act to a star like brad 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.340
 pitt ask someone who is known 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.270
 but that is European American 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.860
 unfortunately we did not see out and the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.810
 for top film characters 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.490
 kinnock me without but we have to 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.770
 wait for the second part seems because 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.940
 I think it will appear there but good 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.400
 I'm saying a lot of negative things 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.650
 however the movie is entertaining 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.060
 It's bearable but I insist but the 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.800
 compare find in the manga because 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.390
 they made the van to take off at 20 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.950
 minutes was true is the following 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.730
 when the titans appear and we have 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.500
 action scenes 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.870
 everything is great there is blood 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.760
 censor nothing but so be it if there is no 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.800
 vital where you have to talk to the 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.620
 humans show emotions are made 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.540
 very boring and monotonous my advice 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.910
 would be if they have a winner for a movie 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.770
 hang out look at the plant something that 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.570
 be very good to come back again 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.139
 it's not good because they're going to lose 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.909
 weather 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.800
 so much more to say I do not have 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.050
 friends of singles negative points the 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.909
 positive points and the plot more or less 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.650
 you already know what you 're going for 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.060
 waiting for his opinion stability fight 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.039
 to see if they liked it if they did not like it 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.840
 comment all the comments below 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.729
 so a lot of disagreement this video 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.090
 See you in the next 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.090
 bye
