the health app and have health app seems
to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.979> getting<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.909> away<00:01:21.180> overall

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
to be getting a little bit away overall

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.880 
to be getting a little bit away overall
this<00:01:24.830> overall<00:01:25.830> updates<00:01:27.200> from<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.740> see

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
this overall updates from what I can see

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.460 
this overall updates from what I can see
it<00:01:29.189> has<00:01:29.430> some<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:30.570> should<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:31.049> able<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.259> monitor

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it has some it should be able to monitor

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
it has some it should be able to monitor
spirometry<00:01:32.310> data<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:32.939> which<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.390> has<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> do

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
spirometry data now which it has to do

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.890 
spirometry data now which it has to do
it<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.049> lung<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.180> your<00:01:36.180> lung<00:01:36.420> functions

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it your lung and your lung functions

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.789 
it your lung and your lung functions
basically<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.420> maybe<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.570> will<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.840> cool<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
basically so maybe that will be cool it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.789 
basically so maybe that will be cool it
also<00:01:41.009> has<00:01:41.369> SMS<00:01:41.939> relay<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.390> something<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.560> other

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
also has SMS relay or something so other

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
also has SMS relay or something so other
devices<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.700> access<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> mess<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
devices will be with access as a mess it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.170 
devices will be with access as a mess it
will<00:01:45.780> prompt<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.220> device<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.790> maybe

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
will prompt you on your device so maybe

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.300 
will prompt you on your device so maybe
if<00:01:48.360> your<00:01:48.479> macro<00:01:48.750> problem<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.290> access<00:01:49.710> SMS<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
if your macro problem and access SMS it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.230 
if your macro problem and access SMS it
you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.149> allow<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:52.350> allow<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.240> as

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you can allow that or not allow that as

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.870 
you can allow that or not allow that as
I<00:01:54.479> said<00:01:54.630> their<00:01:54.780> spotlight<00:01:54.990> speed<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.670> much

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
I said their spotlight speed is so much

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.810 
I said their spotlight speed is so much
quicker<00:01:57.079> which<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.469> very<00:01:58.619> impressive

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
quicker which is very very impressive

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.490 
quicker which is very very impressive
overall<00:01:59.820> probably<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> speed<00:02:00.960> improvements

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
overall probably the speed improvements

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.870 
overall probably the speed improvements
here<00:02:01.619> seems<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.490> little<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.509> improved

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
here seems to be a little bit improved

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.190 
here seems to be a little bit improved
which<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.149> definitely<00:02:06.299> something<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> do

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
which is definitely something that I do

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.609 
which is definitely something that I do
enjoy<00:02:07.350> very<00:02:07.979> fluid<00:02:08.399> experience

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
enjoy very fluid experience

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.460 
enjoy very fluid experience
same<00:02:09.950> thing<00:02:10.220> when<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:10.519> did<00:02:10.759> check<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.209> out<00:02:11.470> on
