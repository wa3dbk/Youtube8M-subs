story short I think it's gonna be about
better<00:02:30.840> thing<00:02:31.340> rather<00:02:32.340> than<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.609> worse<00:02:32.790> thing

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
better thing rather than a worse thing

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.539 
better thing rather than a worse thing
