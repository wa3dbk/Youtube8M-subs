00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.089
 Conductor of the academy I know there's 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.919
 certain standards and among those rules is 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.380
 that in every program there must be a 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.880
 student who leaves the kitsch academy 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.150
 la la so that's why I ask 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.679
 our jury what the alicia vÃ­ctor that 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.960
 get up from your seats so that you 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.580
 direct to the deliberation room for 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.770
 make the decision we have and the 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.020
 tonight students leave the 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.240
 Christian academy and I think that's not 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.260
 it will not be possible because we already 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.290
 we have deliberated 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.360
 so a decision was made and simply 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.450
 for us there is no expelled 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.170
 and since last week the teacher 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.960
 Quico decided that they were going to take the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.190
 attribution of ejecting someone good 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.470
 I want to ask the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.540
 production if you allow me in this 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.910
 occasion they are the ones who deliberate and 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.700
 decide if after this memorable 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.190
 night there is an expelled one would not have been 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.410
 this memorable night 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.730
 we have said it many times if not 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.600
 what happened in the past would have happened 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.520
 previous concert 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.400
 Kiko accept the challenge 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.230
 to choose together with your team one of 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.050
 them so that he leaves the academy 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.320
 criticism tonight if I do not have another 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.320
 remedy 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.950
 teacher please come on let's go 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.950
 deliberate 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.360
 so that it has to be greater than 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.360
 deliberation room for 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.540
 tonight is a unique night 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.900
 even though 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.350
 determined 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.070
 Hey, I'm the carrasquel kid that 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.960
 It's costing work in the fields 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.250
 you have to follow the rules also and it's 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.250
 that's why you need to have a student 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.250
 expelled 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.040
 and if what you have 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:19.680
 the rules and nobody even the to 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.000
 all students are also face 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 that they may not believe but good is 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.450
 this is the contest so are the rules 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.790
 of the game and the master of the field came out to 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.380
 say that students was sentenced well 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.280
 Well, well, we do not have more than 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.190
 wait 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.750
 tonight our jury according to 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.780
 the participation of our students 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.400
 They decided not to sentence anyone 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.470
 academy rules say that one 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.110
 has to leave therefore kiko fields 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.640
 and his team of teachers has already taken a 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.760
 I want to ask you please 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.800
 enter the forum to give me the envelope with 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.870
 the final decision of who of our 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.210
 students of the chifla academy 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.690
 night is dismissed in stationary 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.690
 Oh, my God, the time came that I did not 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.710
 it may be possible not to make the decision 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.570
 of the student who will be expelled now I 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.700
 I can follow what I want in that I was not going 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.130
 to be real but already see the suitcase and that 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.710
 It makes me think that yes, I do not and 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.230
 besides they are not only the five 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.840
 sentences and they are all students and 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.310
 now if there is no or there is no no no no 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.460
 We know who because, as they are all 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.890
 now there can not be with an option 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.140
 exact we usually see two three 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.300
 four but right now they are all 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.300
 students at risk 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.250
 and I say yes about nothing has already 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.970
 I 'm going 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.540
 this student is 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.230
 is already opening the envelope this face put 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.230
 surprise face 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.130
 this envelope is blank 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.080
 what do you mean we know the rules if 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.090
 we know the rules of the academy 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.760
 but also the rules the regulations 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.760
 they were made to be modified 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.370
 and after such a memorable night 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.370
 how is it 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.670
 all students with more guards 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.630
 moderated also by the others 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.660
 and we have these nights are repeated and not 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.200
 I can believe what emotion 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.800
 tonight this moment we are with her 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.800
 and we follow it 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.940
 the first street concert kit the 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.610
 that no student is expelled 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.150
 to his great 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.910
 slow to your great effort I 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.430
 because we closed this program with pure 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.970
 happy faces with tears but of 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.970
 emotion 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.160
 and hopefully there will be more of these nights
