and<00:00:08.450> what's<00:00:08.690> called<00:00:08.960> the<00:00:09.110> dripless<00:00:09.530> seal<00:00:09.830> I

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
and what's called the dripless seal I

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.060 
and what's called the dripless seal I
could

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
could

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.549 
could
you<00:00:13.130> have<00:00:13.370> to<00:00:13.840> lubricate<00:00:14.840> it<00:00:14.900> with<00:00:15.139> water

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
you have to lubricate it with water

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:16.870 
you have to lubricate it with water
which<00:00:15.860> means<00:00:16.070> you're<00:00:16.309> always<00:00:16.490> going<00:00:16.789> to<00:00:16.820> have

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
which means you're always going to have

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.150 
which means you're always going to have
water<00:00:17.210> dripping<00:00:17.570> in<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:17.840> boat<00:00:18.020> this<00:00:18.800> new

water dripping in the boat this new
shaft<00:00:19.849> seal<00:00:20.150> will<00:00:20.390> eliminate<00:00:20.660> any<00:00:21.110> water

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
shaft seal will eliminate any water

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.560 
shaft seal will eliminate any water
coming<00:00:21.529> in<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:21.919> boat<00:00:21.950> so<00:00:22.789> theoretically

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
coming in the boat so theoretically

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:34.030 
coming in the boat so theoretically
we'll<00:00:24.140> have<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.349> dry<00:00:24.619> bilge<00:00:32.530> coupling<00:00:33.530> bolts<00:00:33.890> on

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
we'll have a dry bilge coupling bolts on

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.340 
we'll have a dry bilge coupling bolts on
this<00:00:34.280> or<00:00:34.519> actually<00:00:34.879> Luke's<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:36.199> owner

this or actually Luke's and the owner

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.170 
this or actually Luke's and the owner
had<00:00:36.620> complained<00:00:37.100> about<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.400> vibration<00:00:37.640> issue

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
had complained about a vibration issue

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.920 
had complained about a vibration issue
this<00:00:39.080> could<00:00:39.290> very<00:00:39.530> well<00:00:39.620> be<00:00:39.800> part<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.370> it<00:00:40.930> if

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
this could very well be part of it if

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.750 
this could very well be part of it if
those<00:00:42.230> bolts<00:00:42.680> come<00:00:42.860> out<00:00:43.010> which<00:00:43.220> I<00:00:43.339> have<00:00:43.519> seen

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
those bolts come out which I have seen

and that propeller is going to hit the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.850 
and that propeller is going to hit the
rudder<00:00:48.320> when<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:49.280> does<00:00:49.460> going<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:49.760> damage<00:00:50.059> both

this sooner or later those bolts would

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.420 
this sooner or later those bolts would
have<00:00:54.020> fallen<00:00:54.199> out<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.710> needed<00:00:54.949> bit<00:00:55.129> dead<00:00:55.370> in

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
with a siphon break on it which just

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.710 
with a siphon break on it which just
sends<00:02:18.080> water<00:02:18.260> down<00:02:18.590> lubricate<00:02:19.220> system

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720

dripless<00:02:20.720> seal<00:02:21.700> seal<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.940> all<00:02:23.120> set

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.260 

take<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.870> clamps

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
take the clamps

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.130 
take the clamps
actually<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.020> very<00:02:30.290> easy<00:02:30.620> install<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.870> had

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
actually a very easy install if I had

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.200 
actually a very easy install if I had
done<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.410> install<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.220> would<00:02:34.880> have<00:02:34.970> plumbed

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
done this install I would have plumbed

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.330 
done this install I would have plumbed
water<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.960> old<00:02:36.110> shaft<00:02:36.470> seal<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:39.220> think<00:02:40.220> it

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
water to the old shaft seal I think it

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.280 
water to the old shaft seal I think it
just<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.850> works<00:02:41.270> better<00:02:41.480> because<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.870> packing

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
just it works better because of packing

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.260 
just it works better because of packing
and<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.560> was<00:02:42.740> pretty<00:02:43.010> done<00:02:43.250> dry<00:02:43.640> which<00:02:43.940> tells

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
and that was pretty done dry which tells

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.890 
and that was pretty done dry which tells
me<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:44.570> been<00:02:44.750> hot<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.880> that's<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.480> we'll<00:02:47.720> put

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
me it's been hot and that's it we'll put

00:02:47.900 --> 00:03:04.090 
me it's been hot and that's it we'll put
the<00:02:48.020> covers<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.740> new<00:02:51.920> space<00:02:52.370> seals<00:03:03.100> that's

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
the covers on the new space seals that's

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.570 
the covers on the new space seals that's
it

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.310 
it
rock<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.150> alignment<00:03:05.630> into<00:03:05.930> well<00:03:06.080> then<00:03:06.230> I

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
rock the alignment into well then I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.060 
rock the alignment into well then I
think<00:03:06.620> six<00:03:07.130> thousands<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.380> I'll<00:03:09.380> uncouple<00:03:09.980> at

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
think six thousands and I'll uncouple at

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.960 
think six thousands and I'll uncouple at
the<00:03:10.220> spring<00:03:11.020> when<00:03:12.020> she<00:03:12.170> shoots<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.530> water

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
the spring when she shoots the water

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.640 
the spring when she shoots the water
through<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.000> final<00:03:14.420> alignment<00:03:14.630> it'd<00:03:15.350> be<00:03:15.500> good

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
through the final alignment it'd be good

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.310 
through the final alignment it'd be good
to<00:03:15.770> go<00:03:15.980> fellas<00:03:16.610> out<00:03:16.790> being<00:03:17.380> scanned<00:03:18.380> in<00:03:19.040> tune

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
to go fellas out being scanned in tune

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.700 
to go fellas out being scanned in tune
eliminate<00:03:21.320> all<00:03:22.250> places<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:22.880> vibration<00:03:23.710> it'd

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
eliminate all places of vibration it'd

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.450 
eliminate all places of vibration it'd
be<00:03:24.800> good<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.040> go

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
be good to go

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.700 
be good to go

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
the thing about Yarmouth both are that
