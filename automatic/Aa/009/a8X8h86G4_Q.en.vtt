00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:10.050
 who is better or worse 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.000
 because party part so I wish that 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.950
 that day is well prepared above is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 well mentally to be able to win 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.859
 the party I think that mouth has many 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.039
 possibilities of being able to move to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.890
 next round I am very optimistic all 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.439
 case I think it will be very even but 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 that in the end the mouth will be able to pass the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.890
 next round 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.329
 waiting for the mouth to be at the level that 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:47.250
 is now good and knowing that of 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 that river pretty much lowered its level 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.710
 The shirt also weighs a little 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.790
 conviction that players have 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.020
 of mouth are not what I had before 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.210
 It improved a lot with the arrival of 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.100
 Basque so you have to keep going I know that 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.329
 I will continue like this and keep improving and good and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.300
 it's the only thing left for us to fight 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.850
 now today not everything to pointer 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.590
 I think I 've had very great 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.990
 performance now 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.210
 the last game out there that has 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.930
 lowered a little but but I already tell you the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.600
 Classics are different 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 they will surely give 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.320
 the best both physically and 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.290
 football one has to be 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.619
 100 to play this type of game for 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.210
 his people for his family for the 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.210
 t shirt for pride 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.649
 on Thursday he has a great river 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.000
 rival you have to beat him however 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.280
 I hope you can give him why 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.270
 because I need it because it comes 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.520
 proving that it is the best team 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.260
 I was looking for sure to wait for a 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.729
 little up rivals bases of space 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.160
 his games as they do everywhere that 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.420
 goes out to look for the game of entry and what 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.320
 the best that can happen to your mouth can 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.759
 wait a little and leave 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.160
 counterattack like he did on court 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.650
 river where beyond the field there 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.290
 It was in good condition because the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.380
 officials missing 15 15 minutes 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.150
 classic appear up because 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.480
 because you give yourself to the maximum and because 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.970
 the concentrations is at 100 so I 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.950
 it looks like it's going to be a test and before 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.230
 a couple phase is a boiler the court 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.690
 mouth 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.250
 and I think that's where they can feel that 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.569
 can give us a lot of strength 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.819
 then the river court is much more 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.860
 opened there and it always went well 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.909
 not really so let's hope that in 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.909
 This stage is going well too
