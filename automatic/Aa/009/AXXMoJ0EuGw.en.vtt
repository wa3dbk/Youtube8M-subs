00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
increases the amount of traffic they get

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.329 
increases the amount of traffic they get
methodically<00:00:53.469> this<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:54.679> how<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:54.859> went<00:00:55.190> online

methodically this is how you went online

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.119 
methodically this is how you went online
it's<00:00:55.879> really<00:00:56.269> that<00:00:56.420> simple<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:57.769> this<00:00:57.920> is

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
it's really that simple and so this is

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.090

you to just see is just how much i
tracked<00:01:25.610> what<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.000> did<00:01:26.300> because<00:01:26.480> you<00:01:27.050> have<00:01:27.290> to

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
tracked what I did because you have to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.780 
tracked what I did because you have to
see<00:01:27.620> what<00:01:27.770> works<00:01:27.980> so<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.190> can<00:01:28.370> know<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.580> go

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
see what works so you can know to go

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.240 
see what works so you can know to go
back<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.000> do<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.300> again<00:01:29.480> so<00:01:30.440> if<00:01:30.740> we<00:01:30.890> just<00:01:31.070> go

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
back and do it again so if we just go

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.060 
back and do it again so if we just go
through<00:01:31.550> here<00:01:31.700> you'll<00:01:31.880> see<00:01:31.940> that<00:01:33.070> traffic

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
through here you'll see that traffic

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.270 
through here you'll see that traffic
came<00:01:34.490> from<00:01:34.730> a<00:01:34.850> lot<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.240> different<00:01:35.690> places<00:01:36.280> some

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
came from a lot of different places some

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.370 
came from a lot of different places some
of<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.700> lot<00:01:37.940> of<00:01:38.120> traffic<00:01:38.330> some<00:01:38.750> of<00:01:38.870> it<00:01:38.990> not<00:01:39.140> so

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
of it a lot of traffic some of it not so

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.050 
of it a lot of traffic some of it not so
much<00:01:39.560> traffic<00:01:39.860> some<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.520> free<00:01:40.790> traffic

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
much traffic some of it free traffic

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.780 
much traffic some of it free traffic
some<00:01:41.480> of<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:41.720> paid<00:01:41.930> traffic<00:01:42.260> but<00:01:43.190> all<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.640> it

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
some of it paid traffic but all of it

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.590 
some of it paid traffic but all of it
tracked<00:01:44.650> this<00:01:45.650> is<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.950> key<00:01:46.730> component<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.450> your

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
tracked this is a key component to your

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
tracked this is a key component to your
success<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:50.390> question<00:01:50.930> is<00:01:51.050> how<00:01:51.440> do<00:01:51.500> i

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
success so the question is how do i

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.740 
success so the question is how do i
create<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:52.070> tracking<00:01:52.640> link<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.090> what<00:01:53.360> program

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
create a tracking link and what program

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.320 
create a tracking link and what program
do<00:01:53.900> i<00:01:53.990> use<00:01:54.230> well<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:55.400> one<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:55.640> use<00:01:55.940> this

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
do i use well this is the one I use this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.030 
do i use well this is the one I use this
is<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.570> one<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.720> started<00:01:57.140> with<00:01:57.290> that's<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.920> one

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
is the one I started with that's the one

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.470 
is the one I started with that's the one
I<00:01:58.070> recommend<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.760> mean<00:01:58.970> there's<00:01:59.150> tons<00:01:59.390> of

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
I recommend I mean there's tons of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.000 
I recommend I mean there's tons of
solutions<00:01:59.900> out<00:02:00.020> there<00:02:00.080> but<00:02:00.500> as<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.680> can<00:02:00.800> see

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
solutions out there but as you can see

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.680 
solutions out there but as you can see
that<00:02:01.040> this<00:02:01.850> one's<00:02:02.120> been<00:02:02.330> through<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.660> fire

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
that this one's been through the fire

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.770

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.910 

example<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:30.030> imagine<00:04:31.020> there<00:04:31.320> was<00:04:31.380> an<00:04:31.500> ad<00:04:31.650> there

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.490 
example so imagine there was an ad there
so<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.520> when<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.060> come<00:04:33.270> back<00:04:33.300> here<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.900> can<00:04:34.410> say

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
so that when I come back here I can say

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.620 
so that when I come back here I can say
oh<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.920> is<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.130> ad<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.370> placed<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.970> time<00:04:36.270> and

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
oh this is the ad I placed that time and

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.020 
oh this is the ad I placed that time and
I<00:04:37.170> could<00:04:37.350> say<00:04:37.530> well<00:04:37.710> maybe<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.340> used<00:04:38.610> very<00:04:38.940> a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
I could say well maybe I used very a

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.460 
I could say well maybe I used very a
little<00:04:39.540> bit<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.750> different<00:04:40.050> on<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.230> next

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
little bit of a different on the next

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.410 
little bit of a different on the next
time<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:40.800> could<00:04:40.950> see<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.220> difference<00:04:41.610> so

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
time and I could see the difference so

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.990 
time and I could see the difference so
it's<00:04:42.750> important<00:04:43.200> just<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.590> can<00:04:43.680> remember

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
it's important just so you can remember

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.610 
it's important just so you can remember
also<00:04:45.000> important<00:04:45.540> is<00:04:45.780> if<00:04:46.080> you're<00:04:46.260> doing

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
also important is if you're doing

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.470 
also important is if you're doing
marketing<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.490> it's<00:04:47.610> through<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:47.880> vendor<00:04:48.300> is

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
marketing and it's through a vendor is

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.230 
marketing and it's through a vendor is
to<00:04:48.990> know<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.290> contact<00:04:49.770> person's<00:04:50.220> name<00:04:50.460> what

address is and what their phone number

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.040 
address is and what their phone number
is<00:04:54.510> very<00:04:55.350> important<00:04:55.950> because<00:04:56.460> like<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:56.910> said

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
is very important because like I said

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.750 
is very important because like I said
when<00:04:58.050> you're<00:04:58.200> tracking<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.890> something<00:04:59.460> works

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.990 
when you're tracking and something works
