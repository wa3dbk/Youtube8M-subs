00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.650 
the sounds as well not really sure where
that<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.639> heard<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.880> gun<00:03:51.060> at<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.329> end<00:03:51.480> so

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
that is but I heard a gun at the end so

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.319 
that is but I heard a gun at the end so
that's<00:03:51.810> pretty<00:03:51.959> cool<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:53.069> then<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.489> once<00:03:54.209> you

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
that's pretty cool and then the once you

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.949 
that's pretty cool and then the once you
put<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.690> sleep<00:03:54.930> mode<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.209> system<00:03:57.690> locked

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
put in a sleep mode it's a system locked

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.839 
put in a sleep mode it's a system locked
so<00:03:58.500> that's<00:03:58.680> pretty<00:03:58.920> cool<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.489> have<00:03:59.609> that

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
so that's pretty cool to have that

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.319 
so that's pretty cool to have that
little<00:04:00.750> extra<00:04:00.959> feature<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.560> there<00:04:02.000> also<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
little extra feature on there also the

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.390 
little extra feature on there also the
background<00:04:03.690> does<00:04:03.930> change<00:04:04.230> color<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.769> didn't

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
background does change color I didn't

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.949 
background does change color I didn't
really<00:04:05.549> find<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.120> as<00:04:06.269> wasting<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.780> lot<00:04:06.900> of

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
really find it as wasting a lot of

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.500 
really find it as wasting a lot of
battery<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.500> me<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:08.760> others<00:04:09.180> may<00:04:09.329> have<00:04:09.480> a

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
battery to me but others may have a

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.180 
battery to me but others may have a
different<00:04:09.720> problem<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.620> didn't<00:04:10.829> really<00:04:10.950> waste

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
different problem it didn't really waste

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.650 
different problem it didn't really waste
too<00:04:11.340> much<00:04:11.430> my<00:04:11.669> battery<00:04:12.030> like<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.299> thought<00:04:12.510> it

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
too much my battery like I thought it

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.219 
too much my battery like I thought it
would<00:04:12.810> but<00:04:13.410> I'm<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.829> does<00:04:14.010> not<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:15.269> what<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.079> do
