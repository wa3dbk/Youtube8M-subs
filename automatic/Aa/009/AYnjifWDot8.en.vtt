our little demo here I actually warmed

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.390 
our little demo here I actually warmed
up<00:00:14.880> some<00:00:15.120> water<00:00:15.360> earlier<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.250> gonna

it is a powerful antioxidant what it

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.580 
it is a powerful antioxidant what it
means<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:35.730> protects<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.809> cells<00:00:37.170> in

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
means is that it protects the cells in

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.990 
means is that it protects the cells in
the<00:00:37.980> body<00:00:38.329> let's<00:00:39.329> say<00:00:40.100> here<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.430> an<00:00:41.579> apple

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the body let's say here I have an apple

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.630 
the body let's say here I have an apple
that<00:00:42.390> has<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.989> protection<00:00:43.440> which<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.280> skin

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that has a protection which is the skin

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
that has a protection which is the skin
if<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.450> were<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> cut<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> open<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.620> leave<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> up

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
if I were to cut it open and leave it up

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.439 
if I were to cut it open and leave it up
in<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> air<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.300> become<00:00:48.780> Brown<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:50.039> is

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
in the air it would become Brown that is

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.500 
in the air it would become Brown that is
oxidation<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.410> green<00:00:52.710> tea<00:00:52.969> protect<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.180> cell

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
oxidation so green tea protect the cell

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.529 
oxidation so green tea protect the cell
and<00:00:55.219> protect<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> skin<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> cell<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and protect the skin of the cell if you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.189 
and protect the skin of the cell if you
will<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> outer<00:00:58.469> layer<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.399> cell<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
will or the outer layer of the cell and

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.149 
will or the outer layer of the cell and
prevents<00:01:01.199> oxidized<00:01:02.570> oxidation<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.559> sale

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
prevents oxidized oxidation of the sale

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.899 
prevents oxidized oxidation of the sale
so<00:01:06.409> antioxidant<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.680> helps<00:01:08.369> boost<00:01:08.670> your

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
immune system which is obviously fight

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.140 
immune system which is obviously fight
disease<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.680> also<00:01:13.920> helps<00:01:14.520> boost<00:01:14.850> your
