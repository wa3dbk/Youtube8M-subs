00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
wasn't really a confessional it was just

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.429 
wasn't really a confessional it was just
me<00:01:58.700> screwing<00:01:59.360> around<00:01:59.570> that<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.080> didn't<00:02:00.350> really

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
me screwing around that I didn't really

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.219 
me screwing around that I didn't really
know<00:02:00.560> what<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.009> was<00:02:01.159> doing<00:02:01.490> easier<00:02:01.820> but<00:02:02.780> as<00:02:03.020> you

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
know what I was doing easier but as you

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.690 
know what I was doing easier but as you
can<00:02:03.290> see<00:02:03.350> how<00:02:03.649> I<00:02:03.680> build<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.189> portal<00:02:04.520> gun<00:02:04.549> I

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
can see how I build the portal gun I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.210 
can see how I build the portal gun I
haven't<00:02:05.000> pictured<00:02:05.360> down<00:02:05.570> below<00:02:05.869> again<00:02:06.220> so

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
haven't pictured down below again so

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.160 
haven't pictured down below again so
it's<00:02:07.820> really<00:02:07.970> convenient<00:02:08.420> really<00:02:08.899> have<00:02:09.019> to

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
it's really convenient really have to

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.160 
it's really convenient really have to
explain<00:02:09.410> how<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.679> build<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:12.670> again

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
explain how to build it so again

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.290 
explain how to build it so again
shooting<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.709> gun<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.640> have<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.030> switch

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
shooting the gun you have to switch

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.420 
shooting the gun you have to switch
between<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.349> orange<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:18.890> blue<00:02:19.040> which<00:02:19.280> is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
between the orange and blue which is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400 
between the orange and blue which is
annoying<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.060> have<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.420> right-click<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.319> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
annoying you have to right-click but the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.650 
annoying you have to right-click but the
switch<00:02:21.709> between<00:02:22.130> them<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.970> gotta<00:02:23.150> push<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
switch between them you gotta push the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.170 
switch between them you gotta push the
Jeep<00:02:23.989> up<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.560> then<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.430> get<00:02:25.580> rid<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.790> them<00:02:25.970> how

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
Jeep up and then to get rid of them how

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.210 
Jeep up and then to get rid of them how
you<00:02:26.239> saw<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.780> pushed<00:02:27.110> our<00:02:27.350> bun<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:27.950> walk<00:02:28.190> through

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
you saw I pushed our bun or walk through

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.729 
you saw I pushed our bun or walk through
one<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.760> doors<00:02:28.790> with<00:02:29.410> whatever<00:02:30.410> that

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
one of the doors with whatever that

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.460 
one of the doors with whatever that
thing<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.150> actually<00:02:32.330> make<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:33.019> but

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
thing is you can actually make that but

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.720 
thing is you can actually make that but
I<00:02:33.500> don't<00:02:33.799> think<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.100> get<00:02:34.280> rid<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.519> it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
I don't think you can get rid of it

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.820 
I don't think you can get rid of it
because<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.330> made<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.230> could<00:02:36.440> get<00:02:36.650> rid<00:02:36.799> of

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
because I made it and I could get rid of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.130 
because I made it and I could get rid of
it<00:02:38.080> but<00:02:39.280> again<00:02:40.280> how<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:41.180> guy<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.750> it's<00:02:41.930> so

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
it but again how this guy and it's so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.809 
it but again how this guy and it's so
much<00:02:42.319> more<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.739> thought<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.069> was<00:02:43.160> just<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.580> gun

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
much more I thought it was just the gun

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.370 
much more I thought it was just the gun
but<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.569> wasn't<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:46.040> got<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.519> texture<00:02:46.880> pack

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
but it wasn't so I got the texture pack

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.729 
but it wasn't so I got the texture pack
for<00:02:48.380> portal<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:49.940> game<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:51.560> looks

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
for portal for this game and it looks

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.300 
for portal for this game and it looks
everything<00:02:52.310> works<00:02:53.269> out<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.660> looks<00:02:53.810> good<00:02:54.310> but

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
everything works out it looks good but

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.270 
everything works out it looks good but
there<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.640> like<00:02:56.380> some<00:02:57.380> stuff<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.980> doesn't

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
there is like some stuff that doesn't

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.580 
there is like some stuff that doesn't
like<00:02:59.030> they<00:02:59.209> didn't<00:02:59.480> change<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.959> kept<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:00.470> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
like they didn't change it kept it the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.039 
like they didn't change it kept it the
same<00:03:00.859> but<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:02.150> wouldn't<00:03:02.420> see<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.540> stuff<00:03:02.900> in

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
same but you wouldn't see that stuff in

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.360 
same but you wouldn't see that stuff in
portal<00:03:03.470> anyway<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.190> makes<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.790> lot<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:04.940> sense

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
portal anyway so makes a lot of sense

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.800 
portal anyway so makes a lot of sense
anyway<00:03:07.370> as<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.910> can<00:03:07.970> see<00:03:08.239> how<00:03:08.450> I'm<00:03:08.570> just

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
anyway as you can see how I'm just

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.710 
anyway as you can see how I'm just
building<00:03:09.140> random<00:03:09.739> stuff<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.910> stuff<00:03:11.239> is<00:03:11.660> the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
building random stuff this stuff is the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.449 
building random stuff this stuff is the
stuff<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.140> I'm<00:03:12.440> pretty<00:03:12.709> much<00:03:12.799> shifty<00:03:13.280> used

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459
