00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.269
 here it is scott file by michael matthews 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.099
 the Australian of the greenedge auriga that 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.860
 runs with the bicycle model 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.830
 preferred by team riders 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.650
 in fact only one Australian runs 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.430
 with the a that is a bicycle a little more 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.390
 comfortable and less fast than the crazy 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.309
 du race c 50 wheels are high profile 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.439
 naturally in carbon for tubular 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:35.050
 we will be all the team riders 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.270
 Australian use this set 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.650
 also this of course 17 of wheel 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.370
 which is characterized by the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.560
 minimum aerodynamic resistance la 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.610
 maximum smoothness, even very rigid 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.980
 as evidenced by the size of the third 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.450
 very particular is the tubular in 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.300
 used by the energy charge 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.640
 produced by the continental a un 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.810
 very special tread that in 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.820
 slick part 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.980
 in the central part that is the one 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.900
 delegated to the smoothness and partly to 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.820
 knurled in the two side bands e 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.950
 are those that go to join the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.840
 soil when the bicycle turns into a 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.700
 supply the saddles with the auriga clean edge 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.960
 prologue with this in particular is the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.119
 model 0 2 with cpc technology that stands 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.220
 for connect power check is one 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.140
 particular finish of the part 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.540
 surface of the saddle than in place 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.660
 of the classic classic coating 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:35.030
 to this particular finish with 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.430
 a kind of scale they are going to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.500
 contact with the shorts of the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.410
 runner who allow to increase the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.040
 comfort and the perceived reaction under the 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.420
 saddle 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.080
 moving instead to the front 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.740
 of the bicycle we can see i 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.870
 group remote control commands 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.690
 electronic shimano two ace of hai tu 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.520
 not just those positioned in 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.350
 correspondence of the gearshift levers but 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.170
 even those placed inside the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.240
 handlebar in the lower part and are in 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.130
 particular the commands preferred by 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.380
 sprinters that in this way cannot 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.890
 operate shifting even when they are 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.890
 in low grip
