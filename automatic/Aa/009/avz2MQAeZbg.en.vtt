00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
strong and how you'd be testing it yeah

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.440 
strong and how you'd be testing it yeah
I<00:00:07.080> think<00:00:07.230> it's<00:00:07.589> pretty<00:00:07.740> strong<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:09.000> want<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.269> we

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
I think it's pretty strong we want to we

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.440 
I think it's pretty strong we want to we
want<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:10.019> know<00:00:10.340> it's<00:00:11.340> difficult<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:12.269> to

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
want to you know it's difficult to do to

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.900 
want to you know it's difficult to do to
go<00:00:12.599> out<00:00:12.660> buy<00:00:12.960> product<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.530> just<00:00:13.559> hear<00:00:14.549> someone

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
go out buy product and just hear someone

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.840 
go out buy product and just hear someone
tell<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.630> how<00:00:15.750> strong<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:17.490> figured

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
tell you how strong it is and we figured

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.790 
tell you how strong it is and we figured
that<00:00:17.880> instead<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.020> telling<00:00:19.260> people

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
that instead of just telling people

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.700 
that instead of just telling people
let's<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.160> show<00:00:20.730> them<00:00:20.939> how<00:00:21.060> strong<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.449> is

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
let's just show them how strong it is

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.650 
let's just show them how strong it is
now<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.010> strength<00:00:23.250> test<00:00:23.550> personally<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.600> think

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
now the strength test personally I think

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.890 
now the strength test personally I think
Robbie<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.289> insane

Andrew I better investigate this zooming

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.600 
Andrew I better investigate this zooming
the<00:01:46.140> first<00:01:46.470> corners<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.040> make<00:01:47.220> sure<00:01:47.430> there's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
