I<00:00:28.429> wasn't<00:00:29.029> a<00:00:29.090> huge<00:00:29.179> fan<00:00:29.269> of<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.539> first<00:00:29.689> film<00:00:29.929> I

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
I wasn't a huge fan of the first film I

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.410 
I wasn't a huge fan of the first film I
thought<00:00:30.439> it<00:00:31.250> didn't<00:00:31.460> go<00:00:31.519> far<00:00:31.759> enough<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:32.210> make

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
thought it didn't go far enough to make

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.910 
thought it didn't go far enough to make
murder<00:00:32.630> funny<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:33.020> think<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:33.320> have<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.890> be

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
murder funny I think you have to be

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.830 
murder funny I think you have to be
really<00:00:34.340> really<00:00:34.430> dark<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:35.300> make<00:00:35.420> murder<00:00:35.600> funny

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
really really dark to make murder funny

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.380 
really really dark to make murder funny
like<00:00:36.020> very<00:00:36.260> bad<00:00:36.470> start<00:00:37.100> it<00:00:37.850> didn't<00:00:38.090> go<00:00:38.180> far

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
like very bad start it didn't go far

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.610 
like very bad start it didn't go far
enough<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.810> they<00:00:38.930> were<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.260> was<00:00:39.380> sort<00:00:39.500> of

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
enough and they were so it was sort of

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.800 
enough and they were so it was sort of
passable<00:00:40.310> comedy<00:00:40.670> for<00:00:40.820> me<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.480> trailer<00:00:41.780> I

one<00:01:01.760> of<00:01:01.790> those<00:01:01.940> rare<00:01:02.240> cases<00:01:02.750> for<00:01:03.320> me<00:01:03.440> where<00:01:03.620> I

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
one of those rare cases for me where I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.400 
one of those rare cases for me where I
like<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.489> thought<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.120> last<00:01:05.300> movie<00:01:05.900> was<00:01:06.020> only

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
like you thought the last movie was only

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.170 
like you thought the last movie was only
ok<00:01:06.740> didn't<00:01:07.190> really<00:01:07.370> care<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:07.580> much<00:01:07.790> for<00:01:07.970> it

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
ok didn't really care that much for it

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.460 
ok didn't really care that much for it
wasn't<00:01:08.420> as<00:01:08.510> funny<00:01:08.690> as<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:08.900> thought<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.350> was

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
wasn't as funny as I thought it was

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.080 
wasn't as funny as I thought it was
gonna<00:01:09.650> be<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.070> other<00:01:10.160> people<00:01:10.430> I'd<00:01:10.550> told<00:01:10.820> me

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
gonna be and other people I'd told me

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.660 
gonna be and other people I'd told me
but<00:01:11.570> for<00:01:11.690> some<00:01:11.930> reason<00:01:12.410> I'm<00:01:12.920> really<00:01:13.370> looking

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
but for some reason I'm really looking

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.430 
but for some reason I'm really looking

really<00:01:38.090> great<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.570> that<00:01:38.900> was<00:01:39.080> what<00:01:39.260> I<00:01:39.290> think

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
really great and that was what I think

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.960 
really great and that was what I think

jennifer<00:01:45.080> aniston<00:01:45.440> scene<00:01:45.620> i<00:01:45.740> think<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
jennifer aniston scene i think is the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.710 
jennifer aniston scene i think is the
same<00:01:46.250> world<00:01:46.430> talking<00:01:46.610> yeah<00:01:46.760> we<00:01:47.210> can<00:01:47.510> get<00:01:47.600> away

with her but um she's gonna have the
same<00:01:49.460> stick<00:01:49.760> I<00:01:50.000> think<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.540> lot<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:50.960> gonna

hundred<00:02:36.569> percent<00:02:36.750> right<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.319> might<00:02:37.470> not

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
hundred percent right that it might not

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.800 
hundred percent right that it might not
work<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:38.069> what<00:02:38.400> if<00:02:38.489> he's<00:02:38.700> able<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:39.030> knock<00:02:39.599> out

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
