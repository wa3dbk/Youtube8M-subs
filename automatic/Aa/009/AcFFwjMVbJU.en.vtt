font the code text that would display
would<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.340> name<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:23.940> code<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.510> my

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.530 

then<00:01:30.620> finally<00:01:31.070> we<00:01:31.160> can<00:01:31.310> control<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:31.940> tooltip

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
then finally we can control the tooltip

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.080 
then finally we can control the tooltip
that<00:01:33.230> is<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.560> little<00:01:33.770> pop-up<00:01:34.220> window<00:01:34.940> when

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
that is the little pop-up window when

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.730 
that is the little pop-up window when
you<00:01:35.180> hover<00:01:35.390> over<00:01:35.540> a<00:01:35.840> button<00:01:36.110> after<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> few

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
you hover over a button after a few

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.070 
you hover over a button after a few
seconds<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:38.210> can<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:38.720> use<00:01:38.930> the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
seconds you can have it use the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.990 
seconds you can have it use the
procedures<00:01:39.560> description<00:01:40.220> or<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.520> can<00:01:40.790> type

adding<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> new<00:01:47.850> code<00:01:48.120> works<00:01:48.510> identically<00:01:49.080> to

adding a new code works identically to

adding a new code works identically to
editing<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.400> code<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.090> won't<00:01:51.300> go<00:01:51.600> over<00:01:51.630> that

editing a code so I won't go over that
necessarily<00:01:52.590> again<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.070> deleting<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.120> code<00:01:54.390> if
