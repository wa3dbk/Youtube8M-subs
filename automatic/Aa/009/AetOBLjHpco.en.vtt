00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 we was hirschberg today and the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.030
 is the autumn test we fish today 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.769
 the next and the head in there 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.220
 now travel year-old carp menu cards 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.380
 and some smaller ones at fishing or 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 s14 schmidt lonely is surprised 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.609
 what is inside and we fish with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 our crane truck today that's it 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.730
 that makes you one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.560
 We have to make work easier 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.660
 us something comes out is nature conservation 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.670
 there is extensive occupancy and it is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.969
 just the goal to get the dough 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.450
 and the birdlife or whichever 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:57.539
 the waterbirds but get along 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:01:00.059
 could have survived all two 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.370
 years, the dough is fished around a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.439
 to clear the course like the fish 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.780
 have grown or how many 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.820
 fish are still there and the goal 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 it is actually for nature conservation here 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.060
 the farming in extensively too 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 earn 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.580
 So we try animal welfare 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.950
 It is at larger ponds to fish 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.439
 very difficult to get this one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 small white fish or the industry too 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.990
 that brings all alive out because of that 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.970
 mass comes out and then again 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 a short two days 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.750
 stand and we will be the little fish 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.040
 recover and then we will 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.729
 the small fish separate number 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.310
 get out and then down to the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.290
 container over oxygen on it and the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.740
 fish over linden so that's not 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.970
 problem 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.970
 since use 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.980
 That's about 800 g 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.319
 and I suspect that but the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.709
 cormorant has already brought out a lot 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:29.260
 we'll see what else is in it 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.269
 dough about twelve hectares and from the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
 Size is known so much more 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.060
 insert fish 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.739
 The fish will be with us now 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.810
 then sorted fish house and 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.700
 then went to share the fishing clubs 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.080
 continue or is accordingly for as 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.410
 used fresh in the battle 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.590
 Direct marketing on concerns the shows 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.330
 then we move about ca week then 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.310
 the water outside has huge 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.840
 role or about the week 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.840
 that accomplish that of pulling the cas 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.710
 We will definitely be there in the spring 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.850
 in front of the amount of co2 have very little 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.730
 and it is very much the clientele 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.160
 hold almost have to the mass of the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.440
 fisherman is missing 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.480
 a lot of fish are inside 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.420
 surprisingly well grown so that 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.100
 sometimes up to 675 actually 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.960
 not as the goal but it was then 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.970
 he more fishing for than fishing where for 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.400
 about one to be brought to where it is 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.430
 of course, the entire fishing train has made it difficult 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.830
 were just these huge amounts of bars 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.710
 or knows fischer and karl bosch was the 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.690
 lattice constipation would not do that 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.370
 The fish will be available 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.200
 but they work much better 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.640
 we broke the fish well 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.890
 supplied together to an oxygen 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.270
 and with the entire fishing train already 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.270
 I am not content to complain 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.870
 in the canal if now to the fish 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.570
 sorted and in different sizes and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.670
 backwards are getting smaller and we 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:34.610
 put forward over the container the 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:36.230
 fish another setting we are like this 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.780
 the big cards could stay 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.400
 the frogs or the white sent 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.350
 ever further behind not swim 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.070
 right mood further back and it 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.570
 Just let us sort it out 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.190
 then only need the cards the 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.190
 biggest clean trains 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.770
 missing to tinker a fresh water 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.840
 and the fish always try that 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.310
 fresh water to go and that is 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.310
 Always visit the small tables 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.310
 to come back to the fresh water
