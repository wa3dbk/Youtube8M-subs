 The Super Mario has been around for over 26 years 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.920
 Since then, dozens of games have appeared with the Italian plumber in the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.909
 lead 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.449
 With Marios, people have grown up all over the world 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.039
 like here in Göttingen 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.970
 Here lives the media scientist and author Matthias Märtens 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.289
 his research fields also include video games super mario has him though 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.950
 He accompanied him long before his academic career 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.320
 really 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.660
 Marijo has Mertens ever lured the first on the digital playground 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.160
 Schuon the first appearance of the Italian plumber in the Parka 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.580
 Classic Donkey Kong inspired him 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.569
 come installed 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.030
 the first game 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.910
 Possibilities shown 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.570
 that the medium is with the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.770
 to deal intensively 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.660
 whether it was hardly sports he was pastime 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.250
 Donkey Kong Build something that makes me what the present 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.780
 Marino has changed a lot in 26 years thanks to the rapidly increasing 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.240
 Processing power of the game consoles 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.420
 in Donkey Kong the first commercially successful day just a game this the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.310
 Main character still remain anonymous Menden but the cornerstone of himself 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.330
 Over and over repetitive patterns he must keep a woman out of the claws 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
 rescue a wicked kidnapper 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.159
 the next milestone was Super Mario Brothers 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.630
 four years after Don came to Rio had his name and with brother Luigi 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.240
 but the brothers were only gaining strength, though 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.090
 Multiplayer mode together 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.350
 with Super Mario Brothers 3 perfected in the tender that John 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.770
 By the way, Dowland Warendorf is because Martino Blocher's year is Carinthia 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 her world full of green final exam percent 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.040
 at the latest with Super Mario Woldt the figure reached a level of detail the 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.940
 brought her to life and lost her emotions for Marijo Vadis the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.940
 Key to success and Emma Guntz's most successful film or 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.809
 Computer games 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.769
 cleverly 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.889
 the pond until 17 o'clock also brought the German-American children 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.829
 We know more about Super Marios than Mickey Mouse 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.639
 That's why there are millions of games missing 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.419
 Also a lot of Mario's collector Brad Martin recently from the US Games 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.629
 Transmitter as Forty was presented is certainly the king among them 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.549
 Brad collected thousands of Prishtina ears among other Marius cases articles 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.569
 read my game 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.129
 this thing here is my favorite marino 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.480
 this is an advertising figure from the Tokyo Game Show the remaining $ 700 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.639
 tasted 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.950
 in Super Mario 64 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.010
 Finally, the Kemptner dared to take the plunge into the third dimension 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.439
 a small joystick on the controller easy to control 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.439
 what a super runs her 60 um 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:11.099
 This principle of the 3D environment has continued ever since until today 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.889
 to 6 and sorry 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.569
 that is the surface in which I am in the computer environment generally 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.839
 move 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.630
 his team rather disappointed Marijo Games 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.470
 Nintendo had just raised the bar very high on the current game 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.860
 Super Mario Galaxy ties them back a little to the spirit of 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.310
 Classics and Matthias Märtens predict a long future for Super Mario 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.579
 because the figure is Nintendo's umbilical cord to the buyer 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.110
 they do not necessarily have to 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.420
 again and again that computer games reinvent shame to convince you 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.029
 that he later on 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:47.559
 We know each other and we like each other and we do something together again 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:48.659
 together 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.039
 that's what Pommer stands for 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:56.489
 As long as Nintendo is concerned, Orio still has 5 6 3 lives in store 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:56.849
 to have
