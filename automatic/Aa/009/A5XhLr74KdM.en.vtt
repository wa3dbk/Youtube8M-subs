00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 totally good when I'm going to show 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:11.130
 How to solder in my welding machine 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.210
 hi what a salary 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.680
 my frames 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.680
 as in the previous scheme 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.770
 in any case my son's toy 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.500
 be here this little machine and now I have 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.059
 an approximate of four more months or 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.079
 least has not changed neither the water nor 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.440
 with viola the salt is this way they will be able 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.920
 fix also still 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.879
 comes 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.760
 it has some salt stuck in there but 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.760
 loose still not good 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:01:01.210
 this is what is the mass the earth 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:05.510
 no chufa direct to the box of the earth 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.410
 this is said to travel 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:14.690
 going through it and get here to the 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:20.080
 close and the phase is going to be here 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.690
 it almost connects to the phase and it comes and it 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.740
 is all this has to be stable 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.740
 this is regulated here 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.460
 it is regulated the closer 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.450
 it's more amperage is stronger the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.000
 welding and then this one here comes to 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.480
 electrode 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.510
 this is the electrode 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.390
 I even have more electrode as you can 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.840
 observe miren 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.630
 do not 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.009
 It is always advisable to use with your 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.549
 gloves before for protection and 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.700
 when it's already plugged in, it grabs and 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.920
 begins to weld not obviously that 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.500
 you are going to have to make contact 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.540
 with this iron 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:17.430
 so that it is earth and everything goes 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.430
 and began my career 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.080
 with a box more than everything is improvising 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.530
 look 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.130
 well I'm going to try it so you can see 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.130
 what are they? 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.880
 as you can see they will be laughing 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.720
 right now but that covers you 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.560
 of everything that is the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:56.020
 the rays to the forest know that it 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.020
 love and if it does not protect you with the mask 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.900
 You're going to have very serious problems 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.409
 time to sleep 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:10.379
 it has happened to me good I can not prove it 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:14.099
 because midday and they are with the 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.849
 computer whenever loose must 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.400
 from unplugging everything that is 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.740
 appliances and most of all have 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.280
 what 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.830
 do it as an adult 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.240
 and an adult is supervising them 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.240
 they will take everything is handmade 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.690
 no no 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.220
 all these artisans 10 liters of water 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.330
 with 250 grams of salt 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.960
 wooden platforms wire number 16 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.010
 Of electricity 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.260
 that supports and right now and surely 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.930
 You need to change water and after 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.840
 empty I'll give it back to goya 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.370
 when you need again soldier like 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.210
 they will realize is that I talked a little 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.640
 thick 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.220
 me 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.800
 thick cable because if it's very cable 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:16.840
 delgadito opens like this 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:20.199
 like a horn with a canchita 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.430
 Well I hope it has served you up 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.430
 then 20
