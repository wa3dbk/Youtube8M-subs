00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello people today I show you as you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.000
 you build a mine and that here 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.889
 is my expression 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 You should always go up three blocks 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.380
 leave blank and then make stop 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.980
 do not place yourself so 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.480
 Although encounters heads could do but 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.480
 Well , it's not that nice 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.090
 then you should if you only times 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.109
 on level 15 you can see here 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.090
 should you first have a room 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.670
 create where you have a bed and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.960
 workbench then you should have 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 make Christians here with cable-stone 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.210
 because you will be a lot 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.070
 get pickaxe store okay coal 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.379
 then here gems or melted 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 is as well as iron or something or gold 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 stop and veterinarians if you always 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.110
 has not yet been processed then just a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 bed fasnacht is just around the corner again 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.239
 then you want to go upstairs 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.940
 be sure to accept a checklist here 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.580
 because often something is forgotten 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.820
 First of all you do it right 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.060
 by putting in different gear 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.220
 and that's called string mining 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 I think and definitely 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.490
 We'll just start and then leave 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.900
 you then as far as you can go 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 if in one direction I have now 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.240
 once found nothing that you can see yes and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.040
 Now sometimes the other direction 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.770
 also not okay then you go so pay 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.000
 at least three blocks far away here 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130
 is currently a torch so that is 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.270
 only 4 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 because most doctors are such a diamond 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.979
 two fat and that's why you see the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 then here by now and if it is now 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.570
 here in the middle 1 would then have to 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.880
 I also think I would be one 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.350
 then stop to see 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.579
 only if one is in the middle now 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.710
 I would not see why 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:03.840
 Well so let 32 again and free 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.340
 so on and on, I believe that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.929
 I could still do that I could 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.519
 and you can do that on the 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.500
 make opposite side and here 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.360
 is just hollow when you fill in 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.040
 you can meet the idea always good 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.349
 explore because there you will often find 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.060
 things because there are already many 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.709
 uncovered so do not get upset if 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.769
 he does not always hold diamonds directly 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.209
 finds or something easy 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.420
 carry on diamonds are holding 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.040
 You should use your raw materials 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.090
 maybe take a shovel 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.920
 but you can also do that by hand 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.250
 as many times you will not you he 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.250
 Find 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.690
 Red storm is also due to rare raw materials 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.690
 and since the last extension can 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.940
 you too if you have redstone diamonds 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.709
 coal and iron I think makes me break 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.209
 Experience points receive these are the 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.400
 always good if you want to do something magic 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.400
 or something else 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.620
 and well, there are not any more here 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.560
 just always in one direction mine there 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.030
 you usually find something like me 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.069
 Do not really go to system now 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.040
 for dan knows it is a pure 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.540
 glÃ¼ckssache 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.000
 so you see how long is the bow 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.639
 Actually , I can do that now 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.769
 do the following so it's punk 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.340
 I did not know borner yet but 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.769
 then you see diamonds then 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.380
 there again diamonds down there 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.980
 Actually, the soil is very rich 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.120
 diamonds and other but unfortunately have 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.720
 i just got a bad job here 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.239
 would be coal now and someday 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.340
 I'll just stop there or maybe 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.780
 not give but you can hear where the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.889
 monsters are there you can go then 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.680
 you want or should something like that 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.239
 probably find well the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.040
 most important are just diamonds first 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.150
 there would probably see some 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.150
 if I think about it 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.900
 and otherwise just keep going in 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.579
 one direction may be several 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.900
 Gears as I invest here and yes then 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.510
 I'll show you that with my own 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:22.960
 tnt totally pointless because you have more 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:26.139
 loses as a winner and now you see 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.199
 first of all what you get everything you can get 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:33.310
 get from this big room here 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:37.990
 I would get very little now 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.770
 say it's worth it more 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.180
 you can do that by hand 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.310
 Whenever you're done here 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.979
 sort or in your central warehouse or 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.180
 You can bring other things for that 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.280
 you also have a box here somewhere 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.660
 create is not so important now 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.130
 you can just throw away 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.180
 if you do not need the fight 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.710
 Of course always enough 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.490
 picking up that is very very much 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.470
 Important torches also and stop 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.419
 maybe you still have to turn 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.539
 something shoots and puts it 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.889
 of course never wrong ok i would 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.409
 say that was it, too 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.389
 Of course that does not forget it 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.030
 The water bucket is only allowed to 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.139
 to burn at the beginning 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:26.159
 if you lava comes to meet or 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.159
 other and see you next time
