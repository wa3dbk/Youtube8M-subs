00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.040
 welcome people eclipse good for today 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.170
 in this video I'm going to show you what 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.869
 is the realization of how to connect your 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.400
 nintendo wii to a good screen in 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.379
 TV screen or any other 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.150
 device that can show us the signal 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.250
 we need three things obviously the 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.170
 screen or television what they can 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.660
 occupy to be able to play your nintendo wii 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.130
 lopez connection to electricity that in 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.289
 this case I am going to occupy a small 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.210
 lane that I have here positioned and the 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.470
 nintendo wii in a few moments we are going to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 all the cables that are installed for 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.360
 to be able to make this connection that is 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.670
 successes 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.320
 Well once we have what 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.700
 is the nintendo wii as you see here I already 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.710
 I have honey are my consoles once 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.410
 that we have this here put today 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.810
 we are three things what are your bar 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.330
 of your sensor bar which is this in my 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.850
 young case here I have with this entry 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.820
 which goes to the back or back of 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.100
 the nintendo you then that performs the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.660
 connection by simply putting this cable 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.560
 here 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.300
 in good position I would not know how to explain it 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.070
 it is very well the position this part 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.040
 that is Czech that has a small 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.660
 inclination goes up is that 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.300
 corner can come for the part 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.160
 top of the flashlight as you see there 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.250
 I'm left with this the sensor bar and 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.400
 is connected to the nintendo and it could be 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 appear the wiimote cursor in 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.080
 any part of the TV's is 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.060
 thing can go on what is the truth 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.729
 No surprise of water or where you can 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.729
 where you should position yourself for a 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.340
 best willbold signal 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.369
 the second thing is to have our cables rca 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.760
 RCA cable All cables come by 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.790
 defect with the purchase of the wii 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.400
 the rca cable connects equally in the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.420
 back of the nintendo like here 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 can be seen in this area just as 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.970
 same way here this cable has a 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.140
 small part inclined here can not be 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.510
 prison is not reached since the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.080
 background is black and this part inclined 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.640
 it must go the same for the top 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.010
 once after this because 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.200
 simply connect the people the 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.640
 water cables 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.080
 subsequently the connected ones 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.690
 we will connect to the light and the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.960
 television so you can appreciate the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.990
 image of the nintendo the third cable that 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.850
 need is the power cord 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.860
 this cable is a is like all 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.870
 they carry a small inclination in this 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.380
 part but this is this inclination that 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.060
 go here 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.880
 and here is a little bit clearer to appreciate 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.150
 It has a small 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.670
 that part should go towards the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.260
 upper right 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.660
 as you see it should look towards this side 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.040
 that way the water would be ready once 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.280
 connected as right now we do not have 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.260
 nothing else connected this I'm going to 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.350
 proceed to connect the television and 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.350
 connect the wii to what is the television 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.020
 ok the television connected and in the light what 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.319
 which is the next the next step 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.200
 it must be connect the wii by the cable 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.120
 what is the monitor or the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.610
 TV in this case these cables 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.610
 they have three colors specifically the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.160
 by default they bring two inputs 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.550
 for these types of red yellow cables 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.530
 and white normally if it's a TV 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.510
 very old only has a title of 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.130
 entry that normally comes in the 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.250
 side of the screen like here is 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.840
 shows yellow white and red by the 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.959
 back if it is already very new 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.510
 remember, you will have cables and inputs 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.940
 excessively has many many many 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.250
 posts that are for high definition if 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.570
 you do not want to complicate the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.660
 old do not worry anyway 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.310
 these three entries are going to be in the 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.019
 TV but if it is very new 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.810
 in this concentrate find the one that is 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.489
 yellow white and red once 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.019
 connected these three cables and right now 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.019
 I will proceed to connect them 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.530
 make sure they are well connected 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.420
 and that they do not get out the first time once 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.159
 done that we agreed we have the TV 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.530
 connected to the water and connected to the TV 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.430
 and we will proceed to connect the wii to the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.609
 current of light 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.430
 taking the good wii the cable that goes to the 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.990
 hot regulator is granted 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.990
 electricity by one lane 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.710
 a moment that I had a little problem 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.320
 with this 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.740
 now they did all the steps well 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.110
 the wii must detach a small 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.590
 reddish color in this young button here already 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.139
 I see the acrid red color in the water 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.300
 I will proceed to turn on the TV 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.949
 and turn on the water so they can 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.620
 appreciate it here as you see it is on 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:05:00.409
 we turn on the TV now it has a step 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.310
 apart they must have their wii control 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:07.550
 wiimote that case it should be 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.689
 have this control with batteries and I 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.330
 case I have a battery pack 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.610
 rechargeable then just tell it 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.409
 I connect and it should be seen as well 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.330
 had the cap if they do not have a 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.789
 battery pack as I buy this 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.610
 some double batteries are inserted in 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:26.300
 this part of the control activates a 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.569
 battery here goes one and finishes another part 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.300
 it is connected and the control 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:34.069
 later you have a good one 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.310
 Once the TV is on I have to go 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.509
 to the video 1 or video 2 mode the truth 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.000
 I do not know what will be then of some 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.639
 now we come back with the view of 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.839
 that the wii works perfectly well 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.539
 Well, as you can see in the image 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:49.699
 I have a little relaxation in this but 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.650
 well usually the default bar 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.540
 must go on top of the 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.790
 tele or lower or here 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.440
 if you have mounted the TV to the wall 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.320
 this one carries the same procedure 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.320
 they just have to have a small one 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.210
 little care is not to throw anything 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.370
 that has already been connected or even from 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.040
 damage television take very much into account 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.110
 it is recommended to pass the cable through 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.120
 behind the TV for this that if not no 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.480
 they will be able to see the image perfectly 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.700
 of the wii this one relaxes normally 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.650
 lopez all the cable that I have here 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.480
 this can be hidden in a very 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.640
 simple to put behind the TV or 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.220
 having a little or a little more order 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.750
 well or well here I have control of the 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.610
 uy if he pressed it already 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.590
 they notice that it is blinking 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.990
 then I proceed to turn on the wii 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.610
 As you can see, I turned it on from the button 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.800
 on that is in this part 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.199
 of control if you want to pay 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.699
 I just let down when the 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.900
 turn off from the control has a small 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.789
 problem is that a button is put 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.190
 yellow do not worry you can go back 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:54.720
 to turn on does not have any problem this 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.450
 and if you want to understand from here 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.910
 simply you push this button 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:03.890
 As you can see, this simply appears 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.890
 picture of the water and it sounds perfectly 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:10.540
 this my TV is not totally the 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.270
 configuration I do not have it with for 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.740
 full screen but it does not look bad this 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.530
 it's a problem my TV is not from my 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:21.090
 wii this and here you can already appreciate 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.090
 that sounds totally the uicc 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.709
 well with this I conclude my tutorial 

00:07:24.209 --> 00:07:27.569
 live club people I hope you have them 

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:30.589
 pleased and see you in the next 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.589
 video see you later
