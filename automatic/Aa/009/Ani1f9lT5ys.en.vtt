the other way of removing it at the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.029 
the other way of removing it at the
surface<00:01:01.579> is<00:01:01.879> with<00:01:02.030> chemical<00:01:02.750> depilatory

surface is with chemical depilatory

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.380 
surface is with chemical depilatory
which<00:01:04.039> are<00:01:04.220> chemicals<00:01:04.670> which<00:01:04.879> usually<00:01:05.089> have

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
which are chemicals which usually have

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.139 
which are chemicals which usually have
alkali<00:01:05.899> and<00:01:06.140> sulphur<00:01:07.039> in<00:01:07.190> them<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:07.759> actually

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
alkali and sulphur in them that actually

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.779 
alkali and sulphur in them that actually
dissolves<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.110> hair<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:10.100> see<00:01:10.250> hair<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.610> made

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
dissolves the hair you see hair is made

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.660 
dissolves the hair you see hair is made
of<00:01:10.940> keratin<00:01:11.149> and<00:01:11.539> these<00:01:12.380> substances<00:01:13.039> actually

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
of keratin and these substances actually

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.690 
of keratin and these substances actually
dissolve<00:01:14.000> keratin<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:15.289> problem<00:01:15.679> is<00:01:15.830> that's

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
dissolve keratin the problem is that's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.540 
dissolve keratin the problem is that's
carried<00:01:17.090> in<00:01:17.209> in<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.690> surface<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.229> your<00:01:18.440> skin

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
carried in in the surface of your skin

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.120 
carried in in the surface of your skin
so<00:01:19.550> if<00:01:19.819> you<00:01:20.149> use<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.360> too<00:01:20.630> strong<00:01:20.959> too<00:01:21.649> much<00:01:21.860> or

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
so if you use a too strong too much or

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.370 
so if you use a too strong too much or
too<00:01:22.160> long<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:23.330> can<00:01:23.509> actually<00:01:23.690> dissolve<00:01:24.170> Worf

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
too long you can actually dissolve Worf

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.350 
too long you can actually dissolve Worf
some<00:01:24.619> of<00:01:24.709> your<00:01:24.860> skin<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.369> get<00:01:25.819> an<00:01:25.910> irritation

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
or a burn so usually their instructions

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.580 
or a burn so usually their instructions
about<00:01:28.910> testing<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.599> making<00:01:29.869> sure<00:01:30.080> that

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
about testing it and making sure that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.230 
about testing it and making sure that
you<00:01:30.679> don't<00:01:30.890> use<00:01:31.069> it<00:01:31.220> in<00:01:31.340> sensitive<00:01:31.789> areas<00:01:31.910> and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
you don't use it in sensitive areas and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.109 
you don't use it in sensitive areas and
you<00:01:32.330> don't<00:01:32.569> use<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.080> too<00:01:33.200> long<00:01:34.119> regardless

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
you don't use it too long regardless

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.150 
you don't use it too long regardless
which<00:01:35.330> of<00:01:35.479> these<00:01:35.599> techniques<00:01:36.080> you<00:01:36.319> use<00:01:36.500> you're

which of these techniques you use you're
going<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.369> have<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.640> repeat<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.539> maintenance

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
going to have to repeat the maintenance

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.680 
going to have to repeat the maintenance
every<00:01:39.500> day<00:01:39.860> or<00:01:40.069> every<00:01:40.130> other<00:01:40.580> day<00:01:40.789> depending

hair from the root maintenance is much
less<00:02:06.560> infrequent<00:02:07.190> because<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.819> takes<00:02:07.970> the

three techniques waxing is pretty fast

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.220 
three techniques waxing is pretty fast
because<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.640> removes<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:14.030> lot<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.330> hair<00:02:14.540> at<00:02:14.750> one

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
because it removes a lot of hair at one

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.679 
because it removes a lot of hair at one
time<00:02:15.500> as<00:02:15.770> opposed<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.790> plucking<00:02:17.060> or<00:02:17.329> threading

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
time as opposed to plucking or threading

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.860 
time as opposed to plucking or threading
which<00:02:18.140> removes<00:02:18.560> individual<00:02:19.280> hairs<00:02:19.870> plucking

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
which removes individual hairs plucking

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.730 
which removes individual hairs plucking
is<00:02:21.019> inexpensive

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
is inexpensive

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.620 
is inexpensive
you<00:02:21.860> can<00:02:22.010> do<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.220> by<00:02:22.340> yourself<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.420> course

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.620 
you can do it by yourself but of course
it's<00:02:23.840> time-consuming<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:25.480> threading<00:02:26.480> is

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
it's time-consuming and threading is

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.030 
it's time-consuming and threading is
usually<00:02:26.960> done<00:02:27.080> by<00:02:27.140> professionals<00:02:27.890> and
