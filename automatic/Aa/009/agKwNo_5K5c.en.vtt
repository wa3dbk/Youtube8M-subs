00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
way so that's how the hips we even if

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.320 
way so that's how the hips we even if
the<00:02:51.420> shoulders<00:02:51.870> get<00:02:52.080> out<00:02:52.260> ahead<00:02:53.330> irritation

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
the shoulders get out ahead irritation

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.830 
the shoulders get out ahead irritation
is<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.720> way<00:02:54.959> now<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.459> hips<00:02:56.670> are<00:02:56.910> further

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
is this way now and the hips are further

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.720 
is this way now and the hips are further
back<00:02:59.360> but<00:03:00.360> everything<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.319> braced<00:03:01.730> against

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
back but everything is braced against

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.640 
back but everything is braced against
the<00:03:02.910> front<00:03:03.209> side<00:03:04.519> so<00:03:05.519> when<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.849> see<00:03:06.650> finish

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
the front side so when you see finish

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.120 
the front side so when you see finish
the<00:03:08.640> shoulders<00:03:09.120> should<00:03:09.299> still<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:10.130> braced

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
the shoulders should still be braced

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.560 
the shoulders should still be braced
against<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.640> foot<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:14.000> this<00:03:15.000> shoulder<00:03:15.420> will

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
against the foot and this shoulder will

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.229 
against the foot and this shoulder will
be<00:03:15.600> going<00:03:15.930> back<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.829> way<00:03:19.819> so<00:03:20.819> when<00:03:21.000> you're

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
be going back that way so when you're

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.599 
be going back that way so when you're
pulling<00:03:21.510> on<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.920> doorframe<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:26.220> hip<00:03:26.400> is

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
pulling on the doorframe the hip is

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.349 
pulling on the doorframe the hip is
leading<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:29.549> just<00:03:29.730> want<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.000> pull

straight and you're you're just getting
your<00:03:35.370> body<00:03:35.609> more<00:03:36.000> out<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.420> way

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.740 

what<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.290> see<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> lot<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:45.720> turning<00:03:46.720> around

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
what I see a lot of is turning around

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.990 
what I see a lot of is turning around
too<00:03:49.750> far<00:03:50.760> or<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.180> disk<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.600> over<00:03:52.870> here<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.820> the
