Engineers<00:01:32.880> ensure<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> new<00:01:33.810> stoves

don't mean retraining a generation of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.419 
don't mean retraining a generation of
workers<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.380> stoves<00:01:37.709> are<00:01:37.889> designed<00:01:38.219> with

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
workers so the stoves are designed with

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.469 
workers so the stoves are designed with
local<00:01:38.759> needs<00:01:38.969> in<00:01:39.209> mind<00:01:40.819> they<00:01:41.819> can<00:01:41.999> even<00:01:42.329> burn

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479

the<00:01:45.020> three<00:01:46.020> things<00:01:46.259> which<00:01:46.469> we<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.679> addressed

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the three things which we have addressed

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.389 
the three things which we have addressed
in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> technology<00:01:48.029> is<00:01:48.240> air<00:01:48.840> fuel<00:01:49.229> ratio<00:01:49.399> so

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
in the technology is air fuel ratio so

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
in the technology is air fuel ratio so
that<00:01:50.429> we<00:01:50.670> get<00:01:50.759> higher<00:01:50.969> temperatures<00:01:51.539> we've

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that we get higher temperatures we've

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.959 
that we get higher temperatures we've
looked<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.709> good<00:01:52.889> insulation<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.609> that<00:01:53.759> we

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
looked at good insulation so that we

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.809 
looked at good insulation so that we
curb<00:01:54.229> losses<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.469> environment<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.039> we

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
curb losses to the environment and we

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.399 
curb losses to the environment and we
have<00:01:56.939> looked<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.179> complete<00:01:57.569> combustion<00:01:57.959> so

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
have looked at complete combustion so

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
have looked at complete combustion so
that<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.950> no<00:01:59.069> carbon<00:01:59.310> monoxide

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
that there is no carbon monoxide
