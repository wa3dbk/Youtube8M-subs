00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.479 
over what the idea is behind heavy rain
well<00:00:39.570> every<00:00:40.140> rain<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.590> about<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> idea<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
well every rain is about the idea of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.490 
well every rain is about the idea of
creating<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.149> experience<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.110> based<00:00:43.350> on

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
creating an experience that is based on

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
creating an experience that is based on
storytelling<00:00:43.890> where<00:00:44.460> player's<00:00:45.300> actions

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
storytelling where player's actions

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
storytelling where player's actions
would<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.110> consequences<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.039> way<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
would have consequences on the way the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.840 
would have consequences on the way the
story's<00:00:47.850> true<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.360> would<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.289> an<00:00:50.280> emotional

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
story's true it would be a an emotional

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.450 
story's true it would be a an emotional
experience<00:00:51.379> definitely<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> probably

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
experience definitely and probably

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000 
experience definitely and probably
aiming<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.539> an<00:00:54.660> adult<00:00:54.840> audience<00:00:55.170> much<00:00:55.800> more

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
aiming for an adult audience much more

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.709 
aiming for an adult audience much more
than<00:00:56.129> kids<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.579> teenagers<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.480> quite

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
than kids or teenagers so it's quite

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.549 
than kids or teenagers so it's quite
dark<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.760> serious<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.120> guess<00:01:00.350> could<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> go

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
detail about that well the game offers

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.060 
detail about that well the game offers
different<00:01:08.729> types<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.840> sequences<00:01:10.500> first<00:01:10.950> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
different types of sequences first of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.590 
different types of sequences first of
all<00:01:11.159> you're<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.549> direct<00:01:11.670> control<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
all you're in direct control all the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.810 
all you're in direct control all the
time<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.439> mean<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.100> control<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
time I mean you really control the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
time I mean you really control the
character<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.509> second<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> second<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
character of a second to second you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.350 
character of a second to second you
interact<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> environment<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.119> talk

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
interact with the environment you talk

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760 
interact with the environment you talk
two<00:01:18.509> characters<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.350> different<00:01:19.740> things

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
two characters you do different things

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.160 
two characters you do different things
and<00:01:20.100> different<00:01:20.159> scenes<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.840> specific

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and different scenes for some specific

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.950 
and different scenes for some specific
action<00:01:22.799> scenes<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.280> use<00:01:24.000> an<00:01:24.299> interface<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
action scenes we use an interface that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.249 
action scenes we use an interface that
is<00:01:25.350> closed<00:01:25.860> through<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> old<00:01:27.259> quicktime

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
is closed through the old quicktime

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.679 
is closed through the old quicktime
event<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.250> different<00:01:29.759> i<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.450> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
event but is really different i think so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.480 
event but is really different i think so
first<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.200> integrated<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
first of all we integrated all the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.880 
first of all we integrated all the
symbols<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.570> 3d<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> environment<00:01:34.530> they

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
symbols in in 3d in the environment they

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.929 
symbols in in 3d in the environment they
are<00:01:34.979> animated<00:01:35.689> in<00:01:36.689> 3d<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:38.159> sold<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.790> use

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
are animated in 3d it's sold so we use

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.880 
are animated in 3d it's sold so we use
all<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> controls<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> controller<00:01:40.380> we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
all the controls on the controller we

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.510 
all the controls on the controller we
use<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> sixaxis<00:01:41.520> motion<00:01:41.790> sensor

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
use the sixaxis motion sensor

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.669 
use the sixaxis motion sensor
the<00:01:42.609> triggers<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.180> balance<00:01:43.539> mistakes<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.259> we

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
the triggers the balance mistakes and we

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.440 
the triggers the balance mistakes and we
really<00:01:44.859> try<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.130> emulate<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:46.000> moon's<00:01:46.240> on

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
really try to emulate the moon's on

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.240 
really try to emulate the moon's on
