actually<00:01:06.689> found<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:08.159> target<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
actually found it I'm in target it is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.010 
actually found it I'm in target it is
less<00:01:10.110> than<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.280> minks<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.939> Sephora<00:01:12.450> carries

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
less than the minks that Sephora carries

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.380 
less than the minks that Sephora carries
and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:14.159> actually<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.270> better<00:01:16.159> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
and I actually like it better the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.550 
and I actually like it better the
pattern<00:01:18.390> i<00:01:18.509> did<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.140> floral

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560

pattern and i'll show you guys a picture

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.469 
pattern and i'll show you guys a picture
in<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.380> sec<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.580> similar<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
in just a sec is very similar to the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.240 
in just a sec is very similar to the
minks<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.200> i<00:01:25.259> did<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> actually<00:01:25.920> want

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
minks that i did want to actually want

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.270 
minks that i did want to actually want

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to get it done at a salon so i really

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.890 
to get it done at a salon so i really
like<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.030> colors<00:01:30.329> aren't<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.720> bright

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
like that the colors aren't as bright

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.840 
like that the colors aren't as bright
but<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.770> actually<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.400> cool<00:01:32.579> because

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
but that's actually kind of cool because

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.640 
but that's actually kind of cool because
it's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> little<00:01:33.450> toned<00:01:33.750> down<00:01:33.930> i<00:01:34.170> could<00:01:34.380> not

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it's a little toned down i could not

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.770 
it's a little toned down i could not
necessarily<00:01:35.310> wear<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.030> things<00:01:36.329> but

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
necessarily wear it with more things but

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020 
necessarily wear it with more things but
if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.799> blends<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.369> little<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.729> more

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
if you know blends in a little bit more

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
if you know blends in a little bit more
if<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:39.960> call<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.320> windy<00:01:40.680> and

actually has been pretty good i've had
it<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.500> few<00:01:46.590> days<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.180> doesn't<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.930> as

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it for a few days but it doesn't have as

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.960 
it for a few days but it doesn't have as
much<00:01:49.500> buckling<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:52.009> flipping<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
much buckling and flipping and this and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
much buckling and flipping and this and
that<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.479> far<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> makes<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.710> home

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950

that as far as like the makes at home
did<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> lot<00:01:57.630> easier<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.229> apply<00:01:58.500> i

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
did and it was a lot easier to apply i

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.359 
did and it was a lot easier to apply i
actually<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.299> has<00:02:01.369> more

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
actually think that it has more

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.600 
actually think that it has more
properties<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.090> nail<00:02:03.450> polish<00:02:04.250> then<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
properties like nail polish then the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.680 
properties like nail polish then the
mixed<00:02:06.000> us<00:02:06.149> which<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.750> more<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:08.690> plasticky

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
mixed us which is more like a plasticky

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.290 
mixed us which is more like a plasticky
coating<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.530> some<00:02:11.099> sort<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.120> actually

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
coating of some sort this one actually

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.700 
coating of some sort this one actually
smelled<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.050> no<00:02:13.319> power

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
smelled like no power

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.340 
smelled like no power
I<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.820> like<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.030> protective<00:02:15.600> shield<00:02:15.840> over<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
I have like a protective shield over the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.680 
I have like a protective shield over the
top<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.100> first<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.940> ready<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.360> apply<00:02:18.570> it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
top when you first get ready to apply it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.810 
top when you first get ready to apply it
and<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.350> remove<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.890> actually<00:02:20.310> kind<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.520> smells

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
and we remove it actually kind of smells

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.400 
and we remove it actually kind of smells
like<00:02:20.940> wet<00:02:21.240> until<00:02:21.480> college<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.080> thought<00:02:22.230> that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
like wet until college so I thought that

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.800 
like wet until college so I thought that
was<00:02:22.560> interesting<00:02:23.210> on<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.420> side<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
was interesting on the side of the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
was interesting on the side of the
package<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.590> says<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.250> doesn't<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.700> any

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
package it says that it doesn't have any

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.420 
package it says that it doesn't have any
formaldehyde<00:02:28.700> what<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.660> lean<00:02:30.930> or<00:02:31.430> dpb

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
formaldehyde what was it to lean or dpb

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.130 
formaldehyde what was it to lean or dpb
I<00:02:32.640> actually<00:02:32.880> had<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.180> go<00:02:33.390> online<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.810> find<00:02:34.020> out

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
I actually had to go online to find out

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.580 
I actually had to go online to find out
what<00:02:34.260> dpb<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.070> just<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.560> toxic<00:02:37.560> chemical

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
what dpb is just like a toxic chemical

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.820 
what dpb is just like a toxic chemical
that<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.580> cause<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.480> believe<00:02:40.140> its<00:02:40.260> had<00:02:40.380> cancer

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that can cause I believe its had cancer

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.370 
that can cause I believe its had cancer
and<00:02:40.860> other<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.400> birth<00:02:41.610> defects<00:02:42.380> so

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
and other like birth defects so

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.920 
and other like birth defects so
obviously<00:02:44.220> that's<00:02:44.370> not<00:02:44.520> good<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.750> actually

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
obviously that's not good so I actually

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.250 
obviously that's not good so I actually
like<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.530> pretty<00:02:47.280> cool<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.390> said<00:02:48.450> not

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
like it pretty cool and like I said not

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.290 
like it pretty cool and like I said not

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
as much wrinkling and buckling as the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.760 
as much wrinkling and buckling as the
minks<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.050> could<00:02:52.170> do<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.380> home<00:02:52.590> by

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
minks that you could do it home by

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:11.630 
minks that you could do it home by
sephora<00:02:53.220> i<00:03:09.590> actually<00:03:10.590> decided<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.980> try<00:03:11.280> it

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
which was actually for acrylic nails and

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.830 
which was actually for acrylic nails and
destroyed<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.400> whole<00:03:29.670> top<00:03:29.910> layer<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.210> my<00:03:30.450> nil

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
they have very um just taking off the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.750 
they have very um just taking off the
excess<00:03:37.230> layers<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.920> my<00:03:38.070> nails<00:03:38.280> which<00:03:38.490> made<00:03:38.640> it

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
excess layers of my nails which made it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.820 
excess layers of my nails which made it
really<00:03:38.790> sensitive<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.170> had<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.350> go<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> few

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
really sensitive so I had to go a few

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.800 
really sensitive so I had to go a few
weeks<00:03:41.160> without<00:03:41.490> doing<00:03:41.970> anything<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.660> was

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
weeks without doing anything and I was

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.750 
weeks without doing anything and I was
wondering<00:03:43.230> what<00:03:43.320> my<00:03:43.440> nails<00:03:43.650> ever<00:03:43.950> be<00:03:44.640> as

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
wondering what my nails ever be as

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.420 
wondering what my nails ever be as
strong<00:03:45.000> as<00:03:45.210> they<00:03:45.360> were<00:03:45.680> prior<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.890> me<00:03:47.040> going<00:03:47.310> to

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
strong as they were prior to me going to

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.400 
strong as they were prior to me going to
get<00:03:47.550> them<00:03:47.700> done<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.240> if<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.720> ever<00:03:48.750> have<00:03:49.110> taken

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
get them done and if you ever have taken

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.170 
get them done and if you ever have taken
off<00:03:49.530> acrylic<00:03:49.950> nails<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.430> felt<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.030> is

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
off acrylic nails it felt like that is

off acrylic nails it felt like that is
really<00:03:51.480> painful<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:53.040> your<00:03:53.280> nails<00:03:53.460> are<00:03:53.610> like

the morning or you know early part of
the<00:05:04.030> day<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.510> then<00:05:04.690> before<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.170> went<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.410> sleep

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
the day and then before I went to sleep

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.970 
the day and then before I went to sleep
and<00:05:05.980> I<00:05:06.490> did<00:05:06.790> see<00:05:07.120> some<00:05:07.480> improvement<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.470> i

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
and I did see some improvement and i

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.460 
and I did see some improvement and i
think<00:05:09.220> i<00:05:09.340> paid<00:05:09.640> like<00:05:09.940> ten<00:05:10.360> dollars<00:05:10.750> for<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.290> and

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
think i paid like ten dollars for it and

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.820 
think i paid like ten dollars for it and
as<00:05:11.890> you<00:05:12.040> can<00:05:12.190> see<00:05:12.220> i<00:05:12.370> have<00:05:12.490> plenty<00:05:13.000> left<00:05:13.830> after

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
as you can see i have plenty left after

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.000 
as you can see i have plenty left after
doing<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.400> for<00:05:16.000> seven<00:05:16.210> days<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:16.960> i<00:05:17.230> think<00:05:17.860> it

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
doing it for seven days so i think it

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.640 
doing it for seven days so i think it
was<00:05:18.100> money<00:05:18.400> well<00:05:18.760> spent<00:05:19.230> if<00:05:20.230> you<00:05:20.350> go<00:05:20.470> on

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
was money well spent if you go on

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.640 
was money well spent if you go on
