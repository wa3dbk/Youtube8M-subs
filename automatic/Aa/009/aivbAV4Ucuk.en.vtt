00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.620
 I take the opportunity as a producer I 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.020
 I understand that when we look at us 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.300
 Millions of TV viewers should quickly 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.880
 he sink all the best so I immediately 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.020
 I want to say this is not tanya chipper 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.120

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.920

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.870
 Armenui hard when I just 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.220

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.250
 want them to remember her and 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.410
 the most important thing we did 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.080
 I said that this country should song 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.170

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.270
 in the semifinals or not pass what it is 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:22.350
 one of my favorite singers on 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:26.010
 today in our country is a fact 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.660
 for all I want to say this is one of 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.870
 most favorite singers 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:34.640
