Whatís happening again guys? You know thereís

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.320
actually a theme for todayís videos and thatís:
ìahhhoooohhh! What the F(beep)kî. Seriously!

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.900
Starting out with this creepy satanic Louis
Armstrong bobble head doll.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.220
[Creepy Louis Armstrong Head - Clip]
(inaudible)

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.339
[Ray William Johnson (RayWJ)]
Now I know what youíre thinking. Ray: that

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.439
thing has low batteries. Bull(beep) that thing
is here to f(beep)in molest me! I mean did

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.670
you see that face? Louis Armstrong doesnít
make that R@peF@ce, I mean what if you walked

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.230
into a jazz club and Louis Armstrong was on
stage making a face like ìHELLO Where are

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.780
all the white b^tch&amp;s at?î That video got
30,000 views in about a year and a half. And

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.920
and, thank you, thank you guys for sending
that to me cause you know, I didnít wanna

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.210
sleep this week or anything. f(beep)in think
is going to haunt my (like Freddy Fóing Kruger)

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.649
nightmares. And oh, props to the lady whose
idea it was to film this thing and put it

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.309
on Youtube, but ah, a quick message to her:
ìI think you left your weed on the table

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.440
there.î I guess you would need to toke up
all the time after seeing that creepy f(beep)in

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.770
thing in your living room. HELLO!

[Ray William Johnson (RayWJ)]
Actually this next video is from last year,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.650
I wanted to review it then but I didnít have
time, but its great youíll like it, it has

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.860
3,000,000 views. So thereís these guys watching
this girl dance here in a bikini. You know,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.700
typical internet behavior (lookiní for beatiní
material) but of course thatís not the good

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.000
part. The good part is when the girl approaches
the camera.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.380
[Bikini Girl ChatRoulette Prank - Clip]
Whatís up? Whatís up guys? (girl is a guy)

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.380
You guys are so gay!

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.170
[Ray William Johnson (RayWJ)]
Now, I love this (beep) mainly cause the guys

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.610
watchin the bikini dance there, they were
all mesmerized like they are f(beep)in Bikini

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.200
Girl Louis Armstrong. And then the dude turns
around and calls them gay! Which is hilarious

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.259
cause you know they left the room, like oh,
my god, are we gay? I swear to god I had this

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.469
boner before we clicked on that video. And
ya, I know what you guys think, actually I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.399
do know what you guys are thinking, you guys
are thinking what a Douche! What a fag, cause

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.000
according to you guys everyone on the internet
is either a douche or a fag. And we appreciate

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.350
that! (loviní us some douchery faggery) No!
But youíre probably thinking, Ray: Why is

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.351
Jesus there dancing in a bikini? I donít
know, for your sins? I donít know. But I

00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:22.980
do know you gotta go watch the whole video
cause he pranks other people, and itís hilarious!

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.720
But admittedly if that had happened to me,
I think I would of handled it a little differently.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.450
Hey, b^tch! I didnít say stop dancing! Alright
besides all that, thatís not the weirdest

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.895
part. (his p&amp;n^s is not the weirdest part?)
Hereís the weirdest part. (still not his

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:38.840
p&amp;n^s?) The guys channel says his name is
Steve Kardynal and I swear to you, I met Steve

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.070
before, not, like at a Tranny Bar, but no!
In real life! Now correct me if Iím wrong

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.850
but is that True Steve, do we know each other?
Well! Regardless, Steve, I think I speak for

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.690
everyone her when I say: ìnice, @ssî.

Alright so this video was kind of blowing

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.650
up this week. It got over 700,000 thousand
views and itís just a girl and a cell phone

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.650
cam.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.440
[Do You Like Me Now - Clip]
Cuz, I donít have a boyfriend so Iíve kind

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440
of been wondering whatís wrong with me.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.120
[Ray William Johnson (RayWJ)]
Alright, fair enough. Normal enough. Sheís

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.530
a girl with a cell phone cam, she doesnít
have a boy friend so sheís gonna make us

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.530
a little video.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.880
[Do You Like Me Now - Clip]
Do You Like Me Now? Do you like me know, with

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.750
all this makeup on? Huh? Do you f&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;ing like

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.990

face and pouring water over her head) Ahhhhhhh!

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:34.540
Do you like me now? Ahhhhhhhhhhh! (messing
up her hair) Do you guys like me now? (dancing)

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.560
You like me now? (Model posing) Whatís 2
plus 2, Gonorrhea!

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.420
[Ray William Johnson (RayWJ)]
I told you, didnít I, I told yoU! I told

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.760
you all the videos today would make you go
AHHHHHHHHHH, ILLLLLLLL WHAT THE F(BEEP)! Now,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.330
to the girl in the video. Sweet heart, you
donít have to do all that stuff to get a

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.820
guy to like you. All you have to do is? The
dishes! Alright! Look, look, lets be serious

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.710
here, if youíre a girl, itís not hard, itís
not difficult to attract a guy. Look Steve,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.260
here, did it and he got a f(beep)in p*n^s!~
I mean, it really is that simple, guys, and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.090
you guys would guys would notice these things
if you stop spending all your time f(beep)ing

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.959
planking! Ya, pardon me, side note here: ìPlanking
is the stupidest s(beep)t, if I walk around

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.180
town and I see anyone of you planking, I swear
to god Iím gonna run up and punch you right

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.210
in the d^(beep)k. Anywhore! I think that everyoneís
favorite part of this video is that little

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.449
mathematical equation she has for STDís

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.980

sheís right!

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.330
[Ray William Johnson (RayWJ)]
But if you didnít already know. This video

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.169
is faker than a Jersey Shore sun tan! Itís
actually a performance ñ this little girl

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.789
is actually giving a socio-political performance!
Look! She is satirizing what guys look for

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.229
in girls and I think she did a great job.
In fact, she did a good enough job that plenty

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.849
of people believed it. Hell, even those gay
guys thought it was real. So to that, I can

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.070
honestly say: ìGood performance, girl. Hatís
off to youî. Keep on trolliní with those

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.509
socio-political messages. Oh, guys real quick,
side note: before I forget, I actually made

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.539
a Google plus account, (gplus.to/raywj) I
resisted for a while and then I had to make

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.099
one cause people were making fake ones and
google is too f(beep)ing stupid to take the

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.819
fake ones down! So this is my Google plus
account (gplus.to/raywj) I will also put it

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.919
in the info bar BELOW. So if you have a Google
plus account then add me, weíll have a good

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.509
time. And other than that Iíll see you in
a few days. Oh, donít forget to check out

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:34.629
