00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.569 
the images and picking the best of the
best<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.159> left

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
best so as you can see there to the left

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.370 
best so as you can see there to the left
where<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> says<00:01:54.060> labels<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.049> there's<00:01:55.200> an

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
where it says labels and there's an

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.080 
where it says labels and there's an
arrow<00:01:55.619> pointing<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.250> you'll<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.790> we

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
arrow pointing down you'll see that we

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.679 
arrow pointing down you'll see that we
only<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.420> no<00:01:58.290> label<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.040> select<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.479> red

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
only have no label and select the red

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.780 
only have no label and select the red
now<00:02:01.020> there's<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> bunch<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.189> labels<00:02:02.369> there

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
now there's a bunch of labels there

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.190 
now there's a bunch of labels there
there's<00:02:03.149> yellow<00:02:03.960> green<00:02:04.530> turquoise<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.579> red

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
there's yellow green turquoise and red

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.080 
there's yellow green turquoise and red
so<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:07.670> yellow<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:08.720> command<00:02:09.649> 7<00:02:10.160> which<00:02:10.700> stands

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
so the yellow is command 7 which stands

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.270 
so the yellow is command 7 which stands
for<00:02:11.270> second<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:13.459> 8<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.360> green<00:02:15.110> which<00:02:15.620> stands

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
for second the 8 is green which stands

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.530 
for second the 8 is green which stands
for<00:02:16.430> approved<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.720> 9<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.099> command<00:02:19.910> 9<00:02:20.239> is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
for approved the 9 so command 9 is

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.990 
for approved the 9 so command 9 is
turquoise<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.709> one<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.069> for<00:02:22.310> review<00:02:22.760> and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
turquoise and that one is for review and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.470 
turquoise and that one is for review and
then<00:02:23.660> again<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.290> command<00:02:24.590> 6<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.250> red<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.450> you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
then again the command 6 is red so you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.559 
then again the command 6 is red so you
can<00:02:26.690> rate<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.770> label<00:02:28.550> your<00:02:28.790> images<00:02:29.270> this<00:02:29.420> way

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
can rate and label your images this way

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.210 
can rate and label your images this way
