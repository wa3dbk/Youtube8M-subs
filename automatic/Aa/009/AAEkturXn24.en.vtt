answer we ain't going to beat around the
bush<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.860> for<00:01:49.860> those<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.280> don't

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
bush and for those of you that don't

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.210 
bush and for those of you that don't
know<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.610> picked<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.000> black<00:01:51.240> ops<00:01:51.479> 2<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> for

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
know I picked up black ops 2 for the for

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.499 
know I picked up black ops 2 for the for
the<00:01:53.250> ps3<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> ps3

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the ps3 so you know if you have a ps3

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.139 
the ps3 so you know if you have a ps3
and<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.899> think<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.350> beat<00:01:58.590> my<00:01:58.939> behind<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and you think you can beat my behind you

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.639 
and you think you can beat my behind you
probably<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.719> I'm<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> lie<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
probably can I'm not going to lie you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.550 
probably can I'm not going to lie you
probably<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:02.219> because<00:02:02.689> I'm<00:02:03.689> not<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.049> good<00:02:04.290> on

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
probably can because I'm not so good on

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.910 
probably can because I'm not so good on
the<00:02:05.189> ps3<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.469> controller

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the ps3 and it's just the the controller

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.669 
the ps3 and it's just the the controller
that<00:02:08.250> makes<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.670> little<00:02:08.789> bit<00:02:08.910> harder<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.679> to

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that makes it a little bit harder to to

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.870 
that makes it a little bit harder to to
navigate<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.340> move<00:02:11.459> around<00:02:11.750> so

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
navigate and move around so

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.960 
navigate and move around so
um<00:02:13.530> but<00:02:14.530> yeah<00:02:14.680> guys<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.460> wanted<00:02:15.940> to
