00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello to all and has won 57 and we are 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.130
 find and safed and full of times that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.250
 I shoot this video but it takes 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.540
 same as I get there because thief 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.330
 I would like to introduce this figurine 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 of burns that has the figurines of madness 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.600
 of the series at ge and x so on a 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.699
 mouth I think you told me about it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.960
 finally I guess it's this one is 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.310
 yes I have returned this video because 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.869
 before I wrote a message at the same 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.070
 time that it is not just the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 women who know how to do two things in 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.570
 same time that is not funny 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.329
 bontempi so after where to find her I 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.950
 do not know too much but what you can 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.450
 to do is what I did often 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.309
 is that you will see in a 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.530
 miniature shop not online but 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.930
 a real if you come from it if you in 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 have a close to you and you 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.270
 ask the seller to put it to you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 side because often yeah yeah 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.899
 damn that's what i'm going to get to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.940
 say what I want to be he does not know 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.790
 no longer where to find it as soon as it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.110
 the next day there are already more 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.939
 so the best thing is to ask him to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.229
 put it aside if can see it 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.900
 what I did for 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.549
 some figurines not golden eyes 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.549
 in the eyes I found them by 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.560
 chance of barley and so I found out 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.470
 first I had found it in a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.720
 shop and after I also had gold 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.130
 in another shop so for those 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.250
 who do not know what are the balances after 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.229
 two hits there I show you this 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 figurine also because I am asked 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.119
 often what bunch favorite figurines eh 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.670
 well I think if this one despite that 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.100
 I like that of 1989 as found 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.590
 and I already want to tell you because 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.920
 look at the painting like the pretty ones 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.570
 good the details so for most of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.000
 figurines are causes it's still 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.000
 pretty well do look at it from there garnished 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 the benefits where there are some 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.189
 others who are average but I like 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.189
 I am a fan of this series 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.359
 otherwise there is no other 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.459
 news so you have pretty much everything 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.819
 saw a 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.239
 there is so much I'll tell you 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.170
 meet again 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.720
 and then to the next for a new 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.580
 video and I do not really know what I'm going 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.989
 make 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.000
 I looked at the comments that 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.200
 I had on the videos what is it 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.989
 that I could do as video and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.730
 but I had not read some great stuff 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.000
 interesting by precisely between your 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.440
 figurines more closely like that where I 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.849
 you've shown three but I'm not going 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.090
 no longer wanted to show all one by 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.069
 a 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.799
 because there, as I said, we do not 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:47.510
 finish more then if not bah bah here at the 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.510
