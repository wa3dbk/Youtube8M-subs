 to start we will prepare all 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.909
 our vegetables so it's very simple for 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.449
 the half cucumber we are going to peel it 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.129
 and emptiness and for emptiness and nothing 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.809
 simpler just cut it in 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.309
 the sense of length and using a 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.489
 little spoon we'll just come 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.679
 dig the interior then we go 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.670
 prepare our peppers so we remove 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:03.850
 first the core and cut in the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.070
 sense of length then removed 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.409
 our glitches and all the white part one 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.250
 cut it into strips then here 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.600
 no need to make slats 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.390
 regular is simply to be able to 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.130
 put them in the mixer then we take care 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.229
 then our tomatoes so we go 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.659
 just take off the center and we're going 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.039
 cut them into quarters 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.240
 you saw we are now approaching 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.979
 the end of our recipe 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.890
 we will now cut our onions 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.109
 two and puts it directly into the 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.840
 mixer then we take care of our 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:37.840
 group we're going to crush we remove the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.520
 germ and same thing in the mixer we're going 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.630
 first mix these two foods and 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.630
 then we will add the rest 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:51.619
 then just add our 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.619
 cucumbers 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.509
 then we will be able to add our 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.509
 tomatoes 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.770
 you will see the color will change 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.659
 directly while we are in the process 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.330
 to do it and it will become all of 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.800
 very appealing suite to finish on 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.270
 adds the point so go our powers 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.790
 monrose hainaut yellow pepper we add 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.959
 then olive oil and vinegar 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.040
 of sherry and to finish our 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.040
 tomato paste 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.280
 it feels good when it stops 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.930
 now we will be able to continue we will 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.580
 place all this preparation in a 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.700
 big salad bowl and we will be able to add 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.620
 the rest once in the salad bowl 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.360
 add a glass of water to get the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.230
 texture that we want we add then 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.580
 salt pepper basil and pepper 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.900
 do not hesitate on the ass mans it's 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.750
 still a Spanish recipe as much 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.580
 well perfumed then we will take care of the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.430
 lemon juice so here we go cut it 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.180
 in two and small tips to guide 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.709
 the juice of lemon 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.690
 we will give up the blade of our knife 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.160
 so we're just going to paint it's like 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.769
 that you will see that the juice falls 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.780
 directly tip of the blade your 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.519
 gaspacho is now over let 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.329
