00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
but I really hope they continue updating

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.380 
but I really hope they continue updating
it<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.920> care<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:05.850> put<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.210> there

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it I don't care what they put in there

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.719 
it I don't care what they put in there
just<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:06.990> long<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.469> changes<00:02:08.069> periodically

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
just as long as it changes periodically

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
just as long as it changes periodically
I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.690> part<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> problem<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
I think part of the problem with the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.440 
I think part of the problem with the
x-blade<00:02:11.310> section<00:02:11.970> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
x-blade section is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.710 
x-blade section is
coming<00:02:13.440> back<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> gamer<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.150> often

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
coming back to it as a gamer you often

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360 
coming back to it as a gamer you often
see<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:15.989> same<00:02:16.319> stuff<00:02:16.620> over<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:16.980> over<00:02:17.129> again

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
see the same stuff over and over again

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.940 
see the same stuff over and over again
the<00:02:17.760> top-rated<00:02:18.510> list<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.959> relatively<00:02:19.590> static

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the top-rated list is relatively static

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.619 
the top-rated list is relatively static
so<00:02:20.519> if<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.819> something<00:02:21.030> cycling<00:02:21.480> there

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
so if they have something cycling there

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.000 
so if they have something cycling there
I<00:02:21.660> think<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.140> will<00:02:22.260> help<00:02:22.379> out<00:02:22.620> quite<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> bit

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
I think that will help out quite a bit

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.369 
I think that will help out quite a bit
at<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.849> very<00:02:23.970> least<00:02:24.060> it'll<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.599> better<00:02:25.050> if

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
at the very least it'll be better if

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.410 
at the very least it'll be better if
gamers<00:02:25.769> don't<00:02:26.160> continue<00:02:26.730> coming<00:02:26.910> back<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
gamers don't continue coming back to the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.850 
gamers don't continue coming back to the
section<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.989> see<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> same<00:02:28.500> sort<00:02:28.830> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
section and see the same sort of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.309 
section and see the same sort of
minecraft<00:02:29.370> style<00:02:29.580> game<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.390> tile<00:02:30.690> so

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
minecraft style game in that tile so

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.770 
minecraft style game in that tile so
what<00:02:31.410> else<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.739> on<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.790> mac<00:02:32.940> beta<00:02:33.120> for

something like that and its reception
has<00:02:39.330> been<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.870> little<00:02:40.549> mixed<00:02:41.549> their<00:02:42.120> happen

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
has been a little mixed their happen

some users that managed to install and
play<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.580> game<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:45.420> fine<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.900> works<00:02:46.080> great

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
play the game just fine it works great

for<00:02:46.349> them<00:02:46.560> which<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.610> amazing<00:02:48.209> because

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
for them which is just amazing because

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.720 
for them which is just amazing because
it<00:02:48.840> means<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.530> port<00:02:49.890> actually<00:02:50.579> has<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
it means that this port actually has a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.900 
it means that this port actually has a
shot<00:02:51.030> at<00:02:51.060> working<00:02:51.569> at<00:02:52.700> having<00:02:53.700> said<00:02:53.880> that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
shot at working at having said that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.000 
shot at working at having said that
there<00:02:54.360> were<00:02:54.599> some<00:02:54.900> other<00:02:55.049> problems<00:02:55.440> right<00:02:55.860> out

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
there were some other problems right out

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.920 
there were some other problems right out
of<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.130> gate<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.640> got<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.150> permissions<00:02:57.630> wrong

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
of the gate I got the permissions wrong

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.050 
of the gate I got the permissions wrong
on<00:02:58.230> some<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.590> files<00:02:58.799> that's<00:02:59.310> something

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
on some of the files that's something

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.479 
on some of the files that's something
you<00:03:00.239> don't<00:03:00.569> have<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:01.049> worry<00:03:01.230> about<00:03:01.349> in<00:03:01.739> Windows

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
you don't have to worry about in Windows

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.839 
you don't have to worry about in Windows
land<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.299> in<00:03:03.480> mac<00:03:04.079> linux<00:03:04.530> unix<00:03:04.920> world<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.700> do

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
land but in mac linux unix world you do

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.850 
land but in mac linux unix world you do
have<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.180> worry<00:03:06.329> about<00:03:06.860> read/write

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
have to worry about read/write

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680 
have to worry about read/write
permissions<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.549> files<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:09.060> lot<00:03:09.269> more<00:03:09.510> and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
permissions on files a lot more and

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.110 
permissions on files a lot more and
turns<00:03:10.620> out<00:03:10.769> add<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> defaults<00:03:11.519> set

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
turns out add the defaults set

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240 
turns out add the defaults set
incorrectly<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.769> try<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.980> run<00:03:14.099> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
incorrectly so if you try to run the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.530 
incorrectly so if you try to run the
game<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.549> would<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.790> crash<00:03:15.000> unless<00:03:15.360> your

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
game it would just crash unless your

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.930 
game it would just crash unless your
route<00:03:16.049> or<00:03:16.349> you<00:03:16.530> change<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.100> permissions<00:03:17.760> on<00:03:17.910> a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
route or you change the permissions on a

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.729 
route or you change the permissions on a
whole<00:03:18.090> bunch<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.389> content<00:03:18.720> files<00:03:18.930> beginner

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
whole bunch of content files beginner

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.190 
whole bunch of content files beginner
mistake<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:20.910> easy<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.389> fix<00:03:21.569> so<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.049> was<00:03:22.170> good

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
mistake but easy to fix so that was good

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.460 
mistake but easy to fix so that was good
i<00:03:22.530> also<00:03:22.920> made<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.549> package<00:03:24.359> installer<00:03:24.870> which<00:03:25.260> it

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
i also made a package installer which it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.770 
i also made a package installer which it
turns<00:03:25.859> out<00:03:26.100> isn't<00:03:26.639> really<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.180> preferred<00:03:27.569> way

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
turns out isn't really the preferred way

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.830 
turns out isn't really the preferred way
of<00:03:27.810> distributing<00:03:28.410> software<00:03:28.799> on<00:03:29.280> max<00:03:29.840> again

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
of distributing software on max again

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.470 
of distributing software on max again
this<00:03:31.139> is<00:03:31.319> just<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.799> windows<00:03:32.480> world's

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
this is just like a windows world's

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.710 
this is just like a windows world's
thing<00:03:33.840> i<00:03:34.109> don't<00:03:34.170> know<00:03:34.530> about<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:36.299> idea<00:03:36.660> of

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
thing i don't know about the idea of

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.479 
thing i don't know about the idea of
having<00:03:36.959> an<00:03:37.290> installer<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.950> puts<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.220> bunch<00:03:38.400> of

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
having an installer that puts a bunch of

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.449 
having an installer that puts a bunch of
files<00:03:38.780> basically<00:03:39.780> wherever<00:03:40.049> is<00:03:40.530> pretty

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
files basically wherever is pretty

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.520 
files basically wherever is pretty
commonplace<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:42.090> Windows<00:03:42.420> but<00:03:43.019> on<00:03:43.109> Mac<00:03:43.319> you

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
commonplace on Windows but on Mac you

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.110 
commonplace on Windows but on Mac you
have<00:03:43.650> everything<00:03:43.920> bundled<00:03:44.430> up<00:03:44.519> into<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:44.880> one

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
have everything bundled up into this one

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.610 
have everything bundled up into this one
app<00:03:45.389> file<00:03:45.750> which<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.109> really<00:03:46.410> just<00:03:46.530> a

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
app file which is really just a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.289 
app file which is really just a
container<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.040> other<00:03:47.220> files<00:03:47.519> but<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.150> means

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
container of other files but it means

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.229 
container of other files but it means
it's<00:03:48.510> all<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.750> one<00:03:48.900> place<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.910> preferred

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
it's all in one place and the preferred

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.840 
it's all in one place and the preferred
way<00:03:51.389> of<00:03:51.420> distributing<00:03:51.959> app<00:03:52.350> files<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:53.130> think

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
way of distributing app files I think

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.479 
way of distributing app files I think
based<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.079> feedback<00:03:55.230> anyway<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.950> with

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
based on the feedback anyway is with

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.449 
based on the feedback anyway is with
disk<00:03:57.120> image<00:03:57.420> files<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.130> they're<00:03:59.130> basically

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
disk image files and they're basically

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.949 
disk image files and they're basically
just<00:03:59.670> another<00:03:59.940> storage<00:04:00.269> container<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.780> you

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
just another storage container that you

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.379 
just another storage container that you
can<00:04:01.109> mount<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.620> then<00:04:02.130> when<00:04:02.639> you<00:04:02.819> open<00:04:03.269> that

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
can mount and then when you open that

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.319 
can mount and then when you open that
disk<00:04:03.660> image<00:04:04.549> usually<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.730> see<00:04:05.940> something

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
disk image usually you see something

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.229 
disk image usually you see something
like<00:04:06.500> an<00:04:07.500> icon<00:04:08.130> for<00:04:08.160> your<00:04:08.430> app<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.910> then<00:04:09.060> like

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
like an icon for your app and then like

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.120 
like an icon for your app and then like
a<00:04:09.269> little<00:04:09.630> people<00:04:10.079> draw<00:04:10.319> an<00:04:10.380> arrow<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.040> then

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
a little people draw an arrow and then

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.009 
a little people draw an arrow and then
your<00:04:11.579> Applications<00:04:12.299> folder<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:12.750> then<00:04:12.810> it's

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
your Applications folder and then it's

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.900 
your Applications folder and then it's
up<00:04:13.169> to<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.410> user<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.859> actually<00:04:14.340> put<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.790> app

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
up to the user to actually put the app

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.060 
up to the user to actually put the app
into<00:04:15.359> their<00:04:15.510> applications<00:04:16.410> folder<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.859> that

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
into their applications folder and that

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.140 
into their applications folder and that
installs<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:17.820> which<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.959> really<00:04:19.680> bizarre

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
installs it which is really bizarre

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.790 
installs it which is really bizarre
coming<00:04:21.150> from<00:04:21.510> like<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.930> totally<00:04:22.349> windows

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
coming from like a totally windows

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.670 
coming from like a totally windows

seems<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:24.949> work<00:04:25.070> pretty<00:04:25.190> well<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.850> I'm<00:04:26.180> going

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
seems to work pretty well so I'm going

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.640 
seems to work pretty well so I'm going
to<00:04:26.360> figure<00:04:26.720> out<00:04:26.930> how<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.139> make<00:04:27.289> one<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.560> those

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
set that up what else is going wrong

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.680

with<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.590> there's<00:04:31.190> some<00:04:31.729> choppiness<00:04:32.180> whenever

with it there's some choppiness whenever

with it there's some choppiness whenever

one<00:04:35.300> of<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.479> things<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.840> actually<00:04:36.320> differs

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
one of the things that actually differs

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.640 
one of the things that actually differs
considerably<00:04:37.280> between<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.330> mac<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:38.780> pc<00:04:39.410> xbox

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
considerably between the mac and pc xbox

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.480 
considerably between the mac and pc xbox
versions<00:04:40.370> on<00:04:40.660> PC<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.810> Xbox<00:04:41.900> I'm<00:04:42.470> using<00:04:42.650> X<00:04:43.190> act

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
versions on PC and Xbox I'm using X act

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.960 
versions on PC and Xbox I'm using X act
and<00:04:44.050> for<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.289> mac<00:04:45.440> version<00:04:45.470> I'm<00:04:46.250> using<00:04:46.520> sound

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
and for the mac version I'm using sound

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.749 
and for the mac version I'm using sound
effect<00:04:47.270> instances<00:04:47.930> which<00:04:48.560> in<00:04:48.949> mono<00:04:49.220> game<00:04:49.520> are

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
effect instances which in mono game are

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.140 
effect instances which in mono game are
built<00:04:50.000> using<00:04:50.060> open<00:04:50.840> al<00:04:50.990> so<00:04:51.860> there's<00:04:52.550> there's<00:04:53.030> a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
built using open al so there's there's a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.370 
built using open al so there's there's a
lot<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.330> differences<00:04:53.810> between<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.259> two

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
lot of differences between the two

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.339 
lot of differences between the two
versions<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:55.419> one<00:04:56.419> of<00:04:56.539> the<00:04:56.630> differences<00:04:56.780> is

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
versions and one of the differences is

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.140 
versions and one of the differences is
on<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.860> Mac<00:04:58.039> version<00:04:58.070> whenever<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:58.970> switch

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
on the Mac version whenever you switch

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.080 
on the Mac version whenever you switch
music<00:04:59.599> tracks<00:04:59.870> it<00:05:00.169> loads<00:05:00.590> up<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:01.130> whole<00:05:01.610> new<00:05:01.639> mp3

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
music tracks it loads up a whole new mp3

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.480 
music tracks it loads up a whole new mp3
file<00:05:02.599> into<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.259> sound<00:05:03.500> effect<00:05:03.620> instance<00:05:04.190> and

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
file into a sound effect instance and

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.249 
file into a sound effect instance and
then<00:05:04.610> starts<00:05:04.910> playing<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:06.080> seems

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
then starts playing that and it seems

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.249 
then starts playing that and it seems
like<00:05:06.410> this<00:05:06.530> is<00:05:06.590> just<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:07.130> bit<00:05:07.460> too<00:05:07.820> slow<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:09.139> be

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
like this is just a bit too slow to be

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.800 
like this is just a bit too slow to be
doing<00:05:09.560> on<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.400> fly<00:05:10.610> I<00:05:10.849> can't<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.360> can't<00:05:11.479> just

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
doing on the fly I can't I can't just

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.810 
doing on the fly I can't I can't just
start<00:05:11.990> one<00:05:12.169> of<00:05:12.259> those<00:05:12.380> up<00:05:12.590> in<00:05:12.889> less<00:05:13.550> than<00:05:13.729> a

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
start one of those up in less than a

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.870 
start one of those up in less than a
frames<00:05:14.090> amount<00:05:14.870> of<00:05:14.930> time<00:05:15.259> however<00:05:16.160> it<00:05:16.669> seems

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
frames amount of time however it seems

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.189 
frames amount of time however it seems
like<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.389> solution<00:05:17.720> this<00:05:17.840> is<00:05:17.900> gonna<00:05:18.139> be

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
like the solution this is gonna be

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.740 
like the solution this is gonna be
pretty<00:05:18.349> easy<00:05:18.699> because<00:05:19.699> I<00:05:20.000> don't<00:05:20.240> actually<00:05:20.720> use

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
pretty easy because I don't actually use

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.689 
pretty easy because I don't actually use
that<00:05:21.289> much<00:05:21.470> music<00:05:21.860> in<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.039> game<00:05:22.070> I'm<00:05:22.520> just

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
that much music in the game I'm just

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.700 
that much music in the game I'm just
going<00:05:22.849> to<00:05:22.910> preload<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:23.449> all<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:23.750> start<00:05:24.020> if<00:05:24.560> I

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
going to preload it all to start if I

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.010 
going to preload it all to start if I
can<00:05:24.889> almost<00:05:25.130> fit<00:05:25.639> loading<00:05:26.090> a<00:05:26.180> song<00:05:26.419> into<00:05:26.810> one

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
can almost fit loading a song into one

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.680 
can almost fit loading a song into one
frame<00:05:27.349> then<00:05:27.889> loading<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.460> like<00:05:28.789> ten<00:05:29.090> songs<00:05:29.389> in

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
frame then loading the like ten songs in

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.420 
frame then loading the like ten songs in
the<00:05:29.780> game<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.229> going<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.800> add<00:05:30.949> a<00:05:30.979> pretty

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
the game is going to add a pretty

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.360 
the game is going to add a pretty
negligible<00:05:31.760> amount<00:05:32.210> of<00:05:32.330> time<00:05:32.539> to<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.830> initial

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
negligible amount of time to the initial

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.219 
negligible amount of time to the initial
load<00:05:34.610> started<00:05:35.210> again<00:05:35.419> I<00:05:35.570> should<00:05:35.870> fix<00:05:36.020> these

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
load started again I should fix these

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.610 
load started again I should fix these
problems<00:05:36.580> so<00:05:37.580> that's<00:05:38.270> another<00:05:38.599> pretty<00:05:39.260> easy

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
problems so that's another pretty easy

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.610 
problems so that's another pretty easy
fix<00:05:39.979> of<00:05:40.849> course<00:05:41.150> not<00:05:41.570> all<00:05:41.810> of<00:05:41.990> them<00:05:42.169> are<00:05:42.409> this

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
fix of course not all of them are this

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.510 
fix of course not all of them are this
easy<00:05:42.979> the<00:05:43.669> big<00:05:43.849> WTF<00:05:44.479> bug<00:05:45.110> is<00:05:45.770> one<00:05:46.070> that<00:05:46.310> is

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
easy the big WTF bug is one that is

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.430 
easy the big WTF bug is one that is
unfortunately<00:05:47.300> been<00:05:47.419> reported<00:05:47.840> by<00:05:47.990> at<00:05:48.260> least

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
unfortunately been reported by at least

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.770 
unfortunately been reported by at least
two<00:05:48.680> people<00:05:49.070> and<00:05:49.310> oddly<00:05:50.030> enough<00:05:50.389> they<00:05:50.570> both

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
two people and oddly enough they both

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.370 
two people and oddly enough they both
have<00:05:51.050> macbook<00:05:51.710> airs<00:05:51.979> so<00:05:52.900> people<00:05:53.900> with<00:05:53.990> macbook

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
have macbook airs so people with macbook

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.110 
have macbook airs so people with macbook
pros<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:54.919> imacs<00:05:55.039> haven't<00:05:55.699> seen<00:05:55.880> it<00:05:56.000> yet

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
pros and imacs haven't seen it yet

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.450 
pros and imacs haven't seen it yet
people's<00:05:56.750> MacBook<00:05:57.169> Airs<00:05:57.380> have<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.159> this<00:05:58.310> is<00:05:58.430> a

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
people's MacBook Airs have so this is a

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.510 
people's MacBook Airs have so this is a
little<00:05:58.699> weird<00:05:59.590> basically<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:00.919> game<00:06:01.130> looks

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
little weird basically the game looks

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.300 
little weird basically the game looks
like<00:06:01.849> this<00:06:02.539> and<00:06:02.990> this<00:06:03.530> reminds<00:06:03.919> me<00:06:03.949> of<00:06:04.070> the<00:06:04.159> bug

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
like this and this reminds me of the bug

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.219 
like this and this reminds me of the bug
reports<00:06:04.669> you<00:06:04.759> sometimes<00:06:05.180> get<00:06:05.389> with<00:06:05.930> a<00:06:05.990> form

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
reports you sometimes get with a form

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.839 
reports you sometimes get with a form
that<00:06:06.349> the<00:06:06.590> testers<00:06:07.070> are<00:06:07.099> required<00:06:07.580> to<00:06:07.639> fill

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
that the testers are required to fill

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.370 
that the testers are required to fill
that<00:06:07.909> will<00:06:08.419> have<00:06:08.570> things<00:06:08.780> like<00:06:08.900> observe

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
that will have things like observe

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.320 
that will have things like observe
behavior<00:06:09.560> and<00:06:10.130> then<00:06:10.250> the<00:06:10.370> expected<00:06:10.729> result

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
behavior and then the expected result

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.560 
behavior and then the expected result
and<00:06:12.250> really<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.370> expected<00:06:13.970> result<00:06:14.270> is<00:06:14.419> so

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
and really the expected result is so

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.820 
and really the expected result is so
obvious<00:06:15.050> but<00:06:15.199> they<00:06:15.289> have<00:06:15.409> to<00:06:15.440> fill<00:06:15.650> it<00:06:15.770> out

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
obvious but they have to fill it out

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.710 
obvious but they have to fill it out
anyway<00:06:16.220> so<00:06:16.250> it'll<00:06:16.639> be<00:06:16.699> like<00:06:16.789> observed

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
anyway so it'll be like observed

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.839 
anyway so it'll be like observed
behavior<00:06:17.900> the<00:06:18.409> game<00:06:18.590> crashes<00:06:18.889> expected

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
behavior the game crashes expected

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.659 
behavior the game crashes expected
behavior<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.630> game<00:06:20.780> doesn't<00:06:21.199> crash<00:06:21.680> yeah

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
behavior the game doesn't crash yeah

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.460 
behavior the game doesn't crash yeah
that's<00:06:22.880> pretty<00:06:23.030> obvious<00:06:23.240> so<00:06:24.050> in<00:06:24.139> this<00:06:24.229> case

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
that's pretty obvious so in this case

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.870 
that's pretty obvious so in this case
it's<00:06:24.710> kind<00:06:24.889> of<00:06:24.919> like<00:06:25.070> observed<00:06:25.729> behavior

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
it's kind of like observed behavior

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.860 
it's kind of like observed behavior
there's<00:06:26.750> no<00:06:26.930> stuff<00:06:27.520> expected<00:06:28.520> behavior<00:06:28.970> that

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
there's no stuff expected behavior that

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.200 
there's no stuff expected behavior that
there<00:06:30.229> should<00:06:30.380> be<00:06:30.500> stuff<00:06:30.860> and<00:06:31.370> this<00:06:31.940> is<00:06:32.090> where

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
there should be stuff and this is where

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.790 
there should be stuff and this is where
things<00:06:32.389> get<00:06:32.599> a<00:06:32.659> little<00:06:32.810> bit<00:06:32.960> dicey<00:06:33.139> because

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
things get a little bit dicey because

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.020 
things get a little bit dicey because
again<00:06:34.340> I

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
again I

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.060 
again I
can't<00:06:35.240> reproduce<00:06:35.510> this<00:06:35.840> locally<00:06:36.350> I<00:06:36.500> don't

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
can't reproduce this locally I don't

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.500 
can't reproduce this locally I don't
even<00:06:37.190> seem<00:06:37.490> to<00:06:37.580> have<00:06:37.670> the<00:06:37.760> hardware<00:06:38.000> to<00:06:38.240> do<00:06:38.360> it

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
even seem to have the hardware to do it

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.480 
even seem to have the hardware to do it
and<00:06:39.400> the<00:06:40.400> other<00:06:40.430> problem<00:06:41.060> is<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:42.020> problem

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
and the other problem is the problem

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.270 
and the other problem is the problem
could<00:06:43.490> lie<00:06:43.910> inside<00:06:44.600> mono<00:06:44.990> game<00:06:45.230> which<00:06:45.890> is<00:06:46.250> a

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
could lie inside mono game which is a

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.210 
could lie inside mono game which is a
little<00:06:46.550> tougher<00:06:46.970> to<00:06:47.090> diagnose<00:06:47.510> and<00:06:47.810> fix

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
little tougher to diagnose and fix

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.960 
little tougher to diagnose and fix
hopefully<00:06:49.220> it's<00:06:49.430> just<00:06:49.520> something<00:06:49.850> i'm

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
hopefully it's just something i'm

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.730 
hopefully it's just something i'm
screwed<00:06:50.180> up<00:06:50.300> on<00:06:50.450> my<00:06:50.600> end<00:06:50.780> and<00:06:50.990> i<00:06:51.140> will<00:06:51.530> be<00:06:51.560> able

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
screwed up on my end and i will be able

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.740 
screwed up on my end and i will be able
to<00:06:51.950> reproduce<00:06:52.700> it<00:06:53.030> or<00:06:53.210> at<00:06:53.270> least<00:06:53.300> figure<00:06:53.570> out

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
to reproduce it or at least figure out

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.570 
to reproduce it or at least figure out
what's<00:06:53.930> happening<00:06:54.260> without<00:06:55.010> having<00:06:55.370> to<00:06:55.490> do

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
what's happening without having to do

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.700 
what's happening without having to do
some<00:06:55.790> crazy<00:06:55.940> remote<00:06:56.420> debugging<00:06:56.840> but<00:06:57.590> yeah

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
some crazy remote debugging but yeah

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.860 
some crazy remote debugging but yeah
that's<00:06:58.220> my<00:06:58.400> challenge<00:06:58.640> for<00:06:59.000> today<00:06:59.210> fix<00:06:59.720> all
