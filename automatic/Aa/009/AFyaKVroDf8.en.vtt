00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.210
 beekeeping and today's video we 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.510
 tell you how we make spring 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:37.160
 feeding bees this 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:39.380
 stimulating use syrup in 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.770
 one-to-one sugar syrup ratio 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.750
 and with the addition 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.760
 cobalt vitamin supplements i mean i 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.730
 I will not call her name very much 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.770
 who knows this supplement vitamins go there 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.950
 composed of vitamins and cobalt means 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.390
 do we feed what the families in 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.159
 the number 4 5 times 300-500 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.979
 milliliters means to us for this 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.649
 I need to sit accordingly 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.200
 cooked with vitamins with these 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.570
 so here we have feeders for 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 we bought each family specifically 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.700
 liter such pebbles are very comfortable with them 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.420
 it is very convenient to use them 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.420
 These are the trough means measured 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.369
 cup here it is 300 milliliters i 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.130
 he drew such a world come on 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.680
 for three hundred miles it's home and chisel well in 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.770
 Basically all you say and even here yet 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.790
 see next to the trough lies such 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:46.939
 a piece of small thickness, we have planted a 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:49.610
 so here we have a bias already in 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.119
 feeding trough in this - but where is this hive not 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.439
 stands out and in order to avoid 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.560
 sour sugar syrup 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.700
 still stroking such a bar and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.180
 imagine the syrup goes exactly ours here 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.100
 here to these steps go and everything is here 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.069
 nothing remains and the bees all choose 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.860
 there remains a dry and clean feeder here 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.170
 such a process is our yes again 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.170
 I will say that in advance 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.900
 we have already prepared in advance 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.780
 every hive we have feeders to 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.930
 no running no jerking here we are 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:36.830
 prepared for each hive laid 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:43.100
 we just need to pour the syrup and 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:47.630
 put the hive well here we continue 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:54.010
 shoot our video on spring simulation 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:59.690
 spring stimulation in person take the cover 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.260
 we take a cushion of our dimarik be gone 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.070
 Choco smoke miracle here quietly 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.220
 don't bother them again 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:16.190
 laid the wand's here, yes that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:19.250
 told you we know our feeder like this 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:26.260
 all this is done under our dimensional 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.260
 300 milliliters pour a glass and 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.020
 a little bit of a little trickle 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:40.880
 that's what bees felt syrup and 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:44.980
 come here all close our faces 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.520
 the process is literally one two minutes 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.390
 there are no difficulties either 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.700
 dressing spring do it as I need 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.600
 already said said and repeat 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:06.610
 four to five times can be four times 500 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.610
 milliliters we do crucified at 300-350 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:15.800
 somewhere in this range what's next 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.800
 we shift on the next 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.530
 which already filmed video stories 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.460
 I'll tell you the video we have already held 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.669
 spring audit cel was this week 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.669
 two back means we did briefly 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:56.280
 I'll explain this as I just spoke to you 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:58.550
 there were nine frames so we did 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.550
 feed frames here with feeds 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.700
 force for composite board with 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.419
 insulation 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.290
 bees to the insulation and squeeze the nest here 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.419
 this family we have turned up to 7 frames 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.229
 we compress so that the club is maximally compressed 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:20.340
 that the bees were warm enough for them 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:23.520
 that is, that they grow brood then 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.700
 there is so that it was warm water it 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.020
 done every spring to build 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.460
 family strength 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.970
 Well, after a week after

 stopped 12 hours there is there over there on 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:18.419
 fishing line shows that small pieces of pollen

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:31.839
