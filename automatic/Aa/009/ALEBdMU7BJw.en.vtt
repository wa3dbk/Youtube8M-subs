the sound differences between having

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.760 
the sound differences between having
stock<00:00:03.600> parts<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.020> your<00:00:04.080> arcade<00:00:04.380> stick<00:00:04.589> from

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
having solid parts I've seen videos

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.870 
having solid parts I've seen videos
where<00:00:07.109> they<00:00:07.140> do<00:00:07.259> one<00:00:07.589> or<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.859> other<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.550> not

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.290 
where they do one or the other but not
really<00:00:09.240> both<00:00:10.309> as<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.460> can<00:00:11.580> hear<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> parts

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
really both as you can hear the parts

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.350 
really both as you can hear the parts
are<00:00:12.389> still<00:00:12.570> stock<00:00:12.809> parts<00:00:13.080> stick<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.219> still<00:00:14.429> in

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.000 
are still stock parts stick is still in
jail<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.990> stock<00:00:16.199> J<00:00:16.379> left<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.859> came<00:00:16.980> with

and the buttons aren't modded or it

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.630 
and the buttons aren't modded or it
aren't<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.869> silence<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.020> ones<00:00:22.279> since<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.430> is

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
aren't the silence on ones since this is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.300 
aren't the silence on ones since this is
a<00:00:23.670> sound<00:00:24.269> demonstration<00:00:24.960> here's<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> video<00:00:26.039> on

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
a sound demonstration here's a video on

00:00:26.310 --> 00:01:41.960 
a sound demonstration here's a video on
how<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.910> stock<00:00:27.150> parts<00:00:27.390> sound<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.900> action

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.309 

now<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.149> I've<00:01:43.240> put<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.569> inserts<00:01:43.899> inside<00:01:44.170> the

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
now that I've put the inserts inside the

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.559 
now that I've put the inserts inside the
buttons<00:01:44.649> and<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.310> TPM<00:01:45.759> a<00:01:45.909> has<00:01:46.119> been<00:01:46.270> switched

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
buttons and the TPM a has been switched

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.840 
buttons and the TPM a has been switched
to<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:47.020> Rollie<00:01:47.259> flash<00:01:47.560> one<00:01:47.799> let's<00:01:48.580> see<00:01:48.759> how

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
to the Rollie flash one let's see how

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.980 
to the Rollie flash one let's see how
these<00:01:49.000> sound<00:01:49.390> like<00:01:49.450> when<00:01:49.720> they're<00:01:49.869> being

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
these sound like when they're being

00:01:49.990 --> 00:02:56.500 
these sound like when they're being
played

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.090 

so<00:02:57.510> there's<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.050> significant<00:02:58.620> difference<00:02:58.950> in

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
so there's a significant difference in

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.370 
so there's a significant difference in
sound<00:02:59.340> or<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.180> think<00:03:00.330> when<00:03:00.780> comparing<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
sound or so I think when comparing the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.920 
sound or so I think when comparing the
two<00:03:01.730> there's<00:03:02.730> still<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> little<00:03:03.240> sound<00:03:03.630> coming

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
two there's still a little sound coming

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.660 
two there's still a little sound coming
from<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.140> joystick<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
from the joystick but that's just the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.000 
from the joystick but that's just the
actuator<00:03:06.090> hitting<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.390> restricted<00:03:07.050> gate<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
actuator hitting the restricted gate the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.320 
actuator hitting the restricted gate the
sound<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.370> be<00:03:08.490> easily<00:03:08.610> jond<00:03:08.940> out<00:03:09.120> by<00:03:09.270> the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
sound can be easily jond out by the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.730 
sound can be easily jond out by the
background<00:03:09.570> noises<00:03:09.930> especially<00:03:10.560> when<00:03:10.650> you're

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
background noises especially when you're

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.320 
background noises especially when you're
playing<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.100> tournament<00:03:11.220> people<00:03:12.060> are<00:03:12.150> quite

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
playing in a tournament people are quite

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.970 
playing in a tournament people are quite
loud<00:03:12.510> they're<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.960> button<00:03:13.230> although<00:03:13.500> not<00:03:13.830> as

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
loud they're the button although not as

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.440 
loud they're the button although not as
quiet<00:03:14.190> still<00:03:14.520> has<00:03:14.670> its<00:03:14.820> sound<00:03:15.090> muffled<00:03:17.450> so

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
quiet still has its sound muffled so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.730 
quiet still has its sound muffled so
hopefully<00:03:18.960> that<00:03:19.110> will<00:03:19.200> help<00:03:19.290> out<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.590> long

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
hopefully that will help out in the long

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.930 
hopefully that will help out in the long
run<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.100> big<00:03:20.430> question<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.760> wanna<00:03:20.880> ask

it worth in the long run you also have
to<00:03:26.310> think<00:03:26.370> about<00:03:26.520> playing<00:03:26.850> competitively<00:03:27.330> for

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
to think about playing competitively for

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.330 
to think about playing competitively for
a<00:03:28.080> casual<00:03:28.440> play<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:28.770> alright<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.250> the
