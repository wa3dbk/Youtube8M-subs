00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.400 
you please so you can use this
strategically<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.700> cut<00:02:11.879> off<00:02:12.030> your

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
strategically to cut off your

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.110 
strategically to cut off your
opponents<00:02:13.840> or<00:02:14.840> just<00:02:15.440> full<00:02:15.770> out<00:02:15.950> run<00:02:16.850> right

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
opponents or just full out run right

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.380 
opponents or just full out run right
into<00:02:17.150> them<00:02:18.310> you'll<00:02:19.310> see<00:02:19.400> i'm<00:02:19.670> falling<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.210> bit

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
into them you'll see i'm falling a bit

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.410 
into them you'll see i'm falling a bit
behind<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.710> other<00:02:22.040> player<00:02:22.400> ends<00:02:23.330> up

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
behind but the other player ends up

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.740 
behind but the other player ends up
doing<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.750> u-turn<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.730> i<00:02:25.730> go<00:02:26.060> flying<00:02:26.420> into<00:02:26.570> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
doing a u-turn and i go flying into the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.930 
doing a u-turn and i go flying into the
crowd<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.380> i<00:02:27.410> figure<00:02:27.740> it's<00:02:27.860> about<00:02:27.980> time<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
crowd so i figure it's about time to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.540 
crowd so i figure it's about time to
switch<00:02:29.210> my<00:02:29.390> car<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.190> that's<00:02:31.190> what<00:02:31.340> i<00:02:31.400> was

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
switch my car and that's what i was

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.190 
switch my car and that's what i was
talking<00:02:31.730> about<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.270> actually<00:02:32.570> switch<00:02:32.960> to

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
talking about you can actually switch to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.240 
talking about you can actually switch to
any<00:02:33.410> car<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.190> map<00:02:35.050> which<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.230> i<00:02:36.560> mean<00:02:36.980> it

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
any car on the map which is i mean it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.910 
any car on the map which is i mean it
makes<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.150> interesting<00:02:38.570> it's<00:02:39.020> it's<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.710> nice

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
makes it interesting it's it's a nice

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.530 
makes it interesting it's it's a nice

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
head straight to the freeway the reason

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.820 
head straight to the freeway the reason
i'm<00:02:46.790> going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.300> freeway<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.500> it's

i'm going to the freeway is because it's

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.610 
i'm going to the freeway is because it's
much<00:02:49.370> more<00:02:50.000> difficult<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.900> catch<00:02:51.200> people

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
much more difficult to catch people

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.620 
much more difficult to catch people
while<00:02:51.770> they're<00:02:51.860> on<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.070> freeway<00:02:52.630> because

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
while they're on the freeway because

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.750 
while they're on the freeway because
when<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.900> switch<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.470> another<00:02:54.680> card<00:02:55.100> you

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
when you switch to another card you

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.400 
when you switch to another card you
don't<00:02:55.910> start<00:02:56.270> off<00:02:56.420> very<00:02:56.450> fast<00:02:56.990> you're<00:02:57.290> only

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
don't start off very fast you're only

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.020 
don't start off very fast you're only
going<00:02:57.680> as<00:02:57.830> fast<00:02:58.040> as<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.340> car<00:02:58.580> was<00:02:58.730> already

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
going as fast as that car was already

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.230 
going as fast as that car was already
going<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.980> on<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.220> freeway<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.730> basically

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
going so on the freeway you basically

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.390 
going so on the freeway you basically
have<00:03:02.450> two<00:03:02.720> options<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.410> catch<00:03:03.590> someone<00:03:04.040> if

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
have two options to catch someone if

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.570 
have two options to catch someone if
they're<00:03:04.700> not<00:03:04.850> going<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.240> crash<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:07.430> can

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
they're not going to crash you can

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.910 
they're not going to crash you can
either<00:03:07.730> choose<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.420> car<00:03:08.720> that's<00:03:08.930> significantly

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
either choose a car that's significantly

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.150 
either choose a car that's significantly
further<00:03:10.250> up<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.730> try<00:03:11.210> and<00:03:11.560> kind<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.710> adjust

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
further up and try and kind of adjust

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.210 
further up and try and kind of adjust
your<00:03:13.370> speed<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.760> meet<00:03:14.150> there's<00:03:14.890> just<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:16.040> bit

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
your speed to meet there's just a bit

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.100 
your speed to meet there's just a bit
slower<00:03:16.520> so<00:03:16.820> they<00:03:16.940> can<00:03:17.120> catch<00:03:17.330> up<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.810> but<00:03:18.080> i

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
slower so they can catch up to you but i

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.130 
slower so they can catch up to you but i
love<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.410> time<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.910> car<00:03:20.390> with<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.660> flag<00:03:20.900> will

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
love the time the car with the flag will

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.990 
love the time the car with the flag will

nothing<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:24.350> other<00:03:25.220> kind<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.940> way<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.750> can

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
nothing the other kind of way you can

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.710

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
take the flag from them is by choosing a

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.780 
take the flag from them is by choosing a
car<00:03:29.990> that's<00:03:30.140> actually<00:03:30.530> heading<00:03:31.010> towards<00:03:31.550> them

car that's actually heading towards them
and<00:03:32.740> by<00:03:33.740> doing<00:03:33.950> this<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.340> either<00:03:34.400> want<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.760> cut

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
and by doing this you either want to cut

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.480 
and by doing this you either want to cut
them<00:03:35.240> off<00:03:35.450> or<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.940> want<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.240> head-on<00:03:38.600> collision

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
which is also very difficult which is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.280 
which is also very difficult which is
why<00:03:43.100> i'm<00:03:43.370> heading<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.060> freeway<00:03:44.450> you'll
