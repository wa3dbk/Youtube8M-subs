place<00:02:22.120> these<00:02:23.120> staff<00:02:23.450> was<00:02:23.720> trained<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.530> very

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
place these staff was trained in a very

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.500 
place these staff was trained in a very
very<00:02:24.800> short<00:02:24.950> time<00:02:25.400> we<00:02:25.610> recently<00:02:25.940> brought<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.450> a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
very short time we recently brought in a

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.420 
very short time we recently brought in a
new<00:02:26.540> doctor<00:02:27.110> that<00:02:27.260> didn't<00:02:27.530> even<00:02:27.830> need<00:02:28.010> formal

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
new doctor that didn't even need formal

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.280 
new doctor that didn't even need formal
training<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:29.360> know<00:02:29.510> we<00:02:29.660> just<00:02:29.840> showed<00:02:30.110> her

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
training you know we just showed her

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.490 
training you know we just showed her
basically<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.550> know<00:02:31.640> what<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.940> do<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.500> and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
basically you know what to do and and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.190 
basically you know what to do and and
she<00:02:33.980> went<00:02:34.100> live<00:02:34.340> with<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.640> right<00:02:34.760> away<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
she went live with it right away the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.370 
she went live with it right away the
beauty<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.740> system<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:39.320> don't

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
beauty of the system is that you don't

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.170 
beauty of the system is that you don't
have<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.710> worry<00:02:39.890> about<00:02:40.040> partners<00:02:40.640> handwriting

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
have to worry about partners handwriting

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.590 
have to worry about partners handwriting
anymore<00:02:41.600> which<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.680> big<00:02:42.950> advantage<00:02:43.600> but

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
anymore which is a big advantage but

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.330 
anymore which is a big advantage but
basically<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.140> system<00:02:45.500> allows<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:46.100> to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
basically the system allows you to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.890 
basically the system allows you to
practice<00:02:46.640> exactly<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.570> way<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.750> were

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
practice exactly the way you were

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.080 
practice exactly the way you were
practicing<00:02:48.350> before<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:49.520> have<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.790> choice<00:02:50.030> you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
practicing before you have a choice you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.960 
practicing before you have a choice you
need<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.570> follow<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.770> formats<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.910> are

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
need to follow the the formats that are

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.810 
need to follow the the formats that are
set<00:02:53.240> up<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:54.050> handwrite<00:02:54.410> or<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.520> type

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
set up you can handwrite or you can type

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.120 
set up you can handwrite or you can type
you<00:02:56.450> know<00:02:56.570> your<00:02:56.840> notes<00:02:57.080> whichever<00:02:57.890> way<00:02:58.070> you

you know your notes whichever way you

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.920 
you know your notes whichever way you
choose<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.570> all<00:03:00.140> works<00:03:01.300> at<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.450> beginning

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930

stats are in the same day directly from
the<00:03:42.860> labs<00:03:43.299> well<00:03:44.299> all<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.049> reports<00:03:45.560> are<00:03:45.799> in<00:03:46.220> in

a<00:03:46.459> timely<00:03:46.730> way<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.299> as<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> result<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.500> makes<00:03:48.680> us

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
a timely way and as a result it makes us

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.110 
a timely way and as a result it makes us
better<00:03:48.920> ducks<00:03:49.280> because<00:03:49.640> we're<00:03:49.790> calling

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
better ducks because we're calling

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.380 
better ducks because we're calling
patients<00:03:50.510> back<00:03:50.690> with<00:03:50.900> results<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.760> know<00:03:52.940> in<00:03:53.269> a

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
patients back with results you know in a

patients back with results you know in a
very<00:03:53.720> very<00:03:54.250> efficient<00:03:55.250> manner<00:03:55.640> which<00:03:56.330> by<00:03:56.720> the

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
very very efficient manner which by the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.890 
very very efficient manner which by the
way<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:57.049> presses<00:03:57.410> patients<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.940> labs<00:03:59.330> you

timely way but they also come in in the
same<00:04:05.870> format<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.860> know<00:04:06.950> before<00:04:07.130> we<00:04:07.549> work<00:04:08.209> with

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
same format you know before we work with

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.450 
same format you know before we work with
four<00:04:08.660> different<00:04:08.840> labs<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:09.650> it's<00:04:10.519> easy<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:11.000> use

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
four different labs and it's easy to use

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.300 
four different labs and it's easy to use
easy<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.510> adapt<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:13.890> that's<00:04:14.070> another
