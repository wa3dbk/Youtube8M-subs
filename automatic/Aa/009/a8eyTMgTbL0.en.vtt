00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.709 
get some Loctite take the wheel off
we'll<00:00:14.759> run<00:00:14.940> through<00:00:15.059> how<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> take<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> wheel

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
we'll run through how to take the wheel

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.380 
we'll run through how to take the wheel
off<00:00:15.900> quickly<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.550> with<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.699> lock<00:00:17.910> type<00:00:18.150> just

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
off quickly and with that lock type just

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.670 
off quickly and with that lock type just
drop<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> little<00:00:18.810> bit<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.050> Loctite<00:00:19.199> on<00:00:19.529> there

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
drop a little bit of Loctite on there

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.050 
drop a little bit of Loctite on there
and<00:00:19.770> then<00:00:19.890> tighten<00:00:20.100> these<00:00:20.340> back<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.880> some

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and then tighten these back up with some

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.750 
and then tighten these back up with some
ten<00:00:21.270> mil<00:00:21.449> nuts<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.410> there<00:00:22.680> spanners<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.279> that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
ten mil nuts and there spanners and that

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.859 
ten mil nuts and there spanners and that
should<00:00:23.939> stop<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.210> from<00:00:24.390> moving<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
should stop that from moving in the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.420 
should stop that from moving in the
future<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.380> we'll<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.769> do<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> joke

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
future so we'll just do that as a joke

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.470 
future so we'll just do that as a joke
eh<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:26.760> we're<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> remove<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> tire

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
eh so we're going to remove the tire

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.340 
eh so we're going to remove the tire
which<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.510> nice<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.019> easy<00:00:35.329> there<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.390> two

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
which is nice and easy there are two

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
which is nice and easy there are two
washers<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.700> easier<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.360> this

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
washers and it's easier if you do this

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.139 
washers and it's easier if you do this
one<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> ground<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:41.340> wash<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.700> look<00:00:41.850> after

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
one on the ground to wash it look after

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.010 
one on the ground to wash it look after
those<00:00:42.300> washers<00:00:43.250> grab<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.489> wheel<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.020> kinda

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
those washers grab the wheel and kinda

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.360 
those washers grab the wheel and kinda
work<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.950> up

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
work it up

and<00:01:33.250> there<00:01:33.400> we<00:01:33.549> go<00:01:33.700> these<00:01:33.940> are<00:01:34.000> start<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.390> come

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
and there we go these are start to come

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.490 
and there we go these are start to come
loose<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:38.250> we'll<00:01:39.250> leave<00:01:39.400> all<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:41.229> all<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
loose so we'll leave all the the all the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.080 
loose so we'll leave all the the all the
washers<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:41.890> everything<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.400> there<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.790> I

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
washers and everything on there and I

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.740 
washers and everything on there and I
would<00:01:46.360> take<00:01:46.570> three<00:01:47.020> off<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.500> start<00:01:47.800> with<00:01:48.070> I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
would take three off to start with I

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.910 
would take three off to start with I
leave<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.869> last<00:01:50.050> one<00:01:50.320> just<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.619> hold<00:01:50.770> the

casing<00:01:51.310> on<00:01:51.430> line<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:54.009> then<00:01:54.130> we'll<00:01:54.280> do<00:01:54.369> that

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
casing on line and then we'll do that

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.870 
casing on line and then we'll do that
one<00:01:54.700> separately<00:01:55.119> in<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.299> moment<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:57.009> with<00:01:57.729> your

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
lock tight that's not super glue that's

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.669 
lock tight that's not super glue that's
a<00:02:02.289> lock<00:02:02.470> tight<00:02:03.539> place<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.720> drop<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:08.500> like

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
a lock tight place the drop just like

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:18.759 
a lock tight place the drop just like
that<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:11.500> each<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.759 

each<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.069> bolts<00:02:20.280> there<00:02:22.849> okay<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.590> then

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
each of the bolts there okay and then

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.740 
each of the bolts there okay and then
with<00:02:25.980> your<00:02:26.989> spanner<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:29.700> reverse<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
with your spanner just reverse the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.229 
with your spanner just reverse the
procedure<00:02:32.599> turn<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.810> back<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.260> what<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:39.090> can

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
procedure turn that back to what you can

we're very happy with in previous videos
we<00:05:24.860> used<00:05:25.790> to<00:05:25.880> take<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.210> tie<00:05:26.360> down<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:26.750> peel

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
we used to take the tie down and peel

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.440 
we used to take the tie down and peel
the<00:05:27.050> tire<00:05:27.320> back<00:05:27.620> but<00:05:28.490> we<00:05:28.610> kind<00:05:28.850> of<00:05:28.970> worked<00:05:29.150> out

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
the tire back but we kind of worked out

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
the tire back but we kind of worked out
that<00:05:29.690> if<00:05:29.750> we<00:05:30.040> leave<00:05:31.040> everything<00:05:31.340> connected

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
that if we leave everything connected

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.540 
that if we leave everything connected
it's<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.530> little<00:05:33.770> like<00:05:33.860> changing<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:34.340> belt

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
off but you can inspect the belt and the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.360 
off but you can inspect the belt and the
belt<00:05:38.210> is<00:05:38.510> very<00:05:38.570> good<00:05:38.960> we're<00:05:39.800> going<00:05:39.980> to<00:05:40.160> just
