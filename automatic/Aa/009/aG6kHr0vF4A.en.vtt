we<00:01:21.100> think<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.910> gaming<00:01:22.240> market<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:22.750> huge<00:01:23.410> and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
we think the gaming market is huge and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.440 
we think the gaming market is huge and
he<00:01:24.070> actually<00:01:24.310> getting<00:01:24.640> bigger<00:01:24.910> than<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.390> is

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
he actually getting bigger than it is

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.960 
he actually getting bigger than it is
today<00:01:25.630> oh<00:01:25.960> it's<00:01:26.320> ridiculous<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.130> now<00:01:27.400> so<00:01:27.820> this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
today oh it's ridiculous and now so this

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.720 
today oh it's ridiculous and now so this
is<00:01:28.180> definitely<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:29.110> console<00:01:29.920> do<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.430> call<00:01:30.610> this

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
a console do you call it a computer I

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.930 
a console do you call it a computer I
mean<00:01:32.770> they're<00:01:33.100> essentially<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.730> same<00:01:33.880> thing

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940

you<00:02:03.130> can<00:02:03.280> buy<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.550> on<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.760> pc<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.300> you<00:02:04.390> can<00:02:04.510> buy

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
you can buy it on a pc and you can buy

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.870 
you can buy it on a pc and you can buy
it<00:02:04.720> for<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.140> console<00:02:05.650> but<00:02:06.460> they're<00:02:06.759> not

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
it for a console but they're not
