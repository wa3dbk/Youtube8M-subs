00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 do not 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello in this video in collaboration with 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.760
 Picture bleu I'll show you how to make 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.010
 a very very easy case for your laptop 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.810
 and by modifying the measurements you can 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.930
 use it also as a cover for a 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.210
 tablet or for any other device 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.769
 The materials that I will use are a 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.009
 piece of leatherette and a piece of a 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.079
 tissue that is as soft as possible I 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.060
 in this case what I have done has been 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.150
 pick up a fleece fabric and 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.430
 attach it to a piece of cotton wadding what 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.950
 I have stuck with a textile glue that does not 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 it is especially strong that it is a 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.170
 glue to know that it is not 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.720
 very well stuck but it is a glue 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.350
 temporary so that it serves me of subjection 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.540
 while I sew the piece to know the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.240
 size that we're going to need what 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.790
 you have to do is take the device 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.140
 what are you going to use in my case what 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.140
 I want for the laptop 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.020
 and what you have to see is that you over 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.900
 6 following this part from here to the edge 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.240
 You have to see that you get about 4 or 5 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.060
 centimeters on each side 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.190
 except this of course around here 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.180
 here and this part of here has you 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.800
 that left about four or five 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.040
 centimeters is always better than us 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.810
 about not missing us 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.570
 first of all what I 'm going to do is 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.540
 Sew the lining part what I will do 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.060
 will be put 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.070
 the right against the right that the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.580
 right that I have chosen is the part 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.490
 gray fleece I'll put it right 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.550
 with a right and I'll make some seams 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.500
 simply by the edges to be a 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.670
 pretty thick piece sew 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.040
 approximately one and a half centimeters 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.500
 or two centimeters from the edge and only 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.140
 on both sides leaving a 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.660
 opening and on one of the sides you have 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.910
 have to be careful to leave a 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.830
 space of approximately 10 or 12 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.140
 centimeters to be able to then give the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.180
 return 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.910
 for the poly skin we will do the same 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.940
 operation with the proviso that I'm going to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.220
 they are going to put an application of the logo of 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.790
 chita look on one side what 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.240
 I'll put it like this with the police in shape 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.210
 simple of course 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.210
 I'll put it like that and make a zig stitch 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.450
 zag all around for me to stay 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.970
 well caught and once you have done it 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.370
 I will put right with right 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.960
 and I will also be on both sides in 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.330
 this case does not need to leave any 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.850
 opening 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.310
 once the two parties are cooked both the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.070
 outside as the part of the lining I 've 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.660
 turned around the part of the outside and 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.120
 instead, the lining has left the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.930
 backwards now what I have to do is 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.930
 Introduce 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.430
 the outside inside the lining 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.000
 make the corners fit the 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.000
 background 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.500
 and now what I have to do is pass 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.960
 to the machine to make a seam by 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.540
 all the tubular shaped edge as if 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.200
 was the bottom of a pair of pants has already 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.700
 happened to all this edge posture if 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.590
 you have not done it before I recommend you 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.070
 you use a press double fabrics 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.860
 drag to for this work on 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.920
 all because here I have already used three 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.240
 layers the wadding the fleece and the poly 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.680
 skin and it's too thick for so 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.959
 pass through the machine especially if the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.870
 yours does not have much power now 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.209
 this hole that we had left I'm going to 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.630
 go pulling out what is outside of the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.630
 sheath 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.069
 once turned around first 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.590
 you will have to close this hole with a 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.220
 hidden stitch and once that's done 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.700
 you have to put the part of the lining towards 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.700
 inside 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.520
 matching the corners well 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.580
 from the inside with the outside 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.420
 yes and now for a better finish 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.460
 we will perfectly place this seam 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.620
 perfectly stretched and we will pass a 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.320
 new seam on this edge reminds 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.290
 please the dam double fabrics 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.389
 drag once we have passed this 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.580
 Edge stitching we already have our 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.980
 finished piece you see that the finish is 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.860
 super professional and being some fabrics 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.860
 so thick has been enough 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.270
 tight so that although 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.169
 although we had left at the beginning 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.520
 quite on the edges you see that it has 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.520
 stayed super just 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.690
 so that it protects us perfectly 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.370
 the laptop if it has seemed useful to you 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.120
 I like it and subscribe to my channel to 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.569
