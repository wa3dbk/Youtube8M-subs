00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello welcome to a new video of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 craft channel in this 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.960
 I want to teach you how to make a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.599
 broom with plastic bottles we will use 5 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.730
 large plastic bottles a 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:25.230
 pliers a cutter a wire scissors with 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.130
 to tie like this for example the stick 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.710
 for the broom 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.829
 and finally a rod to do 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.860
 hollows the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 with the cutter and the scissors cut the 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.920
 bottle in this part completely 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.420
 and then we are going to remind you of this part 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.610
 to the field we are also going to give you the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:59.120
 full turn we will eliminate that 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.339
 part past those edges and we're going to 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.070
 do the same procedure to three 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:08.270
 bottles plus a total of four bottles 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.280
 we are going to cut them in the same way 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.590
 after they're already cut we're going 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.579
 to take out the fringes we are going to cut 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.080
 until here we are going to make cuts 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.260
 upwards 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 not very wide 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:38.920
 not too narrow that we have something left 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.370
 so here I already have a finished list 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.430
 how are we going to do this to all 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.600
 is 4 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 then to a fifth bottle that we're going to 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.360
 cut this part of here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 let's go around cutting the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 and we're going to use this part then 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:14.049
 we will do and we have 4 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.910
 to do this is through funnel 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.950
 inside the fringes 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.120
 and we 're going to pull it back 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.400
 thus 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.569
 ay cross and do not cross 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.110
 here we are going to place a second bottle 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.110
 fringes 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.780
 let's climb above the other let 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.780
 with a third 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:55.909
 let's go back we'll help a little 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:59.470
 with the other hand and ready and then we're going to 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.470
 place the fourth and last 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.870
 very well to continue to be later with 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.430
 We will open the hot rod 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.090
 holes going through all the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.829
 bottles so that after with the wire 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.829
 you go through there 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:28.630
 let's double cut the excess and 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.240
 with the pliers we are going to twist for 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.760
 secure all the bottles and that 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.000
 do not miss us at this point 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.760
 we have already finished that I have put four 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.550
 moorings as you can see to hold it 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.480
 better then what we are going to do is 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.480
 place the stick 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.440
 and in this part of here will be a 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.520
 nail to secure well and that has been 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.300
 everything basically 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.400
 I hope you liked the video and we 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.400
 we see in a next tutorial
