00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
series or something but then i realized

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.899 
series or something but then i realized
that<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.100> wasn't<00:01:17.130> good<00:01:17.490> enough<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.790> do

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
that it just wasn't good enough to do

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.310 
that it just wasn't good enough to do
that<00:01:17.939> watch<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.810> bit<00:01:19.939> yeah<00:01:21.020> this<00:01:22.020> isn't<00:01:22.170> if

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that watch this bit yeah this isn't if

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.050 
that watch this bit yeah this isn't if
you<00:01:22.439> were<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.280> shoot<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.729> somebody<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you were if you shoot at somebody and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.280 
you were if you shoot at somebody and
miss<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> don't<00:01:24.780> kill<00:01:24.990> them<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
miss them right you don't kill them and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.510 
miss them right you don't kill them and
then<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.680> run<00:01:25.860> around<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> corner<00:01:26.430> it's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then they run around the corner it's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.719 
then they run around the corner it's
probably<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.570> good<00:01:27.630> idea<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> follow<00:01:28.439> them

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
probably a good idea not to follow them

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.380 
probably a good idea not to follow them
probably<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:29.909> they're<00:01:30.000> probably<00:01:30.150> lying

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
probably because they're probably lying

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.999 
probably because they're probably lying
on<00:01:30.570> their<00:01:30.689> lying<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.380> their<00:01:31.470> belly<00:01:31.680> waiting

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
annoying if you get all the way to the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.069 
annoying if you get all the way to the
top<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.090> them<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.359> then<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.600> get<00:03:18.690> elk<00:03:18.930> hills

think<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.289> last<00:04:57.439> one<00:04:57.529> was<00:04:57.650> about<00:04:57.740> spanking<00:04:58.490> in

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
think the last one was about spanking in

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.390 
think the last one was about spanking in
front<00:04:58.819> of<00:04:58.909> a<00:04:58.939> window<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.449> it<00:05:00.159> probably<00:05:01.159> not<00:05:01.370> a

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
front of a window so it probably not a

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.700
