steaming is something that a lot of

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.240 
steaming is something that a lot of
people<00:00:06.839> overcomplicate<00:00:07.259> there's<00:00:07.919> basically

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
people overcomplicate there's basically

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.860 
people overcomplicate there's basically
three<00:00:08.340> things<00:00:08.940> you're<00:00:09.300> doing<00:00:09.540> when<00:00:09.780> you're

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
three things you're doing when you're

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.660 
three things you're doing when you're
seeing<00:00:10.170> milk<00:00:10.500> you're<00:00:10.710> adding<00:00:11.040> heat<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
seeing milk you're adding heat to the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.400 
seeing milk you're adding heat to the
milk<00:00:11.849> you're<00:00:12.059> introducing<00:00:12.719> air<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.200> milk

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
milk you're introducing air to the milk

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.049 
milk you're introducing air to the milk
or<00:00:13.620> stretching<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.370> as<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.610> people<00:00:14.700> like<00:00:14.849> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
or stretching it as some people like to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.849 
or stretching it as some people like to
call<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.509> you're<00:00:16.049> spinning<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> milk<00:00:16.740> around

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
call and you're spinning the milk around

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.529 
call and you're spinning the milk around
and<00:00:17.220> around<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.670> pitcher<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.240> some<00:00:18.480> people

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and around in the pitcher so some people

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.990 
and around in the pitcher so some people
call<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.109> vortex<00:00:19.609> whirlpool<00:00:20.609> whatever

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
call that the vortex whirlpool whatever

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
call that the vortex whirlpool whatever
I<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.300> vortex<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.930> sounds<00:00:22.289> hotter<00:00:22.470> it's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I like vortex that sounds hotter it's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.170 
I like vortex that sounds hotter it's
important<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> portion<00:00:23.670> your<00:00:23.789> milk<00:00:24.000> out

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
important to portion your milk out

important to portion your milk out
correctly<00:00:24.689> if<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.900> use<00:00:25.080> way<00:00:25.350> too<00:00:25.380> much<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:26.099> not

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
correctly if you use way too much or not

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.470 
correctly if you use way too much or not
enough<00:00:26.250> you're<00:00:26.640> gonna<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.330> hard

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
enough you're gonna have a really hard

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.730 
enough you're gonna have a really hard
time<00:00:27.570> when<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> comes<00:00:28.140> down<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> pouring

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
time when it comes down to pouring

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.109 
time when it comes down to pouring
pattern<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.189> gonna<00:00:29.279> make<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> challenging

pattern it's gonna make it challenging

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.490 
pattern it's gonna make it challenging
once<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.689> got<00:00:30.779> our<00:00:30.900> milk<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.260> pitcher

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
once we got our milk in the pitcher

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.110 
once we got our milk in the pitcher
we're<00:00:31.679> gonna<00:00:31.769> go<00:00:31.949> ahead<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.430> position<00:00:32.579> our

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
we're gonna go ahead and position our

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760 
we're gonna go ahead and position our

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
pitcher on the steam wand so the heats

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
pitcher on the steam wand so the heats
of<00:00:50.610> freebee<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.210> put<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.539> thing<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
of freebee if we put this thing on the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.450 
of freebee if we put this thing on the
seen<00:00:52.199> wall<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.469> turn<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> steam<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.219> it's

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
seen wall and turn the steam one on it's

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.799 
seen wall and turn the steam one on it's
gonna<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.789> hot<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.180> by<00:00:54.329> itself<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.719> don't

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
gonna get hot all by itself we don't

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.240 
gonna get hot all by itself we don't
even<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
even really have to think about it the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.549 
even really have to think about it the
two<00:00:56.610> other<00:00:56.969> things<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.660> introduction<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.350> air

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
two other things the introduction of air

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.920 
two other things the introduction of air
and<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.039> vortex<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.850> all<00:01:00.090> dependent<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.690> how

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and that vortex are all dependent on how

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.330 
and that vortex are all dependent on how
we<00:01:00.989> position<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.710> thing<00:01:01.920> we're<00:01:02.100> gonna<00:01:02.219> look

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
we position this thing we're gonna look

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.979 
we position this thing we're gonna look
at<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> depth<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> steam<00:01:03.420> wand<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
at the depth of the steam wand in the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
at the depth of the steam wand in the
milk<00:01:04.229> off<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.820> then

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
milk off our in or out is it and then

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.340 
milk off our in or out is it and then
we're<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> look<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> position<00:01:07.260> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
we're going to look at the position of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
we're going to look at the position of
the<00:01:07.439> steam<00:01:07.680> wand<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.520> milk<00:01:08.729> picture<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the steam wand in the milk picture is it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.149 
the steam wand in the milk picture is it
on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> side<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> middle<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.830> want

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
on the side is it in the middle we want

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.370 
on the side is it in the middle we want
the<00:01:11.430> tip<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> steam<00:01:12.210> wand<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.780> halfway

the tip of the steam wand to be halfway

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.020 
the tip of the steam wand to be halfway
in<00:01:13.619> halfway<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> milk<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
in halfway out of the milk this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.490 
in halfway out of the milk this
positioning<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> ensure<00:01:16.110> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
positioning is going to ensure that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
positioning is going to ensure that
right<00:01:16.799> when<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.070> turn<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> steam<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.970> we're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
right when we turn the steam on on we're

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
right when we turn the steam on on we're
going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.810> suction<00:01:19.290> right<00:01:19.650> away

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
going to get that suction right away

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
going to get that suction right away
for<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> positioning<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
for the positioning of the one in the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.850 
for the positioning of the one in the
picture<00:01:22.020> we're<00:01:22.200> gonna<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> about<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
picture we're gonna have it about a

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
picture we're gonna have it about a
third<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.790> off<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.270> side<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.990> right

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
third of the way off this side not right

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.140 
third of the way off this side not right
in<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> center<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.250> slammed<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.909> against

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
in the center but not slammed up against

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.670 
in the center but not slammed up against
the<00:01:27.270> side<00:01:27.479> wall<00:01:27.509> either<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.470> we're<00:01:28.590> gonna

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the side wall either and we're gonna

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.499 
the side wall either and we're gonna
lean<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.280> pitcher<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:29.700> towards<00:01:30.180> us<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
lean the pitcher back towards us a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
lean the pitcher back towards us a
little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.229> positioning<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> gonna

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
little bit this positioning is gonna

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.130 
little bit this positioning is gonna
make<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> milk<00:01:32.640> wanna<00:01:32.850> spin<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.869> off<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
make the milk wanna spin right off the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.840 
make the milk wanna spin right off the
bat<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.680> once<00:01:34.890> we've<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.579> locked

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
bat so once we've got this thing locked

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.910 
bat so once we've got this thing locked
in<00:01:36.150> we're<00:01:36.630> gonna<00:01:36.720> focus<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> our<00:01:37.710> energy

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
in we're gonna focus all of our energy

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
in we're gonna focus all of our energy
into<00:01:38.400> keeping<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.119> spot<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.600> try<00:01:40.200> not

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
into keeping it in that spot and try not

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740 
into keeping it in that spot and try not
to<00:01:40.770> move<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.100> steaming<00:01:41.610> milk<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.939> definitely<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to move it steaming milk is definitely a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.020 
to move it steaming milk is definitely a
less-is-more<00:01:43.200> kind<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> deal<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.549> more<00:01:44.850> you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
less-is-more kind of deal the more you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.969 
less-is-more kind of deal the more you
move<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> picture<00:01:45.630> around<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.320> worse<00:01:46.710> your

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
move the picture around the worse your

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
move the picture around the worse your
texture<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> be

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
texture is going to be

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.880 
texture is going to be
to<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.630> locked<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.320> positioning

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
to get a locked into that positioning

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.289 
to get a locked into that positioning
and<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.130> turn<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> see<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and you turn to see one on you want to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.569 
and you turn to see one on you want to
keep<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.750> still<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.679> possible<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.460> we're

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
keep it as still as possible so we're

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.709 
keep it as still as possible so we're
gonna<00:01:53.670> take<00:01:53.820> whatever<00:01:54.030> hand<00:01:54.359> you're<00:01:54.509> most

sound<00:02:16.680> they<00:02:16.769> want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> move<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.280> picture

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
sound they want to move the picture

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.070 
sound they want to move the picture
around<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.180> try<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.360> manipulate<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:18.959> right

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
around and try to manipulate it right

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.720 
around and try to manipulate it right
away<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.319> leave<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.860> exactly<00:02:19.980> where<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.519> is

want<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.410> hear<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:35.040> sound<00:02:35.280> that's<00:02:35.760> too<00:02:35.940> much

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
want to hear just sound that's too much

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.059 
want to hear just sound that's too much
you're<00:02:36.390> blowing<00:02:36.750> out<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> milk<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.440> sure<00:02:37.620> way

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
you're blowing out the milk for sure way

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.220 
you're blowing out the milk for sure way
too<00:02:38.130> much<00:02:38.489> air<00:02:38.730> or<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.360> one<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.959> don't<00:02:40.079> hear

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
too much air or this one you don't hear

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.690 
too much air or this one you don't hear
anything<00:02:40.440> no<00:02:40.769> air<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.130> got<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.310> get<00:02:41.400> some<00:02:41.489> air

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
anything no air you got to get some air

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
anything no air you got to get some air
in<00:02:41.819> there<00:02:41.849> when<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.269> think<00:02:42.450> you've<00:02:42.540> got

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
in there when you think you've got

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.509 
in there when you think you've got
enough<00:02:42.750> air<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.530> want<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.769> take<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.310> picture

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
enough air you want to take that picture

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.580 
enough air you want to take that picture
and<00:02:44.880> move<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.299> up<00:02:45.420> on<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> steam<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.319> just

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and move it up on the steam on just

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.289 
and move it up on the steam on just
about<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:46.890> half<00:02:47.250> inch<00:02:47.489> we<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:47.970> want<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.209> make

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
about a half inch we just want to make

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.339 
about a half inch we just want to make
sure<00:02:48.329> that<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.720> tip<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.019> wants

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
sure that the tip of that wants

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.080 
sure that the tip of that wants
submerged<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.340> stop<00:02:50.760> introducing

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
submerged so that we stop introducing

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.300 
submerged so that we stop introducing
the<00:02:51.540> air<00:02:51.750> move<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.350> too<00:02:52.590> far<00:02:52.859> you'll<00:02:53.160> get<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
the air move it up too far you'll get a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.340 
the air move it up too far you'll get a
really<00:02:53.790> weird<00:02:54.120> vortex<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.810> they'll<00:02:54.959> start<00:02:55.290> to

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
really weird vortex and they'll start to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.650 
really weird vortex and they'll start to
rumble<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.190> it'll<00:02:56.370> look<00:02:56.549> awful<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.480> don't

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
rumble and it'll look awful you don't

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.640 
rumble and it'll look awful you don't
move<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.900> enough<00:02:58.139> you'll<00:02:58.350> keep<00:02:58.500> getting

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
move it enough you'll keep getting

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.319 
move it enough you'll keep getting
suction<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.430> keep<00:02:59.549> adding<00:02:59.790> air<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.180> your

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
suction and just keep adding air in your

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.180 
suction and just keep adding air in your
milk<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.690> really<00:03:01.049> fuzzy<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.769> once<00:03:01.950> we're<00:03:02.130> at

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
milk you really fuzzy so once we're at

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.710 
milk you really fuzzy so once we're at
this<00:03:02.310> point<00:03:02.519> we<00:03:02.940> should<00:03:02.970> hear<00:03:03.239> no<00:03:03.540> more

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
this point we should hear no more

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.180 
this point we should hear no more
introduction<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.350> air<00:03:04.560> but<00:03:04.829> we<00:03:04.889> should<00:03:05.040> still

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
introduction of air but we should still

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.770 
introduction of air but we should still
see<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.489> milk<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.850> around<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.359> around<00:03:06.450> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
see the milk going around and around and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.599 
see the milk going around and around and
around<00:03:06.870> what<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.530> vortex<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.160> doing<00:03:08.459> is

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
around what this vortex is doing is

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.160 
around what this vortex is doing is
taking<00:03:08.850> all<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.359> air<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.810> you've<00:03:09.930> added

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
taking all the air that you've added

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.870 
taking all the air that you've added
into<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> milk<00:03:10.799> kind<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.190> distributing<00:03:11.760> it

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
into the milk kind of distributing it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.580 
into the milk kind of distributing it
evenly<00:03:12.090> throughout<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.840> milk<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.500> you

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
evenly throughout the milk so that you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.920 
evenly throughout the milk so that you
get<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.739> nice<00:03:14.160> buttery<00:03:14.850> texture<00:03:15.329> if<00:03:15.720> you've

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
get that nice buttery texture if you've

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.379 
get that nice buttery texture if you've
got<00:03:16.109> only<00:03:16.530> air<00:03:16.739> but<00:03:17.099> no<00:03:17.310> vortex<00:03:17.670> you're<00:03:18.269> just

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
got only air but no vortex you're just

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.390 
got only air but no vortex you're just
going<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:18.690> separated<00:03:19.440> bubbly<00:03:19.980> milk<00:03:20.220> on

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
going to have separated bubbly milk on

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.220 
going to have separated bubbly milk on
top<00:03:20.609> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> liquid<00:03:21.060> milk<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:21.630> we've<00:03:21.810> got<00:03:21.959> all

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
top of the liquid milk if we've got all

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.319 
top of the liquid milk if we've got all
vortex<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:23.160> no<00:03:23.340> air<00:03:23.519> at<00:03:23.639> all<00:03:23.730> we're<00:03:24.209> just

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
vortex and no air at all we're just

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.030 
vortex and no air at all we're just
gonna<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.660> really<00:03:25.109> hot<00:03:25.260> milk<00:03:25.530> spinning

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
gonna have really hot milk spinning

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.900 
gonna have really hot milk spinning
around<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.459> around

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
around and around

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.180 
around and around
going<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.450> be<00:03:27.540> just<00:03:27.750> off<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.200> Black<00:03:28.500> Goat<00:03:28.890> kill

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
going to be just off the Black Goat kill

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.010 
going to be just off the Black Goat kill
the<00:03:29.310> introduction<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.880> air<00:03:30.090> still<00:03:30.750> got<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
the introduction of air still got the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.840 
the introduction of air still got the
vortex<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:31.950> we're<00:03:32.430> gonna<00:03:32.550> feel<00:03:32.820> for

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
vortex going and we're gonna feel for

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.910 
vortex going and we're gonna feel for
temperature<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.720> best<00:03:34.110> place<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.380> feel<00:03:34.710> for

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
temperature the best place to feel for

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.830 
temperature the best place to feel for
temperature<00:03:35.280> near<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.910> bottom<00:03:36.150> half<00:03:36.570> the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
temperature near the bottom half the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.210 
temperature near the bottom half the
picture<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.440> want<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.710> get<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.040> where<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
picture you want to get it to where you

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.310 
picture you want to get it to where you
can<00:03:38.370> just<00:03:38.400> about<00:03:39.180> touch<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.720> picture<00:03:39.870> for

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
can just about touch the picture for

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.500 
can just about touch the picture for
like<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> half<00:03:40.890> second<00:03:41.310> or<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.610> once<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.330> feel

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
like a half second or so once you feel

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.210 
like a half second or so once you feel
that<00:03:42.540> go<00:03:43.050> ahead<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.500> turn<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.800> steam<00:03:44.040> wand

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
that go ahead and turn the steam wand

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.800 
that go ahead and turn the steam wand
off<00:03:44.460> gauging<00:03:44.970> temp<00:03:45.210> will<00:03:45.390> take<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> little

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
off gauging temp will take a little

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.540 
off gauging temp will take a little
practice<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.740> little<00:03:46.860> getting<00:03:47.190> used<00:03:47.340> to

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
practice and a little getting used to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.070 
practice and a little getting used to
but<00:03:47.820> if<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.030> use<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.360> method<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.840> should<00:03:48.870> be

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
but if you use this method you should be

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.320 
but if you use this method you should be
right<00:03:49.290> around<00:03:49.410> 155<00:03:50.310> degrees<00:03:50.400> or<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:50.880> pull<00:03:51.240> the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
right around 155 degrees or so pull the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.690 
right around 155 degrees or so pull the
picture<00:03:51.510> off<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.050> wipin<00:03:52.980> her<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.280> steam<00:03:53.490> on

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
picture off and wipin her to steam on

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.670
