00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.179 
competition idea I've been gonna be I
didn't<00:01:27.990> even<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.229> he's<00:01:28.350> made<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.650> his<00:01:28.680> mind<00:01:28.799> now

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
didn't even if he's made up his mind now

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
didn't even if he's made up his mind now
he's<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.450> make<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.630> public<00:01:31.049> till

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
he's not going to make it public till

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.630 
he's not going to make it public till
the<00:01:31.290> end<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> exhibition<00:01:31.770> season<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.430> think

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the end of the exhibition season I think

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.010 
the end of the exhibition season I think
he's<00:01:32.729> gonna<00:01:32.850> keep<00:01:33.180> doing<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.780> way<00:01:33.840> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
he's gonna keep doing it this way I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.170 
he's gonna keep doing it this way I
think<00:01:34.229> he<00:01:34.500> likes<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.040> well<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
think he likes this well I think the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.480 
think he likes this well I think the
competition<00:01:36.869> was<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.530> goes<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.860> well<00:01:38.130> it'll<00:01:38.310> be

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
competition was it goes on well it'll be

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.980 
competition was it goes on well it'll be
very<00:01:38.610> clear<00:01:38.970> who<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> starter<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
very clear who the starter is and it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
very clear who the starter is and it
will<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.259> Matt<00:01:40.439> Flynn<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.979> said<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.000> after<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
will be Matt Flynn I said that after the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
will be Matt Flynn I said that after the
baby<00:01:42.570> boy<00:01:42.780> sure<00:01:43.079> looked<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.439> they<00:01:43.740> won't

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
baby boy sure looked like it they won't

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
baby boy sure looked like it they won't
I<00:01:44.130> mean<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.360> plan

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I mean I just think that was the plan

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.969 
I mean I just think that was the plan
going<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.500> call<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> whatever

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
going in and they can call it whatever

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.230 
going in and they can call it whatever
they<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.820> divide<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
they want and they can divide up the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
they want and they can divide up the
snaps<00:01:48.570> however<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:49.020> want<00:01:49.170> he's<00:01:50.009> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> be

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
snaps however they want he's going to be

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.130 
snaps however they want he's going to be
the<00:01:50.490> starter<00:01:50.850> boring<00:01:51.240> into<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> massive

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the starter boring into just a massive

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.270 
the starter boring into just a massive
collapse<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.689> yeah<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
collapse so but but yeah I do like the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.429 
collapse so but but yeah I do like the
idea<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.909> even<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.630> he's<00:01:57.810> got<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.320> his

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
idea that I even if he's got that in his

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.630 
idea that I even if he's got that in his
mind<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.219> gonna<00:01:59.340> stick<00:01:59.610> with
