what<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:32.850> using<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.570> am<00:00:33.780> using<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.440> iPhone<00:00:34.950> 4

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
what I'm using I am using the iPhone 4

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.420 
what I'm using I am using the iPhone 4
with<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> front-facing<00:00:36.660> camera<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
with the front-facing camera now as you

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.030 
with the front-facing camera now as you
can<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.660> black<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.899> white<00:00:40.140> so

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
can see this is in black and white so

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.639 
can see this is in black and white so
the<00:00:41.160> filter<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.640> set<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.030> Mono<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:43.260> effects

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the filter is set to Mono the effects

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
the filter is set to Mono the effects
are<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:43.920> none<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> mask<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.300> them<00:00:45.539> so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
are all none and the mask is on them so

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.069 
are all none and the mask is on them so
I<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:46.770> ahead<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.039> play<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.489> and

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
I would go ahead and play with this and

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
I would go ahead and play with this and
show<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.140> guys<00:00:49.289> exactly<00:00:49.500> all<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> different

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
show you guys exactly all the different

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.240 
show you guys exactly all the different
effects<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.449> app<00:00:51.629> has<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
effects that this app has so if you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.930 
effects that this app has so if you
click<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> dice<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.379> random

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.990 

that<00:00:58.940> one's<00:00:59.120> pretty<00:00:59.300> cool

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.690 

the<00:01:06.300> x-ray<00:01:06.870> fish<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.470> will<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:08.100> none

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.539 

so<00:01:11.299> these<00:01:12.259> are<00:01:12.500> different<00:01:12.920> effects<00:01:13.400> that<00:01:13.430> you

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
so these are different effects that you

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.030 
so these are different effects that you
can<00:01:13.580> even<00:01:13.820> add<00:01:14.119> into<00:01:14.630> your<00:01:14.659> beams

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.590 

now<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.880> add<00:01:21.090> different<00:01:21.720> frames

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
now you can add different frames

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.480 
now you can add different frames
crane<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.670> wanted<00:01:26.270> poster<00:01:27.490> the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
crane this is the wanted poster the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.630 
crane this is the wanted poster the
garden<00:01:28.910> sign

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.800 

this<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.120> monitor

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.580 

and<00:01:39.899> this<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> brick<00:01:41.490> wall<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:43.380> can

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and this is the brick wall so you can

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.429 
and this is the brick wall so you can
pick<00:01:44.509> from<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.780> these<00:01:46.439> different<00:01:47.270> facts<00:01:48.439> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
pick from all these different facts and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
pick from all these different facts and
you<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.490> into<00:01:50.939> your

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you know you can have you into your

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.310 
you know you can have you into your
videos<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.430> pretty<00:01:53.549> cool<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.320> I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
videos so these are pretty cool and I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.719

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
you guys out there but they're cool you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.850 
you guys out there but they're cool you
could<00:01:59.939> add<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.330> into<00:02:00.539> your<00:02:00.630> videos<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.350> they

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
could add them into your videos and they

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.969 
could add them into your videos and they
don't<00:02:02.070> take<00:02:02.280> much<00:02:02.460> time<00:02:02.729> at<00:02:02.909> all

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
don't take much time at all

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.850 
don't take much time at all
now<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.039> could<00:02:05.280> come<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.789> little<00:02:06.030> hard<00:02:06.860> that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
now you could come a little hard that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.309 
now you could come a little hard that
you<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.369> put<00:02:08.610> into

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.280 

a<00:02:13.609> video<00:02:14.609> and<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.230> know<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:16.650> would<00:02:16.829> be<00:02:16.859> great

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
a video and you know this would be great

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.770 
a video and you know this would be great
I<00:02:18.319> didn't<00:02:19.189> see<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.580> if<00:02:19.939> the<00:02:20.090> filter<00:02:20.480> set<00:02:20.689> on

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
I didn't see that if the filter set on

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.140 
I didn't see that if the filter set on
the<00:02:20.930> pencil<00:02:21.379> he<00:02:21.920> affects<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.430> set<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.760> mosaic

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
the pencil he affects a set of mosaic

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.600 
the pencil he affects a set of mosaic
and<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.319> mask<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.920> set<00:02:25.189> on

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
and the mask is set on

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.100 
and the mask is set on
so<00:02:28.370> I'm<00:02:29.370> gonna<00:02:29.520> hit<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.060> dice<00:02:30.450> again<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.020> go

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
so I'm gonna hit the dice again and go

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.340 
so I'm gonna hit the dice again and go
random<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.120> prequel<00:02:33.570> kind<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
random so that is prequel kind of like a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:43.089 
random so that is prequel kind of like a
cartoon<00:02:34.620> character

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.370 

now<00:02:43.609> that<00:02:43.999> is<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.269> coursework

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
now that is the coursework

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.760 
now that is the coursework
which<00:02:46.920> also<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:48.090> pretty<00:02:48.300> cool<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:49.650> has
