 parts of our body and we have a 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.630
 physical activity even at home with 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.070

 we have in the house can serve us 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.260
 what is the first good exercise 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.060
 first let's make a being a 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.770
 warm -up exercise is called 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.840
 jon pinj치s and we're going to do it for 30 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.250
 seconds to activate us a little bit to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.240
 activate our circulation of our 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.470
 body we should always do 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.240
 Warming up always needs to be done 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.430
 heating and also mobility 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.070
 articulate and then we start with the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.170
 exercises we are going to do three exercises 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.420
 and we're going to do four laps of the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.280
 exercises to make a circuit of 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.840
 four exercises of three seasons 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.700
 Monica then to warm up that is 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.650
 important then that's good 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.390
 next comes joint mobility 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.939
 which we are going to move our shoulders 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.860
 our arms our bottom and 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.010
 our top to be able to 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.720
 activate and start with the exercises not 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.790
 just like about two minutes to 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.290
 not only the joint movement and 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.840
 then let's start with the first 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.180
 exercise that is a squat we are going to 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.370
 look for a chair from our house and we 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.189
 let's locate in front of her what 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.750
 let's accommodate if we are going to take out the 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.750
 gluteus let's tighten our 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.720
 sit-ups and let's go down slowly 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.129
 doing 15 repetitions slowly then 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.590
 that we finished doing these 15 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.930
 repetitions we are going to do a lot in the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.239
 floor which we are going to place our 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.680
 our hands on the sea and the 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.169
 people who do not have much balance 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.780
 they are not very strong to make it 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.310
 listen to it is going to put it going to put your 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.710
 knee over the sea so you have 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.510
 more support and for experts they do 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.090
 without support this would be the second 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.030
 exercise the third exercise we are going to 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.380
 make glute the part that we like the most 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.400
 make women to take care of that 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.680
 part of our body 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.780
 let's raise our leg by squeezing 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 the gluteus up we're going to do this 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.139
 15 repetitions 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.870
 each leg that would be our third 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.750
 exercise then let's do four 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.880
 series of these three exercises for 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.020
 complete our exercise routine in 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.430
