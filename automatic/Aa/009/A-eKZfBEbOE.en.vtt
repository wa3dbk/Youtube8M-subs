00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.970 
feeling now say we go down to the bottom
holding<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.610> this<00:03:16.510> position<00:03:17.020> here<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.800> is

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
holding it in this position here this is

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.860 
holding it in this position here this is
going<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.340> mimic<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.760> half<00:03:18.970> squat<00:03:19.330> which<00:03:19.600> gets

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
going to mimic the half squat which gets

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.080 
going to mimic the half squat which gets
the<00:03:20.320> front<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.160> quads<00:03:21.430> which<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.790> can<00:03:21.940> do

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
the front of the quads which you can do

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.380 
the front of the quads which you can do
on<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.660> machine<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> gym<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.610> as<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.090> squat

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
on a machine in the gym so as I squat

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.090 
on a machine in the gym so as I squat
down<00:03:25.570> I'm<00:03:25.840> going<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.020> feel<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.470> majority<00:03:27.010> of

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
down I'm going to feel the majority of

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.640 
down I'm going to feel the majority of
that<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.310> going<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.610> be<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.820> front<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.420> my<00:03:29.260> legs

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
that is going to be the front of my legs

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.370 
that is going to be the front of my legs
like<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:29.920> okay

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
like so okay

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.150 
like so okay
then<00:03:32.380> we're<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.650> go<00:03:32.740> ahead<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.130> our

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
then we're going to go ahead and do our

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.670 
then we're going to go ahead and do our
overhead<00:03:33.820> squat<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.940> pressing<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.180> bell<00:03:37.330> up

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
overhead squat so pressing the bell up

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
overhead squat so pressing the bell up
as<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.860> squat<00:03:39.130> down

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
as I squat down

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.730 
as I squat down
I'm<00:03:40.390> going<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.690> rotate<00:03:40.840> my<00:03:42.030> rotate<00:03:43.030> my<00:03:43.180> chest

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
I'm going to rotate my rotate my chest

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.870 
I'm going to rotate my rotate my chest
toward<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:44.860> camera<00:03:45.370> on<00:03:45.550> my<00:03:45.640> head

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
toward the camera on my head

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.480 
toward the camera on my head
and<00:03:46.750> then<00:03:46.870> I'm<00:03:46.959> going<00:03:47.050> to<00:03:47.110> stand<00:03:47.410> up<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:48.400> you

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
and then I'm going to stand up so you

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.120 
and then I'm going to stand up so you
want<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.880> keep<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.240> torso<00:03:49.780> turned<00:03:50.410> because

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
want to keep that torso turned because

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.670 
want to keep that torso turned because
it's<00:03:51.430> almost<00:03:51.910> impossible<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.990> do<00:03:53.200> good<00:03:53.410> squat

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
it's almost impossible to do good squat

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.150 
it's almost impossible to do good squat
just<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.100> this<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:55.270> turning<00:03:56.100> in<00:03:57.100> that

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
just like this so turning in that

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.910 
just like this so turning in that
direction<00:03:57.490> and<00:03:58.120> then<00:03:58.959> coming<00:03:59.350> up<00:03:59.410> with<00:03:59.470> self

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
direction and then coming up with self

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.500 
direction and then coming up with self
so<00:04:00.820> that<00:04:00.850> way

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
so that way

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.900 
so that way
your<00:04:01.870> body<00:04:02.110> can<00:04:02.320> actually<00:04:02.410> move<00:04:02.920> more<00:04:03.490> freely

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
your body can actually move more freely

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.850 
your body can actually move more freely
instead<00:04:04.780> of<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.080> trying<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.380> hold<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.709> there

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
instead of you trying to hold it there

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.320 
instead of you trying to hold it there
and<00:04:05.980> do<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.130> squat<00:04:06.459> because<00:04:06.940> it's<00:04:07.120> more<00:04:07.300> than

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
and do a squat because it's more than

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.970 
and do a squat because it's more than
likely<00:04:07.600> this<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.350> going<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.560> want<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.830> come

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
likely this is going to want to come

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.490 
likely this is going to want to come
forward<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.610> see<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.239> at<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.480> gym<00:04:10.690> all<00:04:11.440> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
forward I see this at the gym all the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.010 
forward I see this at the gym all the
time<00:04:12.010> people<00:04:12.850> hold<00:04:13.209> kettlebell<00:04:13.660> like<00:04:13.810> this

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
time people hold kettlebell like this

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.229 
time people hold kettlebell like this
and<00:04:14.260> then<00:04:14.650> they<00:04:14.770> do<00:04:14.830> squats<00:04:15.250> like<00:04:15.430> this<00:04:15.670> so

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
and then they do squats like this so

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.240 
and then they do squats like this so
therefore<00:04:16.419> it's<00:04:17.169> starting<00:04:17.530> to

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
therefore it's starting to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.620 
therefore it's starting to
bring<00:04:18.640> this<00:04:18.760> forward<00:04:19.060> which<00:04:19.299> isn't<00:04:19.450> really

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
bring this forward which isn't really

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.320 
bring this forward which isn't really
good<00:04:19.930> on<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.200> shoulders<00:04:20.910> okay<00:04:21.910> so<00:04:21.970> then<00:04:22.210> we're

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
good on the shoulders okay so then we're

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.940 
good on the shoulders okay so then we're
going<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.570> go<00:04:22.720> ahead<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.050> do<00:04:23.140> now<00:04:23.530> if<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.800> can

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
going to go ahead and do now if you can

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.410 
going to go ahead and do now if you can
