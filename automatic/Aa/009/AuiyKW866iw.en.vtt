00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.910
 and how about youtube good friends here 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.280
 in this new video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.320
 today we are going to talk about installing 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.040
 nvidia graphics card drivers 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 geforce good first thing we're going to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.439
 do is going to be going to the club 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.199
 and we are going to put here in the search engine what 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.900
 that is being envied puntocom or nothing 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.020
 more and this is what they will give you is in 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 this option or directly between bears 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.630
 but let's go in the first option 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.060
 If they do not know English they can select the 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.950
 the language 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.630
 but good 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.150
 right now 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.860
 no need to select reverse 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.280
 drivers 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.150
 we're going to walk to the page there are two 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.320
 options 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.690
 there are two options can this do the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.540
 automatic detection of the driver that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.550
 Need or can be manual if you 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.830
 you know what they want and everything 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.330
 that 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.180
 this 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.070
 then you can select good in this 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.220
 case he asks me to run left 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.910
 for detection let's give it run 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.400
 this time 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.240
 [Music] 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.240
 we wait 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.520
 I take advantage of this in what we expected 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.520
 to tell them to visit my channel 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.890
 good 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.280
 I do not upload videos daily but 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.409
 I try to upload them 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.670
 [Music] 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.200
 well 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.200
 Well yes I hope to grow 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.229
 such anda of this inside ador we are going to 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.229
 wait 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.040
 good 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:16.030
 good these drivers what help 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.400
 is that if you want to download a 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.260
 good game good also dependence and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.460
 Your machine is powerful and they want 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.460
 download a good game 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.340
 and suddenly I marked them error and all that 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.739
 it's because your graphics card is 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.170
 traced well you know what is plotted 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.430
 or know that the update that has already 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.069
 it's not anymore it's not as good as it could be 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.319
 say current then this one 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.689
 the games do not have it as recognized 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.260
 so what this controller does is 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:51.920
 how to update it and when 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.540
 you write the game 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.989
 good here and we'll give adults 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.989
 text 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.210
 this is going to start to detect what kind of 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.300
 [Music] 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.740
 the type d 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.740
 drivers need 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:18.670
 well you have to wait a while 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.670
 this does not take long 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.680
 let's go here look at this hand we're going to 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.140
 wait for someone to automatically 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.420
 this one that says look for driver 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.989
 good manual here is for you already 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.959
 they know what kind of driver they need I do not know 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.860
 which direction to you this case 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.860
 mirage force 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.630
 in this case I am series 9 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.120
 giffords you good this we leave it 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.819
 say by default good since it's good 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.080
 selecting the good look trip for 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.280
 do not make us so 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.950
 well let's finish by the mere 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.290
 number with this here they boat good in 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.650
 this case I am windows 7 32 my compu 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.989
 is 32 bits and this service 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.250
 language in which they want the driver in 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.660
 this case I will select it 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:28.710
 Spanish and x2 are looking for me in this case 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:34.500
 I get this geforce 6150 s 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:36.539
 n force 430 that is here and here as 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.820
 can see in this part it says that already 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.210
 integrated graphs come 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.969
 look 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.489
 what is done 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.289
 good since you already appeared 

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:49.999
 this may be that you disappear 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.589
 another one also depends on the machine and the 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:55.159
 type of graphics card they have 

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:58.899
 you are going to give drive download and the 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.899
 goes and the page is going to update 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.379
 this does not take long 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.510
 but here comes everything says version 300 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:13.050
 7.30 74 sorry 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:16.230
 this was from June 24, 2013 good 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.750
 is going to update until that date is 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.500
 uncover the windows 7 32 bit system 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.540
 windows 8 32 bits windows view 32 bits 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.970
 the language is in spanish spain 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.940
 and the cold, well, I'm in 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.460
 Spain because the graphic card is 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.240
 integrated in that language 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.240
 All this 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.010
 well then you are going to give them 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.620
 yesterday guy let's download it 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.830
 they will give here 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:53.009
 and it will automatically start 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:56.909
 download in this case I no longer why 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:59.710
 and I already have it in cancel, I'm going to 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:02.480
 reach good 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.100
 here and then the 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.890
 procedure procedures is very 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.800
 easy should only give you continue to leave 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.240
 crystal and all that good makes account that 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.639
 what you did is on the page is 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.340
 everything practically 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.110
 here we are going to open what is being 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.110
 the folder of 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.990
 the controller 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.190
 a little 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.040
 and here is the nvidia control panel 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.690
 of the driver that we download as 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.470
 can see here says control panel of 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.969
 nvidia 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:09.199
 [Music]

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.020
 does not have as much important good but to 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.460
 you are going to be sending 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.660
 updates those updates go 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:26.230
 to serve for 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.240
