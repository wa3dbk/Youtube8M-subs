but she doesn't want to cut it one of

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.620 
but she doesn't want to cut it one of
the<00:00:30.189> reasons<00:00:30.579> why<00:00:30.700> I<00:00:30.730> feel<00:00:30.970> like<00:00:31.090> this<00:00:31.300> look<00:00:31.480> is

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.500 
the reasons why I feel like this look is
so<00:00:31.869> hot<00:00:32.140> because<00:00:32.380> it's<00:00:32.700> always<00:00:33.700> in<00:00:33.880> style<00:00:34.120> the

you<00:00:37.510> can<00:00:37.690> pretty<00:00:37.899> much<00:00:37.989> reinvent<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.920> Bob

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100
