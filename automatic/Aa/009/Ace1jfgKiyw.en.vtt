00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.290 
better on the inside we have more of
that<00:03:24.900> pattern<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.650> saw<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.820> bottom

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
that pattern that we saw on the bottom

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.140 
that pattern that we saw on the bottom
right<00:03:27.660> there<00:03:28.160> more<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.370> crazy<00:03:29.670> pattern

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
right there more of that crazy pattern

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.030 
right there more of that crazy pattern
once<00:03:30.360> again<00:03:30.570> like<00:03:30.930> palm<00:03:31.230> Leafs<00:03:31.680> almost<00:03:31.920> looks

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
once again like palm Leafs almost looks

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.550 
once again like palm Leafs almost looks
like<00:03:32.100> fireworks<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:33.000> whatnot<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:34.320> rest

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
like fireworks and whatnot and the rest

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.140 
like fireworks and whatnot and the rest
of<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.920> sock<00:03:35.190> liner<00:03:35.460> is<00:03:35.640> just<00:03:35.910> your<00:03:36.120> basic

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
of the sock liner is just your basic

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.500 
of the sock liner is just your basic
navy<00:03:36.840> color<00:03:37.080> on<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.950> insole<00:03:38.490> if<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.300> not

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
navy color on the insole if that is not

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.060 
navy color on the insole if that is not
going<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.870> be<00:03:39.960> too<00:03:40.110> much<00:03:40.200> shadows<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.860> there<00:03:41.040> I

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
going to be too much shadows in there I

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.920 
going to be too much shadows in there I
think<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.460> might<00:03:41.640> be<00:03:41.670> though<00:03:41.910> on<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.630> insole

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
think it might be though on the insole

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.600 
think it might be though on the insole
though<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:43.170> does<00:03:43.350> say<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.650> LeBron<00:03:44.010> flip<00:03:44.520> it

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
though it does say that LeBron flip it

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.360 
though it does say that LeBron flip it
around<00:03:44.700> James<00:03:45.360> written<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.320> red<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:47.040> navy

around James written in red on a navy

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
insula so that pretty much wraps up the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.190 
insula so that pretty much wraps up the
aesthetics<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.000> shoe<00:03:51.210> guys<00:03:51.420> let<00:03:52.020> me<00:03:52.110> know
