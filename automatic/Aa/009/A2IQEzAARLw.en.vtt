base<00:01:16.370> drill<00:01:16.610> we're<00:01:16.730> going<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:16.940> right<00:01:17.150> here<00:01:17.450> if

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
base drill we're going to right here if

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.120 
base drill we're going to right here if
use<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.110> for<00:01:18.260> your<00:01:18.350> overhead<00:01:18.680> or<00:01:18.800> your<00:01:18.920> cert

work on making the power X at the end
catch<00:01:42.330> surprise<00:01:44.390> let's<00:01:45.390> stretch<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
catch surprise let's stretch up to the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.600 
catch surprise let's stretch up to the
sky<00:01:46.050> we<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.800> hit<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
sky we have to hit up more on the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.950 
sky we have to hit up more on the
overhead<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.150> serve<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.420> any<00:01:48.540> other<00:01:48.720> stroke

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
overhead and serve than any other stroke

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.600 
overhead and serve than any other stroke
to<00:01:49.110> counteract<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> debt<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.190> ball<00:01:50.369> falling

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to counteract the debt the ball falling

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.050 
to counteract the debt the ball falling
down<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.940> top<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> our<00:01:51.330> head<00:01:52.640> that's<00:01:53.640> good

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
down on top of our head that's good

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.850 
down on top of our head that's good
so<00:01:54.420> next<00:01:54.570> step<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.080> go<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:55.680> good

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so next step as we go that's that's good

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.900 
so next step as we go that's that's good
not<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.160> use<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.400> our<00:01:56.430> overhead<00:01:56.820> as

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
not going to use for our overhead as

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.700 
not going to use for our overhead as
well<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.330> crossover<00:01:57.930> steps<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.320> turn<00:01:58.470> more

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
well we do crossover steps we turn more

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
well we do crossover steps we turn more
than<00:01:58.860> sideways<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.970> hit<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.180> more<00:02:00.360> on

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
than sideways we have to hit up more on

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.790 
than sideways we have to hit up more on
the<00:02:00.509> overhead<00:02:00.869> than<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.140> serve<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
the overhead than the serve because the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.780 
the overhead than the serve because the
ball<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:01.979> falling<00:02:02.340> from<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.520> greater<00:02:02.759> distance

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
ball is falling from a greater distance

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.410 
ball is falling from a greater distance
so<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.630> go<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.900> way<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.420> we're

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
so we go this way is now we can go we're

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.490 
so we go this way is now we can go we're
going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> stir<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.869> paint<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.350> one

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
going to stir the paint now this one

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.419 
going to stir the paint now this one
we're<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> aim<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> top<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
we're going to aim for the top of the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.800 
we're going to aim for the top of the
backdrop<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> help<00:02:09.360> us<00:02:09.539> hit<00:02:09.690> up

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
backdrop is this going to help us hit up

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.910 
backdrop is this going to help us hit up
so<00:02:09.929> we're<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> stir<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.470> pain<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.800> is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
so we're going to stir the pain this is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.199 
so we're going to stir the pain this is
third<00:02:11.100> base<00:02:11.280> drill<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.850> first<00:02:12.060> base

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
third base drill this is first base

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.540 
third base drill this is first base
drill<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:13.230> now<00:02:13.380> going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> keep<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.769> crinkle

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
drill it's now going to keep the crinkle

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.680 
drill it's now going to keep the crinkle
on<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> wrist<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.940> whole<00:02:15.120> time<00:02:15.330> until<00:02:15.480> we

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
on the wrist the whole time until we

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.650 
on the wrist the whole time until we
snap<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.800> would<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.070> comb<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> hair

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
snap up it would just comb the hair

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.770 
snap up it would just comb the hair

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.970 

we're<00:02:23.050> really<00:02:23.200> focused<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.680> getting<00:02:23.770> our

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
we're really focused on getting our

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.440 
we're really focused on getting our
elbow<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.400> front<00:02:24.430> keeping<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.030> trick<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.360> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
elbow in front keeping the trick on the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.180 
elbow in front keeping the trick on the
front<00:02:25.660> side<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.930> wrist<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.380> we've<00:02:26.980> come
