00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
activity 18s called sketching complex

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.690 
activity 18s called sketching complex
objects<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.950> complex<00:00:05.279> object<00:00:05.609> I've

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
objects and the complex object I've

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.560 
objects and the complex object I've
chosen<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.240> represent<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.529> child's<00:00:08.340> toy

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
chosen to represent is this child's toy

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.150 
chosen to represent is this child's toy
it's<00:00:09.570> not<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:09.990> complicated<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.889> makes<00:00:11.040> it

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
it's not so complicated that it makes it

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.220 
it's not so complicated that it makes it
very<00:00:11.370> difficult<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.910> draw<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.750> does<00:00:12.900> give

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
very difficult to draw but it does give

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.289 
very difficult to draw but it does give
me<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.349> chance<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.830> represent<00:00:14.370> much<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
me a chance to represent much of the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.210 
me a chance to represent much of the
things<00:00:15.509> we've<00:00:15.660> looked<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.199> creating<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
things we've looked at the creating the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.320 
things we've looked at the creating the
ovals<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.480> use<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.930> outlining<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
ovals the use of outlining and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.880 
ovals the use of outlining and
perspective<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:22.109> where<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.470> start<00:00:22.740> with

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
perspective so where do you start with

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.840 
perspective so where do you start with
an<00:00:22.980> object<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.460> this

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
an object like this

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.420 
an object like this
well<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.990> need<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> decide<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.800> sort<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.099> view

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
well we need to decide what sort of view

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.310 
well we need to decide what sort of view
we're<00:00:26.730> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.000> produce<00:00:27.150> first<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
we're going to produce first of all and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.990 
we're going to produce first of all and
if<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.160> remember<00:00:29.310> back<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.699> some<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
if you remember back to some of the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.870 
if you remember back to some of the
previous<00:00:30.179> activities<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.160> us<00:00:32.189> what

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
previous activities it was up to us what

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.660 
previous activities it was up to us what
sort<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:34.160> box<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.430> started<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.739> Y

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
sort of box we started with as the Y

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.610 
sort of box we started with as the Y
shape<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.210> started<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.350> could

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
shape I started with but I could

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.229 
shape I started with but I could
represent<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.579> very<00:00:41.790> different<00:00:41.850> way<00:00:42.210> I

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
represent it in a very different way I

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.610 
represent it in a very different way I
could<00:00:42.540> represent<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.940> wet<00:00:44.940> like<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.750> saw

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
could represent it wet like this I saw

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.819 
could represent it wet like this I saw
much<00:00:46.920> more<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.879> top<00:00:48.300> surface<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:49.649> way<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
much more of that top surface the way I

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.369 
much more of that top surface the way I
draw<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.550> entirely<00:00:51.000> up<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.360> me<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
draw it is entirely up to me as the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.319 
draw it is entirely up to me as the
graphic<00:00:53.070> designer<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.059> particular

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
graphic designer of this particular

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.049 
graphic designer of this particular
image<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:57.170> having<00:00:58.170> thought<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:59.059> I've

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
image so having thought about it I've

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.880 
image so having thought about it I've
decided<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.870> particularly<00:01:01.410> want<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> be

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
decided that I particularly want to be

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.969 
decided that I particularly want to be
able<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.329> top<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.260> side<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> like

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
able to see the top and this side I like

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.320 
able to see the top and this side I like
the<00:01:05.129> wheels<00:01:05.309> very<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> want<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> be

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the wheels very much but I want to be

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.000 
the wheels very much but I want to be
able<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.750> front<00:01:07.049> surface<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.740> well

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
able to see this front surface as well

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.420 
able to see this front surface as well
so<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> need<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> produce<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.170> crate<00:01:10.740> which

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so I need to produce the crate which

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.050 
so I need to produce the crate which
envelops<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> entire<00:01:12.890> object<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> might

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
envelops the entire object now it might

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.230 
envelops the entire object now it might
be<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> chose<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.350> spend<00:01:16.560> some<00:01:16.830> time

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
be that I chose to spend some time

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.060 
be that I chose to spend some time
measuring<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.509> object<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.939> exactly

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
measuring this object to get it exactly

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.710 
measuring this object to get it exactly
understood<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> purpose<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
understood I'm just for the purpose of

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.450 
understood I'm just for the purpose of
this<00:01:24.810> sketch<00:01:25.140> activity<00:01:25.680> I'm<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
this sketch activity I'm just going to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
this sketch activity I'm just going to
go<00:01:26.610> straight<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.450> produce<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.590> shape<00:01:29.369> like

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
go straight in and produce a shape like

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.200 
go straight in and produce a shape like
that<00:01:29.900> which<00:01:31.310> more<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.400> less<00:01:32.430> envelops<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that which more or less envelops the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.390 
that which more or less envelops the
hole<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.840> object<00:01:34.259> clearly<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.920> wasted

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
hole of the object clearly this wasted

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.719 
hole of the object clearly this wasted
space<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.869> let's<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:37.350> how<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
space up here but let's see how that

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.530 
space up here but let's see how that
unfolds<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.439> know<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> object<00:01:41.130> has<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
unfolds I know that the object has a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.010 
unfolds I know that the object has a
thinner<00:01:43.110> front<00:01:43.470> than<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> back<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> need<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
thinner front than the back so I need to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.850 
thinner front than the back so I need to
begin<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.680> put<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.100> some<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.240> shape<00:01:48.860> over

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
begin to put in some of this shape over

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.429 
begin to put in some of this shape over
here<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.149> beginning<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.479> construct<00:01:52.140> now

here and I'm beginning to construct now

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.539 
here and I'm beginning to construct now
the<00:01:53.189> front<00:01:54.149> nose<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.380> tractor<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.040> I'm

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the front nose of the tractor and I'm

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.280

the roof is going to come over something
like<00:02:15.450> that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
like that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:29.390 
like that
it's<00:02:18.600> going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.050> come<00:02:19.320> about<00:02:20.160> there<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:28.400> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it's going to come about there so and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.590 
it's going to come about there so and
the<00:02:30.390> wheel<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:31.770> be<00:02:32.010> about<00:02:33.000> there

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
the wheel is going to be about there

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.090 
the wheel is going to be about there
it's<00:02:33.900> put<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.530> wheels<00:02:34.770> now

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
it's put in one of the wheels now

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.450 
it's put in one of the wheels now
remember<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:37.080> principle<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.740> join<00:02:38.250> these

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
remember the principle of join these

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.340 
remember the principle of join these
ovals<00:02:39.030> was<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.870> find<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.430> axes<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.540> I'll<00:02:42.840> put

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
ovals was to find the axes and I'll put

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.480 
ovals was to find the axes and I'll put
that<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.980> construction<00:02:44.550> line<00:02:44.940> there<00:02:45.360> and

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
that in as a construction line there and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.790 
that in as a construction line there and
ninety<00:02:47.490> degrees<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.540> put<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> line

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
ninety degrees to it I put in a line

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.430 
ninety degrees to it I put in a line
which<00:02:50.010> will<00:02:50.100> be<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.310> major<00:02:51.000> axes<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.990> I'm

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
which will be the major axes and I'm

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.790 
which will be the major axes and I'm
going<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.620> use<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:54.150> help<00:02:54.360> me<00:02:54.630> construct<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.130 

line<00:02:58.800> like<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.570> now<00:03:00.570> that's<00:03:00.840> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
line like that now that's a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.200 
line like that now that's a
representation<00:03:02.100> using<00:03:02.370> an<00:03:02.430> oval<00:03:02.760> that

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
representation using an oval that

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.780 
representation using an oval that
represents<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.200> circle<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.100> wheel<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.520> do

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
represents the circle of the wheel I do

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.390 
represents the circle of the wheel I do
the<00:03:06.030> same<00:03:06.210> for<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.990> front<00:03:07.140> wheel<00:03:07.440> let's<00:03:08.250> see

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
the same for the front wheel let's see

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.550 
the same for the front wheel let's see
how<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.580> would<00:03:08.880> look<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.630> have<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.320> look<00:03:10.470> at

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
how that would look I have a look at

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.780 
how that would look I have a look at
this<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:12.260> beneath<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
this I can see it's just beneath the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.070 
this I can see it's just beneath the
underside<00:03:14.790> there<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.360> seems<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.720> go<00:03:15.840> through<00:03:16.050> a

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
underside there it seems to go through a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.980 
underside there it seems to go through a
little<00:03:16.290> sort<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.470> plastic<00:03:16.950> housing<00:03:17.400> there<00:03:17.640> I

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
little sort of plastic housing there I

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.230 
little sort of plastic housing there I
draw<00:03:18.990> in<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.790> axle<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.590> draw<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.620> line<00:03:23.240> ninety

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
draw in the axle I draw a line ninety

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.460 
draw in the axle I draw a line ninety
degrees<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.920> allow<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:27.300> become

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.290 

the<00:03:31.470> guidelines<00:03:32.070> for<00:03:32.820> my<00:03:33.000> ellipse<00:03:34.070> my<00:03:35.070> oval<00:03:35.670> so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
the guidelines for my ellipse my oval so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.340 
the guidelines for my ellipse my oval so
I<00:03:36.660> can<00:03:37.140> now<00:03:37.320> project<00:03:37.590> those<00:03:38.040> lines<00:03:38.430> out<00:03:38.700> and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
I can now project those lines out and

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.810 
I can now project those lines out and
draw<00:03:40.350> another<00:03:41.720> oval<00:03:43.460> because<00:03:44.460> I<00:03:44.550> want<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
draw another oval because I want the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.460 
draw another oval because I want the
wheel<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.000> have<00:03:45.330> some<00:03:45.570> thickness

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.610 

and<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.590> same<00:03:52.890> for<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> front<00:03:53.670> wheel<00:03:57.620> join

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
and the same for the front wheel join

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.289 
and the same for the front wheel join
that<00:03:58.769> up<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.099> there<00:03:59.340> let's<00:03:59.700> put<00:03:59.790> some<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.209> those

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
that up to there let's put some of those

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:10.880 
that up to there let's put some of those
lines<00:04:00.659> in<00:04:04.370> hope<00:04:05.370> you'll<00:04:05.700> see<00:04:05.879> what<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:09.890> and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
lines in hope you'll see what it is and

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.069 
lines in hope you'll see what it is and
we<00:04:11.159> can<00:04:11.310> begin<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.670> continue<00:04:12.239> with<00:04:12.599> this<00:04:12.780> now

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
we can begin to continue with this now

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.830 
we can begin to continue with this now
she<00:04:13.920> looks<00:04:14.129> like<00:04:14.310> live<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:15.239> original<00:04:15.569> crate

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
she looks like live the original crate

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.270 
she looks like live the original crate
was<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.049> little<00:04:16.320> bit<00:04:16.410> ambitious<00:04:16.859> at<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.100> back

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
was a little bit ambitious at the back

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.740 
was a little bit ambitious at the back
there<00:04:17.579> not<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.850> problem<00:04:18.180> because<00:04:18.449> I'm<00:04:18.690> just

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
there not a problem because I'm just

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:27.640 
there not a problem because I'm just
going<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.019> force<00:04:19.290> shorten<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:20.160> little<00:04:21.150> bit

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.779 

and<00:04:28.729> obviously<00:04:29.729> I've<00:04:30.090> got<00:04:30.300> my<00:04:30.770> funnel<00:04:31.789> coming

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
and obviously I've got my funnel coming

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.629 
and obviously I've got my funnel coming
out<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.300> here<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.680> how<00:04:35.010> are<00:04:35.100> we<00:04:35.130> doing<00:04:35.430> for

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
out of here and how are we doing for

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.420 
out of here and how are we doing for
that<00:04:35.760> right<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.180> need<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.449> put<00:04:36.630> in<00:04:36.810> some<00:04:37.430> back

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
that right we need to put in some back

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.689 
that right we need to put in some back
wheels<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.780> some<00:04:40.139> wheels<00:04:40.410> at<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.680> rear<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:41.490> I

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
wheels so some wheels at the rear that I

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.570 
wheels so some wheels at the rear that I
can't<00:04:44.699> quite<00:04:44.880> see<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.270> other<00:04:45.389> one<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
can't quite see the other one and the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.730 
can't quite see the other one and the
little<00:04:47.820> headlight<00:04:48.300> things<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:48.960> here<00:04:49.260> I'm<00:04:49.650> not

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
little headlight things on here I'm not

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.469 
little headlight things on here I'm not
going<00:04:49.889> to<00:04:49.949> put<00:04:50.070> too<00:04:50.310> much<00:04:50.550> detail<00:04:51.030> into<00:04:51.210> this

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
going to put too much detail into this

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.230 
going to put too much detail into this
sketch<00:04:51.780> this<00:04:52.199> after<00:04:52.590> all<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:52.949> a<00:04:53.220> first<00:04:53.669> sketch

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
sketch this after all is a first sketch

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.980 
sketch this after all is a first sketch
that<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:55.110> now<00:04:55.260> use<00:04:55.289> as<00:04:55.800> an<00:04:56.510> underlay<00:04:57.510> using

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
that I can now use as an underlay using

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:49.370 
that I can now use as an underlay using
that<00:04:58.169> overlay<00:04:58.889> technique

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.960 

so<00:05:50.310> now<00:05:50.520> we've<00:05:50.670> got<00:05:50.850> sketch<00:05:51.630> of<00:05:52.250> our<00:05:53.250> child's

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
so now we've got sketch of our child's

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.640 
so now we've got sketch of our child's
toy<00:05:54.180> which<00:05:55.170> is<00:05:55.410> a<00:05:55.620> plausible<00:05:56.550> starting<00:05:57.300> point

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
toy which is a plausible starting point

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.410 
toy which is a plausible starting point
but<00:05:58.650> it's<00:05:58.770> used<00:05:59.520> many<00:05:59.940> of<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.120> techniques

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420

for<00:06:10.890> things<00:06:11.220> like<00:06:11.310> wheels<00:06:11.790> the<00:06:12.480> use<00:06:12.630> of

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
for things like wheels the use of

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.780 
for things like wheels the use of
shading<00:06:13.440> to<00:06:13.560> give<00:06:13.710> three-dimensional<00:06:14.490> form

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
shading to give three-dimensional form

to<00:06:15.330> an<00:06:15.420> object<00:06:15.980> if<00:06:16.980> you<00:06:17.130> can<00:06:17.280> end<00:06:17.580> up<00:06:17.820> with

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
to an object if you can end up with

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.900 
to an object if you can end up with
rough<00:06:19.200> sketches<00:06:19.500> like<00:06:19.680> these<00:06:20.040> then<00:06:20.730> they're

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
rough sketches like these then they're

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.880 
rough sketches like these then they're
going<00:06:21.000> to<00:06:21.060> be<00:06:21.120> really<00:06:21.300> valuable<00:06:21.570> to<00:06:21.900> not<00:06:22.590> only

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
going to be really valuable to not only

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.560 
going to be really valuable to not only
in<00:06:22.980> communicating<00:06:23.670> your<00:06:23.790> design<00:06:24.060> ideas

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
in communicating your design ideas

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.690 
in communicating your design ideas
amongst<00:06:25.260> other<00:06:25.590> designers<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:26.250> showing<00:06:26.580> them

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
amongst other designers and showing them

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.370 
amongst other designers and showing them
to<00:06:26.790> other<00:06:26.940> people<00:06:27.270> but<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.110> act<00:06:28.230> of

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
to other people but the act of

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.200 
to other people but the act of
visualizing<00:06:28.920> them<00:06:29.220> can<00:06:29.580> improve<00:06:30.000> your<00:06:30.150> own

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
visualizing them can improve your own

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.320 
visualizing them can improve your own
creativity<00:06:30.890> so<00:06:31.890> these<00:06:32.820> are<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.000> techniques

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
creativity so these are the techniques

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.240 
creativity so these are the techniques
that<00:06:33.570> you<00:06:33.630> need<00:06:33.660> to<00:06:33.930> practice<00:06:34.110> to<00:06:34.830> be<00:06:34.980> able<00:06:35.070> to

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
that you need to practice to be able to

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.950 
that you need to practice to be able to
use<00:06:35.880> sketching<00:06:36.780> effectively<00:06:37.260> in<00:06:37.470> design
