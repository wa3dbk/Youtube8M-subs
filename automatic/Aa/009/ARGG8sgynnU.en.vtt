 there is a video how to properly scald 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.630

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.950
 we take here a thin skin with us 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.360
 quietly take us the most important thing 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:57.510

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.000
 slaughtered others there was 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:22.210
 More popular live liver 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.240
 but the corn is separated from us because 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:34.680
 it is separated and the next stage is the navel 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:41.650
 navel, too, separate the fat if oily 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:46.440
 the bird it all washed up well usually 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:53.160
