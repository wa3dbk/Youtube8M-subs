we're<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.129> again<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> pretty

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
we're going on this again it's a pretty

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.430 
we're going on this again it's a pretty
much<00:00:51.090> sling<00:00:51.329> shot<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.840> guys<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.350> no

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
much sling shot from this guys I have no

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
much sling shot from this guys I have no
idea<00:00:52.649> what<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> they<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
idea what the they do I don't I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.639 
idea what the they do I don't I
don't<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> slingshot<00:00:54.960> someone<00:00:55.379> but

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
don't know how to slingshot someone but

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.860 
don't know how to slingshot someone but
I<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.820> something<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.660> or

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
I think it's something like this or

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.080 
I think it's something like this or
something<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.440> no<00:00:58.770> um<00:00:59.250> since<00:00:59.760> shot<00:00:59.910> close

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
something right no um since shot close

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.709 
something right no um since shot close
behind<00:01:00.420> someone<00:01:00.809> maybe<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.390> use

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
behind someone maybe it's so we can use

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.530 
behind someone maybe it's so we can use
our<00:01:03.989> skills<00:01:04.400> from<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.820> Blues<00:01:06.000> Brothers<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
our skills from the Blues Brothers to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
our skills from the Blues Brothers to
make<00:01:06.689> our<00:01:06.810> way<00:01:06.900> over<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.950> let's<00:01:08.070> try

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
make our way over there so let's try

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.560 
make our way over there so let's try
this<00:01:08.310> again<00:01:08.490> hopefully<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.479> some

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this again hopefully there's some

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.230 
this again hopefully there's some
swinging<00:01:09.900> around<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.830> now<00:01:11.580> after<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.090> hit

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
swinging around and now after we hit

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000 
swinging around and now after we hit
this<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.720> spring<00:01:12.990> board<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.890> go

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
this little spring board we can go

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.550 
this little spring board we can go
across<00:01:14.189> again<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> hit<00:01:15.479> them<00:01:15.600> with<00:01:15.750> our<00:01:15.900> fists

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
across again and hit them with our fists

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.140 
across again and hit them with our fists
pretty<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.340> down<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.670> again<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
