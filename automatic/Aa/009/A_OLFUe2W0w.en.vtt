 for the football manager 13 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.489
 There are a lot of database changes 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.410
 there are stronger changes tears talent 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.280
 changes and so on due to the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.200
 current season 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.910
 which is just completed there 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.710
 adjustments were made to 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.329
 latest transfers are attendance with 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.729
 in there that one over the summer break if 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.770
 The game really starts here 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.999
 gamble on the latest data so to speak 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.209
 that can be really interesting though 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:16.700
 icing on the cake, which is why me too 

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:19.759
 make this news is the end of season 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.039
 crash he is alleged with this update 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.109
 fixed speak if you a game stone 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.619
 You started the attacks again 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.719
 this is now the end of the season 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.229
 gefixed when a score starts 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.209
 under 1.0 point 4.0 then you have to 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.819
 again season change can perform 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.979
 after the first season without you 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.869

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.499
 good news 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.090
 It took a little while, but needed 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.669
 after all, it has arrived there for 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.200
 double thumbs high on my part 

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:52.459

 everyone thought they are dead everyone has 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.409

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.399

 and when a move has gone white 

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:10.369
 that may take a while 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.030
 Maybe that's why you did not hear anything 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.400

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.709
