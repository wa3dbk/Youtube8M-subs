00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.700 
indicates to me we're ready for a break
one<00:00:58.280> way<00:00:58.460> or<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.610> other<00:00:58.729> and<00:00:59.570> there's<00:01:00.439> going

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
to be enough fundamental news out this

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.170 
to be enough fundamental news out this
week<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:03.110> create<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.339> catalyst<00:01:04.820> I<00:01:04.939> think

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
week to create the the catalyst I think

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.510 
week to create the the catalyst I think
for<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.600> break<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.500> for<00:01:06.680> example<00:01:06.770> if<00:01:07.130> we<00:01:07.280> fall

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
for the break so for example if we fall

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.520 
for the break so for example if we fall
short<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:08.030> those<00:01:08.240> jobs<00:01:08.540> numbers<00:01:09.080> on<00:01:09.229> Friday

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
Wednesday yeah I mean again I don't

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.660

think<00:01:14.960> there's<00:01:15.140> going<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.440> be<00:01:15.500> any<00:01:15.590> new<00:01:16.370> news

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
think there's going to be any new news

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.750 
think there's going to be any new news
out<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.240> FOMC<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.620> I<00:01:19.040> don't<00:01:19.280> think<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
out of the FOMC and I don't think the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.940 
out of the FOMC and I don't think the
Europeans<00:01:20.660> are<00:01:20.900> going<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.530> touch<00:01:21.710> their

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
Europeans are going to touch their

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.410 
Europeans are going to touch their
interest<00:01:22.310> rate<00:01:22.550> policy<00:01:23.560> at<00:01:24.560> this<00:01:24.890> meeting<00:01:25.420> so

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
interest rate policy at this meeting so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.410 
interest rate policy at this meeting so
I<00:01:26.930> think<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:28.130> market<00:01:28.460> is<00:01:28.520> trying<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.090> trend

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
I think the market is trying to trend

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.530 
I think the market is trying to trend
higher<00:01:29.690> but<00:01:30.080> it's<00:01:30.230> running<00:01:30.590> into<00:01:31.420> selling<00:01:32.420> up

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
higher but it's running into selling up

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.220 
higher but it's running into selling up
in<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.870> high<00:01:33.230> 13<00:01:33.830> 30s<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.810> market

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
in the high 13 30s and I this market

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.930 
in the high 13 30s and I this market
needs<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.710> build<00:01:36.980> momentum<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.520> break<00:01:37.760> up

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
needs to build momentum to break up

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.490 
needs to build momentum to break up
through<00:01:38.210> there<00:01:38.390> before<00:01:38.810> we<00:01:38.960> see<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.290> next

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
through there before we see the next

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.060 
through there before we see the next
move<00:01:39.770> maybe<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.229> 1357<00:01:42.229> level<00:01:42.680> which<00:01:42.860> was

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
move maybe to the 1357 level which was

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.180 
move maybe to the 1357 level which was
my<00:01:43.220> target<00:01:43.430> last<00:01:43.790> week<00:01:44.409> but<00:01:45.409> belong<00:01:45.830> oritzu

fundamental news that will break this to
the<00:01:51.950> upside<00:01:52.370> I<00:01:52.540> you<00:01:53.540> know<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:53.690> suspect<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.350> the

the market are probably funds I'd avoid

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.979 
the market are probably funds I'd avoid
the<00:02:32.870> if<00:02:33.520> they<00:02:34.520> did<00:02:34.790> buy<00:02:35.060> these<00:02:35.420> these

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
the if they did buy these these

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.780 
the if they did buy these these
positions<00:02:36.590> which<00:02:36.770> obviously<00:02:37.099> it<00:02:37.400> did<00:02:37.610> their

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
positions which obviously it did their

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.699 
positions which obviously it did their
long<00:02:37.970> on<00:02:38.120> their<00:02:38.569> showing<00:02:38.780> along<00:02:39.050> on<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.319> comex

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
long on their showing along on the comex

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.530 
long on their showing along on the comex
the<00:02:39.980> question<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.459> when<00:02:40.700> did<00:02:40.880> they<00:02:41.060> buy<00:02:41.239> them

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the question is when did they buy them

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.320 
the question is when did they buy them
and<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:42.770> know<00:02:42.860> are<00:02:43.069> they<00:02:43.190> long<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.700> 1200s

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
and you know are they long in the 1200s

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.570 
and you know are they long in the 1200s
or<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.840> jump<00:02:45.260> into<00:02:45.440> this<00:02:45.620> market<00:02:45.860> when<00:02:46.340> gold

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
or the jump into this market when gold

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.220 
or the jump into this market when gold
broke<00:02:46.850> up<00:02:47.030> through<00:02:47.300> thirteen<00:02:47.720> hundred<00:02:48.020> and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
broke up through thirteen hundred and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.380 
broke up through thirteen hundred and
that<00:02:48.709> makes<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.069> difference<00:02:49.520> because<00:02:49.730> if<00:02:50.150> if

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
that makes a difference because if if

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.080 
that makes a difference because if if
they<00:02:51.050> got<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.470> late<00:02:51.830> they're<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.000> be

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
they got in late they're going to be

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.790 
they got in late they're going to be
very<00:02:53.300> nervous<00:02:53.569> at<00:02:53.870> these<00:02:54.050> levels<00:02:54.319> if<00:02:54.650> this

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
very nervous at these levels if this

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.559 
very nervous at these levels if this
market<00:02:55.160> doesn't<00:02:55.340> break<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.910> upside<00:02:56.269> if

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
market doesn't break to the upside if

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.780 
market doesn't break to the upside if
they<00:02:57.019> got<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.380> early<00:02:57.709> they'll<00:02:57.920> hold<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.430> for<00:02:58.760> a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
they got in early they'll hold on for a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.759 
they got in early they'll hold on for a
while<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.750> it's<00:03:00.080> not<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.319> question<00:03:00.530> of

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
while so it's it's not a question of

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.559 
while so it's it's not a question of
them<00:03:01.040> increasing<00:03:01.730> their<00:03:01.880> positions<00:03:02.390> which

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
them increasing their positions which

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:03.910 
them increasing their positions which
was<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> obvious<00:03:03.110> thing<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.560> do<00:03:03.739> after

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
was the obvious thing to do after

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.770 
was the obvious thing to do after
bernanke<00:03:04.370> made<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.819> plain<00:03:05.090> he<00:03:05.299> wasn't<00:03:05.600> going

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
bernanke made it plain he wasn't going

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.050 
bernanke made it plain he wasn't going
to<00:03:05.870> get<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.230> way<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.560> market<00:03:07.010> but<00:03:07.880> at

to get in the way of the market but at

to get in the way of the market but at
what<00:03:08.330> level<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.930> they<00:03:09.080> get<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.410> at<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.950> again

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
what level that they get in at and again

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.309 
what level that they get in at and again
hedge<00:03:10.760> funds<00:03:11.030> aren't<00:03:11.209> very<00:03:11.420> loyal<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.140> you'd

Zurich and London and it's been

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.630 
Zurich and London and it's been
problematic<00:06:32.180> with<00:06:32.660> Singapore<00:06:33.200> now<00:06:33.640> more

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
problematic with Singapore now more

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.720

both Europe and the Far East it just

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.909 
both Europe and the Far East it just

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
makes logistical sense and I think

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.170 
makes logistical sense and I think
that's<00:06:43.100> why<00:06:43.250> you're<00:06:43.430> seeing<00:06:43.640> those<00:06:43.850> vaults

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
that's why you're seeing those vaults

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.969 
that's why you're seeing those vaults
opening<00:06:44.540> there<00:06:44.690> your<00:06:45.230> favorite<00:06:45.590> part<00:06:45.770> now

times you know I suggested a couple of
weeks<00:06:59.240> back<00:06:59.450> that<00:06:59.510> this<00:06:59.870> might<00:07:00.080> be<00:07:00.230> a<00:07:00.260> time

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
weeks back that this might be a time

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.800 
weeks back that this might be a time
just<00:07:00.740> to<00:07:00.860> take<00:07:01.040> a<00:07:01.070> holiday<00:07:01.460> and<00:07:01.820> and<00:07:02.389> let<00:07:02.690> the

just to take a holiday and and let the

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.580 
just to take a holiday and and let the
market<00:07:02.960> sort<00:07:03.380> of<00:07:03.470> a<00:07:03.680> sort<00:07:04.490> itself<00:07:04.639> out<00:07:05.590> this

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
market sort of a sort itself out this

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.390 
market sort of a sort itself out this
market<00:07:07.150> lacks<00:07:08.150> conviction<00:07:09.139> right<00:07:09.680> here<00:07:09.950> it's

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
market lacks conviction right here it's

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.220 
market lacks conviction right here it's
trading<00:07:10.880> in<00:07:11.090> a<00:07:11.150> tighter<00:07:11.419> and<00:07:11.660> tighter<00:07:11.720> range

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230 
trading in a tighter and tighter range

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.060 
trading in a tighter and tighter range
and<00:07:12.530> it<00:07:12.650> is<00:07:12.770> going<00:07:12.980> to<00:07:13.100> break<00:07:14.020> there's<00:07:15.020> a<00:07:15.139> more

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
and it is going to break there's a more

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
break might be to the upside which would

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.770 
break might be to the upside which would
see<00:07:20.930> the<00:07:21.220> 1357<00:07:22.220> level<00:07:22.669> I'm<00:07:22.880> again<00:07:23.300> I<00:07:23.330> need<00:07:23.630> that

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:23.780 
see the 1357 level I'm again I need that

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.670 
see the 1357 level I'm again I need that
1338<00:07:24.620> level<00:07:25.070> taken<00:07:25.430> out<00:07:25.550> with<00:07:25.730> conviction

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 
1338 level taken out with conviction

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.810 
1338 level taken out with conviction
before<00:07:27.680> I<00:07:27.980> I'm<00:07:28.520> in<00:07:28.730> that<00:07:28.880> camp<00:07:29.320> 13<00:07:30.320> 12<00:07:31.190> seems<00:07:31.640> to

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:31.820 
before I I'm in that camp 13 12 seems to

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.640 
before I I'm in that camp 13 12 seems to
be<00:07:31.910> a<00:07:31.940> good<00:07:32.150> support<00:07:32.630> level<00:07:32.930> it's<00:07:33.140> bounced<00:07:33.500> off

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.650 
be a good support level it's bounced off

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.159 
be a good support level it's bounced off
that<00:07:33.680> twice<00:07:34.220> so<00:07:35.210> I<00:07:35.240> think<00:07:35.480> we're<00:07:35.780> in<00:07:35.810> a<00:07:35.900> range

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.169 
that twice so I think we're in a range

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:42.790 
that twice so I think we're in a range
