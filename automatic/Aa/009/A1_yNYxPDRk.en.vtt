call it became a pot amiss
I<00:00:38.410> used<00:00:39.100> to<00:00:39.190> be<00:00:39.780> trying<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:40.809> write<00:00:40.960> music<00:00:41.140> up

there<00:00:41.739> trying<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.670> maybe<00:00:43.149> it<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.390> just<00:00:43.420> after

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
there trying to maybe it was just after

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.869 
there trying to maybe it was just after
dinner<00:00:44.109> and<00:00:44.410> I<00:00:44.680> was<00:00:44.829> trying<00:00:45.100> to<00:00:45.160> get<00:00:45.670> some<00:00:45.850> work

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
dinner and I was trying to get some work

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.229 
dinner and I was trying to get some work
done<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:47.159> the<00:00:48.159> pink<00:00:48.399> hippo<00:00:48.550> was<00:00:48.879> always

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
done and the pink hippo was always

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.860 
done and the pink hippo was always
sending<00:00:49.570> me<00:00:49.600> back<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.949> used<00:00:54.729> to<00:00:54.820> hear<00:00:54.969> the<00:00:55.360> bass

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
sending me back I used to hear the bass

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.600 
sending me back I used to hear the bass
drum<00:00:56.079> beat<00:00:56.409> and<00:00:56.440> sometimes<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.190> baseline

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
drum beat and sometimes the baseline

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.500 
drum beat and sometimes the baseline
would<00:00:57.820> come<00:00:58.030> through

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.560 

so<00:01:04.510> rather<00:01:04.720> than<00:01:04.960> try<00:01:05.200> to<00:01:06.090> compete<00:01:07.090> with<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.480> I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
so rather than try to compete with it I

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.030 
so rather than try to compete with it I
decided<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:08.050> incorporate<00:01:08.350> some<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
decided to incorporate some of the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.310 
decided to incorporate some of the
elements

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.570 

so<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.620> funky<00:01:14.010> avocado<00:01:14.370> came

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so that's how the funky avocado came

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.950 
so that's how the funky avocado came
about<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.180> starts<00:01:15.510> off<00:01:15.690> with<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.430 

starts<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.950> medium<00:01:20.370> R&amp;B<00:01:20.880> tempo<00:01:21.440> slows

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
starts out with a medium R&amp;B tempo slows

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.970 
starts out with a medium R&amp;B tempo slows
down<00:01:22.650> into<00:01:22.979> some<00:01:23.190> heavy<00:01:23.340> rock

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.830 

ends<00:01:26.760> it<00:01:27.180> finishes<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.260> in<00:01:28.410> a<00:01:29.300> fit<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.330> disco

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
ends it finishes up in a fit of disco

00:01:30.840 --> 00:03:55.830 
ends it finishes up in a fit of disco
fury

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:08.190
