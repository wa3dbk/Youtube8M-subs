us how the testing was done and what the
findings<00:00:37.739> were<00:00:38.010> we've<00:00:38.760> came<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.450> 9<00:00:39.690> 12

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
findings were we've came out with 9 12

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.310 
findings were we've came out with 9 12
is<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.350> year<00:00:40.559> ago<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.809> now<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
is a year ago and now that we have to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.630 
is a year ago and now that we have to
see<00:00:43.440> reproduction<00:00:43.950> engines<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.489> did<00:00:44.610> some

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
see reproduction engines we did some

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.720 
see reproduction engines we did some
detailed<00:00:45.390> flight<00:00:45.660> tests<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.700> we're<00:00:47.700> very

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
detailed flight tests and we're very

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
detailed flight tests and we're very
happy<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.450> actually<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> twenty<00:00:49.710> one

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
happy that actually the twenty one

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.260 
happy that actually the twenty one
percent<00:00:49.980> better<00:00:50.340> fuel<00:00:50.640> consumption<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.210> we

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
percent better fuel consumption that we

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.910 
percent better fuel consumption that we
claim<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.719> even<00:00:52.680> better<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.160> real<00:00:53.399> life<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
claim are even better in real life so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
claim are even better in real life so
what<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> 912<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
what you need to know is that the 912 is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420 
what you need to know is that the 912 is
uses<00:00:57.960> basically<00:00:58.320> two<00:00:58.649> different<00:00:58.680> mixture

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
uses basically two different mixture

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760 
uses basically two different mixture
settings<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> power<00:01:00.840> mode<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
settings we get a power mode which is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.460 
settings we get a power mode which is
basically<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> rich<00:01:02.489> setting<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.570> getting<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
basically a rich setting for getting the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.020 
basically a rich setting for getting the
best<00:01:04.650> power<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.369> engines<00:01:05.700> for

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
best power out of the engines for

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240 
best power out of the engines for
starting<00:01:06.390> climb<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.439> once<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> switch<00:01:07.920> into

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
starting climb but once you switch into

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370 
starting climb but once you switch into
cruise<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.850> once<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> pull<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> fall<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:10.049> we

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
cruise so once you pull the fall out we

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.340 
cruise so once you pull the fall out we
are<00:01:10.530> lower<00:01:10.950> than<00:01:11.040> 13<00:01:11.909> seven<00:01:12.420> percent<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.290> all

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
are lower than 13 seven percent for all

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
are lower than 13 seven percent for all
setting<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.729> switch<00:01:14.970> into<00:01:15.210> an<00:01:15.270> eco<00:01:15.600> mode

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
setting you switch into an eco mode

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
setting you switch into an eco mode
which<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> lean<00:01:17.070> mixture<00:01:17.460> setting<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
which is a lean mixture setting and that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.760 
which is a lean mixture setting and that
really<00:01:18.869> gives<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> best<00:01:19.439> fuel

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
really gives you the best fuel

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.469 
really gives you the best fuel
efficiency<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.509> saw<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.189> Eco<00:01:23.189> mode

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
efficiency so what we saw in Eco mode

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
efficiency so what we saw in Eco mode
especially<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> high<00:01:24.780> altitude<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.560> tow<00:01:25.710> up

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
especially the high altitude we tow up

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.310 
especially the high altitude we tow up
to<00:01:25.860> 30<00:01:26.310> minus<00:01:26.700> thirty<00:01:27.060> six<00:01:27.330> percent<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.990> better

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to 30 minus thirty six percent of better

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.030 
to 30 minus thirty six percent of better
fuel<00:01:28.560> consumption<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.479> wide<00:01:30.479> open<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.900> our

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
fuel consumption and wide open for our

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
fuel consumption and wide open for our
even<00:01:32.040> though<00:01:32.159> its<00:01:32.280> power<00:01:32.520> setting<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.150> it's

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
even though its power setting so it's

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.969 
even though its power setting so it's
really<00:01:33.780> not<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:33.960> fuel<00:01:34.290> consumption<00:01:34.770> we

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
really not about fuel consumption we

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.539 
really not about fuel consumption we
still<00:01:35.310> saw<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.909> better<00:01:36.240> than<00:01:36.450> ten<00:01:36.689> percent

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
still saw it better than ten percent

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.399 
still saw it better than ten percent
improved<00:01:38.549> fuel<00:01:38.729> consumption<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:40.049> also<00:01:40.170> did

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
improved fuel consumption we also did

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.649 
improved fuel consumption we also did
looked<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> long-term<00:01:41.329> so<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.450> had<00:01:42.540> this

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
looked at the long-term so we had this

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.569 
looked at the long-term so we had this
airplane<00:01:42.990> sitting<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.590> our<00:01:43.680> Airport<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.460> we

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
airplane sitting at our Airport that we

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.760 
airplane sitting at our Airport that we
track<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> fuel<00:01:45.210> usage<00:01:45.390> off<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.170> had<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
track the fuel usage off and it had the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.300 
track the fuel usage off and it had the
912<00:01:47.220> ULS<00:01:47.280> installed<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:49.189> upgraded<00:01:50.189> this

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
912 ULS installed and we upgraded this

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.830 
912 ULS installed and we upgraded this
aircraft<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> 912<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.469 
aircraft to the 912 is
and<00:01:52.929> we<00:01:53.920> solve<00:01:54.159> fuel<00:01:54.429> consumption<00:01:54.939> on<00:01:55.060> average

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
and we solve fuel consumption on average

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.099 
and we solve fuel consumption on average
so<00:01:55.719> this<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:55.990> 250<00:01:56.799> hour<00:01:57.280> average<00:01:58.109> coming

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
so this is a 250 hour average coming

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.130 
so this is a 250 hour average coming
down<00:01:59.289> by<00:01:59.469> 30<00:01:59.799> point<00:02:00.130> one<00:02:00.340> percent<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.869> this<00:02:02.020> is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
down by 30 point one percent so this is

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.139 
down by 30 point one percent so this is
really<00:02:02.319> how<00:02:02.619> how<00:02:03.460> much<00:02:03.609> few<00:02:03.819> things<00:02:04.000> I'm<00:02:04.119> sure

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
really how how much few things I'm sure

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.849 
really how how much few things I'm sure
how<00:02:04.479> much<00:02:04.600> better<00:02:04.869> fuel<00:02:05.109> consumption<00:02:05.560> can<00:02:05.679> get

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
how much better fuel consumption can get

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.980 
how much better fuel consumption can get
with<00:02:06.069> 912<00:02:06.579> is<00:02:06.880> but<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.509> course<00:02:07.569> it's<00:02:07.869> always

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
with 912 is but of course it's always

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.859 
with 912 is but of course it's always
specific<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.679> one<00:02:09.310> single<00:02:09.580> aircraft<00:02:09.879> but<00:02:10.660> what

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
specific to one single aircraft but what

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.449 
specific to one single aircraft but what
you<00:02:10.989> always<00:02:11.080> need<00:02:11.349> to<00:02:11.470> know<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.769> there's<00:02:12.310> this

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
you always need to know is there's this

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.670 
you always need to know is there's this
power<00:02:12.730> mode<00:02:12.970> there's<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.629> Eco<00:02:13.840> mode<00:02:13.989> if<00:02:14.500> you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
power mode there's the Eco mode if you

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.170 
power mode there's the Eco mode if you
want<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.950> get<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.220> best<00:02:15.370> fuel<00:02:15.670> efficiency<00:02:16.150> out

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
want to get the best fuel efficiency out

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.340 
want to get the best fuel efficiency out
of<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.480> 912<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.799> see<00:02:18.010> commit
