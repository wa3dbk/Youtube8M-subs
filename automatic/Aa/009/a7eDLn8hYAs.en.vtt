result<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> bleach<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.850> pretty

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
result of the bleach and it's pretty

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.719 
result of the bleach and it's pretty
yellow<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.840> didn't<00:01:07.080> buy<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> toner<00:01:07.740> which

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
yellow I didn't buy a toner which

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
yellow I didn't buy a toner which
probably<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> bad<00:01:09.420> idea<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.080> okay<00:01:10.380> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
probably the bad idea but it's okay so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
probably the bad idea but it's okay so
we're<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> add<00:01:11.040> red<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> anyway<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
we're going to add red to it anyway so I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.170 
we're going to add red to it anyway so I
think<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.960> should<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.229> fine<00:01:13.790> but<00:01:14.790> um<00:01:16.280> yeah<00:01:17.280> it's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
think it should be fine but um yeah it's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.609 
think it should be fine but um yeah it's
supposed<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.080> natural<00:01:19.409> toner

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
in it with the bleach but I don't think

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
in it with the bleach but I don't think
that<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:22.590> happened<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.549> mean

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
do um so I guess the first obvious thing

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.819 
do um so I guess the first obvious thing
is<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:06.030> hair<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> new<00:02:06.960> hair<00:02:07.229> color<00:02:07.470> week

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
as I mentioned in the last few Clips it

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.190 
as I mentioned in the last few Clips it
was<00:02:11.250> vampire<00:02:12.030> red<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.660> look<00:02:12.900> we'll<00:02:13.050> think

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
was vampire red and look we'll think

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.920 
was vampire red and look we'll think
about<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.800> fading<00:02:14.160> pretty<00:02:14.580> nicely<00:02:15.000> this

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
about it it's fading pretty nicely this

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.660 
about it it's fading pretty nicely this
is<00:02:16.110> actually<00:02:16.470> two<00:02:16.650> weeks<00:02:16.890> into<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.370> probably

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
is actually two weeks into it probably

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.550

more<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.239> week<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.630> half<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.470> was

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
more like a week and a half and it was

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.800 
more like a week and a half and it was
super<00:02:19.769> easy<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.430> use<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.940> cannot<00:02:21.269> tell<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.510> how

literally just go like this with it and
like<00:02:31.080> apply<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> hair<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.459> don't

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
even need the brush or anything and I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.900 
even need the brush or anything and I
know<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.739> end<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.130> getting<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.580> over<00:02:35.610> my

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
know I end up getting it all over my

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.720 
know I end up getting it all over my
hands<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.540> regret<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.019> later<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.069> this

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
hands and I regret it later but I this

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.970 
hands and I regret it later but I this
process<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.900> much<00:02:40.110> simpler<00:02:40.470> than<00:02:40.799> to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
process is so much simpler than to

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.259 
process is so much simpler than to
actually<00:02:41.370> get<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.519> brush<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.030> like

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
actually get a brush and like

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.110 
actually get a brush and like
individually<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.140> do<00:02:43.440> every<00:02:43.950> piece<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.610> what

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
individually like do every piece so what

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.020 
individually like do every piece so what
we<00:02:45.420> end<00:02:45.569> up<00:02:45.720> with<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:46.650> red<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.610> really

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
we end up with with red and I really

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.610 
we end up with with red and I really
actually<00:02:48.180> like<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:49.019> first<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.380> didn't

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
actually like it at first I didn't

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.740 
actually like it at first I didn't
because<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:49.950> was<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.519> it's<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.299> colorful

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
because I was like it's not colorful

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.330 
because I was like it's not colorful
enough<00:02:51.810> because<00:02:52.349> it's<00:02:52.500> such<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> normal<00:02:52.860> light

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
enough because it's such a normal light

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.370 
enough because it's such a normal light
color<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.330> would<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.690> people<00:02:54.989> where

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
color that you would see people where

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.699 
color that you would see people where
like<00:02:55.980> aside<00:02:56.519> from<00:02:56.910> purples<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.930> blues<00:02:58.019> and

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
like aside from purples and blues and

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.289 
like aside from purples and blues and
pinks<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.549> that's<00:02:59.820> why<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.000> was<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.269> little

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
pinks so that's why I was a little

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.210 
pinks so that's why I was a little
really<00:03:00.660> iffy<00:03:01.049> about<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.440> color<00:03:01.620> at<00:03:01.799> first<00:03:02.010> but

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
really iffy about the color at first but

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.250 
really iffy about the color at first but
the<00:03:02.730> more<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:02.940> wear<00:03:03.390> obviously<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.019> more<00:03:04.230> I

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
the more I wear obviously the more I

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.530 
the more I wear obviously the more I
like<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.579> don't<00:03:06.060> know<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.239> looked

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
like it and I don't know I just looked

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.900 
like it and I don't know I just looked
really<00:03:06.840> cool<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.380> feel<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.890> Ariel<00:03:08.340> for<00:03:08.609> real

really cool I feel like Ariel for real

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.569 
really cool I feel like Ariel for real

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
because her hair is this color and my

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.220 
because her hair is this color and my
