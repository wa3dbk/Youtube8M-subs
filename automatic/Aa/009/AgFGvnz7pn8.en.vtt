00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.820 
come to expect so you've got a 3.5 inch
screen<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.640> policy<00:02:27.450> really<00:02:27.989> body<00:02:28.290> boy<00:02:28.560> 2

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
screen is it policy really body boy 2

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.940 
screen is it policy really body boy 2
inch<00:02:29.010> screen<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.970> c7<00:02:30.510> has<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.690> 3.5<00:02:31.170> inch<00:02:31.470> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
inch screen so the c7 has a 3.5 inch and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:44.410 
inch screen so the c7 has a 3.5 inch and
the<00:02:32.250> n8<00:02:32.580> has<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.910> 3.5<00:02:33.480> inch<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.870> has<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> 3.2

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.090 

megapixel<00:02:45.420> camera<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.380> back<00:02:46.500> yes

I<00:02:49.160> guess<00:02:49.370> disaster<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:50.120> already<00:02:50.570> megapixel

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
I guess disaster is already megapixel

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.940 
I guess disaster is already megapixel
camera<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:53.840> tool<00:02:54.140> photo<00:02:54.410> lights<00:02:55.180> sorry<00:02:56.180> and
