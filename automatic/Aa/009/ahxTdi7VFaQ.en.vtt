00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.800
 or I had already had the 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.830
 Worm to make some bread recipe 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.450
 and well with this one I premiere in the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.250
 description I will leave some links 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.410
 interesting because the truth is that there 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.230
 many ways to make bread and good 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.300
 it's a really fascinating world and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.759
 almost impossible to summarize in a small 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.279
 recipe with the amounts of this recipe 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.310
 there will be for two loaves so let's go there 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.880
 we will put a kilo of flour about five 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.219
 grams of baker's yeast 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.770
 100 grams of olive olives 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.540
 boned good I have boned them 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.760
 with your hands and then 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.710
 we will remove everything well during a good 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.050
 long so that the yeast is well 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.690
 distributed among the flour we add 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.550
 between 15 and 20 grams of salt and we return to 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.550
 move but this time less time 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.630
 finally we add 550 grams of water 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.630
 tibia 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.470
 in the same bowl and we can help each other 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.840
 a scraper we will mix well all the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.119
 ingredients already when we have them here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.409
 well mixed we will work the dough 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.409
 on a clean surface 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.820
 the proportions of water and flour 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.890
 this recipe to knead it is a task that is 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 little complicated and then I do not know 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.330
 it requires no kneading tactics 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.330
 in particular so that we look good 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.610
 practically then the idea will be to go 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.800
 stretching the shrinking the envelope 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 same stretching back to go 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.790
 developing the gluten that carries the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.220
 flour 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.960
 and good to feel the gluten do not think 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.090
 that gluten is not bad because 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.280
 you can definitely see in many 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.410
 supermarkets products that are advertised 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.050
 as gluten free there are people who 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.640
 thinks that gluten is a bad thing and that 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.830
 It is convenient to eat gluten-free foods 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.590
 when the truth is that there is no 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.540
 problem in eating gluten unless 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.610
 you have an allergy to him then yes 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.140
 obviously you have to go for other 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.330
 food but in case it is not like that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.250
 Well there is no problem to eat the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.660
 gluten is not any element or chemical 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.209
 invented nothing bad and as I go 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.720
 happening what you will see is that the amount 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.300
 of mass that was previously stuck to the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.890
 table because it is less and less and leaves 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.410
 dragging everything inside one's own 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.380
 mass also also the dough has a 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.420
 softer touch is not seen as 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.480
 principle that good seems like an entity 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.300
 a little report and such 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.019
 once mixed in 2 bowls we will put a 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.019
 little bit of flour 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.920
 We will cut the 2 mass and give it a 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.620
 Quick kneading simply to give 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.120
 ball shape 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.250
 We will leave each ball in each of the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.590
 bulls and we'll cover them with fill 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.400
 transparent let stand the dough 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.930
 so that it rises for a day we could 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.610
 leave it less time but we already 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.250
 It is convenient that the fermentation be more 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.580
 long to thus give it more flavor 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.580
 to the bread 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.560
 and 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.750
 and the next day once raised on 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.980
 the table we will put a little flour and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.980
 we will remove the dough from the bowl 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.180
 We will give you a quick kneading in which 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.690
 about everything we will do 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.690
 classify the mass 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.609
 after the mass do we have to go 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.980
 shaping and taking tension the mass 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.170
 For this, what we do is like 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.120
 you can see in the video go taking the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.060
 mass of the ends and we're going to 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.520
 referring to herself 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.920
 and good for me at the end and longer 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.780
 a bit like bar form but 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.650
 you could leave it in a more round shape 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.959
 a little bit to your liking 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.150
 so we'll have to let them rest 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.560
 3 or 4 hours 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.750
 we should leave it on a cloth of 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.299
 Linen I've done it on paper 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.280
 bake we cover it with a rag and 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.870
 we should put something on the sides for 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.220
 that the mass will not be spilled and 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.220
 stay after formed 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.829
 we will heat the oven to 220 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.570
 degrees and we introduce inside a tray 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.450
 with water 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.650
 this will make it release steam and this 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.639
 it's good for you to make a good 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.069
 Cortex 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.499
 the bread before putting it in the oven what 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.150
 what you will have is that with a knife 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:35.090
 make an incision that goes because of 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.310
 end to end 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.650
 and in this case, I stayed a little 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.600
 short on one of the loaves and you can see 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.180
 that the result is that it's broken by 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.490
 below and even above you see that 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.430
 has almost no opening 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.590
 With water we will leave it for 20 minutes 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.410
 then we remove the water we lower the 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.280
 oven temperature to 200 degrees and what 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.320
 we leave 35 more minutes 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.780
 and with that we'll have our bread 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.480
 of olives that we will have to leave it to 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.460
 cool before cutting it I hope you 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.610
 have liked the recipe until the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.610
 following
