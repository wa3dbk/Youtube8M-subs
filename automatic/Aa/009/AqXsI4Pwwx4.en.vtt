00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.469
 who are happy 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.280
 tender little creatures in the desert 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.280
 are the meerkats 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.060
 loud smaller 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 they are also extremely curious and 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.390
 when a stranger comes he becomes polite 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.390
 and received with friendly interest 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 itself becomes a poisonous cobra 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.750
 inspected and friendship 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 asked 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.979
 and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.289
 An egg can be really frustrating 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.590
 meerkatze knows that something good in there 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.340
 is 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:54.649
 but how do you get to the mungo 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.630
 resembles the meerkat , but it is very similar 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.340
 from another animal family if 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.340
 A Mongolian finds he manages to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:08.360
 next stone brings into position 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:09.560
 sighted briefly and shoots the meerkat 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.959
 but does not have this 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.190
 science she is always used to 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.049
 to dig their food 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.489
 that's why she instinctively tries her 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.730
 problem to solve by giving 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.110
 but that may not work 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.930
 she can learn by the mungo 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.930
 Watched it looks good 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.799
 where it looks so easy
