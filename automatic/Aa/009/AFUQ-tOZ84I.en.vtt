nickel metal hydride battery as you can

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.690 
nickel metal hydride battery as you can
see<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> looks<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.130> something<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> come

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
see it looks like something that come

see it looks like something that come
from<00:00:35.820> China<00:00:37.460> but<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
from China but you can see here that it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.660 
from China but you can see here that it
has<00:00:40.969> three<00:00:41.969> prongs<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.430> totally

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
has three prongs but it is totally

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.340 
has three prongs but it is totally
different<00:00:45.270> setup<00:00:45.899> than<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:48.920> branded

see it's got three prongs also and as
you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:08.180> this<00:01:09.180> prong<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you can see this prong here is the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
you can see this prong here is the
positive<00:01:11.299> from<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> batteries<00:01:12.869> from<00:01:13.080> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
positive from the batteries from this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.359 
positive from the batteries from this
white<00:01:13.500> wire<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.990> Center<00:01:16.409> post<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
white wire this Center post here is the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
white wire this Center post here is the
negative<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> two<00:01:19.259> leads

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
negative as you can see the two leads

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.359 
negative as you can see the two leads
from<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> thermistor<00:01:20.869> come<00:01:21.869> off<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
from the thermistor come off of it it

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.280 
from the thermistor come off of it it
actually<00:01:23.549> also<00:01:24.150> goes<00:01:24.390> into<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> negative

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
actually also goes into the negative

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.649 
actually also goes into the negative
side<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:29.159> other<00:01:29.460> side<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> mr.<00:01:30.390> goes

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
side and the other side of the mr. goes

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.380 
side and the other side of the mr. goes
to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> third<00:01:31.530> prong<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.759> battery<00:01:33.560> prong

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
to the third prong of the battery prong

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.020 
to the third prong of the battery prong
on<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.979> totally<00:01:38.549> different<00:01:38.670> set

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
on this one it's totally different set

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:50.630 
on this one it's totally different set
up<00:01:42.950> spend<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:48.049> all<00:01:49.049> right<00:01:49.640> as

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
up spend get it out of here all right as

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.789 
up spend get it out of here all right as
you<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:53.180> it<00:01:54.180> has<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:56.360> 70<00:01:57.360> sees<00:01:57.799> mini

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
you can see here it has a 70 sees mini

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.999 
you can see here it has a 70 sees mini
switch<00:01:59.159> there<00:02:00.170> thermostat<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> guess<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
switch there thermostat I guess what you

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.800 
switch there thermostat I guess what you
would<00:02:02.130> call<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:05.810> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
would call it as you can see here the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.260 
would call it as you can see here the
positive<00:02:07.020> side<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.530> battery<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.759> side<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
positive side to battery one side of the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.670 
positive side to battery one side of the
switch<00:02:09.509> goes<00:02:09.780> into<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.379> goes<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.640> switch

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
switch goes into it goes to the switch

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.300 
switch goes into it goes to the switch
the<00:02:13.859> switch<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.959> guess<00:02:15.959> they<00:02:16.140> did<00:02:16.319> looped<00:02:17.129> it

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the switch I guess they did looped it

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.000 
the switch I guess they did looped it
down<00:02:17.459> into<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.790> battery<00:02:18.150> pack<00:02:18.359> for<00:02:18.689> I<00:02:19.049> guess

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
down into the battery pack for I guess

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.830 
down into the battery pack for I guess
they<00:02:20.430> should<00:02:20.459> have<00:02:20.700> cut<00:02:20.849> it<00:02:20.939> shorter<00:02:21.299> but<00:02:21.480> it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
they should have cut it shorter but it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.209 
they should have cut it shorter but it
actually<00:02:22.019> just<00:02:22.230> goes<00:02:22.590> down<00:02:22.829> in<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.069> and

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
actually just goes down in there and

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.039 
actually just goes down in there and
comes<00:02:23.400> back<00:02:23.670> up<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.939> goes<00:02:27.150> over<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
comes back up and it goes over to the

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.379 
comes back up and it goes over to the
third<00:02:28.349> prong<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.819> want<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.090> measure<00:02:30.239> that

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
third prong and I want to measure that

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.440 
third prong and I want to measure that
third<00:02:31.290> prong<00:02:31.680> I'm<00:02:32.340> getting<00:02:32.700> full<00:02:32.879> battery

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
third prong I'm getting full battery

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.119 
third prong I'm getting full battery
voltage<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.079> guess<00:02:34.349> what<00:02:34.530> they're<00:02:34.680> doing<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
voltage so I guess what they're doing is

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.539 
voltage so I guess what they're doing is
taking<00:02:36.349> battery<00:02:37.349> power<00:02:39.379> from<00:02:40.379> this<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:40.950> red

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
taking battery power from this or red

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.140 
taking battery power from this or red
lead<00:02:41.819> here<00:02:42.209> down<00:02:42.599> through<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.079> switch<00:02:43.889> out<00:02:44.310> of

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
lead here down through the switch out of

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.000 
lead here down through the switch out of
the<00:02:45.239> switch<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.450> over<00:02:48.780> into<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.470> third<00:02:49.680> prong

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
the switch and over into the third prong

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.449 
the switch and over into the third prong
which<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.209> totally<00:02:51.659> different<00:02:51.840> than

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
which that is totally different than

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.619 
which that is totally different than
this<00:02:53.459> setup<00:02:53.790> where<00:02:54.209> they<00:02:54.389> have<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
this setup where they have the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.140 
this setup where they have the
thermistor<00:02:54.989> going<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.889> from<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.819> negative

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
thermistor going in from the negative

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.159 
thermistor going in from the negative
side<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:59.030> then<00:03:00.030> comes<00:03:00.269> out<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.599> goes<00:03:00.750> over<00:03:00.959> to

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
side and then comes out and goes over to

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.080 
side and then comes out and goes over to
the<00:03:01.230> third<00:03:01.379> prong<00:03:01.709> if<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.489> actually<00:03:02.669> measure

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
the third prong if I actually measure

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.709 
the third prong if I actually measure
this<00:03:03.859> actually<00:03:04.859> I'll<00:03:05.040> get<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.310> ohm<00:03:05.969> resistance

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
this actually I'll get a ohm resistance

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.929 
this actually I'll get a ohm resistance
depending<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.919> veldt<00:03:08.189> temperature<00:03:08.909> of

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
depending on the veldt temperature of

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:16.390 
depending on the veldt temperature of
the<00:03:09.090> battery<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.810> I'll<00:03:12.810> pull<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.219> switch<00:03:14.219> out

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
the battery so I'll pull this switch out

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.259 
the battery so I'll pull this switch out
the<00:03:17.400> tach

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
the tach

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.009 
the tach
I<00:03:19.790> can<00:03:20.790> focus<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.329> on<00:03:21.479> it<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:21.870> see

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
I can focus in on it and you can see

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.379 
I can focus in on it and you can see
there<00:03:22.229> it<00:03:22.349> says<00:03:22.379> 70<00:03:23.010> C<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:24.470> guess<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:26.269> don't<00:03:27.269> know

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
there it says 70 C I guess I don't know

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.939 
there it says 70 C I guess I don't know
what<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.780> purpose<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.379> is<00:03:28.500> if<00:03:28.680> that's<00:03:28.769> the

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
what the purpose of it is if that's the

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:32.149 
what the purpose of it is if that's the
way<00:03:29.099> they<00:03:29.340> design<00:03:29.939> these<00:03:30.919> battery<00:03:31.919> pack

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
way they design these battery pack

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.280 
way they design these battery pack
carrier<00:03:32.639> nickel<00:03:33.239> metal<00:03:33.329> hydride<00:03:33.510> batteries

carrier nickel metal hydride batteries
the<00:03:34.409> charges<00:03:34.859> I'm<00:03:35.549> not<00:03:35.879> sure<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.449> just<00:03:36.569> kind

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the charges I'm not sure it's just kind

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.319 
the charges I'm not sure it's just kind
of<00:03:36.840> different<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.609> can<00:03:38.699> see<00:03:38.849> it's<00:03:39.000> cheap

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
of different and you can see it's cheap

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.550 
of different and you can see it's cheap
because<00:03:39.479> they<00:03:39.569> got<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.079> side<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.349> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
because they got it on the side of the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.020 
because they got it on the side of the
battery<00:03:40.769> pack<00:03:41.810> versus<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:42.989> one<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.319> down<00:03:44.030> in

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
battery pack versus this one is down in

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.899 
battery pack versus this one is down in
the<00:03:45.689> center<00:03:46.970> wrapped<00:03:47.970> around<00:03:48.150> some<00:03:48.870> tape<00:03:49.909> and

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
the center wrapped around some tape and

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.929 
the center wrapped around some tape and
they<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.209> have<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.389> one<00:03:51.659> stuck<00:03:51.959> on<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
they just have that one stuck on to the

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.879 
they just have that one stuck on to the
side<00:03:56.329> which<00:03:57.329> for<00:03:57.629> 40<00:03:57.930> bucks<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.739> know<00:03:58.829> you

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
side which for 40 bucks you know you

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.289 
side which for 40 bucks you know you
really<00:03:59.099> can't<00:03:59.400> beat<00:03:59.639> it<00:03:59.759> but<00:03:59.939> I<00:04:00.030> was<00:04:00.150> just

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
really can't beat it but I was just

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.710 
really can't beat it but I was just
wondering<00:04:00.720> if<00:04:01.459> if<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.639> took<00:04:02.759> because<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.449> have<00:04:03.599> an

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
wondering if if I took because I have an

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.599 
wondering if if I took because I have an
old<00:04:04.019> battery<00:04:04.379> pack<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:05.129> has<00:04:05.370> that

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
old battery pack that has that

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.780 
old battery pack that has that
thermistor<00:04:05.970> if<00:04:06.329> I<00:04:06.449> just<00:04:06.689> rewired<00:04:07.109> it<00:04:07.790> like

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
thermistor if I just rewired it like

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.289 
thermistor if I just rewired it like
that<00:04:09.030> one<00:04:10.250> if<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.579> would<00:04:11.759> be<00:04:12.269> better

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
that one if it would be better

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.249 
that one if it would be better
performance<00:04:13.139> if<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.979> charger<00:04:14.430> would<00:04:15.259> would

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
performance if the charger would would

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.620 
performance if the charger would would
do<00:04:16.440> better<00:04:16.680> or<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.239> just<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.539> way

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
do better or is this just the way

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.879 
do better or is this just the way
they've<00:04:18.959> set<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.259> up<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:21.690> do<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.049> type<00:04:22.860> of

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
they've set it up to do this type of

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.620 
they've set it up to do this type of
battery<00:04:23.250> pack<00:04:23.639> that<00:04:24.120> was<00:04:24.300> just<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.539> only

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
battery pack that was just the only

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.700 
battery pack that was just the only
thing<00:04:24.719> I<00:04:24.990> was<00:04:25.139> curious<00:04:25.440> about

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.670 

so<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:29.740> guess<00:04:29.950> it's<00:04:30.160> really<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:31.530> can<00:04:32.530> see

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
so I guess it's really it you can see

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.910 
so I guess it's really it you can see
the<00:04:32.890> these<00:04:33.220> these<00:04:33.870> branded<00:04:34.870> batteries<00:04:35.260> have

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
the these these branded batteries have

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:43.290 
the these these branded batteries have
these<00:04:36.160> Formica<00:04:40.080> covers<00:04:41.610> things<00:04:42.610> see<00:04:42.880> one<00:04:43.060> here

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
these Formica covers things see one here

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.650 
these Formica covers things see one here
is<00:04:43.450> I've<00:04:43.540> got<00:04:43.570> one<00:04:43.840> took<00:04:44.050> took<00:04:44.560> apart<00:04:45.450> and<00:04:46.450> it's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
is I've got one took took apart and it's

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.540 
is I've got one took took apart and it's
a<00:04:46.930> little<00:04:47.800> more<00:04:47.980> I<00:04:49.650> guess<00:04:50.650> heat<00:04:50.860> resistant<00:04:51.430> and

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
a little more I guess heat resistant and

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.590 
a little more I guess heat resistant and
they<00:04:51.670> have<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.060> like<00:04:52.360> sticky<00:04:53.290> cardboard<00:04:54.600> on

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
they have this like sticky cardboard on

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.830 
they have this like sticky cardboard on
this<00:04:55.900> battery<00:04:56.110> pack<00:04:57.120> on<00:04:58.120> both<00:04:58.360> sides<00:04:58.740> versus

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
this battery pack on both sides versus

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.150 
this battery pack on both sides versus
that<00:05:01.840> now<00:05:02.800> this<00:05:02.980> battery<00:05:03.370> pack<00:05:03.430> did<00:05:03.820> have<00:05:04.000> a

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
that now this battery pack did have a

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.220 
that now this battery pack did have a
heat<00:05:06.160> shrink<00:05:06.400> heat<00:05:07.030> shrink<00:05:07.360> material<00:05:07.930> around

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
heat shrink heat shrink material around

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.930 
heat shrink heat shrink material around
and<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:08.410> took<00:05:08.470> it<00:05:08.770> off<00:05:08.920> so<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.190> could<00:05:09.340> look<00:05:09.730> inside

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
and I took it off so I could look inside

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.640 
and I took it off so I could look inside
of<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.450> see<00:05:10.840> how<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.050> was<00:05:11.140> made

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
of it see how it was made

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.580 
of it see how it was made
but<00:05:12.550> these<00:05:12.760> branded<00:05:13.180> batteries<00:05:14.340> her<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:16.590> little

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
but these branded batteries her a little

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.220 
but these branded batteries her a little
more<00:05:17.770> built<00:05:18.130> for<00:05:19.090> durability<00:05:19.240> versus<00:05:20.080> this

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
more built for durability versus this

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.880 
more built for durability versus this
one<00:05:20.260> cuz<00:05:20.710> you<00:05:20.800> can<00:05:20.890> see<00:05:20.980> all<00:05:21.100> the<00:05:22.650> sails<00:05:23.650> are

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
one cuz you can see all the sails are

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.880 
one cuz you can see all the sails are
all<00:05:24.040> loose<00:05:25.140> so<00:05:26.140> I<00:05:26.170> don't<00:05:26.410> think<00:05:26.500> this<00:05:26.680> one

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
all loose so I don't think this one

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.120 
all loose so I don't think this one
would<00:05:27.010> take<00:05:27.130> very<00:05:27.370> much<00:05:27.520> dropping<00:05:28.590> but<00:05:29.590> again

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
would take very much dropping but again

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.320 
would take very much dropping but again
this<00:05:30.310> forty<00:05:30.640> bucks<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:33.400> was<00:05:33.580> what<00:05:34.300> I
