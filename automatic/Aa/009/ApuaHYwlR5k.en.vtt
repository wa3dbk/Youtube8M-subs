realize it was a dead end there is

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.200 
realize it was a dead end there is
something<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:32.640> later<00:00:32.880> there's<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
something there later there's a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.760 
something there later there's a
weaponsmith<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.870> appears<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.290> Katamon

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
weaponsmith it appears from Katamon

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.400 
weaponsmith it appears from Katamon
there<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.489> epic<00:00:35.730> weapons<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.450> when<00:00:37.320> i

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
there for the epic weapons but when i

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.200 
there for the epic weapons but when i
use<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.739> padam<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.399> spot<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.090> be

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
use in padam on that spot is going to be

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.569 
use in padam on that spot is going to be
absolutely<00:00:39.420> useless<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.350> us

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.000 

so<00:00:46.300> currently<00:00:46.539> I<00:00:46.719> guess<00:00:46.960> this<00:00:47.170> is<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.739> only

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
so currently I guess this is the only

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.470 
so currently I guess this is the only
way<00:00:48.219> a<00:00:48.249> challenge<00:00:48.670> sector<00:00:48.999> pretty<00:00:49.210> much<00:00:49.329> all

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
way a challenge sector pretty much all

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.849 
way a challenge sector pretty much all
the<00:00:49.600> other<00:00:49.719> holes<00:00:49.989> in<00:00:50.140> North<00:00:50.289> sector<00:00:50.620> leaked

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
the other holes in North sector leaked

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:57.619 
the other holes in North sector leaked
other<00:00:51.190> holes<00:00:51.489> in<00:00:51.760> your<00:00:51.909> sector<00:00:52.239> seriously

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.729 

yeah<00:00:58.629> I<00:00:58.690> guess<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.170> pretty<00:00:59.409> sure<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.679> is

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
yeah I guess so the pretty sure this is

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.799 
yeah I guess so the pretty sure this is
the<00:01:00.039> only<00:01:00.190> legit<00:01:00.789> way<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.329> get<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.659> north

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
the only legit way to get to north

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.760 
the only legit way to get to north
center<00:01:02.229> from<00:01:02.439> any<00:01:03.129> other<00:01:03.280> sector<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.680> I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
center from any other sector but I

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.590 
center from any other sector but I
haven't<00:01:05.950> exclusively<00:01:06.610> check<00:01:06.789> valve<00:01:07.000> nap<00:01:07.270> so

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600
