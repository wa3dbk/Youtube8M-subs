00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.199
 bike ride on the banks of the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.939
 garonne 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.980
 the days of coralie balmy begins 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.160
 always so at 8 o'clock this big 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.449
 hope of swimming is walking from 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.489
 since the age of 4 the oat are 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.390
 elements who came to read six years of his 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.550
 natal martinique 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.500
 today she affirms her ambitions 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.360
 I came here because I thought 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.960
 that really I could do stuff 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.559
 well already in the junior category and 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.450
 after I've been saying to him for two years 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.090
 that I can tickets maybe a place 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.219
 at the Olympics but the difficulty 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.140
 for coralie balmy is to swim on the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.039
 the same distance as laure manaudou the 400 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 m freestyle 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.940
 yet at the last championships of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.070
 France under the watch of his mother 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.989
 straight from the martini coralie is paying the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.869
 luxury to delight the title of champion of 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.150
 france to manaudou balmy happy then 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.920
 that manaudou burst into tears the end 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.920
 complex of a young girl reserved 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.060
 she was missing a little bit of trust 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.979
 in it 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.270
 her fault in training she was 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.159
 treated again but as soon as 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.950
 were competing she not down 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.950
 means and that's been a year now a 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.380
 little more than a year she really did 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.700
 confidence in her always shy puts 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.159
 now his complex 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.840
 at 21, she finally comes out of her reserve 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.580
 but sometimes it's still a puzzle 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.229
 for his coach 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.429
 at first I needed to have a wall 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 opposite because we do not know 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:50.159
 she thinks it's okay if it's okay 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.159
 if what they say welcome him to the point so 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.939
 we had to really learn how to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.000
 know 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.100
 when there is not his hand screw it's me 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 miss Martinique and yes it's for sure 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.189
 it's hard but hey I tell myself that I 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.509
 come back twice a year my mother comes and 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.050
 it's becoming as often as possible 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.250
 so it goes far from her roots she 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.440
 threw herself headlong into 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.209
 training to overcome his shyness 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 so much so that it has become a 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.709
 formidable swimmer capable perhaps of 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.879
 get on an Olympic podium in a 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.879
 month and a half to Beijing
