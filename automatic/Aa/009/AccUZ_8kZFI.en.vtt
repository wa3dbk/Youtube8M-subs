00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.359 
take up a pipette rasaan and and there's
just<00:00:25.350> something<00:00:25.590> I've<00:00:25.680> always<00:00:25.800> wanted<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.250> do

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.160 
but the place of drones you know they're
expensive<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.180> don't<00:00:33.690> really<00:00:33.840> want<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
expensive and so I don't really want to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.860 
expensive and so I don't really want to
spend<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.590> much<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.250> massive<00:00:35.850> troop<00:00:36.210> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
