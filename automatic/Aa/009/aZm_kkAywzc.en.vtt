00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
been getting on obviously makes sense

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.569 
been getting on obviously makes sense
from<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.209> technical<00:03:33.480> perspective<00:03:33.870> also<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
from a technical perspective also the

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.309 
from a technical perspective also the
xbox<00:03:35.909> 360<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.629> definitely<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.079> go<00:03:37.260> to

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
xbox 360 is definitely the go to

xbox 360 is definitely the go to
next-gen<00:03:37.950> system<00:03:38.310> for<00:03:38.549> right<00:03:38.670> now<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:38.909> that's

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
next-gen system for right now so that's

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.240 
next-gen system for right now so that's
why<00:03:39.420> we're<00:03:39.569> focusing<00:03:39.930> right<00:03:40.019> now<00:03:40.079> if<00:03:40.349> that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
why we're focusing right now if that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.470 
why we're focusing right now if that
becomes<00:03:41.430> something<00:03:41.730> else<00:03:41.939> will<00:03:42.180> go<00:03:42.299> there

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
becomes something else will go there

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.360 
becomes something else will go there
will<00:03:42.870> go<00:03:43.019> wherever<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.439> goes<00:03:43.650> right<00:03:44.129> now<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
will go wherever that goes right now the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.250 
will go wherever that goes right now the
