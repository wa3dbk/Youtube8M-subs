00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
now that's on my mind is something that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.900 
now that's on my mind is something that
people<00:00:18.480> really<00:00:18.630> aren't<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:20.100> focusing<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
people really aren't like focusing that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.090 
people really aren't like focusing that
much<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.630> much<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.380> they<00:00:22.500> should<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
much on as much as they should be and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.519 
much on as much as they should be and
that's<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> cards<00:00:25.439> that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that's do with one of the cards that

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.130 
that's do with one of the cards that
actually<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.609> new<00:00:26.910> phyrexia<00:00:27.180> called<00:00:27.810> it's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

craters so
are<00:02:13.440> actually<00:02:13.830> think<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.100> red<00:02:14.280> freighter<00:02:14.580> is

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
are actually think the red freighter is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.270 
are actually think the red freighter is
pretty<00:02:15.570> good<00:02:15.720> write<00:02:16.350> down<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.800> he's<00:02:16.980> kind

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
pretty good write down I think he's kind

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.060 
pretty good write down I think he's kind
