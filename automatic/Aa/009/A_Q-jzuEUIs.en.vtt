Daedalus seems like a freaky dude he is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.280 
Daedalus seems like a freaky dude he is
like<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:23.090> guess<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.600> haven't<00:01:23.870> finished

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290

like the I guess you haven't finished
again<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.730> idea<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.470> I<00:01:27.730> want<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:28.970> say

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
again so the idea is that I want to say

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.910 
again so the idea is that I want to say
Matthew<00:01:29.570> Shepard<00:01:30.050> but<00:01:30.410> that's<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.770> guy<00:01:30.890> from

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
Matthew Shepard but that's the guy from

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.500 
Matthew Shepard but that's the guy from
loss<00:01:31.340> yeah<00:01:31.760> I<00:01:32.000> can't<00:01:32.480> even

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
loss yeah I can't even

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.980

Jack<00:01:35.510> Sparrow<00:01:35.869> Jack<00:01:36.820> Sparrow<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.210> no<00:01:38.510> that's

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
Jack Sparrow Jack Sparrow the no that's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.020 
Jack Sparrow Jack Sparrow the no that's
the<00:01:39.140> guy<00:01:39.350> from<00:01:39.760> parts<00:01:40.760> of<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:40.970> Caribbean

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
the guy from parts of the Caribbean

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.800 
the guy from parts of the Caribbean
Caribbean

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.039 

Nathan<00:01:47.619> Hale<00:01:47.920> Nathan<00:01:48.490> Hale<00:01:48.790> Wow<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.780> can't

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
Nathan Hale Nathan Hale Wow I can't

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.750 
Nathan Hale Nathan Hale Wow I can't
believe<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.979> remember<00:01:51.580> that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
believe you remember that

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.230 
believe you remember that
anyway<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.990> idea<00:01:53.260> is<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.790> Nathan<00:01:54.790> Hale

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
anyway so the idea is that Nathan Hale

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.670 
anyway so the idea is that Nathan Hale
is<00:01:56.009> part<00:01:57.009> one<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.670> two<00:01:58.180> experiments<00:01:59.080> involved

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
is part one of two experiments involved

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.030 
is part one of two experiments involved
in<00:01:59.830> like<00:02:00.070> creating<00:02:00.820> an<00:02:01.000> ultimate<00:02:01.479> form<00:02:01.840> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
in like creating an ultimate form of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.800 
in like creating an ultimate form of
chimera<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.940> Daedalus<00:02:04.149> is<00:02:04.780> part<00:02:05.710> two<00:02:06.810> so

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
chimera and the Daedalus is part two so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.740 
chimera and the Daedalus is part two so
he's<00:02:08.140> like<00:02:08.350> your<00:02:08.500> brother<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.819> he's<00:02:10.420> kind<00:02:10.720> of

and<00:05:26.830> there's<00:05:27.340> a<00:05:27.690> waypoint<00:05:28.690> a<00:05:29.230> star<00:05:29.560> above<00:05:30.070> each

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
and there's a waypoint a star above each

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.530 
and there's a waypoint a star above each
thing<00:05:31.660> that<00:05:31.840> you<00:05:31.930> have<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.110> shoot<00:05:33.300> that<00:05:34.300> has

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
thing that you have to shoot that has

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.180 
thing that you have to shoot that has
like<00:05:34.750> electricity<00:05:35.170> running<00:05:35.680> from<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.980> main

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
like electricity running from the main

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.310 
like electricity running from the main
node<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.880> side<00:05:37.150> note<00:05:37.420> and<00:05:37.960> you<00:05:38.050> kind<00:05:38.260> of

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
node to the side note and you kind of

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.570 
node to the side note and you kind of
need<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.470> wait<00:05:38.710> for<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:40.180> data<00:05:40.450> list<00:05:40.630> to<00:05:41.340> get<00:05:42.340> in

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
need to wait for the data list to get in

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.290 
need to wait for the data list to get in
that<00:05:43.090> stream<00:05:43.630> of<00:05:43.750> electricity<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.820> then<00:05:45.820> when

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
that stream of electricity and then when

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.530 
that stream of electricity and then when
he<00:05:46.390> gets<00:05:46.480> in<00:05:46.690> that<00:05:46.720> shoe<00:05:47.110> mode<00:05:47.290> of<00:05:47.710> electricity

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
he gets in that shoe mode of electricity

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.600 
he gets in that shoe mode of electricity
shoot<00:05:49.540> that<00:05:49.780> node<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.380> then<00:05:51.100> he'll<00:05:51.460> get

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
shoot that node and then he'll get

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.120 
shoot that node and then he'll get
damaged<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.300> think<00:05:52.510> you<00:05:52.570> could<00:05:52.660> do<00:05:52.780> it

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
damaged and I think you could do it

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.040 
damaged and I think you could do it
three<00:05:54.130> times<00:05:54.160> obviously<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.210> rules<00:05:55.480> degree

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
three times obviously the rules degree

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:03.810 
three times obviously the rules degree
for<00:05:56.410> video<00:05:56.620> games<00:05:56.890> then<00:05:59.280> he<00:06:00.280> will<00:06:00.520> die<00:06:02.820> all

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
for video games then he will die all

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.440 
for video games then he will die all
right<00:06:04.500> yeah<00:06:05.500> we<00:06:06.340> got<00:06:06.460> one<00:06:06.640> more<00:06:06.790> video<00:06:07.000> after

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
right yeah we got one more video after

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.510
