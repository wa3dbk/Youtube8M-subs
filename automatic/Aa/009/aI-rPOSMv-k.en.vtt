00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
ahead and give a little more beam see

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.070 
ahead and give a little more beam see
how<00:02:09.930> it<00:02:10.050> does<00:02:10.230> and<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.470> put<00:02:10.620> it<00:02:10.710> at<00:02:10.830> 11<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.990> you

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
how it does and I put it at 11 and you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.180 
how it does and I put it at 11 and you
want<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.290> double-check<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.860> after<00:02:17.070> you're

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
want to double-check it after you're

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.390 
want to double-check it after you're
done<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.850> was<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.120> there<00:02:18.270> really<00:02:18.420> good

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.280 

and<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.150> one<00:02:25.300> here<00:02:25.480> will<00:02:25.569> fit<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:25.840> top<00:02:26.080> that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and this one here will fit on top that

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.230 
and this one here will fit on top that
bolt<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:26.739> that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.690 

I'm<00:02:34.140> gonna<00:02:34.230> use<00:02:34.350> my<00:02:34.530> Stanley<00:02:34.860> drill<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.490> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
I'm gonna use my Stanley drill on the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.780 
I'm gonna use my Stanley drill on the
filter<00:02:36.240> with<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> bolt<00:02:36.750> here<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.070> dual

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
filter with the bolt here this is a dual

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.020 
filter with the bolt here this is a dual
speed<00:02:39.180> drill<00:02:39.540> goes<00:02:40.020> up<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> 1,200<00:02:40.740> rpms<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.460> have

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
speed drill goes up to 1,200 rpms I have

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270 
speed drill goes up to 1,200 rpms I have
it<00:02:42.150> set<00:02:42.390> right<00:02:42.570> now<00:02:42.900> 350<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:44.070> should<00:02:44.190> be

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
it set right now 350 there should be

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.010 
it set right now 350 there should be
sufficient<00:02:44.760> with<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.000> drill<00:02:45.270> it's<00:02:45.780> really

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
sufficient with this drill it's really

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:57.500 
sufficient with this drill it's really
powerful

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.910 

with<00:02:57.840> spring<00:02:58.140> barrel<00:02:58.379> nut<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.590> want<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.800> make

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
with spring barrel nut you want to make

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.259 
with spring barrel nut you want to make
sure<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.220> Springs<00:02:59.640> all<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.879> way<00:02:59.970> collapse

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
sure that Springs all the way collapse

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.699 
sure that Springs all the way collapse
over<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.750> bolt<00:03:01.200> here<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.500> don't<00:03:01.590> see

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
over the bolt here you don't see

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.250 
over the bolt here you don't see
anything<00:03:02.069> through<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.370> cracks<00:03:02.610> here<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:04.080> sit

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
anything through the cracks here so sit

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.910 
anything through the cracks here so sit
at<00:03:04.349> 350<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.099> should<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.459> on<00:03:05.640> really<00:03:05.909> good

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.589 

and<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.010> can<00:03:14.129> see<00:03:14.280> they're<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.790> at<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:14.970> rpm

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
and you can see they're just at that rpm

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.470 
and you can see they're just at that rpm
we<00:03:15.750> got<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.080> bolt<00:03:16.290> on<00:03:16.500> really<00:03:16.830> good<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.390> I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
we got that bolt on really good and I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.910 
we got that bolt on really good and I
like<00:03:18.599> how<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.810> multi<00:03:19.140> talked<00:03:19.349> this<00:03:19.530> over<00:03:19.680> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
like how the multi talked this over the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.500 
like how the multi talked this over the
clamp<00:03:20.129> even<00:03:20.430> if<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.580> sticks<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:21.030> beyond<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
clamp even if it sticks out beyond the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.350 
clamp even if it sticks out beyond the
bolt<00:03:21.750> here<00:03:22.019> like<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.410> here<00:03:23.060> right<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.209> over

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
bolt here like this here right on over

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.500 
bolt here like this here right on over
that

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.720 

right<00:03:30.050> now<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.200> have<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.530> drill<00:03:30.770> set<00:03:31.010> at<00:03:31.129> 350

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
right now I have this drill set at 350

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.479 
right now I have this drill set at 350
rpms

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.500 

so<00:03:36.489> getting<00:03:36.730> him<00:03:36.849> off<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.180> easy<00:03:37.360> part

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
so getting him off is the easy part

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.789 
so getting him off is the easy part
we're<00:03:37.870> gonna<00:03:37.989> put<00:03:38.230> this<00:03:38.319> filter<00:03:38.560> back

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
we're gonna put this filter back

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.350 
we're gonna put this filter back
together<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.519> put<00:03:39.640> them<00:03:39.760> back<00:03:39.879> on

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
together and you put them back on

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.179 
together and you put them back on
I<00:03:40.470> got<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> drill<00:03:41.769> still<00:03:42.069> set<00:03:42.310> on<00:03:42.340> 350<00:03:43.269> rpms

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.580 

and<00:03:48.189> that's<00:03:49.060> on<00:03:49.239> there<00:03:49.390> nice<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.569> tight<00:03:49.870> that

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
and that's on there nice and tight that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.569 
and that's on there nice and tight that

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
was really easy this side here and that

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.250 
was really easy this side here and that
multi-tow<00:03:58.180> socket<00:03:58.599> work<00:03:58.750> great<00:03:58.989> on<00:03:59.019> this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
multi-tow socket work great on this

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.649 
multi-tow socket work great on this
three<00:03:59.769> filter<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.730> here's<00:04:00.879> a<00:04:00.940> hayward<00:04:01.090> filter

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
three filter and here's a hayward filter

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.929 
three filter and here's a hayward filter
with<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.959> smaller<00:04:02.319> bolt<00:04:02.650> we're<00:04:03.609> gonna<00:04:03.760> take

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
with a smaller bolt we're gonna take

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.460 
with a smaller bolt we're gonna take
this<00:04:04.060> off<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.299> reverse<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.870> multi<00:04:05.200> torque

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
this off and reverse the multi torque

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.030 
this off and reverse the multi torque
sockets<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:08.349> it<00:04:08.470> should<00:04:08.620> fit<00:04:08.769> over<00:04:08.950> there

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
sockets and it should fit over there

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.059 
sockets and it should fit over there
nicely<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.549> also<00:04:09.670> fits<00:04:09.970> over<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.239> Jandy

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
nicely it also fits over the Jandy

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:20.069 
nicely it also fits over the Jandy
filter<00:04:12.069> bolts<00:04:12.370> edit<00:04:13.329> at<00:04:13.450> 350<00:04:14.260> rpm<00:04:14.680> still<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.959> I

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
filter bolts edit at 350 rpm still and I

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.240 
filter bolts edit at 350 rpm still and I
took<00:04:20.289> it<00:04:20.380> right<00:04:20.530> out<00:04:20.590> there

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
took it right out there

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.070 
took it right out there
I<00:04:21.280> mean<00:04:21.910> you<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.060> same<00:04:22.270> speed<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.720> get<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.870> back

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
I mean you the same speed to get it back

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:35.369 
I mean you the same speed to get it back
on<00:04:23.289> here

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.279 

and<00:04:36.379> so<00:04:36.530> that's<00:04:36.710> not<00:04:36.830> there<00:04:36.979> no<00:04:37.129> problem<00:04:38.289> and

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
and so that's not there no problem and

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.749 
and so that's not there no problem and
so<00:04:39.409> I<00:04:39.440> highly<00:04:39.650> recommend<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:40.220> multi<00:04:40.520> torque

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
so I highly recommend the multi torque

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.159 
so I highly recommend the multi torque
socket<00:04:41.120> sets<00:04:41.360> where<00:04:41.539> your<00:04:41.659> filter<00:04:41.810> cleaning

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
socket sets where your filter cleaning

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.719 
socket sets where your filter cleaning
and<00:04:42.409> make<00:04:42.500> sticking<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:43.009> bolt<00:04:43.190> on<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.639> off

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
and make sticking the bolt on and off

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.790 
and make sticking the bolt on and off
very<00:04:44.150> easy<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.199> makes<00:04:45.229> your<00:04:45.530> filter

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
very easy and it makes your filter

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.280 
very easy and it makes your filter
cleaning<00:04:46.009> a<00:04:46.159> breeze
