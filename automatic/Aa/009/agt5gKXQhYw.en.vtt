00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.130
 hello everyone I'm close to canet like 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.380
 you see I'm a little busy I have the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.420
 Messy desk because I've 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.890
 restored the system with a copy of 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.440
 security since he was giving me 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.600
 problems and I'm replenishing the changes 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.760
 today I will teach you to remove those options 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.190
 of the contextual menu that appear when giving 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.260
 right click and in the new section we 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.210
 a stream of things come out 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.280
 programs that I installed I have already 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.410
 erased a few options but I've 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.750
 fallen into the idea of ​​teaching you how to do it 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.700
 to you also for that we need 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.190
 a program that you have in the link of the 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.340
 description the registry editor of 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.350
 windows and the information is already 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.129
 I took out of this web that I leave you also in 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 the description 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.530
 and good we started the program is called 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.570
 king scanner when opening it we will leave the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.210
 window that I show you next 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.670
 otherwise you give the same button as 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.649
 I for you to appear we write the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.210
 words the new that is the name of the 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.759
 new call entry in the menu 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.429
 contextual and we leave all these 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.569
 options that are the roots 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.970
 selected in blue to scan 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:42.700
 in all of them we give to ok 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.590
 and will start looking for these tickets that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.360
 are in the extensions of 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.370
 file to which the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.860
 files in the new menu submenu 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.720
 contextual is to say all the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.450
 file extensions have a 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.310
 entry in the windows registry to 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.560
 that a file with that extension is 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.810
 find in the new submenu should have 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.120
 a submenu called the new in your entry 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.300
 in the record that refers to the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.910
 contextual menu I hope you have it 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.130
 understood if you do not study it for yours 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.130
 account though few will interest you this 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.680
 continue for a while scanning me now I'm going 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.069
 to pause the video and I'm going out now 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.069
 I come back 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.250
 hello good I've already returned and as has already 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.260
 finished scanning as we continue through 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.870
 true do not think it takes two hours in 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.660
 scan takes a moment alone I had 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.290
 things to do now let's see how 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.510
 eliminate the elements that we do not want 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.390
 for example flash document I do not 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.370
 interest press on him 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.609
 just to see its extent that in 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.739
 this case is point f l if you can not see 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.079
 the file extension at the end of 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.299
 video I explain how to find out 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.480
 we go to the program king scanner and we give 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.700
 on the search button as in the video 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.980
 we write fl icand right click on 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.260
 the one-to-one results that appear 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.359
 marked shaded and we click on 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.219
 opening king edit this will open the 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.319
 entries in the windows registry 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:24.420
 our job is to rename the 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.659
 entries called the new putting a 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.659
 script or a point in front we do well 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.100
 we repeat these steps until it is 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.720
 repeat so that we will find all 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.630
 the 'new with a script or what 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.980
 we have put nullifying his name as 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.980
 you can see already cancel this 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.280
 where we do not see the word self nor one 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.280
 we must do nothing 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.230
 finally I think we've just finished 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.240
 rename all entries now fl 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.000
 we must check it we right click 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.890
 on the new desk and it is no longer 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.890
 It has gone well as you can see 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.500
 now let's remove another one that will be flash 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.780
 actionscript file thing that I do not use for 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.480
 nothing there 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.360
 we give the same as before to search but 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.610
 we need the extension so we created 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.280
 the file on the desktop and we see its 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.169
 extension if you do not appear clicks 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.960
 right over the file and you give 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.510
 properties there you look where it puts type 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.490
 of file now if we write in the 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.419
 window search the extension and we're going to 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.419
 search next 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:22.559
 just as before we are giving on the 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.869
 results right click opening regedit 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:27.209
 and we are changing the names 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:29.809
 some will appear already changed by the 

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:31.859
 that were renamed before and so left 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.949
 we continue like this until the end of 

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:33.949
 stock 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.070
 finally and again we check that 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:12.200
 that entry is not on the menu 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:14.900
 perfect contextual is no longer 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.810
 now we will remove the 7 zip entry 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.810
 whose extension I already know that is 7 z 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.750
 we do the same, I will not explain the 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.750
 Observed steps 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.600
 I leave the necessary in the description 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.460
 in another video I explain how to see the 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.770
 file extensions 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.990
 Well, I have already removed what I 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.120
 I was annoyed, I hope I served you 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.120
 until the next bye
