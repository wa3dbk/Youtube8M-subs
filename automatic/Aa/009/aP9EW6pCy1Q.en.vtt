00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.840
 too bad that black and white squeaks family 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.490
 and they can not easily make a flower trough 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.870
 Thanksgiving is good at monitoring 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.610
 young designer Pankin again different and that gives us the freedom for the

 Textile designer regularly visited the studios of his prominent customers 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.570
 the whole world 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.720
 He always has to take the creators with his ideas at least a step 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.910
 to be ahead 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.799
 that's scary mutual inspiration 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.330
 a good motivator the mother needs the demand the market behavior 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.200

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.330
 Not a bit at all that they need to be able to rely on grades 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 and that gives a game now 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.020
 Three fabric collections invalidated company every year with a total of 80 900 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.509

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.639
 we have these substances 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.510
 Aluminum and copper and great the gentle 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.219
 they were these 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 the videos will be 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:24.309
 and Bayern Munich could with the left that we do not have in the end 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.229
 more so important 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:29.559
 but we have printed it the rearrangement on the back and the miracle is 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:30.649
 done 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.649
 that you can fill up with these stages 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.009
 the joy of experimenting with new materials seems inexhaustible 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.409
 time and again the company came up with new dimensions in the Staffelsteiner 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.869

 with modern technologies the readers stilts or inkjet printing 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.730
 Textile designer Riegler Stübbeken specialized in this process instead 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.629

 maybe not everything can bring everything together I totally think it 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.460
 exciting when I worked so many shifts to finish what 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.759
