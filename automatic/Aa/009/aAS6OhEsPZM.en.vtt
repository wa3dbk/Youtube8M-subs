00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.050
 not 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.830
 but we are far from obvious 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.640
 I am 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 canvas 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.629
 and that's all 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.629
 I am surprised 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.359
 j 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.569
 But the damage is done 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:26.409
 what do you want 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.409
 but bercy 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.010

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.140
 haberdasher 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.970
 no but what is it 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.970
 according to the blog 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.470
 to take decisions 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 a 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.160
 not so radical 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
 so far 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.760
 the site 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080
 that's what I do 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 I 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 since the beginning of the season 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.800
 I know what I'm doing 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 I am 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.060
 with germany 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.240
 with black stone 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.520
 still a good time 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.960
 Tell us a little bit 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.010
 it was not established according to the British media for you 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 2 months later 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 % 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 what do you propose 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.729
 I am 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.049
 here 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.989
 discovery
