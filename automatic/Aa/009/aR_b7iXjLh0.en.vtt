00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
this thing so the most support thing

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.880 
this thing so the most support thing
that<00:00:52.690> you<00:00:52.780> can<00:00:52.900> do<00:00:53.050> in<00:00:53.170> this<00:00:53.320> is<00:00:53.589> have<00:00:53.860> people

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
that you can do in this is have people

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.549 
that you can do in this is have people
or<00:00:54.670> have<00:00:55.120> your<00:00:55.300> gun<00:00:55.480> or<00:00:55.510> spot<00:00:55.960> targets<00:00:56.379> for<00:00:56.440> you

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
because being up in the air it's sort of

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.950 
because being up in the air it's sort of
hard<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.559> see<00:00:59.829> people<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:01.090> need<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.449> see

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
hard to see people so you need to see

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.499 
hard to see people so you need to see
the<00:01:02.079> little<00:01:02.260> triangle<00:01:03.010> above<00:01:03.340> their<00:01:03.670> name<00:01:04.239> or

the little triangle above their name or

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.139 
the little triangle above their name or
the<00:01:04.839> player<00:01:05.289> to<00:01:05.649> be<00:01:06.430> able<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.729> shoot<00:01:06.970> them

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
the player to be able to shoot them

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.180 
the player to be able to shoot them
easier<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:07.899> know<00:01:08.020> where<00:01:08.170> they<00:01:08.259> are<00:01:08.289> the<00:01:08.979> lot

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
easier and know where they are the lot

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.620 
easier and know where they are the lot
easier<00:01:09.430> makes<00:01:09.729> life<00:01:09.970> easier<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.330> it's<00:01:10.539> also

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
easier makes life easier and it's also

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.420 
easier makes life easier and it's also
important<00:01:11.140> for<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.410> spot<00:01:11.740> targets<00:01:12.190> and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
important for you to spot targets and

important for you to spot targets and
you<00:01:13.360> know<00:01:13.479> see<00:01:13.750> whatever<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.350> can<00:01:14.500> do<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.700> this

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
you know see whatever you can do in this

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.810 
you know see whatever you can do in this
thing<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.110> gunner<00:01:17.320> versus<00:01:17.679> driver<00:01:17.979> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
thing the gunner versus driver the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.270 
thing the gunner versus driver the
gunner<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.840> can<00:01:20.110> get<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.289> lot<00:01:20.470> more<00:01:20.530> kills<00:01:20.979> and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
gunner it can get a lot more kills and

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.800 
gunner it can get a lot more kills and
it's<00:01:21.429> also<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.759> lot<00:01:21.910> easier<00:01:22.060> because<00:01:22.210> you<00:01:22.450> don't

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
it's also a lot easier because you don't

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
it's also a lot easier because you don't
have<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.960> fly<00:01:23.289> and<00:01:23.590> shoot<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.570> gun<00:01:26.050> the<00:01:26.830> gunner

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
have to fly and shoot the gun the gunner

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.219 
have to fly and shoot the gun the gunner
which<00:01:28.240> is<00:01:28.420> what<00:01:28.570> I'm<00:01:28.660> doing<00:01:28.869> right<00:01:28.960> now<00:01:29.020> I'm

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
which is what I'm doing right now I'm

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.050 
which is what I'm doing right now I'm
the<00:01:29.259> gunner<00:01:29.560> right<00:01:29.710> now<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.399> gun<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.820> little

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
the gunner right now the gun is a little

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.130 
the gunner right now the gun is a little
bit<00:01:31.149> more<00:01:31.270> stronger<00:01:31.720> than<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.899> other<00:01:32.020> one

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
bit more stronger than the other one

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.910 
bit more stronger than the other one
because<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.400> driver<00:01:34.060> has<00:01:34.650> his<00:01:35.650> like<00:01:35.890> a

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
because the the driver has his like a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.730 
because the the driver has his like a
bunch<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.400> missiles<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:36.970> can<00:01:37.150> she<00:01:37.299> has<00:01:37.479> 18<00:01:38.020> 14<00:01:38.619> or

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
bunch of missiles I can she has 18 14 or

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.580 
bunch of missiles I can she has 18 14 or
18<00:01:38.799> of<00:01:39.100> them<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.479> they're<00:01:40.659> sort<00:01:41.049> of<00:01:41.140> weak<00:01:41.350> but

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
18 of them and they're sort of weak but

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.340 
18 of them and they're sort of weak but
he<00:01:41.829> can<00:01:41.950> also<00:01:42.009> have<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.570> guided<00:01:43.570> missile<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:44.140> lot

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
he can also have a guided missile a lot

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.719 
he can also have a guided missile a lot
well<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.799> gunner<00:01:45.040> can<00:01:45.280> have<00:01:45.399> one<00:01:45.549> but<00:01:45.700> it's

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
well the gunner can have one but it's

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.569 
well the gunner can have one but it's
only<00:01:46.000> if<00:01:46.270> it's<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.920> target<00:01:47.920> if<00:01:47.979> it's<00:01:48.189> it's<00:01:48.490> like

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
only if it's a target if it's it's like

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.899 
only if it's a target if it's it's like
the<00:01:48.759> laser<00:01:49.000> target<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.630> Recon<00:01:50.020> thing<00:01:50.380> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the laser target that the Recon thing is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.630 
the laser target that the Recon thing is
and<00:01:51.909> then<00:01:52.600> he<00:01:52.689> also<00:01:52.810> has<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.020> TV<00:01:53.829> guided<00:01:54.280> missile

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
and then he also has a TV guided missile

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.670 
and then he also has a TV guided missile
which<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:54.820> uh<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:55.810> there's<00:01:56.079> a<00:01:56.140> video<00:01:56.350> camera

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
which is uh like there's a video camera

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.510 
which is uh like there's a video camera
on<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:56.950> middle<00:01:57.189> missile<00:01:57.579> um<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:59.380> I<00:01:59.770> honestly

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
on the middle missile um so I honestly

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.190 
on the middle missile um so I honestly
like<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.850> gunner<00:02:01.060> kit<00:02:01.509> can<00:02:01.719> be<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.840> little<00:02:02.020> bit

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
like the gunner kit can be a little bit

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.249 
like the gunner kit can be a little bit
more<00:02:02.380> easier<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.430> use<00:02:04.030> but<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:04.600> yeah<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.140> does

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
more easier to use but it yeah it does

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.749 
more easier to use but it yeah it does
get<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> lot<00:02:05.680> more<00:02:05.799> kills<00:02:06.040> but<00:02:06.189> you<00:02:06.640> know

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
get you a lot more kills but you know

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.120 
get you a lot more kills but you know
flying<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.390> little<00:02:07.570> bit<00:02:07.659> fun<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.320> right<00:02:09.009> before

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.400 
flying a little bit fun and right before
you<00:02:09.579> saw<00:02:09.790> it<00:02:10.030> that's<00:02:10.509> really<00:02:10.750> important<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.260> do

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
you saw it that's really important to do

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.220 
you saw it that's really important to do
is<00:02:11.620> repair<00:02:12.459> your<00:02:12.640> vehicle<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.329> that's

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
is repair your vehicle and that's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.140 
is repair your vehicle and that's
because<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.590> got<00:02:14.799> maybe<00:02:15.489> you're<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.790> battle

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
because I got maybe you're in a battle

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.120 
because I got maybe you're in a battle
and<00:02:16.329> you<00:02:16.600> get<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.019> get<00:02:17.110> some<00:02:17.350> fire<00:02:17.620> well<00:02:17.950> what

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and you get you get some fire well what

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.770 
and you get you get some fire well what
you<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.880> can<00:02:18.910> hopefully<00:02:19.269> evade

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
you can do is you can hopefully evade

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.240 
you can do is you can hopefully evade
from<00:02:20.049> them<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.470> then<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.739> can<00:02:20.860> set<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.100> down

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
from them and then you can set it down

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.670 
from them and then you can set it down
the<00:02:21.549> ED<00:02:22.090> what<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.110> like<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.410> end<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the ED what is it like the end of the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.710 
the ED what is it like the end of the
map<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.239> out<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.690> can

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
map and you can get out and you can

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.720 
map and you can get out and you can
repair<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.859> then<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.489> go<00:02:27.549> back<00:02:27.700> and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
repair it so then you can go back and

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.009 
repair it so then you can go back and

out what my third one is but you can

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.470 
out what my third one is but you can
kind<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.129> experiment<00:02:55.760> with<00:02:55.849> it<00:02:55.879> Oh<00:02:56.150> Oh<00:02:56.450> my

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
kind of experiment with it Oh Oh my

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.430 
kind of experiment with it Oh Oh my
third<00:02:56.840> one<00:02:56.989> for<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.260> one<00:02:57.319> is<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:59.440> target

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
third one for that one is a target

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.990 
third one for that one is a target
missile<00:03:00.739> or<00:03:00.890> every<00:03:01.099> know<00:03:01.310> where<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.579> lock<00:03:01.760> on

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
missile or every know where you lock on

and<00:03:02.299> for<00:03:03.170> my<00:03:03.290> gunner<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.920> side<00:03:04.220> well<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.480> can't

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
and for my gunner it side well you can't

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.089 
and for my gunner it side well you can't
really<00:03:05.720> use<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.140> because<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:06.709> know<00:03:06.799> no<00:03:06.950> one

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
really use it because you know no one

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.979 
really use it because you know no one
uses<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.430> little<00:03:07.760> laser-guided<00:03:08.329> missile<00:03:08.810> think

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
uses a little laser-guided missile think

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.210 
uses a little laser-guided missile think
so<00:03:10.000> running<00:03:11.000> out<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.120> time<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.620> important<00:03:13.069> for

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
so running out of time the important for

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.520 
so running out of time the important for
the<00:03:13.489> importance<00:03:13.909> of<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.959> your<00:03:15.079> team<00:03:15.319> is

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
the importance of it to your team is

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.289 
the importance of it to your team is
that<00:03:15.940> when<00:03:16.940> you're<00:03:17.090> in<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:17.329> thing<00:03:17.389> you<00:03:18.139> can

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
that when you're in this thing you can

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.390 
that when you're in this thing you can
you<00:03:20.299> can<00:03:20.510> really<00:03:20.720> take<00:03:20.989> out<00:03:21.170> tanks<00:03:21.859> it's<00:03:22.129> a

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
you can really take out tanks it's a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.339 
you can really take out tanks it's a
little<00:03:22.609> bit<00:03:22.700> difficult<00:03:22.909> because<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.989> tanks

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
little bit difficult because the tanks

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.949 
little bit difficult because the tanks
they<00:03:24.440> do<00:03:24.500> take<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.799> lot<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.129> damage<00:03:25.549> but<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.780> can

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
they do take a lot of damage but you can

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.710 
they do take a lot of damage but you can
you<00:03:27.349> can<00:03:27.500> help<00:03:27.680> spot<00:03:28.040> targets<00:03:28.670> as<00:03:28.819> well<00:03:28.849> as<00:03:29.269> you

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
you can help spot targets as well as you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.379 
you can help spot targets as well as you
can<00:03:29.900> take<00:03:30.109> out<00:03:30.260> tanks<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.920> can<00:03:31.389> I'm

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
can take out tanks and you can I'm

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.839 
can take out tanks and you can I'm
conquest<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.319> can<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:34.069> go<00:03:34.340> up<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.670> their

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
conquest you can like go up to their

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.149 
conquest you can like go up to their
objective<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.500> wreak<00:03:36.739> havoc

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
objective and you can just wreak havoc

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.039 
objective and you can just wreak havoc
and<00:03:37.280> just<00:03:37.459> shoot<00:03:37.670> at<00:03:37.819> them<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.209> hopefully<00:03:38.750> get

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
and just shoot at them and hopefully get

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.860 
and just shoot at them and hopefully get
them<00:03:39.200> off<00:03:39.319> of<00:03:39.349> there<00:03:39.620> but<00:03:39.769> also<00:03:40.639> this<00:03:41.329> thing<00:03:41.389> is

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
them off of there but also this thing is

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.129 
them off of there but also this thing is
usually<00:03:42.709> be<00:03:42.859> taking<00:03:43.760> out<00:03:43.879> a<00:03:43.910> taking<00:03:44.690> out<00:03:44.810> jets

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
usually be taking out a taking out jets

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.500 
usually be taking out a taking out jets
and<00:03:45.349> stuff<00:03:45.560> or<00:03:45.769> other<00:03:46.430> helicopters<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.299> it's

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
and stuff or other helicopters and it's

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.759 
and stuff or other helicopters and it's
kind<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.780> annoying<00:03:47.989> because<00:03:48.260> there's<00:03:48.560> almost

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
kind of annoying because there's almost

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.280 
kind of annoying because there's almost
always<00:03:49.099> another<00:03:49.459> helicopter<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.079> other

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
always another helicopter on the other

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.449 
always another helicopter on the other
team<00:03:51.500> that's<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.859> air<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.129> you<00:03:52.190> don't<00:03:52.400> get

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
team that's in the air so you don't get

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.189 
team that's in the air so you don't get
much<00:03:52.669> time<00:03:52.699> yourself<00:03:53.389> you<00:03:53.599> know<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.780> if<00:03:54.109> you

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
much time yourself you know you if you

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.750 
much time yourself you know you if you

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
to fly but a lot of times I try to fly

to fly but a lot of times I try to fly
one<00:04:15.440> about<00:04:15.650> myself<00:04:15.859> because<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.400> lot<00:04:16.699> of<00:04:16.729> people

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
one about myself because a lot of people

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.449 
one about myself because a lot of people
don't<00:04:17.090> know<00:04:17.150> how<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.269> fly<00:04:17.539> this<00:04:17.599> thing<00:04:17.690> and
