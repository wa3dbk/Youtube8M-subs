you put it on cold water the air inside
of<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.020> contract<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.830> what<00:02:02.130> was

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
of it is going to contract and what was

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.250 
of it is going to contract and what was
once<00:02:02.820> tube<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.510> thought<00:02:03.750> you've<00:02:03.960> filled

once tube that you thought you've filled

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.070 
once tube that you thought you've filled
up<00:02:04.410> enough<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.070> no<00:02:05.700> longer<00:02:05.940> near<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.390> firm<00:02:06.750> as

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
up enough is no longer near as firm as

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.680 
up enough is no longer near as firm as
you<00:02:07.170> expected<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.459> wait<00:02:08.880> pump<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.300> tube<00:02:09.509> up

very<00:02:09.990> firm<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.590> way<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.770> test<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.340> once<00:02:11.520> you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
very firm the way to test it once you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.120 
very firm the way to test it once you
get<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:11.940> inflated<00:02:12.450> stand<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.350> top<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.950> and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
get it inflated stand on top of it and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.449 
get it inflated stand on top of it and
it<00:02:14.580> should<00:02:14.790> slightly<00:02:15.360> depress<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.459> mean

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
it should slightly depress I mean

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.400

slightly<00:02:18.030> because<00:02:18.540> you'll<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:19.080> how<00:02:19.230> that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
slightly because you'll see how that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.740 
slightly because you'll see how that
changes<00:02:19.440> once<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.190> gets<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.580> cold<00:02:20.820> water

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.110

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
okay so now you've got a quick lesson on

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
okay so now you've got a quick lesson on
inflation<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.310> remember<00:02:29.310> towing<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.390> filled

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
inflation and remember towing a filled
