video when you commit yourself to a plan
to<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:46.369> don't<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:48.329> too<00:01:48.750> extreme<00:01:49.909> with<00:01:50.990> your

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to a go don't be too extreme with your

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.160 
to a go don't be too extreme with your

diet and your training routine because

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.340 
diet and your training routine because
there's<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.890> big<00:01:56.219> chance<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.719> too

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
there's a big chance that if it's too

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.719 
there's a big chance that if it's too
extreme<00:01:59.570> you<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:01.500> will<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.310> end<00:02:02.520> up

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
extreme you you will just end up

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.169 
extreme you you will just end up
quitting<00:02:04.100> because<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
quitting because you

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.730 
quitting because you
you<00:02:08.179> won't<00:02:08.360> have<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.599> discipline<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.530> keep

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
you won't have to discipline to to keep

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.180 
you won't have to discipline to to keep
up<00:02:09.890> with<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.660> I'd<00:02:11.660> say<00:02:11.989> it's<00:02:12.650> better<00:02:12.950> if

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
up with it and I'd say it's better if

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.180 
up with it and I'd say it's better if
you<00:02:13.310> start<00:02:13.670> with<00:02:14.150> something<00:02:14.920> easier<00:02:15.920> to

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
you start with something easier to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.050 
you start with something easier to
follow<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:17.950> go<00:02:18.950> higher<00:02:19.220> on<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.700> under

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
follow like go higher on the under

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.870 
follow like go higher on the under
carbohydrates<00:02:20.870> or<00:02:21.140> error<00:02:21.459> have<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> cheat<00:02:22.850> meal

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
carbohydrates or error have a cheat meal

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.449 
carbohydrates or error have a cheat meal
every<00:02:23.510> two<00:02:23.750> or<00:02:23.870> three<00:02:23.900> days<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.130> don't

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
every two or three days and just don't

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.520 
every two or three days and just don't
be<00:02:25.640> too<00:02:25.670> strict<00:02:26.150> because<00:02:26.989> if<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.230> are<00:02:27.319> too

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
be too strict because if you are too

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.630 
be too strict because if you are too
strict<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.480> always<00:02:29.540> try<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.200> be<00:02:30.640> then

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
strict like I always try to be then

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.229 
strict like I always try to be then
there<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.769> there's<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:33.890> chance<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:34.880> you

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
there is a there's a chance that if you

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.520 
there is a there's a chance that if you
are<00:02:35.390> not<00:02:35.599> as<00:02:36.040> disciplined<00:02:37.040> as<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:39.050> need<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.260> be

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
are not as disciplined as you need to be

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.430 
are not as disciplined as you need to be
then<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.370> will<00:02:40.580> fail<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:41.660> like<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.110> have
