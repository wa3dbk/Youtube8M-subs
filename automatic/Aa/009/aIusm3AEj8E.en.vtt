here to this clinic to donate some blood
but<00:00:39.600> there's<00:00:39.750> something<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.110> curious<00:00:40.320> about

but there's something I'm curious about

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.650 
but there's something I'm curious about
have<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.460> ever<00:00:41.579> wondered<00:00:41.910> why<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.270> use<00:00:42.450> all

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
have you ever wondered why they use all

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
have you ever wondered why they use all
those<00:00:42.780> letters<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.440> describe<00:00:43.860> our<00:00:44.070> blood<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
those letters to describe our blood I

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.180 
those letters to describe our blood I
mean<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.809> makes<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.200> blood<00:00:46.620> different<00:00:47.010> from

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
mean what makes a blood different from

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.180 
mean what makes a blood different from
all<00:00:47.460> or<00:00:47.910> B<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.200> why<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.710> important<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
all or B and why is it so important that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.810 
all or B and why is it so important that
doctors<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.090> kind<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.390> blood<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.780> have

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
doctors know what kind of blood we have

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.310 
doctors know what kind of blood we have
well<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.969> taken<00:00:54.329> centuries<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:55.079> us<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
well it's taken centuries for us to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
well it's taken centuries for us to
unlock<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.890> secrets<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> our<00:00:56.550> blood<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
unlock the secrets of our blood and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.389 
unlock the secrets of our blood and
we've<00:00:57.840> learned<00:00:58.109> some<00:00:58.379> hard<00:00:58.559> lessons<00:00:58.680> along

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
we've learned some hard lessons along

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.119 
we've learned some hard lessons along
the<00:00:59.460> way

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
the way

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.290 
the way
for<00:01:02.129> instance<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.670> once<00:01:02.879> believed<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
for instance we once believed that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.410 
for instance we once believed that
illnesses<00:01:04.080> were<00:01:04.260> caused<00:01:04.500> by<00:01:04.769> bad<00:01:05.100> blood<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
illnesses were caused by bad blood so to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
illnesses were caused by bad blood so to
make<00:01:06.630> people<00:01:06.960> well<00:01:07.200> again<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.189> drain

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
make people well again we would drain

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.890 
make people well again we would drain
the<00:01:08.760> offending<00:01:09.240> blood<00:01:09.510> from<00:01:09.810> their<00:01:09.960> body<00:01:11.900> as

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the offending blood from their body as

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
the offending blood from their body as
you<00:01:13.080> probably<00:01:13.409> guessed<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.979> procedure

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you probably guessed this procedure

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.149 
you probably guessed this procedure
wasn't<00:01:15.030> very<00:01:15.330> successful<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> couple

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
wasn't very successful and for a couple

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.060 
wasn't very successful and for a couple
of<00:01:17.250> good<00:01:17.400> reasons<00:01:17.990> first<00:01:18.990> here's<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:19.890> much

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
of good reasons first here's how much

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.620 
of good reasons first here's how much
blood<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> flowing<00:01:20.759> through<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> average

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
blood is flowing through the average

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.980 
blood is flowing through the average
adult<00:01:21.960> body<00:01:22.229> about<00:01:22.740> 5<00:01:23.280> liters<00:01:23.479> now<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
adult body about 5 liters now if you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.840 
adult body about 5 liters now if you
were<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.110> lose<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.770> liter<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> your

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
were to lose a liter or more of your

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
were to lose a liter or more of your
blood<00:01:27.200> you'd<00:01:28.200> start<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.530> suffer<00:01:28.860> from<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
blood you'd start to suffer from a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.200 
blood you'd start to suffer from a
condition<00:01:29.520> known<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.090> shock<00:01:31.880> when<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.909> lose<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
condition known as shock when you lose a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.819 
condition known as shock when you lose a
lot<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.479> blood<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:34.140> body<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.710> become

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
lot of blood your body can become

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.840 
lot of blood your body can become
starved<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.729> oxygen

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
starved for oxygen

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.210 
starved for oxygen
if<00:01:36.939> that<00:01:37.119> blood<00:01:37.450> isn't<00:01:37.630> quickly<00:01:38.080> replaced<00:01:38.470> you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
if that blood isn't quickly replaced you

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.670 
if that blood isn't quickly replaced you
can<00:01:39.400> fall<00:01:39.580> into<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.850> coma<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.420> die<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.229> that's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
can fall into a coma and die and that's

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.109 
can fall into a coma and die and that's
what<00:01:41.860> happened<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.220> allow<00:01:42.430> those<00:01:42.640> early

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
what happened to allow those early

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.670 
what happened to allow those early
patients<00:01:43.420> who<00:01:43.750> have<00:01:43.900> their<00:01:44.049> blood<00:01:44.229> drained

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
patients who have their blood drained

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.800 
patients who have their blood drained
they<00:01:45.549> die

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.810 

now<00:01:49.810> when<00:01:49.990> we<00:01:50.110> respect<00:01:50.680> those<00:01:50.860> early<00:01:51.430> blood

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
now when we respect those early blood

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.520 
now when we respect those early blood
draining<00:01:52.150> doctors<00:01:52.720> were<00:01:52.870> correct

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
draining doctors were correct

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.070 
draining doctors were correct
a<00:01:53.560> lot<00:01:54.220> of<00:01:54.250> infectious<00:01:54.820> diseases<00:01:55.180> are<00:01:55.630> carried

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
a lot of infectious diseases are carried

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.350 
a lot of infectious diseases are carried
by<00:01:56.110> our<00:01:56.380> blood<00:01:56.680> but<00:01:57.490> what<00:01:57.670> they<00:01:57.820> didn't<00:01:58.300> know

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
by our blood but what they didn't know

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.750 
by our blood but what they didn't know
is<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.930> our<00:01:59.110> blood<00:01:59.380> also<00:01:59.980> carries<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.490> cells

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
is that our blood also carries the cells

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.130 
is that our blood also carries the cells
we<00:02:01.000> need<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.480> fight<00:02:01.810> those<00:02:02.110> diseases<00:02:03.090> our

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
we need to fight those diseases our

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.690 
we need to fight those diseases our
blood<00:02:05.140> can<00:02:05.350> be<00:02:05.470> divided<00:02:05.830> into<00:02:06.070> two<00:02:06.370> main

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
blood can be divided into two main

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.350 
blood can be divided into two main
components<00:02:06.960> red<00:02:07.960> cells<00:02:08.260> and<00:02:08.560> plasma<00:02:09.180> it's<00:02:10.180> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
components red cells and plasma it's the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.120 
components red cells and plasma it's the
red<00:02:10.570> cells<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:11.080> give<00:02:11.230> our<00:02:11.380> blood<00:02:11.650> its<00:02:11.800> color

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
red cells that give our blood its color

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.100 
red cells that give our blood its color
but<00:02:12.820> their<00:02:13.000> main<00:02:13.210> function<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.930> carry

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
but their main function is to carry

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.730 
but their main function is to carry
oxygen<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.980> our<00:02:15.070> tissues<00:02:15.960> now<00:02:16.960> if<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.380> remove

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
oxygen to our tissues now if you remove

along<00:02:55.600> in<00:02:55.750> history<00:02:56.350> we<00:02:56.860> discovered<00:02:57.400> two

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
along in history we discovered two

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.760 
along in history we discovered two
special<00:02:58.239> proteins<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.050> surface<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.620> our

special proteins on the surface of our
red<00:03:00.010> blood<00:03:00.340> cells<00:03:00.640> they're<00:03:01.630> called<00:03:01.870> antigens

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
red blood cells they're called antigens

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.390 
red blood cells they're called antigens
and<00:03:02.980> we<00:03:03.100> labeled<00:03:03.519> them<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.570> B<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:06.310> we

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
and we labeled them a and B then we

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.280 
and we labeled them a and B then we
discovered<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:06.940> some<00:03:07.360> people's<00:03:07.750> red<00:03:07.989> cells

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
discovered that some people's red cells

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
discovered that some people's red cells
have<00:03:08.890> only<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.310> antigen<00:03:10.090> some<00:03:10.989> have<00:03:11.890> only<00:03:12.070> the

to show you the problem let's go back to

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.010 
to show you the problem let's go back to
the<00:03:43.840> clinic<00:03:47.610> now<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.640> happen<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.239> have<00:03:49.450> type<00:03:49.840> A

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
the clinic now I happen to have type A

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.160 
the clinic now I happen to have type A
blood<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.790> let's<00:03:51.940> take<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> sample<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.569> my<00:03:52.840> blood

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
blood so let's take a sample of my blood

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:01.320 
blood so let's take a sample of my blood
and<00:03:53.319> divide<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.739> into<00:03:53.830> two<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> first

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
and divide it into two to the first

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.120 
and divide it into two to the first
sample<00:04:01.750> we'll<00:04:01.870> add<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.140> solution<00:04:02.830> containing

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
sample we'll add a solution containing

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.910 
sample we'll add a solution containing
plasma<00:04:03.760> from<00:04:03.940> type<00:04:04.180> A<00:04:04.360> blood<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:05.410> same<00:04:05.650> blood

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
plasma from type A blood the same blood

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.630 
plasma from type A blood the same blood
type<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.340> mine<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.890> other<00:04:09.040> sample<00:04:09.519> we'll

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
type is mine to the other sample we'll

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.640 
type is mine to the other sample we'll
add<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.820> solution<00:04:10.450> containing<00:04:10.780> plasma<00:04:11.440> from

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.190 
add a solution containing plasma from
type<00:04:11.860> B<00:04:12.130> blood<00:04:15.540> now<00:04:16.540> we'll<00:04:16.720> mix<00:04:16.900> everything

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
type B blood now we'll mix everything

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.479 
type B blood now we'll mix everything
together<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:18.010> there's<00:04:18.730> your<00:04:18.970> problem

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
together and there's your problem

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.120 
together and there's your problem
the<00:04:21.489> first<00:04:21.850> sample<00:04:22.360> looks<00:04:22.510> normal<00:04:23.020> but<00:04:23.200> in<00:04:24.040> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
the first sample looks normal but in the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.950 
the first sample looks normal but in the
second<00:04:24.550> sample<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:25.060> red<00:04:25.240> cells<00:04:25.540> have<00:04:25.750> all

second sample the red cells have all
clumped<00:04:26.350> together<00:04:26.440> into<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.070> sticky<00:04:27.639> mess<00:04:29.100> so

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
clumped together into a sticky mess so

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.990 
clumped together into a sticky mess so
what's<00:04:30.310> happening

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
what's happening

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.300 
what's happening
well<00:04:31.479> floating<00:04:32.139> around<00:04:32.260> in<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.650> plasma<00:04:33.280> of
