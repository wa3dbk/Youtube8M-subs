00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.790 

I've<00:05:48.620> got<00:05:48.860> like<00:05:48.980> a<00:05:49.130> hood<00:05:49.340> scoop<00:05:49.550> right<00:05:49.970> in<00:05:50.150> here

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
so we'll see if we can cut that out that

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:03.610 
so we'll see if we can cut that out that
lay<00:05:54.050> in<00:05:54.080> there<00:06:01.720> take<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.750> little<00:06:02.960> heat<00:06:03.170> and<00:06:03.440> see

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
lay in there take a little heat and see

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.820 
lay in there take a little heat and see
what<00:06:03.740> we<00:06:03.800> can<00:06:03.950> come<00:06:04.040> up<00:06:04.100> with<00:06:08.410> just<00:06:09.410> cut<00:06:09.650> this
