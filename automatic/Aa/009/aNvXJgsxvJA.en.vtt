and data collected to show this and I

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.250 
and data collected to show this and I
wouldn't<00:05:43.360> be<00:05:43.479> surprised<00:05:43.810> if<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.050> still

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
wouldn't be surprised if it still

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.140 
wouldn't be surprised if it still
applies<00:05:44.500> even<00:05:44.650> in<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:44.919> 2014<00:05:45.520> meta<00:05:45.700> game<00:05:45.820> it's

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
applies even in the 2014 meta game it's

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.370 
applies even in the 2014 meta game it's
a<00:05:46.180> little<00:05:46.419> bit<00:05:46.510> old<00:05:46.690> but<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:47.050> know<00:05:47.169> it

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
a little bit old but you know it

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.930 
a little bit old but you know it
definitely<00:05:47.740> still<00:05:48.160> applies<00:05:48.430> taking<00:05:48.849> the

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
definitely still applies taking the

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.490 
definitely still applies taking the
first<00:05:49.120> off<00:05:49.300> in<00:05:49.419> 3<00:05:49.599> stock<00:05:49.780> matches<00:05:50.169> is<00:05:50.289> so

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
first off in 3 stock matches is so

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.300 
first off in 3 stock matches is so
powerful<00:05:50.979> that

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310

eight<00:07:13.600> blocks<00:07:13.840> they're<00:07:14.050> going<00:07:14.320> to<00:07:14.470> say<00:07:14.680> the

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
eight blocks they're going to say the

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.400 
eight blocks they're going to say the
classic<00:07:15.190> trap<00:07:15.670> yeah<00:07:16.150> it's<00:07:16.480> not<00:07:16.630> even<00:07:16.810> it's<00:07:17.350> not

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
classic trap yeah it's not even it's not

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.960 
classic trap yeah it's not even it's not
even<00:07:17.500> actually<00:07:17.920> good<00:07:18.100> because<00:07:18.250> down<00:07:18.580> smash<00:07:18.820> is

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
even actually good because down smash is

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.400 
even actually good because down smash is
not<00:07:19.150> safe<00:07:19.390> on<00:07:19.540> block<00:07:19.570> whereas<00:07:20.020> forward<00:07:20.290> smash

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
not safe on block whereas forward smash

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.260 
not safe on block whereas forward smash
is<00:07:20.650> so<00:07:20.920> once<00:07:21.340> you<00:07:21.430> get<00:07:21.550> that<00:07:21.640> forward<00:07:21.880> smash<00:07:22.060> on
