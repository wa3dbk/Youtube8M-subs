00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.400
Well I was standing in the back yard, with my little girl and boy

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.000
When off in the distance I could hear that
thunder roar

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.800
Well that big jet came overhead about scared
my girl half to death

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:40.800
They said Daddy, what's the sound that that plane made, it took a while to find the words to say

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.200
Well that's the sound of that big eighteen wheeler truck rolling  down that old highway,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.500
And that's the sound of the school bus that carries kids to school everyday,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.600
Yeah that's a country song on the radio, and that's me and your mama growing old

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:10.900
Yeah that's the price, that some folks have
to pay, but that's freedom everyday

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.600
Now there's talk in the Carolina's about a
brand new landing field,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.700
And all these people worried about all the
birds that might get killed

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.500
Well they can land that jet in my backyard
anytime that they want to

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.900
Because I know what it stand for, and just
what it's there to do

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Cause that's the sound of that marching band
playing loud at the highschool football game

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.600
And that's a bonfire out in the cold, or a shelter when it rains

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.400
Yeah that's a bobber in the fishing hole or your team scoring another goal

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:04.300
Yeah that's the price, that some folks have
to pay, but that's freedom everyday

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.600
So they can fly these jets from east to west
anytime that they want to

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.000
Cause that loud sound you're hearing means
freedom for me and you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Cause that's the sound of that star spangled
banner being sung on my tv

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.600
And that's the sound of the preacher preaching
straight to you and me

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.500
Yeah that's fireworks on the fourth of July and the American Flag flying high,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:47.500
Yeah that's the price, that some folks have
to pay, but that's freedom everyday

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:56.800
Yeah there's soldiers that had the ultimate
price to pay

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:08.100
So we can have freedom everyday
In the good ole USA

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.200
That's Freedom Everyday
