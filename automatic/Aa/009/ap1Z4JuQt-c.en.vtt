in Tekken 5 game I get 60 frame per

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.240 
in Tekken 5 game I get 60 frame per
second<00:01:11.030> but<00:01:11.600> when<00:01:11.869> I<00:01:11.900> fight<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:12.409> slows<00:01:12.710> down<00:01:13.040> to

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
second but when I fight it slows down to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.630 
second but when I fight it slows down to
30<00:01:13.520> frame<00:01:13.880> per<00:01:13.909> second<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.950> answer<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.490> this

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
30 frame per second the answer to this

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.910 
30 frame per second the answer to this
is<00:01:16.850> in<00:01:17.060> my<00:01:17.180> opinion<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:18.320> have<00:01:18.350> probably

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
is in my opinion you have probably

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.340 
is in my opinion you have probably
followed<00:01:19.400> other<00:01:19.610> videos<00:01:20.030> their<00:01:20.690> videos<00:01:21.080> are

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
followed other videos their videos are

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.469 
followed other videos their videos are
based<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.800> their<00:01:21.979> specs<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.820> impossible

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
based on their specs so it is impossible

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.880 
based on their specs so it is impossible
for<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.840> get<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.290> same<00:01:24.470> speed<00:01:24.860> that

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
for you to get the same speed that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.340 
for you to get the same speed that
you're<00:01:25.220> probably<00:01:25.520> expecting<00:01:26.149> you<00:01:26.990> should<00:01:27.229> be

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you're probably expecting you should be

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.930 
you're probably expecting you should be
trying<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.920> tweak<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.340> settings<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.880> see
