00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.319
 would make the promised product video 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.170
 lip catrice 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.190
 The first lipstick that I show is lipstick 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.260
 ultimat color 210 title written 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.699
 very, very small, well, something there 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.910
 piccadilly is so bright bright pink 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 crimson lipstick at first 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.029
 absolutely not by force I am a little bit even 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.600
 somehow there may be something that is of color 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.700
 I do not know fuchsias 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.630
 brush it turns out very even 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 nothing 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.829
 the only thing is if you apply it from 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.910
 the tube is of course busting it will be 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.000
 very bright 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.149
 I do not dare to the following two 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.250
 lipsticks that show from the same series 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.879
 it would not be if I even said it 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 what hits in catrice are 2 refugees 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:03.059
 lipstick 1 in the room but also 10 and this is such 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 beige reddish color and 2 one world 190 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.530
 it's beige pink color at first 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.939
 look between them is no difference but on 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.390
 actually see it now in this 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:18.080
 number 0 10 I have you luck with the edge as 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.210
 I said it so beige red and 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.939
 beige-pink under which in 190 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 in the middle of them the texture is very dense . 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.970
 these colors can go behind the mask if 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.220
 talk about not beat Orsk show 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.880
 video rental there is lipstick from 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.149
 essense which i have already shown number a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.729
 1052 for lipstick and number one for sky 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.960
 the pencil is both called and 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.600
 provide ideal combination of 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.149
 why do i think that beige is wrong and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.020
 adsense wins over these 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.560
 lipstick from catrice because lipstick 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 essence 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.159
 Is it more creamy? 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.340
 creamy light and much less likely 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.740
 that now stand this you will fall for 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.489
 mask but in particular on me now 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.940
 this lipstick with the same pencil is not 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.640
 It is provided that the rika is visible and so again 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.330
 If you apply with a brush, then good lipstick 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.900
 some special claims I will take 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.260
 they smell 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.700
 sweetish such unobtrusive smell 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.269
 ordinary enough standard for 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.739
 lipstick mass market scent 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.470
 the next lipstick from catrice who imagine 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.290
 got it so that's all lipstick 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.859
 ribbed tubes of a series of ultimate particles from Sunshine 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.640
 I have the color 0 and 90 it is called Knox Fox 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:47.760
 and this purchase I don’t regret 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.880
 In general , I like it without any 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.459
 such a brown pink 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.420
 enough me and but at the same time quite 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.940
 yourself in Siberia and every day 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.329
 this lipstick is lighter more creamy 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.340
 than the ultimatum color and she is not very 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.069
 steadfastly but for me it is not so 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.940
 she doesn’t have a big lack of fold 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.720
 clogged peeling does not emphasize and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.150
 when she goes 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.450
 she's coming off somehow ok that is 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.150
 no tolerance no horror with her 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.870
 not happening and the next product is 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.989
 pomade 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.810
 also in ancient dudes but that's another 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.930
 series is even more light series which 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.200
 called quit march im gel color then 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.700
 There is gel lipstick which as with me 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.200
 supposed to lie color 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:46.030
 Personally, I have the color 040 is such a direct 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.050
 pinky pinky pink yes she falls 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.090
 translucent yes she's so kind 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.670
 gel or something but you know me not 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.860
 like the way she worn I don't like 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.920
 the feeling of this lipstick on her lips she 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.790
 kind of like vaseline not unpleasant i 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.489
 I feel I do not expect this from lipstick 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.860
 The lite version of gloss lipsticks well 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.709
 of course could not pass by this one 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.549
 series of lipstick pencils lipstick markers not 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.220
 I knew how to call generically as 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:24.010
 three sieves called lip balm balm 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:31.020
 in my room go flamingo 060 this 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:34.900
 such a pink color I want to say about not 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.669
 she has a pretty intense sweet 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.460
 smell for me a little bit 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.800
 sugary well into a very valuable product 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.190
 quite good but cubes it feels like 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.150
 such a fat balm something 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.150
 resembles in balm socks from neve 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.910
 are those which are more densely gives 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.710
 beautiful color keeps well and how do i 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.380
 she seemed to really feed 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.020
 my lips stretched to her and when 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.389
 it was cooler when it was cold and not 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.820
 I really noticed that I would be with her 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.320
 don't wind up and vice versa 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.780
 getting skin like this more 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.770
 moist but I don't know how it goes 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.500
 summer business 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.560
 it seems to me that this is a sugary smell 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.590
 will be in the warm season to strain 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.400
 also from catrice i gained such brilliance 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.560
 for lips in room 070 and honestly i 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.800
 very satisfied in the tube probably he 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.259
 may seem bright gives a cube such 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.840
 natural 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:37.240
 reddish such a healthy shade in 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.580
 there are spangles of which are completely not 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.740
 felt on the lips then there is no this 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.150
 the sensations of sand smell him too 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.979
 some sweet but unobtrusive 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.050
 worn well does not spread not 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:54.430
 numb for the contour of the lips can be easily 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:59.199
 wear without a pencil even pretty 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:03.430
 rack non sticky italian balsam ones 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:06.659
 blush like these two in one here 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.039
 wild just color is unreal 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:12.039
 pigmented just barely touched 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.229
 the color is already very bright I do not know it looks 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.330
 for a long time as my nails and at first glance 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.940
 of course you look and think you probably 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.000
 impossible to wear but really very 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.190
 even perhaps by its structure 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.889
 reminds tint meaning you don't see 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.069
 product on your face or on your lips 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:33.340
 see only the pigment on the cheeks attached 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:36.159
 such a rose some frosty blush 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.349
 I really liked the spring, I think too 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:40.270
 I will experiment indulge summer 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.009
 probably not very well but in general I 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.969
 happy here this thing is interesting 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:48.819
 thing will try to look like walls 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:53.310
 need to wear well here in full you everything I 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.310
 symbol for your attention and all for now
