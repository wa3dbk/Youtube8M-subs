it<00:01:55.409> does<00:01:55.560> feel<00:01:55.770> kind<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.040> heavy<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:56.759> when

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
it does feel kind of heavy but then when

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
it does feel kind of heavy but then when
you're<00:01:57.000> actually<00:01:57.299> wearing<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.350> feels

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you're actually wearing it it feels

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.950 
you're actually wearing it it feels
almost<00:01:59.009> weightless<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.119> suspension<00:02:00.630> design

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
almost weightless the suspension design

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.530 
almost weightless the suspension design
does<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.409> really<00:02:01.860> work<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.420> with<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
does actually really work so with the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.080 
does actually really work so with the
large<00:02:03.750> cushion<00:02:04.229> pads<00:02:04.469> they<00:02:05.130> already<00:02:05.490> can't<00:02:05.850> be

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
large cushion pads they already can't be

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059 
large cushion pads they already can't be
but<00:02:06.360> I've<00:02:06.450> gotta<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.810> honest<00:02:07.079> they're<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
but I've gotta be honest they're not the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.969 
but I've gotta be honest they're not the
greatest<00:02:08.099> noise<00:02:09.000> cancelling<00:02:09.629> um<00:02:09.869> when<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> was

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
greatest noise cancelling um when I was

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.390 
greatest noise cancelling um when I was
when<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> had<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.910> headphones

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
when I had the headphones

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.130 
when I had the headphones
but<00:02:12.579> I<00:02:12.610> wasn't<00:02:12.879> listening<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.299> anything<00:02:13.510> if

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
but I wasn't listening to anything if

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.869 
but I wasn't listening to anything if
anyone<00:02:14.739> else<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.099> room<00:02:15.220> talked<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.730> could

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
anyone else in the room talked I could

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.819 
anyone else in the room talked I could
hear<00:02:16.030> them<00:02:16.180> really<00:02:16.420> clearly<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.530> then<00:02:17.650> when<00:02:17.739> I

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
hear them really clearly and then when I

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.789 
hear them really clearly and then when I
was<00:02:17.920> playing<00:02:18.159> music<00:02:18.310> but<00:02:19.060> quite<00:02:20.019> loud<00:02:20.290> they

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
was playing music but quite loud they

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.319 
was playing music but quite loud they
could<00:02:20.980> hear<00:02:21.189> like<00:02:21.549> it's<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.909> clear<00:02:22.180> what<00:02:22.269> it

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
could hear like it's that clear what it

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.300 
could hear like it's that clear what it
was<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.599> was<00:02:22.689> listening<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.049> so<00:02:23.920> what<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.129> won't

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
using the headset they will most likely

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.210 
using the headset they will most likely
be<00:02:32.349> able<00:02:32.409> to<00:02:32.560> hear<00:02:32.709> what<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.040> you're

impressed by how good they sound for how
much<00:02:40.840> they<00:02:40.989> cost<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:42.519> mid<00:02:42.730> tones<00:02:43.030> were<00:02:43.329> just

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
much they cost the mid tones were just

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.960 
much they cost the mid tones were just
really<00:02:43.629> full<00:02:43.959> or<00:02:44.230> any<00:02:44.349> rich<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.489> high-pitched

really sound tinny

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.490 
really sound tinny
but<00:02:48.849> I<00:02:48.879> was<00:02:49.120> most<00:02:49.389> impressed<00:02:49.569> by<00:02:49.900> was<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.230> low

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
but I was most impressed by was the low

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.160 
but I was most impressed by was the low
tones<00:02:50.799> um<00:02:51.250> because<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.510> 50<00:02:52.989> millimeter

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
tones um because of the 50 millimeter

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
drivers the bass actually sounds really

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.289 
drivers the bass actually sounds really
realistic<00:02:56.609> whereas<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.730> headset<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.180> had

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
realistic whereas the headset that I had

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.580 
realistic whereas the headset that I had
before<00:02:58.420> even<00:02:58.959> though<00:02:59.109> it's<00:02:59.230> more<00:02:59.409> expensive

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
before even though it's more expensive

really<00:03:12.819> surprised<00:03:13.359> by<00:03:13.599> how<00:03:13.720> accurate<00:03:14.170> was<00:03:14.319> I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
really surprised by how accurate was I

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.500 
really surprised by how accurate was I
could<00:03:14.799> like<00:03:14.920> close<00:03:15.129> my<00:03:15.310> eyes<00:03:15.489> spin<00:03:15.909> round<00:03:16.150> and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
could like close my eyes spin round and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.569 
could like close my eyes spin round and
when<00:03:17.199> I<00:03:17.230> heard<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.560> noise<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.769> could<00:03:18.250> tell<00:03:18.400> the

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
when I heard a noise I could tell the

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.460 
when I heard a noise I could tell the
exact<00:03:18.940> location<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.540> was<00:03:19.629> coming<00:03:19.930> from<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.169> was

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
exact location it was coming from I was

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.069 
exact location it was coming from I was
really<00:03:20.769> impressed<00:03:20.980> by<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.340> although<00:03:22.299> I<00:03:22.599> didn't

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
really impressed by it although I didn't

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.750 
really impressed by it although I didn't
get<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.349> full<00:03:23.560> surround<00:03:24.310> sound<00:03:24.669> experience

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
get the full surround sound experience

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.699 
get the full surround sound experience
so<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:25.419> got<00:03:25.599> over<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.840> other<00:03:25.989> headset<00:03:26.410> once

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
so I got over the other headset once

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.050 
so I got over the other headset once
again<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.310> other<00:03:27.400> headset<00:03:27.760> was<00:03:27.879> a<00:03:27.909> lot<00:03:28.030> more

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
again the other headset was a lot more

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.899 
again the other headset was a lot more
expensive<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.650> apart<00:03:29.739> from<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.159> one<00:03:30.579> thing

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
expensive and apart from that one thing

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.809 
expensive and apart from that one thing
this<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.840> cyber<00:03:32.169> fe2<00:03:32.650> completely<00:03:33.040> blows<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
this the cyber fe2 completely blows the
