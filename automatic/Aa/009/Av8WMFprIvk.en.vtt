00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
suspected the floor does not look very

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.419 
suspected the floor does not look very
stable<00:01:43.810> yeah<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.080> feels<00:01:45.259> pretty<00:01:45.619> mushy<00:01:45.920> I

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
stable yeah it feels pretty mushy I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.160 
stable yeah it feels pretty mushy I
wouldn't<00:01:46.850> be<00:01:46.909> surprised<00:01:47.360> if<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.690> carpet<00:01:47.960> is

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
wouldn't be surprised if the carpet is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.539 
wouldn't be surprised if the carpet is
the<00:01:48.200> only<00:01:48.409> thing<00:01:49.000> holding<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.119> up<00:01:51.430> yeah<00:01:52.430> we

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
the only thing holding it up yeah we

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.100 
the only thing holding it up yeah we
have<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.700> furnace<00:01:53.119> on<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.390> main<00:01:53.540> level<00:01:53.780> which

is<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.290> good<00:01:54.560> indication<00:01:55.009> there's<00:01:55.430> no<00:01:55.610> basement

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
I have it around a neck strap so that I

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.039 
I have it around a neck strap so that I
can<00:02:10.850> see<00:02:11.030> where<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:11.239> walking<00:02:11.390> rather<00:02:11.810> than

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
can see where I'm walking rather than

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.960 
can see where I'm walking rather than
looking<00:02:12.290> through<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> viewfinder<00:02:12.799> if<00:02:13.579> you<00:02:13.730> find

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
looking through a viewfinder if you find

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.530 
looking through a viewfinder if you find
it<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> little<00:02:14.239> wobbly<00:02:14.600> that's<00:02:15.200> why<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.910> I'm

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
heavy-duty fridge I mean I'm surprised

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.009 
heavy-duty fridge I mean I'm surprised
that<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.790> floor<00:02:23.030> can<00:02:23.299> hold<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.780> up<00:02:25.900> same<00:02:26.900> with

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
that the floor can hold it up same with

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.259 
that the floor can hold it up same with
the<00:02:27.109> furnace<00:02:28.870> my<00:02:29.870> hair<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.380> newspaper<00:02:31.269> it's

the furnace my hair is a newspaper it's

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.420 
the furnace my hair is a newspaper it's
a<00:02:32.359> flyer<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.690> find<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.829> can<00:02:33.920> never<00:02:34.160> find

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
a flyer I find that I can never find

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.030 
a flyer I find that I can never find
dates<00:02:34.730> on<00:02:34.970> fliers<00:02:37.989> sure<00:02:38.989> enough<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.500> don't<00:02:39.560> see

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
dates on fliers sure enough I don't see

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.280 
dates on fliers sure enough I don't see
one<00:02:40.250> here<00:02:40.519> but<00:02:40.820> there's<00:02:41.030> some<00:02:41.209> vinyl<00:02:41.660> here

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.069 

let's<00:02:44.860> check<00:02:45.099> that<00:02:45.310> out<00:02:48.420> pretty<00:02:49.420> faded<00:02:49.750> I

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
let's check that out pretty faded I

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.160 
let's check that out pretty faded I
can't<00:02:50.319> read<00:02:50.920> anything<00:02:51.220> on<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.030> think<00:02:52.989> it's

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
can't read anything on it I think it's

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.880 
can't read anything on it I think it's
all<00:02:53.319> faded<00:02:53.590> off<00:02:57.750> okay<00:02:58.750> that's<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.349> let's<00:02:59.680> check
