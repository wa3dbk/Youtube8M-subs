00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.440 
you can see on your meter some camping
lanterns<00:02:32.740> also<00:02:33.190> create<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.580> small<00:02:34.000> amount<00:02:34.330> of

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
lanterns also create a small amount of

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.740 
lanterns also create a small amount of
radiation<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.770> be<00:02:35.830> measured<00:02:36.540> keep<00:02:37.540> in

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
radiation that can be measured keep in

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.290 
radiation that can be measured keep in
mind<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.890> type<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.430> radiation<00:02:39.790> meter

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
mind that this type of radiation meter

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.720 
mind that this type of radiation meter
was<00:02:40.900> designed<00:02:41.349> for<00:02:41.560> radiation<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.580> air

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
was designed for radiation in the air

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.390 
was designed for radiation in the air
and<00:02:43.060> there<00:02:43.750> are<00:02:43.870> dangerous<00:02:44.130> substances<00:02:45.130> it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
and there are dangerous substances it

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.970 
and there are dangerous substances it
does<00:02:45.670> not<00:02:45.880> measure<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:47.050> if<00:02:47.080> someone<00:02:47.650> who<00:02:47.800> has<00:02:47.830> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
does not measure so if someone who has a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.920 
does not measure so if someone who has a
better<00:02:48.250> way<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.640> measuring<00:02:49.120> tells<00:02:49.750> you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
better way of measuring tells you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.350 
better way of measuring tells you
something<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.530> not<00:02:50.709> safe<00:02:51.099> you<00:02:51.880> want<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.180> listen

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
something is not safe you want to listen

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.319 
something is not safe you want to listen
and<00:02:52.660> be<00:02:52.870> careful
