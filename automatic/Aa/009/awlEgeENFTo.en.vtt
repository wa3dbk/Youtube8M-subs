 ours is the installation whole 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.540
 by default if you are now for the first 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.860
 times the program opens you come 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.250
 first to a small window 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.399
 see 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.270
 which can first maximize the first 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.210
 For the sake of clarity so currently great 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.190
 window you should first if you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.120
 because now a connection via wifi 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.960
 wanted to create on file 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.649
 go settings 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 and connect on mobile with google 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.290

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.600
 OK 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.480
 Now we see it first on the phone then 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.060

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.060

 pull down the menu press on it 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.310
 then the three options are if you only 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.329
 still wlan war proposed by 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.450
 to create a pin 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.890
 You should do that and then you have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.079

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.060
 already built for the connection 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.870
 pin code you have created is her 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.870

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.110
 like the phone book of the organizer 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.340
 notes call lists of the msi 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.620
 You are now syncing this one here 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.540
 black bars look like that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.670

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.770
 I prefer to hide then 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.020
 you can access everything here now 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.970
 on the call lists the number chosen 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:45.140

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.930

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.670
 Furthermore, you can count on your own motives 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.680
 Conversations sms to grab 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.659
 read the inbox and so on 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.459
 an important feature of this program 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.819
 is of course the file explorer 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.170
 here you can just files 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.879

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.879
 and all it files also makes 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.960
 at other looks here one 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:29.310
 temperature display a battery indicator and 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.220
 the processor load the firmware and 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.570
 other interesting information 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.270
 at the memory status you can see how 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.550
 many euros total memory occupied and 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.690
 still available 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.120
 if you still ask from increased 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.470
 Using the data explorers can you 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.580

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.080

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.970
 do that in even more detail 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.550
