 thank you all and first of all 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.699
 I want to thank so many 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.769
 so many Costa Ricans who prayed for 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.170
 thousands who made a prayer that 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.750
 They still worried without knowing me 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.420
 you do not believe it and few people knew 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.519
 but exactly a year ago for the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.890
 Holy last year everything that 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.830
 I spent with him and you remember my son 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.539
 I got sick for Easter 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.189
 I in that until that moment I thought that 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.039
 had spent the worst holy week all 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.920
 my life I knew that it was not known what it was 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.619
 then there was a dreadful diagnosis of 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.539
 eric hodgkin lymphoma had a healing 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.549
 miraculous because even the same 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.009
 doctors have told me that they do not know 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.440
 they explain something else so that eric has 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.690
 cured as sure to be a miracle of 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.119
 god I started doing biblical studies 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.539
 here all the sides of my house we did 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.250
 prayer as preparing that what you 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.429
 I'm shooting at the god I was 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.439
 preparing you will not remember anything 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.540
 I do not remember anything list I do not remember 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.540
 nothing the last memory that I have 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.150
 it's from puntarenas when you knew that 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.940
 veronica had died I knew it as 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.700
 until about a week later it was 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.730
 very hard for me it was very painful very 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.760
 painful I cried a lot to see someone 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.070
 I could think that this question is silly 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.680
 and I'm going to make you what your 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.759
 feelings and your thoughts towards the 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.430
 man suspected of killing 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.860
 veronica and of having you prostrate in this 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.840
 bed in recovery thank god if 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 I really have him as a 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.530
 feeling of pity for several 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.470
 reasons first tell me it's a 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.360
 super young boy 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.200
 then I say as such a person 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.140
 Young already has such a big problem in 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.540
 your life or already has its future 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.940
 committed or is a person who has 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.550
 come because I do not say it or whatever 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.690
 Breathalyzer says a warm person 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.940
 alcoholic who came with drugs that 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.130
 what did he come fast doing crazy 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.230
 because supposedly what they have 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.490
 counted from the statements that gave a 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.030
 boy who came with a platform 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.060
 that lightning guy threw wildly to 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.950
 scratch where in double stripe in two 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.440
 roads where you could not scratch or be 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.430
 I say 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.010
 God have you have compassion and he is going to 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.170
 have to face god is going to have 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.090
 to face the authorities and is going to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.780
 have to face your own conscience 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.700
 a lisette am to the boy and friends 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.370
 they did breathtaking obviously mine 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.130
 it came out totally negative and that of if 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.050
 it came out positive it was true my husband 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.720
 Fernando has the receipt thanks to 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.600
 God swims that forgiveness of voice towards him 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.390
 Well, I tell you that as a Christian I have 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.030
 to forgive him and at this moment it 's something 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.080
 in what I'm going to have to work 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.080
 ask God to help me 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.079
 of Christians that we forgive all god 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.969
 he does not forgive us until the worst of that 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.400
 we do we have to 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.230
 do the same but it will be something that I'm going to 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.290
 have to work with God and ask him 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.480
 God help me continue in that 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.720
 I want that if I want I want to say just 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.820
 one thing clearer list 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.640
 I am always a very careful person 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.930
 to handle them very carefully bone I 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.910
 I can say that maybe I'm the only one 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.800
 person that when I go through the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.690
 in front of the comptroller's office there is a sign 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.490
 that says no more than 40 kilometers per 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.200
 hour and I do the speed 40 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.690
 kilometers per hour and days go by and 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.489
 they whistle me here I need but there 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.470
 says you have to drive to 40 and me down 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.630
 that is not false lightning no no 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.400
 exceeds or limits speed I handle 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.850
 very well and I think that was 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.560
 clever enough and I realized that no 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.720
 it's useless for me to handle well if the 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.400
 other people do not handle well of anything 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.050
 It serves me to raise awareness in the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.420
 roads if others do not 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.850
 consciousness on the road well nothing 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.010
 it helps me to give way if others 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.230
 they do not want to give way to anything 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.880
 It helps me to be quiet at the wheel if 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.260
 everyone else is not going to be calm 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.240
 we have to do 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.280
 we have to do something lizette in the 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.960
 streets of our country teach the 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.270
 children as a sign of the new boys 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.789
 mari that said that we could 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.220
 see we could make this conversation 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.759
 graph the conversation here in your 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.940
 little bed but smiling her life still 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.319
 amen so be it blessed be god and and 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.569
 I thank God for the opportunity and 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:20.130
 I'm alive so I'm again for 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.130
 count thank you very much mari 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.379
 in back we share the value of the 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.379
 overcoming
