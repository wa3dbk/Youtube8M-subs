 Robot cars had as scenarios

 major cities of the USA and 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.730
 awesome places of china and hong 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.680
 kong 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.770
 there were four Chinese cities 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.289
 used for this production 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.719

 Great Chinese wall and mocking park 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:19.510
 where the pods appear 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.400
 we have cases installed all kinds of 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.190
 Film crews with what we can 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.980
 conclude that for Michael Bay there are no 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.680
 the impossible 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.390
 in hong kong the claim spread 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.200
 through different streets and neighborhoods 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.200
 traditional 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.670
 but the action that destroys much 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.160
 of these locations was carried out in 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.320
 studies the title that the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.900

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.290
 and of course the hundreds of explosions and the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.400
 action of the end they tested the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.620
 physical state of the event 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.780
