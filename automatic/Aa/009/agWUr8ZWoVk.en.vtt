00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
using a 3 axis gimbal the first axis you

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.810 
using a 3 axis gimbal the first axis you
want<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.519> balance<00:00:14.670> out<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:15.719> tilt<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.820> you

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
want to balance out is your tilt and you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.250 
want to balance out is your tilt and you
plug<00:00:18.029> into<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> gimbal<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.810> your<00:00:18.990> tilt

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
plug into the gimbal you have your tilt

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.950 
plug into the gimbal you have your tilt
axis<00:00:19.439> right<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.150> your<00:00:21.270> row<00:00:21.480> axis

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
axis right here you have your row axis

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.460 
axis right here you have your row axis
and<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.590> also<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.220> your<00:00:23.730> pan<00:00:24.060> axis<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and you also have your pan axis for the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.849 
and you also have your pan axis for the
all<00:00:25.710> movements<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.580> y'all<00:00:26.820> control<00:00:27.500> so<00:00:28.500> in

all movements and y'all control so in

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
all movements and y'all control so in
part<00:00:29.279> 1<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.599> cover<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
part 1 we're going to cover how to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.350 
part 1 we're going to cover how to
balance<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.800> tilt<00:00:32.279> axis<00:00:32.489> very<00:00:33.120> very

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
balance out the tilt axis very very

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.299 
balance out the tilt axis very very
simple<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.500> right<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:34.739> here's

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
simple so you can see right now here's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.020 
simple so you can see right now here's
an<00:00:35.460> example<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:37.070> properly<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.370> well

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
an example of a properly and well

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450 
an example of a properly and well
balanced<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.660> tilt<00:00:40.079> axes<00:00:40.500> wherever<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.250> leave

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
balanced out tilt axes wherever I leave

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.490 
balanced out tilt axes wherever I leave
it<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.120> little<00:00:42.329> bit<00:00:42.450> front<00:00:42.750> heavy<00:00:42.930> but

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it up it's a little bit front heavy but

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.020 
it up it's a little bit front heavy but
once<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.739> remove<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> lens<00:00:44.430> cap<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
once you remove the lens cap and you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
once you remove the lens cap and you
adjust<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> focus<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:45.870> right<00:00:46.350> wherever<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
adjust the focus just right wherever you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
adjust the focus just right wherever you
put<00:00:47.309> your<00:00:47.430> camera<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.180> should<00:00:48.480> stay<00:00:48.780> where

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
put your camera it should stay where

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.830 
put your camera it should stay where
it's<00:00:49.170> at<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.370> camera<00:00:50.670> may<00:00:50.850> move<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.329> tad

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
it's at now the camera may move a tad

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
it's at now the camera may move a tad
bit<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.920> normal<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.430> due<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
bit just this normal is due to the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
bit just this normal is due to the
nature<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> magnetic<00:00:54.629> cogging<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
nature of the magnetic cogging of the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.369 
nature of the magnetic cogging of the
motors<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.180> always<00:00:57.180> make<00:00:57.870> sure<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.170> balance

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
motors and always make sure you balance

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.520 
motors and always make sure you balance
your<00:00:58.739> camera<00:00:58.770> without<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.760> lens<00:01:00.000> cap

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
your camera without the lens cap

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.569 
your camera without the lens cap
especially<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.649> using<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.070> larger

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
especially be using like the larger

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
especially be using like the larger
Canon<00:01:03.030> L<00:01:03.180> Series<00:01:03.239> lens<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> much

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
Canon L Series lens you have a much

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.590 
Canon L Series lens you have a much
larger<00:01:05.129> heavier<00:01:05.519> lens<00:01:05.880> cap<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
larger heavier lens cap and when you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.109 
larger heavier lens cap and when you
remove<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.320> there's<00:01:08.250> no<00:01:08.460> longer<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.760> weight

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
remove it there's no longer that weight

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.969 
remove it there's no longer that weight
of<00:01:09.270> front<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.810> make<00:01:09.990> sure<00:01:10.020> your<00:01:10.320> lens<00:01:10.500> cap<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
of front so make sure your lens cap is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.490 
of front so make sure your lens cap is
removed<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.750> balance<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> tilt

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
removed when your balance of the tilt

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.580 
removed when your balance of the tilt
axis<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.100> very<00:01:14.640> easy<00:01:15.229> here's<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> balance

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
axis so very easy here's how to balance

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.380 
axis so very easy here's how to balance
it<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.860> first<00:01:17.460> off<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.909> balance<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it out first off you want to balance the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.170 
it out first off you want to balance the
horizontal<00:01:19.170> axis<00:01:20.009> right<00:01:20.159> here<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.909> tilt

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
horizontal axis right here on the tilt

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.590 
horizontal axis right here on the tilt
so<00:01:21.810> let<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.880> falls<00:01:24.119> for

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
so let go you see which way it falls for

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.640 
so let go you see which way it falls for
example<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> quickly<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:26.930> D<00:01:27.930> balance<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
example I'm a quickly of D balance the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
example I'm a quickly of D balance the
gun<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:28.979> show<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.189> guys<00:01:29.340> exactly<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> do

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
gun will show you guys exactly how to do

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
gun will show you guys exactly how to do
it<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.110> right<00:01:31.350> now<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> let<00:01:31.979> go

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it you can see right now when I let go

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.969 
it you can see right now when I let go
the<00:01:32.430> lens<00:01:33.420> down<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.990> lens<00:01:34.170> falls<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.710> first

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the lens down the lens falls out first

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
the lens down the lens falls out first
that<00:01:35.130> means<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.579> too<00:01:35.820> much<00:01:35.939> weight<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that means I have too much weight in the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
that means I have too much weight in the
front<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.140> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> slide<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.799> camera

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
front so you want to slide your camera

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
front so you want to slide your camera
back<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> little<00:01:39.119> bit<00:01:39.329> loosen<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.200> my

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
back a little bit loosen up my

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.880 
back a little bit loosen up my
quick-release<00:01:40.799> plate<00:01:41.210> move<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.710> camera<00:01:43.710> back

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
quick-release plate move my camera back

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.999 
quick-release plate move my camera back
a<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.159> bit<00:01:44.399> into<00:01:45.329> its<00:01:45.509> balance<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.799> then

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
a little bit into its balance and then

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.969 
a little bit into its balance and then
tighten<00:01:47.520> down<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:47.970> quick-release<00:01:48.329> plate<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
tighten down my quick-release plate and

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
tighten down my quick-release plate and
you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:51.000> doesn't<00:01:51.210> fall<00:01:51.540> towards<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
you can see it doesn't fall towards the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230 
you can see it doesn't fall towards the
front<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.250> doesn't<00:01:53.549> fall<00:01:53.729> towards<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
front and it doesn't fall towards the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.539 
front and it doesn't fall towards the
back<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.990> means<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.340> your

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
back so that means that you have your

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.969 
back so that means that you have your
horizontal<00:01:56.909> balance<00:01:57.600> out<00:01:57.810> pretty<00:01:58.110> well<00:01:58.229> now

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
horizontal balance out pretty well now

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.639 
horizontal balance out pretty well now
once<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.820> done<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.649> process

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
once you have that done do not process

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.740 
once you have that done do not process
to<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> roll<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.790> keep<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.270> continuing

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to the roll just keep on continuing

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.010 
to the roll just keep on continuing
balance<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> tilt<00:02:04.710> axis<00:02:04.890> now<00:02:05.899> move<00:02:06.899> your

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
balance out the tilt axis now move your

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.609 
balance out the tilt axis now move your
camera<00:02:07.729> vertically<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.420> let<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
camera vertically like so and let go and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.839 
camera vertically like so and let go and
observe<00:02:11.009> which<00:02:11.550> way<00:02:12.020> your<00:02:13.020> gimbal<00:02:13.379> goes

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
observe which way your gimbal goes

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.520 
observe which way your gimbal goes
so<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.269> you<00:02:14.420> fall<00:02:14.659> towards<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.019> bottom<00:02:15.409> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
so if you fall towards the bottom that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.619 
so if you fall towards the bottom that
means<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.890> bottom<00:02:16.549> have<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.849> fall<00:02:17.239> towards

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
means you bottom have you fall towards

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.020 
means you bottom have you fall towards
the<00:02:17.689> top<00:02:18.019> that<00:02:18.590> means<00:02:18.829> you're<00:02:18.950> top-heavy<00:02:19.430> so

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
the top that means you're top-heavy so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.789 
the top that means you're top-heavy so
in<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.780> gimbal<00:02:21.109> here<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.319> have<00:02:21.469> in<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.650> video

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
gimbal has two screws on each side you

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.229 
gimbal has two screws on each side you
can<00:02:32.840> see<00:02:32.870> here<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> total<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.680> four<00:02:33.889> screws

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
can see here a total of four screws

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.509 
can see here a total of four screws
loosen<00:02:35.239> up<00:02:35.329> those<00:02:35.450> screws<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:37.370> you're

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
loosen up those screws and then you're

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.459 
loosen up those screws and then you're
going<00:02:37.609> to<00:02:37.700> want<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:37.939> pull<00:02:38.569> this<00:02:38.659> play<00:02:38.959> forward

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
going to want to pull this play forward

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.979 
going to want to pull this play forward
or<00:02:39.799> push<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.430> plate<00:02:40.730> back<00:02:41.000> when<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.629> balance

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
or push this plate back when you balance

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.199 
or push this plate back when you balance
out<00:02:42.109> the<00:02:42.260> vertical<00:02:42.469> very<00:02:43.010> easy<00:02:43.249> so<00:02:43.760> if<00:02:43.939> fall

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
out the vertical very easy so if fall

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.240 
out the vertical very easy so if fall
towards<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:45.200> bottom<00:02:45.409> that<00:02:45.769> means<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.099> have

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
towards the bottom that means you have

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.610 
towards the bottom that means you have
too<00:02:46.519> much<00:02:46.700> weight<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.209> this<00:02:47.870> side<00:02:48.139> you're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
too much weight on this side you're

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.319 
too much weight on this side you're
going<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.799> want<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.010> slide<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.459> tray<00:02:49.760> back<00:02:50.269> a

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
going to want to slide this tray back a

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.789 
going to want to slide this tray back a
little<00:02:50.599> bit<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.989> balance<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:51.409> out<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.709> just

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
little bit to balance it out and just

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.640 
little bit to balance it out and just
make<00:02:51.949> fine<00:02:52.699> adjustments<00:02:52.849> do<00:02:53.780> very<00:02:54.109> very<00:02:54.379> small

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
make fine adjustments do very very small

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.830 
make fine adjustments do very very small
increments<00:02:54.889> at<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.189> time<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.669> keep<00:02:56.389> on<00:02:56.599> testing

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
increments at a time and keep on testing

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.209 
increments at a time and keep on testing
it<00:02:57.109> and<00:02:57.230> once<00:02:57.379> you<00:02:57.469> think<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.680> have<00:02:57.829> it<00:02:57.949> just

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
it and once you think I have it just

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.159 
it and once you think I have it just
right<00:02:58.519> tighten<00:02:59.359> down<00:02:59.389> the<00:02:59.629> screws<00:02:59.959> and

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
right tighten down the screws and

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.379 
right tighten down the screws and
double-check<00:03:01.069> wherever<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:01.969> point<00:03:02.209> your

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
double-check wherever you point your

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.539 
double-check wherever you point your
camera<00:03:02.569> lens<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.379> should<00:03:03.980> stay<00:03:04.219> there<00:03:04.280> without

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
camera lens it should stay there without

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.789 
camera lens it should stay there without
moving<00:03:05.120> at<00:03:05.269> all<00:03:05.510> once<00:03:06.139> you<00:03:06.169> have<00:03:06.379> that<00:03:06.560> done

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
moving at all once you have that done

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.709 
moving at all once you have that done
you<00:03:06.829> have<00:03:07.159> properly<00:03:07.699> balanced<00:03:08.209> out<00:03:08.299> your<00:03:08.449> tilt

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
you have properly balanced out your tilt

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.349 
you have properly balanced out your tilt
axis<00:03:08.949> this<00:03:09.949> may<00:03:10.129> take<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.519> for<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.819> first<00:03:11.090> try

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359
