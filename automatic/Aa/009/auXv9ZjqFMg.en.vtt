stuff like how can we not care how can
you<00:02:35.620> do<00:02:35.710> let<00:02:35.890> people<00:02:36.160> walk<00:02:36.310> over<00:02:36.550> you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
you do let people walk over you

you do let people walk over you
I<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.720> just<00:02:37.930> not<00:02:38.110> respond<00:02:38.980> it's<00:02:39.430> like<00:02:40.150> me

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
I can you just not respond it's like me

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.180 
I can you just not respond it's like me
saying<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.530> much<00:02:41.650> easier<00:02:41.860> to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
saying that it's so much easier to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.000 
saying that it's so much easier to
respond<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.940> negativity<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.630> could<00:02:43.870> respond<00:02:44.770> to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
respond to negativity I could respond to

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.130 
respond to negativity I could respond to
being<00:02:45.310> better<00:02:45.760> if<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.150> respond<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.960> mean

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
being better if you respond this I mean

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.680 
being better if you respond this I mean
exactly<00:02:48.070> like<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.340> person<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:49.330> on<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
exactly like that person but on the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.570 
exactly like that person but on the
other<00:02:49.750> hand<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.470> much<00:02:50.620> harder<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.310> just

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
other hand it's so much harder to just

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.030 
other hand it's so much harder to just
walk<00:02:51.880> away<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.420> for<00:02:52.900> me<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.290> think<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.650> takes<00:02:53.830> so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
walk away and for me I think it takes so

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.830 
walk away and for me I think it takes so
much<00:02:54.190> more<00:02:54.250> strength<00:02:54.880> what<00:02:55.270> do<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.630> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
much more strength what do you like and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.620 
much more strength what do you like and
dislike<00:02:55.930> about<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.680> community<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.090> love

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
dislike about the community so I love

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.420 
dislike about the community so I love
that<00:02:58.840> moment<00:02:59.140> everything<00:02:59.590> absolutely

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430
