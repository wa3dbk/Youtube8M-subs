black<00:02:13.650> ops<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.160> everything<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.910> was

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
black ops and everything so I was

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.700 
black ops and everything so I was
playing<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.480> lot<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.720> cod4<00:02:15.900> before<00:02:16.500> modern

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
playing a lot of cod4 before modern

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.990
