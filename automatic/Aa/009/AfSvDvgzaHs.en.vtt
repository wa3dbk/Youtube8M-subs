00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.059
 hello everyone here you have the fourth part 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.969
 of the videos dedicated to bicycles 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.679
 of learning without pedals remember that 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.869
 we want to clarify if the bicycles 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.490
 Learning without pedals are the best 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.070
 option as first bicycle for 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.050
 our children in this video os 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.300
 I will comment on what elements of quality and 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.120
 security we should look at a 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.220
 learning bicycle 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.230
 Quality and safety are themes 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.690
 essential when buying from 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.840
 our children toys and even more in the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.840
 bicycles we must minimize risks and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.520
 maximize comfort the child the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.950
 learning bicycle that we neglect 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.220
 buy our children must have 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.570
 The following minimum characteristics 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.300
 you are made of high materials 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.340
 quality resistant to shock with 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.040
 metals anti corruption and painted with 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.930
 Stain resistant paintings should 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.019
 be light so that the child can with 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.269
 We will see in the care and look at 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.670
 that critical zones are protected 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.970
 to avoid costs like the handlebar in 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.220
 picture etcetera the saddle and the biggest and 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.290
 The handlebars must be adjustable in 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.270
 height for the bike to adapt 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.240
 perfectly at the height of the child and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.940
 this one does not acquire more structures 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.340
 fear without ergonomic to facilitate a 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.590
 good back posture 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.290
 the box should preferably be low 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.870
 to facilitate access for children is 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.530
 say mount and dismount without risk or 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.540
 help the wheels and the steering must 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.590
 to be with bearings for a maximum 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.590
 comfort and durability 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.670
 on this bike we can see more details 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.640
 highlight again a couple of points 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.430
 low box to facilitate entry and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.869
 departure of the child from the bicycle ' 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.110
 protection of certain parties such as 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.110
 handlebar 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.390
 so we finish the fourth of the six 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.490
 videos of the series and remember what 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.040
 important is that our son acquires 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.020
 Dexterity with balance if you want 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.540
