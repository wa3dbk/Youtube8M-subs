 nothing more than this time at the time 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.450
 to train we are going to put 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.190
 olive so that it does not stick 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.050
 then we will we leave then we go 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.670
 go with the sauce and for the sauce I'm going to 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.140
 start melting butter and in what 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.240
 you help me to melt butter 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.010
 Start by helping with the pumpkin 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.300
 castilla come here for the 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.130
 Castilla pumpkin we have to 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.450
 remove all the skin was a little 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.400
 I work very careful when it 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.680
 manipulating with the knife because it 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.420
 could cut is a new and tough 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.920
 very very hard the shell of the pumpkin 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.840
 this next social thing you have to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.610
 buy it already cut into pieces that is 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.990
 much easier to remove a 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.030
 bit like this the skin usually 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.500
 the taste of the pumpkin is like sweet 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.470
 that's why you have to put a little 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.330
 of salt with the mouse for the mouse 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.300
 final we are like the poster of the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.300
 gradient we add now 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.890
 poor things very well until the onion 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.000
 garlic already and you start to mix water with 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.730
 the temperatures are not going to happen to us 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.530
 to burn the butter to stay 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.440
 softly 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.770
 and transparent and add the puree 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.750
 Castilla pumpkin when you have 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.250
 achieved that has already been cooked 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.500
 perfectly the pumpkin is going to remove 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.600
 all the excess moisture because it grabs 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.640
 a lot of water takes away all that excess 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.230
 of moisture does not strain well well well and it 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.550
 will be a puree like this to the best 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.160
 you have to pass it through a processor 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.810
 because a duckling does not do very well there 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.760
 you start to mix it and I start it 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.100
 cooking is already pureed remember 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.660
 remove that excess moisture because if 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.580
 not after I will be very garlic to the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.100
 salt and then we started mixing it with the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.810
 onion and with garlic and try 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.269
 do with the taste of butter already 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.430
 let's let about 5 minutes from there 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.830
 he comes here because not because 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.300
 bring the pumpkin that we just 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.280
 mix you're going to put here in the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.690
 blender 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.690
 while I'm putting the cream 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.510
 we started to mix hahaha I tried 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.150
 help because I'm going to burn I need 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.770
 to use this 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.780
 Oh 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.960
 to see me lift me as much as I go 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.960
 fall out 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.750
 over there we're going to start grinding a 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.190
 little you will be little prince 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.190
 work but it's a little something 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.819
 and unemployment 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.209
 and start mixing everything that was left 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:05.790
 adhered to the walls of the mind but 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.709
 not since it's there if we demanded to put 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.120
 a chili will have to be here but as 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.569
 is the pure pain is not necessary to put 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.569
 the thing 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.829
 there we stop and we go back to 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.109
 the pan where we were 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.150
 this is here for me to think and 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:29.410
 I say in other places about him 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.849
 and if we put a little bit of 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.129
 chicken concentrate by shape 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:38.240
 and we will put in the mouth does not 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:41.080
 I want the habit 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:48.370
 to take from here is why not 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.370
 because it is characteristic of the chipotle 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.229
 please enter and when you are 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.699
 list in our sauce I just seasoned 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.560
 with chicken concentrate and says that 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.330
 I put good when the sauce is ready 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.190
 we do the usual thing whether I 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.620
 I added the pasta directly to the sauce 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.750
 or serve the pasta on a plate and bathe with 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.659
 the pumpkin sauce of Castilla what 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.639
 prefer directly here is already 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:20.830
 perfectly well we already serve it 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.830
 mixed and also here 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.030
 and there begins the mixture that lowe 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.730
 surprise because they are or not 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.210
 this we are going to put a touch of 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.160
 goat cheese cashews and 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.270
 we are going to splash it with a little bit 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.590
 of parsley and this pumpkin legs are 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.390

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.650

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.390
 Here it was also opened also 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.430
 we can put there already once the 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.470
 original 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.150
 although I want to let you understand that the 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.930
 diego schedules imagine they want a 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.930
 joke 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.930
 true that the one who does not say
