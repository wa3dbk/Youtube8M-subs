00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.199
 my time last January and with which more followers 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.469
 We wish the song of Cristian Castro the tone of your voice 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.579
 it seemed to me that they could give 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.789
 and actually had moderate press 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:21.389
 it was very good and if I can not succeed vocals really had no doubt for 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.139
 many more 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.919
 we did was that we noticed something that bothers 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.199
 that something that bothered us we do not know very well what is maybe the choreography 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.339
 because we felt it was common 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:38.649
 very thoughtful to the heavens they were too thoughtful and nothing hinault 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:42.859
 miloc of naturalness as it removed coming from your own body we 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.089
 did and only that bothered you 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.919
 if your body has that sense of having to be doing a 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.309
 choreography at some times highly and I was singing and josÃ© that 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:57.219
 is much impacted with the subject of breathing changes the theme of the 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.559
 breathing 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:02.689
 we ask you that txiki was made to see what is happening with your body 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.979
 with choreography 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:05.939
 with the voice 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.359
 everything so that everything is a million all dyn 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.979
 be chord because I went was out of date today we felt time something bothered you and 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.389
 we assume it is the body but we ask you to think about it 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.809
 as a duty for beasts 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:23.219
 the decision of this jury
