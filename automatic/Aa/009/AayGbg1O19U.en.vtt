00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 Hello, today's video will be 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.960
 dedicated to effective use 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.460
 ammunition on different types of equipment 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.740
 I'll show you by the example of the attack helicopter 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.320
 since the principle is the same and easy 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.289
 transferred for example to tank bmp or 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.630
 anti - aircraft gun and so we sit down a helicopter and see 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.320
 that by default we have twenty 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.630
 eight rockets 14 in a cage and 14 in stock 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.300
 to recharge what needs to be done 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.699
 we shoot one and immediately see that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.320
 it starts the recharge cycle that is in 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.469
 we will end up with almost three 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.960
 full both 14 plus 27 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.860
 let's immediately switch to a place 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 arrow and do the same thing went cycle 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.680
 recharge come back and see 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.829
 that 27 is another interesting nuance if we 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.489
 try to continuously shoot all 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.489
 three clips 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.990
 get the fourth with a slight delay 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:25.300
 which is very convenient in some 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:31.210
 situations and let's try the same 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.790
 most have the shooter and so 30 plus 80 84 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.420
 almost full battle we begin 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.420
 shoot off 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.040
 and 5 with very little delay here 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.290
 such a simple way to improve your 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.860
 combat effectiveness on different types 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.840
 technology 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.840
 Thank you all for your attention yet
