figure from my previous review so I was

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.470

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
excited about this figure for a few

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.630 
excited about this figure for a few
reasons<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.079> thought<00:00:58.680> first<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> foremost

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
reasons I thought first and foremost

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
reasons I thought first and foremost
that<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.879> sculpt<00:01:00.270> was<00:01:00.420> absolutely<00:01:01.320> gorgeous

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
that the sculpt was absolutely gorgeous

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
that the sculpt was absolutely gorgeous
and<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.129> huge<00:01:02.550> factor<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and a huge factor in that was the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420 
and a huge factor in that was the
incredible<00:01:04.140> character<00:01:04.530> design<00:01:04.830> while<00:01:05.220> his

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
incredible character design while his

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.370 
incredible character design while his
outfit<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.390> less<00:01:06.630> flamboyant<00:01:07.200> than<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
outfit is much less flamboyant than the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
outfit is much less flamboyant than the
rest<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.860> he<00:01:08.010> still<00:01:08.280> looked<00:01:08.460> amazing<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
rest of them he still looked amazing and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.550 
rest of them he still looked amazing and
had<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.479> pose<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.020> was<00:01:10.140> completely

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
had this pose that was completely

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
had this pose that was completely
fitting<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.220> his<00:01:11.340> character<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.000> let's<00:01:12.390> just

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
fitting of his character so let's just

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.969

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
between the collar and his neck while I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.240 
between the collar and his neck while I
mentioned<00:02:19.349> with<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.470> Tokyo<00:02:19.830> figure<00:02:20.099> before

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
odd because his scarf was a little too

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.449 
odd because his scarf was a little too
tight<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.480> neck<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:25.980> wrong

there's this gap here and it's really

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.040 
there's this gap here and it's really
hard<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.220> explain<00:02:29.459> why<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.269> horrible<00:02:30.660> but

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
hard to explain why it's so horrible but

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.900 
hard to explain why it's so horrible but
I<00:02:31.080> really<00:02:31.560> hope<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:31.920> see<00:02:32.220> my<00:02:32.370> issue<00:02:32.610> with

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
it if you look at the way that his neck

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.140 
it if you look at the way that his neck
is<00:02:34.860> sculpted<00:02:35.370> his<00:02:35.519> Adam's<00:02:35.790> apple<00:02:36.090> is

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
of his neck so when you put his head in

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.539 
of his neck so when you put his head in
there<00:02:40.200> there's<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.410> very<00:02:40.620> obvious<00:02:40.800> gap<00:02:41.370> which

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
there there's a very obvious gap which

is<00:02:41.580> kind<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.030> ruined<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.540> figure<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:42.989> me<00:02:43.170> I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
is kind of ruined the figure for me I

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.380 
is kind of ruined the figure for me I
have<00:02:43.680> no<00:02:43.890> idea<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> regular

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
I'm probably the only one who cares but

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.979 
I'm probably the only one who cares but
I<00:02:49.620> invested<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> 8,000<00:02:51.330> yen<00:02:51.540> into<00:02:51.750> this
