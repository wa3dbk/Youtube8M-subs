00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
sort the calves off early on so they

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.660

of<00:00:41.960> loading<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.110> way<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.649> could<00:00:43.770> load<00:00:43.950> them

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
of loading that way you could load them

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.310 
of loading that way you could load them
in<00:00:44.280> separate<00:00:44.610> compartments<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:45.270> well<00:00:45.450> then

in separate compartments as well then

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.560 
in separate compartments as well then
you<00:00:46.440> need<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> pay<00:00:46.829> attention<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:48.059> size<00:00:48.329> of

the cattle at your putting each

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.470 
the cattle at your putting each
compartment<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> mix<00:00:50.879> large

cattle and small cattle in the same

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.670 
cattle and small cattle in the same
compartment<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.360> focus<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.899> low<00:00:55.379> stress

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
compartment when we focus on low stress

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040 
compartment when we focus on low stress
livestock<00:00:56.219> handling<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:57.300> try<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> focus<00:00:57.750> on

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
livestock handling we try to focus on

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.319 
livestock handling we try to focus on
getting<00:00:58.230> cattle<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> work<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.280> us<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.059> not

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
getting cattle to work for us and not

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.060 
getting cattle to work for us and not
trying<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> force<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> cattle<00:01:01.350> loop<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.890> go

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
trying to force the cattle loop to go

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.500 
trying to force the cattle loop to go
somewhere<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:02.910> don't<00:01:03.030> want<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> go

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
somewhere they really don't want to go

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.200 
somewhere they really don't want to go
and<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> establish<00:01:05.129> movement<00:01:06.119> in

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and so you have to establish movement in

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
and so you have to establish movement in
the<00:01:06.299> set<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.600> cattle<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.470> try<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> manage

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the set of cattle and then try to manage

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.300 
the set of cattle and then try to manage
that<00:01:08.520> movement<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.060> reduce<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> stress<00:01:10.320> when

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that movement so reduce the stress when

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
that movement so reduce the stress when
you're<00:01:11.460> loading<00:01:11.790> cattle<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.270> once<00:01:12.930> again<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you're loading cattle out once again you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.539 
you're loading cattle out once again you
want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.470> make<00:01:13.590> sure<00:01:13.619> everything's<00:01:14.250> set<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
want to make sure everything's set and

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.910 
want to make sure everything's set and
ready<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:16.049> bring<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> cattle<00:01:16.770> up

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ready to go and then bring the cattle up

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
ready to go and then bring the cattle up
and<00:01:17.100> start<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> loading<00:01:17.729> process<00:01:17.939> once<00:01:18.840> again

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and start the loading process once again

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
and start the loading process once again
right<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.590> we've<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> raise<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> floor

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
right here we've got to raise the floor

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.030 
right here we've got to raise the floor
on<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.000> particular<00:01:21.330> shoot<00:01:21.810> toward<00:01:22.619> matches

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
up with the back of that trailer

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
up with the back of that trailer
there's<00:01:25.320> also<00:01:25.470> another<00:01:25.710> issue<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.430> this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
there's also another issue with this

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.609 
there's also another issue with this
shoot<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.390> board's<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> side<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.470> need

shoot the board's on the side of it need

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.929 
shoot the board's on the side of it need

to be replaced once again that's all for

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.480 
to be replaced once again that's all for
safety<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> livestock<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:34.380> lot<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.220> people

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
think sides of a shoot have to be solid

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.370 
think sides of a shoot have to be solid
that's<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.880> necessarily<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.020> low

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380

it's<00:01:43.350> better<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.860> open<00:01:44.250> sided<00:01:44.490> shoots

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it's better to have open sided shoots

the other aspect of this we don't talk
about<00:03:16.260> very<00:03:16.410> often<00:03:17.070> are<00:03:17.670> these<00:03:17.880> self<00:03:18.329> catch

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
about very often are these self catch

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.060 
about very often are these self catch
latches<00:03:19.880> these<00:03:20.880> are<00:03:21.060> very<00:03:21.239> important<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.890> can

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
latches these are very important you can

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.069 
latches these are very important you can
push<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.850> gate<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.510> will<00:03:24.630> latch<00:03:24.810> itself

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
push that gate and it will latch itself

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.650 
push that gate and it will latch itself
if<00:03:25.769> you're<00:03:25.980> having<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.430> try<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.760> pin<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> gate<00:03:27.420> at

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
if you're having to try to pin a gate at

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
this point in time it puts you in a very

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.199 
this point in time it puts you in a very
unsafe<00:03:30.390> position<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.370> all<00:03:32.640> possible

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
unsafe position so if you all possible

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.660 
unsafe position so if you all possible
go<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.630> these<00:03:33.810> self<00:03:34.140> catch<00:03:34.380> latches<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.160> then

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
go to these self catch latches and then

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.310
