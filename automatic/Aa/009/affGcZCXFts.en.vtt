one<00:06:38.449> in<00:06:38.720> particular<00:06:38.990> and<00:06:39.380> that<00:06:39.410> will<00:06:40.010> be

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
one in particular and that will be

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.290 
one in particular and that will be
remedied<00:06:40.430> when<00:06:40.699> these<00:06:40.820> go<00:06:40.970> in<00:06:41.060> a<00:06:41.120> full

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
remedied when these go in a full

remedied when these go in a full
production<00:06:41.450> is<00:06:41.870> and<00:06:42.110> it's<00:06:42.889> kind<00:06:43.070> of<00:06:43.099> hard<00:06:43.310> to

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
production is and it's kind of hard to

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.540 
production is and it's kind of hard to
tell<00:06:43.580> is<00:06:43.880> the<00:06:44.210> handles<00:06:44.690> are<00:06:44.930> squared<00:06:45.349> off<00:06:45.550> so

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
tell is the handles are squared off so

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.339 
tell is the handles are squared off so
