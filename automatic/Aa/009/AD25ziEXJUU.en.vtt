00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.299
 good hello youtube friends in this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.310
 video we should teach how to do 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.500
 so that it works to find where we 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 this problem appears 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.350
 for example sometimes we open and we 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.590
 appears this to that for example what now 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.590
 now 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.530
 Y 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.070
 we do not appear anything I do not 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.160
 We did not expect to wait and nothing happens 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.190
 good is always the first step not 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.809
 we have to go to the beginning and on equipment 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.989
 we press right click expose 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.989
 properties here properties 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.679
 well once the system does not appear 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.729
 we wait for everything to be done there 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:10.930
 now we put here the top 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.930
 abused system configuration 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.740
 we hope start now with the house opened 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.050
 and once it's opened we put 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.620
 here in configuration is not seconds from 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.760
 victor 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.720
 the first here advanced options 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.470
 configurations 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.470
 to the configuration 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.620
 well the class is not going to open this and 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.380
 we are going to see three bases defects 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.230
 visual advanced options and forecast 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.080
 data execution we press in pressure 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.540
 of data management and here if it's not going to 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.290
 appear like this we put of these two 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.270
 obviously we put here to activate of for 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.520
 all the worst services except the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.880
 that the elections we put to spout 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.880
 add 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.260
 and now 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.260
 let's find our folder 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.790
 but I'm not going to teach what he feels 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.860
 they are program file 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.860
 and here 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.880
 and where does it end on hp we put it 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.880
 we can apply 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.610
 and accept we can be good that was 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.950
