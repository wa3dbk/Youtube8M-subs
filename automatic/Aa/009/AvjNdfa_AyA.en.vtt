00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
where to form and it is channel like

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.040 
where to form and it is channel like
they<00:04:33.830> have<00:04:34.100> this<00:04:34.280> thing<00:04:34.550> channel<00:04:35.210> 1<00:04:35.450> through<00:04:35.750> 4

mobs<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.240> means<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:42.230> you<00:04:42.350> could<00:04:42.560> get<00:04:42.740> more

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
mobs it means that you could get more

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.620

more<00:04:44.030> an<00:04:44.240> axe<00:04:44.450> from<00:04:44.780> them<00:04:45.020> so<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:47.180> killed<00:04:47.480> them

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
more an axe from them so we killed them

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.140 
more an axe from them so we killed them
you<00:04:47.750> got<00:04:47.960> more<00:04:48.230> than<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.530> usual<00:04:48.740> but<00:04:49.580> their

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
you got more than the usual but their

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.960 
you got more than the usual but their
defense<00:04:50.900> is<00:04:51.080> also<00:04:51.230> increased<00:04:51.800> their<00:04:52.310> defense

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
defense is also increased their defense

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.580 
defense is also increased their defense
and<00:04:53.860> something<00:04:54.860> else<00:04:55.070> I<00:04:55.310> forgot<00:04:55.640> so<00:04:56.390> it<00:04:57.320> is

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
and something else I forgot so it is

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.200 
and something else I forgot so it is
actually<00:04:57.890> more<00:04:58.310> increased<00:04:58.790> and<00:05:00.730> let's<00:05:01.730> see

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
actually more increased and let's see

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.250 
actually more increased and let's see
NABBA<00:05:03.200> lights<00:05:03.530> work<00:05:04.220> as<00:05:04.490> well<00:05:04.730> I<00:05:05.030> don't<00:05:05.960> really

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
NABBA lights work as well I don't really

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.700 
NABBA lights work as well I don't really
know<00:05:06.470> how<00:05:06.710> do<00:05:06.770> they<00:05:06.980> work<00:05:07.460> really<00:05:07.760> but<00:05:08.710> these

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
know how do they work really but these

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.710 
know how do they work really but these
are<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.130> never<00:05:10.340> likes<00:05:10.580> maybe<00:05:11.060> it<00:05:11.270> might<00:05:11.540> be

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
are the never likes maybe it might be

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.659 
are the never likes maybe it might be
familiar<00:05:11.900> for<00:05:12.410> some<00:05:12.590> of<00:05:12.710> you<00:05:12.830> guys<00:05:12.860> might<00:05:13.460> not

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
familiar for some of you guys might not

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.390 
familiar for some of you guys might not
be<00:05:13.880> familiar<00:05:14.210> for<00:05:14.600> some<00:05:15.140> of<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.320> guys<00:05:15.400> but

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
be familiar for some of you guys but

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.890 
be familiar for some of you guys but
those<00:05:16.700> are<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.000> neighbor<00:05:17.210> lights<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.780> you

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
those are the neighbor lights and you

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.220 
those are the neighbor lights and you
can<00:05:17.930> add<00:05:18.200> them<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.560> equipment<00:05:19.190> so<00:05:20.120> we're<00:05:20.930> sad

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
can add them to equipment so we're sad

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
can add them to equipment so we're sad
or<00:05:22.360> maybe<00:05:23.360> like<00:05:23.660> you<00:05:24.500> can<00:05:24.680> mount<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:25.070> never

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
or maybe like you can mount and never

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.020 
or maybe like you can mount and never
lay<00:05:25.400> on<00:05:25.580> this<00:05:25.669> item

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
lay on this item

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.330

at<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.240> bottom<00:05:26.390> of<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.810> equip<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.979> can<00:05:28.160> add

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
at the bottom of the equip you can add

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.570 
at the bottom of the equip you can add
one<00:05:28.580> I'm<00:05:28.910> not<00:05:29.030> gonna<00:05:29.120> add<00:05:29.360> it<00:05:29.510> because<00:05:30.520> I'm<00:05:31.520> not

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
one I'm not gonna add it because I'm not

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.969 
one I'm not gonna add it because I'm not
adding<00:05:32.270> anything<00:05:32.690> yet<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:33.440> as<00:05:33.590> you<00:05:33.680> can<00:05:33.800> see

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
this is an example look at the bottom it

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.330 
this is an example look at the bottom it
says<00:05:36.310> 18%<00:05:37.310> so<00:05:37.520> I<00:05:37.550> added<00:05:37.940> a<00:05:38.000> b1<00:05:38.450> so<00:05:39.410> it<00:05:40.130> just

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
says 18% so I added a b1 so it just

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.730 
says 18% so I added a b1 so it just
makes<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.760> stronger<00:05:41.300> right<00:05:42.169> now<00:05:42.350> this<00:05:42.560> is

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
your ears just kidding this server has

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.760 
your ears just kidding this server has
doubled<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:51.040> the<00:05:52.040> defense<00:05:52.820> on<00:05:53.120> bosses<00:05:53.770> for

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
doubled the the defense on bosses for

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.500 
doubled the the defense on bosses for
the<00:05:54.890> reason<00:05:55.220> that<00:05:55.250> people<00:05:55.700> are<00:05:55.970> heading<00:05:56.300> cap

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
the reason that people are heading cap

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.000 
the reason that people are heading cap
damage<00:05:56.930> easy<00:05:57.260> so<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:58.100> server<00:05:58.910> owner<00:05:59.300> wants<00:05:59.810> to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
damage easy so the server owner wants to

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.680 
damage easy so the server owner wants to
make<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:01.100> server<00:06:01.340> a<00:06:01.430> little<00:06:01.700> bit<00:06:01.820> harder<00:06:02.210> so

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
make the server a little bit harder so

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.850 
make the server a little bit harder so
he<00:06:02.870> decided<00:06:03.320> to<00:06:03.590> increase<00:06:03.919> double<00:06:04.460> D<00:06:04.640> the

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
he decided to increase double D the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.520 
he decided to increase double D the
defense<00:06:06.860> on<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.250> bosses<00:06:07.669> so<00:06:08.450> people<00:06:08.810> wouldn't

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
defense on the bosses so people wouldn't

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.620 
defense on the bosses so people wouldn't
be<00:06:09.950> hitting<00:06:10.130> cap<00:06:10.460> damage<00:06:10.880> and<00:06:11.060> it<00:06:11.150> will<00:06:11.300> get<00:06:11.600> a

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
be hitting cap damage and it will get a

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.600 
be hitting cap damage and it will get a
little<00:06:12.050> better<00:06:12.200> a<00:06:12.440> little<00:06:12.740> harder<00:06:13.250> from<00:06:13.430> them

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
little better a little harder from them

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.210 
little better a little harder from them
and<00:06:13.970> honestly<00:06:14.690> I<00:06:14.810> did<00:06:15.140> not<00:06:15.169> get<00:06:15.650> that<00:06:15.710> the

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220
