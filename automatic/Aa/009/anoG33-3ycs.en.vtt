00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.900 
again this little kitchen area nobody
human<00:02:31.670> kitchen<00:02:32.630> extended<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:34.550> this<00:02:34.640> little

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
human kitchen extended to this little

area<00:02:35.060> here<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.690> have<00:02:36.530> noticed<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:37.070> little<00:02:37.220> bit<00:02:37.459> of

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
area here I have noticed a little bit of

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.070 
area here I have noticed a little bit of
framerate<00:02:37.820> problems<00:02:38.300> with<00:02:38.480> this<00:02:38.600> mod<00:02:38.810> but

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
framerate problems with this mod but

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.390 
framerate problems with this mod but
that's<00:02:39.320> probably<00:02:39.530> just<00:02:39.770> because<00:02:39.950> my<00:02:40.220> computer

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
that's probably just because my computer

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.540 
that's probably just because my computer
is<00:02:40.730> just<00:02:40.760> too<00:02:41.330> old<00:02:41.620> at<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:42.860> point<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.400> really

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
is just too old at this point to really

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.430 
is just too old at this point to really
handle<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:43.940> lot<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.150> these<00:02:44.209> bigger<00:02:44.450> mods<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.200> if

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
handle a lot of these bigger mods so if

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.840 
handle a lot of these bigger mods so if
you<00:02:45.530> see<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.739> performance<00:02:46.010> drops<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:46.640> most

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
you see the performance drops it's most

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.630 
you see the performance drops it's most
likely<00:02:46.910> my<00:02:47.209> computer<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:48.620> this<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:49.130> Manor

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
likely my computer but this in Manor

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.729 
likely my computer but this in Manor
home<00:02:50.330> space<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.750> actually<00:02:51.020> pretty<00:02:51.230> big<00:02:51.440> so

inside house smithing supplies this is

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.710 
inside house smithing supplies this is
the<00:05:55.159> small<00:05:55.489> simple<00:05:55.699> shop

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.990 

once<00:06:00.350> again<00:06:00.470> I'm<00:06:00.770> pretty<00:06:01.010> much<00:06:01.070> it<00:06:01.400> so<00:06:01.730> all<00:06:01.850> the

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
once again I'm pretty much it so all the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.500 
once again I'm pretty much it so all the
integers<00:06:02.450> are<00:06:02.630> pretty<00:06:03.140> small<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.650> know<00:06:04.510> the

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
integers are pretty small you know the

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.090 
integers are pretty small you know the
end<00:06:05.720> is<00:06:05.870> the<00:06:05.990> biggest<00:06:06.380> one<00:06:06.530> but<00:06:06.740> I<00:06:06.800> mean<00:06:06.950> that's

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
end is the biggest one but I mean that's

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.350 
end is the biggest one but I mean that's
just<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.310> standard<00:06:07.490> and<00:06:07.790> we'll<00:06:07.940> take<00:06:08.030> a<00:06:08.090> look<00:06:08.270> at

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
just a standard and we'll take a look at

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.760 
just a standard and we'll take a look at
that<00:06:08.450> the<00:06:08.630> next<00:06:08.660> your<00:06:09.590> binds

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
that the next your binds

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.830 
that the next your binds
overall<00:06:12.770> this<00:06:12.920> mod<00:06:13.070> is<00:06:13.220> pretty<00:06:13.850> sweet<00:06:14.390> the
