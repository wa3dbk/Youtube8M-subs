now<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.800> very<00:02:29.860> interesting<00:02:30.490> all<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:30.880> is

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
now this is very interesting all I do is

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.330 
now this is very interesting all I do is
I<00:02:31.210> put<00:02:31.390> my<00:02:31.510> hand<00:02:31.750> near<00:02:32.170> here<00:02:32.530> I'm<00:02:32.860> not<00:02:33.070> even

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
I put my hand near here I'm not even

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.090 
I put my hand near here I'm not even
touching<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.810> power<00:02:35.020> strip<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.710> can<00:02:35.890> see

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
touching the power strip and you can see

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.970 
touching the power strip and you can see
them<00:02:36.190> at<00:02:36.340> one<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.700> half<00:02:36.880> volts<00:02:37.180> AC<00:02:38.110> that's

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
them at one and a half volts AC that's

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.340 
them at one and a half volts AC that's
not<00:02:39.430> exactly<00:02:40.030> healthy<00:02:40.300> for<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.720> body<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.230> be

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
not exactly healthy for the body to be

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.750 
not exactly healthy for the body to be
running<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:44.560> right<00:02:44.650> now<00:02:45.310> I'm<00:02:45.430> going<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.670> put

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
running all right now I'm going to put

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.930 
running all right now I'm going to put
my<00:02:45.880> hand<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.580> power<00:02:48.730> strip<00:02:49.120> right<00:02:49.360> here<00:02:49.890> so

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
my hand on the power strip right here so

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.640 
my hand on the power strip right here so
by<00:02:51.940> being<00:02:52.480> exposed<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.170> electrical

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
by being exposed to the electrical

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.740 
by being exposed to the electrical
fields<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.220> power<00:02:54.400> strip<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.420> see

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
fields on the power strip you can see

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.100 
fields on the power strip you can see
that<00:02:55.900> my<00:02:56.020> body's<00:02:56.410> running<00:02:57.390> over<00:02:58.390> three<00:02:58.720> volts

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
that my body's running over three volts

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.180 
that my body's running over three volts
and<00:02:59.320> now<00:03:00.660> right<00:03:01.660> down<00:03:01.840> here<00:03:02.320> I'm<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:03.010> going

to the power strip or any other
electrical<00:03:38.980> fields<00:03:39.490> you'll<00:03:39.610> see<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.690> just

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
electrical fields you'll see that just

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.290 
electrical fields you'll see that just
the<00:03:40.930> ambient<00:03:41.170> electrical<00:03:42.130> fields<00:03:42.610> in<00:03:42.760> this

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
the ambient electrical fields in this

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:52.140 
the ambient electrical fields in this
room<00:03:43.660> are<00:03:47.850> almost<00:03:48.850> 900<00:03:49.600> millivolts<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:52.120> I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
room are almost 900 millivolts and so I

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.869 
room are almost 900 millivolts and so I
touch<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.720> grounding<00:03:53.230> pad<00:03:53.470> right<00:03:53.710> here

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.649 

i<00:03:58.909> touch<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.810> grounding<00:04:00.260> pad<00:04:00.469> and<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:02.450> goes

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
i touch the grounding pad and it goes

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:09.550 
i touch the grounding pad and it goes
down<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.319> 15<00:04:03.829> millivolts<00:04:08.109> roughly<00:04:09.109> 15

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
down to 15 millivolts roughly 15

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.250 
down to 15 millivolts roughly 15
millivolts

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.440 

all<00:04:16.860> right<00:04:17.040> so<00:04:17.220> it's<00:04:17.340> very<00:04:17.550> important<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.240> be

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
all right so it's very important to be

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.450 
all right so it's very important to be
grounded<00:04:19.020> while<00:04:19.650> you're<00:04:19.890> working<00:04:20.130> at<00:04:20.430> your

to<00:05:04.080> touch<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:05.190> power<00:05:05.400> strip<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.260> three

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
to touch the power strip that is three

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.740 
to touch the power strip that is three
and<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.950> half<00:05:08.100> volts<00:05:08.400> that's<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:09.000> lot<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.330> AC

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
and a half volts that's a lot of AC

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.810 
and a half volts that's a lot of AC
electricity<00:05:10.260> which<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:10.740> not<00:05:11.100> normal<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:11.610> the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
electricity which is not normal for the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.210 
electricity which is not normal for the
body<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.270> be<00:05:12.390> running<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:12.950> then<00:05:13.950> I'm<00:05:14.010> going<00:05:14.130> to

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
body to be running and then I'm going to

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.830 
body to be running and then I'm going to
step<00:05:14.430> on<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.610> grounding<00:05:15.120> pad<00:05:15.330> down<00:05:15.570> here

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
step on the grounding pad down here

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.510 
step on the grounding pad down here
barefoot<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:17.120> immediately<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.240> can<00:05:18.420> see

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
barefoot and immediately you can see

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.930 
barefoot and immediately you can see
that<00:05:20.520> my<00:05:20.670> body<00:05:20.910> voltage<00:05:21.330> goes<00:05:21.540> down<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:21.960> 12

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
that my body voltage goes down to 12

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.000 
that my body voltage goes down to 12
millivolts<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:25.110> best<00:05:25.290> thing<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.560> do<00:05:25.830> when

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
millivolts so the best thing to do when

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.440 
millivolts so the best thing to do when
