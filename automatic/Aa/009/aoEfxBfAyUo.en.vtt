00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
ideal and you want to be using this on a

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.010 
ideal and you want to be using this on a
regular<00:01:39.680> basis<00:01:40.280> but<00:01:40.520> for<00:01:41.270> an<00:01:41.360> emergency<00:01:41.930> were

it's to harness and they're going to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.690 
it's to harness and they're going to
combine<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.750> harness<00:01:57.080> with<00:01:57.920> some<00:01:58.250> equipment

invention of harnesses and equipment the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.330 
invention of harnesses and equipment the
first<00:02:27.769> technique<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:29.410> called<00:02:30.410> angel<00:02:30.680> wings<00:02:31.130> it

your legs okay now this is actually my
preferred<00:04:18.960> method<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:20.060> by<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.470> Rope<00:04:22.470> passing

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
preferred method and by the Rope passing

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.230 
preferred method and by the Rope passing
across<00:04:23.160> your<00:04:23.340> body<00:04:23.460> or<00:04:23.670> putting<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.970> lot<00:04:24.120> of

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
across your body or putting a lot of

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.090 
across your body or putting a lot of
friction<00:04:24.450> in<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.780> system<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.710> it's<00:04:25.860> going<00:04:26.010> to

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
friction in the system so it's going to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.080 
friction in the system so it's going to
slow<00:04:26.340> your<00:04:26.520> descent

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
slow your descent

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.610 
slow your descent
