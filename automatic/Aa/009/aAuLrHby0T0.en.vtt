00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.309 
finished product before sanding just
making<00:02:26.730> sure<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.060> everything<00:02:27.480> fits<00:02:27.510> well<00:02:28.080> I

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
making sure that everything fits well I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.350 
making sure that everything fits well I
think<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> hardest<00:02:29.310> part<00:02:29.580> was<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.819> actually

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
think the hardest part was to actually

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.390 
think the hardest part was to actually
fit<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.380> new<00:02:31.650> cap<00:02:32.549> screws<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.480> nuts<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
originals were actually a little bit too

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.990
