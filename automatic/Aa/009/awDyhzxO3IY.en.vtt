the reason I have the camera it's sort
of<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.680> strange<00:00:07.740> angle<00:00:08.220> here<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.330> fact<00:00:09.510> that

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
of a strange angle here is the fact that

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.490 
of a strange angle here is the fact that
it<00:00:09.929> has<00:00:10.139> such<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> really<00:00:11.309> really<00:00:11.940> odd<00:00:12.259> way<00:00:13.259> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
it has such a really really odd way of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.620 
it has such a really really odd way of
working<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:14.040> now<00:00:14.700> along<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> back<00:00:15.389> you'll

see<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:16.080> unique<00:00:16.650> little<00:00:17.220> bit<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:18.420> is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
see this unique little bit this is

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.880 
see this unique little bit this is
here's<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.740> allow<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:21.210> like<00:00:21.480> so

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
here's to allow it you to go up like so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.620 
here's to allow it you to go up like so
like<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> normal<00:00:23.279> notebook<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.240> go<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.480> like

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
like a normal notebook and go up like

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240 
like a normal notebook and go up like
this<00:00:24.810> kind<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.650> makes<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.920> look<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this kind of makes it look like the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
this kind of makes it look like the
enterprise<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:26.820> Star<00:00:27.150> Trek<00:00:27.359> which<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.930> was

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
enterprise from Star Trek which it was

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.070 
enterprise from Star Trek which it was
crossed<00:00:28.349> promoted<00:00:28.800> with<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> way<00:00:29.929> you<00:00:30.929> can

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
crossed promoted with by the way you can

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440 
crossed promoted with by the way you can
go<00:00:31.170> back<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:32.189> way<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.030> sort<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.239> set

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
go back this way so you can sort of set

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.620 
go back this way so you can sort of set
it<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.780> display<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.640> or<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.000> make

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it up like a display so or you can make

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.119 
it up like a display so or you can make
it<00:00:36.660> flat<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> tablet

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it flat so it's kind of like a tablet

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.830 
it flat so it's kind of like a tablet
not<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.670> since<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.750> bit

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
not really since it's a little bit

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.639 
not really since it's a little bit
thicker<00:00:40.050> than<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.260> tablet<00:00:40.820> but<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.719> multi

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
thicker than a tablet but it is multi

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369 
thicker than a tablet but it is multi
mode<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.100> sure<00:00:44.600> now<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> shut<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.020> while<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
mode for sure now it shut off while I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
mode for sure now it shut off while I
was<00:00:46.530> moving<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.860> around<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.370> let<00:00:47.940> me<00:00:48.000> just

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
was moving it around but let me just

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.400 
was moving it around but let me just
show<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.510> more<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.110> turn<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
show you one more time here if I turn it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
show you one more time here if I turn it
back<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.739> turn<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> display<00:00:51.000> wake<00:00:51.449> the

back on turn the display wake the
display<00:00:51.989> back<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:52.969> like<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.140> pop<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
display back up then like so if I pop it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
display back up then like so if I pop it
up<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:57.510> will<00:00:57.690> flip<00:00:58.219> go<00:00:59.219> back<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.760> flip

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
up like this it will flip go back a flip

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.830 
up like this it will flip go back a flip
again<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.260> does<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.649> rather<00:01:02.399> quickly<00:01:02.840> now

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
again and it does so rather quickly now

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.730 
again and it does so rather quickly now
if<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.019> flip<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:06.049> there's<00:01:07.049> also<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
if I flip it like this there's also the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
if I flip it like this there's also the
ability<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.330> sideways<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
ability to go sideways like that so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.240 
ability to go sideways like that so
that's<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.500> cool<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.450> device<00:01:13.250> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that's pretty cool now this device is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.800 
that's pretty cool now this device is
able<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> work<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.790> touch<00:01:15.000> obviously<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.689> has

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
going to learn like that will flip back

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.819 
going to learn like that will flip back
out<00:01:26.659> as<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.930> home<00:01:28.110> button<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.650> has
