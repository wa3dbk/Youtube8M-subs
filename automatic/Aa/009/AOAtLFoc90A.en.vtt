the<00:00:08.130> barrels<00:00:08.700> mod<00:00:09.030> alright<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the barrels mod alright so here is the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.669 
the barrels mod alright so here is the
first<00:00:11.130> barrel<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.820> holds<00:00:12.059> 64<00:00:12.839> stacks<00:00:13.169> of<00:00:13.440> any

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
first barrel it holds 64 stacks of any

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.060 
first barrel it holds 64 stacks of any
item<00:00:13.860> which<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.309> quite<00:00:14.669> a<00:00:14.730> lot<00:00:15.150> actually<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
item which is quite a lot actually and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.740 
item which is quite a lot actually and
it<00:00:17.070> looks<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:17.910> there's<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:18.360> too<00:00:18.570> too

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it looks like this there's not too too

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.480 
it looks like this there's not too too
much<00:00:18.780> modeling<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.679> when<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.250> right

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
much modeling but you when you right

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.339 
much modeling but you when you right
click<00:00:20.519> with<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.269> block<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.779> your<00:00:21.900> hand<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.289> will

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
click with a block in your hand it will

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.830 
click with a block in your hand it will
go<00:00:22.710> into<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.179> put<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
go into that and you can put that in

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.579 
go into that and you can put that in
sixty<00:00:25.529> four<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:26.310> times<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.170> so

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
sixty four more times so that's so so

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.710 
sixty four more times so that's so so
much<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.910> don't<00:00:30.089> think<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.330> could<00:00:30.509> ever

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
much and I don't think you could ever

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.410 
much and I don't think you could ever
really<00:00:31.169> fill<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.769> unless<00:00:32.220> you<00:00:32.460> your<00:00:32.910> job<00:00:33.210> was

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
really fill that unless you your job was

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.229 
really fill that unless you your job was
a<00:00:33.480> lumberjack<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.620> something<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:36.030> really

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a lumberjack or something I don't really

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.080 
a lumberjack or something I don't really
know<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.710> these<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.789> you<00:00:38.940> need

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
know but to get these out all you need

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.910 
know but to get these out all you need
to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.719> need<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> left-click<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.620> get

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to do is you need to left-click to get

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.880 
to do is you need to left-click to get
the<00:00:41.039> full<00:00:41.579> stack<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.530> need<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the full stack and then you need to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.880 
the full stack and then you need to
shift<00:00:44.250> left<00:00:44.940> click<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.649> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
shift left click just to get one out of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.299 
shift left click just to get one out of
there<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.969> let's<00:00:48.120> take<00:00:48.539> all<00:00:48.750> these<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
there so let's take all these out and

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.939 
there so let's take all these out and
next<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.699> end<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.449> barrel<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
next we have the end or barrel so this

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.450 
next we have the end or barrel so this
end<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.280> arrow<00:00:53.460> holds<00:00:55.640> 1024<00:00:56.640> stacks<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.390> that's

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
end up arrow holds 1024 stacks so that's

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.799 
end up arrow holds 1024 stacks so that's
ridiculous<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.699> could<00:00:59.850> probably<00:01:00.149> never<00:01:00.510> feel

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
ridiculous you could probably never feel

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
ridiculous you could probably never feel
that<00:01:01.019> I<00:01:01.260> don't<00:01:01.769> really<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.010> anyone<00:01:02.370> doing

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that I don't really see anyone doing

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.740 
that I don't really see anyone doing
that<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.629> anyways<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.440> same<00:01:04.650> thing<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
that but anyways it's the same thing I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
that but anyways it's the same thing I
right<00:01:06.750> click<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.050> put<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.500> left<00:01:08.009> click<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> take

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
right click to put in left click to take

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.030 
right click to put in left click to take
out<00:01:08.790> shift<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.390> shift<00:01:11.750> left<00:01:12.750> click<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.259> take<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
out shift a shift left click to take it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.370 
out shift a shift left click to take it
out<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:15.500> last<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> quantum<00:01:17.880> barrel

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
out and last we have the quantum barrel

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
out and last we have the quantum barrel
so<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.590> holds<00:01:20.420> 4092<00:01:21.420> stacks<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.579> any<00:01:23.579> item

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so this holds 4092 stacks of any item

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670 
so this holds 4092 stacks of any item
you<00:01:24.329> could<00:01:24.450> ever<00:01:24.630> imagine<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.560> go

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you could ever imagine so you can go

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
you could ever imagine so you can go
ahead<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.189> fill<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.150> with

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
ahead and you can fill this with

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
ahead and you can fill this with
whatever<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.310> holds<00:01:29.850> well

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
whatever you want and that holds well

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.760 
whatever you want and that holds well
right<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.810> only<00:01:30.960> six<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.650> can

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
right now that's only six but it can

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.200 
right now that's only six but it can
hold<00:01:32.990> 4096<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.619> i<00:01:34.649> only<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.009> 4090<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.090> go

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
hold 4096 so i only have 4090 to go

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.050 
hold 4096 so i only have 4090 to go
until<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.990> filled<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.430> craft

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
until this is filled up so to craft

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
until this is filled up so to craft
these<00:01:39.299> wonderful<00:01:39.840> barrels<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> need<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
these wonderful barrels all you need to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.929 
these wonderful barrels all you need to
do<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> first<00:01:43.590> barrel<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.460> use

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
do is a you for the first barrel you use

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.980 
do is a you for the first barrel you use
six<00:01:45.570> oak<00:01:45.780> wood<00:01:46.170> plank<00:01:46.619> oak<00:01:47.460> wood<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.000> two<00:01:48.719> iron

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
six oak wood plank oak wood and two iron

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.810 
six oak wood plank oak wood and two iron
ingots<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.469> that<00:01:49.710> will<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.369> barrel

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
ingots and that will get you the barrel

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.569 
ingots and that will get you the barrel
and<00:01:50.969> then<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> Ender<00:01:52.380> barrel<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.340> need

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and then for the Ender barrel you need

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.209 
and then for the Ender barrel you need
to<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.969> a<00:01:54.000> barrel<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.020> obsidian<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.979> blaze

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
to have a barrel to obsidian for blaze

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.700 
to have a barrel to obsidian for blaze
rods<00:01:56.549> into<00:01:56.759> ender<00:01:57.240> pearls<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.320> will<00:01:58.530> get

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
rods into ender pearls and that will get

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.789 
rods into ender pearls and that will get
you<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.100> ender<00:01:59.549> barrel<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.289> then<00:02:01.289> finally

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you the ender barrel and then finally

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.010 
you the ender barrel and then finally
for<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> quantum<00:02:02.939> barrel<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.479> need<00:02:03.689> for

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
for the quantum barrel you need for

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.649 
for the quantum barrel you need for
obsidian<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.829> blaze<00:02:05.070> rods<00:02:05.399> into<00:02:05.610> diamonds<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
obsidian to blaze rods into diamonds and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.469 
obsidian to blaze rods into diamonds and
also<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> enter<00:02:08.039> barrel<00:02:08.430> and<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:09.240> get

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
also a enter barrel and that will get

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.830 
also a enter barrel and that will get
you<00:02:09.690> your<00:02:09.720> quantum<00:02:10.649> barrel<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:12.060> these<00:02:12.270> recipes

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
you your quantum barrel so these recipes

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.810 
you your quantum barrel so these recipes
if<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.620> were<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.100> fill<00:02:14.400> these<00:02:14.520> all<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
if you were going to fill these all the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.250 
if you were going to fill these all the
way<00:02:14.940> up<00:02:15.060> I'm<00:02:15.240> pretty<00:02:15.570> sure<00:02:15.780> they<00:02:15.960> would<00:02:16.140> be

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
way up I'm pretty sure they would be

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.530 
way up I'm pretty sure they would be
worth

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
worth

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.630 
worth
it<00:02:16.719> because<00:02:17.049> that's<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.680> huge<00:02:18.099> amount<00:02:18.489> of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
it because that's just a huge amount of

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.539 
it because that's just a huge amount of
items<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.030> they<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.480> store<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.219> last

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
items that they can store so the last

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.610 
items that they can store so the last
thing<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.879> want<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.120> show<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.359> is<00:02:22.480> just<00:02:23.349> they

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
thing I want to show you is just they

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.069 
thing I want to show you is just they
work<00:02:23.950> with<00:02:24.329> redstone<00:02:25.329> and<00:02:25.480> all<00:02:25.719> that<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.049> I

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
work with redstone and all that so I

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.839 
work with redstone and all that so I
think<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.500> actually<00:02:26.829> a<00:02:26.890> quite<00:02:27.250> cool<00:02:27.609> thing

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
think it's actually a quite cool thing

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.660 
think it's actually a quite cool thing
so<00:02:28.450> up<00:02:28.569> here<00:02:28.599> we<00:02:28.780> can<00:02:29.049> go<00:02:29.079> and<00:02:29.469> we<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.189> throw<00:02:30.519> in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
so up here we can go and we can throw in

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.690 
so up here we can go and we can throw in
some<00:02:30.939> blocks<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:32.500> Harbor<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.430> they<00:02:33.549> will

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
some blocks in this Harbor and they will

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.800 
some blocks in this Harbor and they will
go<00:02:33.879> straight<00:02:34.239> into<00:02:34.629> that<00:02:35.939> thing<00:02:36.939> straight

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
go straight into that thing straight

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.679 
go straight into that thing straight
into<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.200> barrel<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.819> then<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.209> also<00:02:40.390> works

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
into the barrel and then it also works

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.509 
into the barrel and then it also works
for<00:02:40.840> taking<00:02:41.319> out<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.709> barrels<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.129> we<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.400> go

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
for taking out of barrels so we can go

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.640 
for taking out of barrels so we can go
ahead<00:02:42.639> and<00:02:42.790> put<00:02:43.269> these<00:02:43.389> in<00:02:43.599> here<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.620> will

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
ahead and put these in here and it will

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.619 
ahead and put these in here and it will
slowly<00:02:45.129> drain<00:02:45.549> them<00:02:45.700> out<00:02:45.790> into<00:02:45.909> the<00:02:46.090> hopper<00:02:46.269> so

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
slowly drain them out into the hopper so

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.539 
slowly drain them out into the hopper so
you<00:02:46.719> can<00:02:46.870> have<00:02:47.049> very<00:02:47.349> cool<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:47.769> advanced

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
you can have very cool and advanced

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.059 
you can have very cool and advanced
redstone<00:02:48.970> systems<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.409> move<00:02:50.620> around<00:02:50.769> your

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
redstone systems to move around your

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.129 
redstone systems to move around your
items<00:02:51.250> while<00:02:51.700> using<00:02:51.970> these<00:02:52.180> barrels<00:02:52.629> and<00:02:52.840> you

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
items while using these barrels and you

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.649 
items while using these barrels and you
don't<00:02:53.349> really<00:02:53.530> need<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.920> wait<00:02:54.129> for<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.909> hopper

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
don't really need to wait for the hopper

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.360 
don't really need to wait for the hopper
to<00:02:55.780> fill<00:02:55.989> up<00:02:56.139> and<00:02:56.319> stuff<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.769> could<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:57.159> have

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
to fill up and stuff you could just have

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.039 
to fill up and stuff you could just have
it<00:02:57.519> all<00:02:57.700> going<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.510> could<00:02:58.659> have<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:58.959> all

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
it all going and you could have it all

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.500 
it all going and you could have it all
store<00:02:59.349> in<00:02:59.439> these<00:02:59.590> barrels<00:03:00.239> alright<00:03:01.239> so<00:03:01.480> that

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
store in these barrels alright so that

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.420 
store in these barrels alright so that
is<00:03:01.930> really<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.349> for<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.650> mod<00:03:02.889> I<00:03:02.919> hope<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.340> all
