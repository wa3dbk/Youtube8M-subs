00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.310
 then manaudou laure other stars of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.649
 swimming gives and evans ian thorpe 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.469
 have resumed their careers after being 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.099
 you hope will resume the find them 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.799
 what level 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.900
 to be competitive what does it mean to you 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.490
 show face we will tell the best 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.439
 global to traitor at which level 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 finally for now I do not want 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.619
 to put too much pressure on me and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.300
 to say that I will be champion 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.189
 Olympic at the same time as the petition 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.869
 I understand that I'm training 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.490
 for the competition but it's true that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.349
 there is still a long way to go 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.520
 and I do not want to put myself too much 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.040
 big goals like I could do it 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.540
 when I was younger and but 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.129
 I hope to be competitors for a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.969
 point next year that means on 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.440
 100 meters on 200 m on 400 m of the back 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 normally without 200 backs and centers of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.430
 100 crawl the opportunity is over even if 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.270
 it still keeps me cary fokam swims 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.719
 a lot and I have already swum too much 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.760
 unexpected 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.620
 I imagine that your coach he had 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 a little stopwatch that right now they 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.969
 watch you swim and stopwatch 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.950
 he's how right now he's very 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.140
 far not so far away that it is 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.850
 it is normal it is not super good but 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.130
 it's not it's not mediocre and no 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.630
 more so it can improve then the 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.550
 angry question is there is always 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.290
 one or know you know that what we're going 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.890
 to say manaudou laura comes back to them because 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.490
 that it's a pleasure for sponsors 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.400
 what do you think people who say 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.190
 that already that it does not shock me because 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.950
 that they can judge or say what they 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.130
 want but if if I ever were in 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.359
 lack of money 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.429
 I know that's going to mean I would not have 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.659
 never stopped actually because the 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.179
 contract with mister pinault that 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.890
 I had I had it until 2012 and 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.719
 I could have gone swimming 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.549
 until next year and is 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.399
 always in depression is unpleasant 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.319
 to be someone that I that I 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.909
 do not want to be listened to anyway you 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.619
 do not be unpleasant it is laure 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.610
 manaudou it's still possible that we go 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.439
 listen to just this hymn the Marseillaise 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.319
 these kind of moments there is what we can 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.319
 hope to revive them with you 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.069
 go in a little over a year it'll be at 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.349
 London 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.289
 it would be a beautiful story I would love 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.049
 Well, I'd like that 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.120

 reader and that's hot it's 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.620
 the goal but but there are a lot of 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.159
 things before again and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.360

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.310

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.340

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.810
