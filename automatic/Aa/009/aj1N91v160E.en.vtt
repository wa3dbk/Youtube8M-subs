feeder this feeder fixes that though

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.050 
feeder this feeder fixes that though
being<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.780> long<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.500> they<00:01:58.619> can't<00:01:58.920> reach

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
being so long that they can't reach

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.990 
being so long that they can't reach
the<00:02:01.810> one<00:02:01.960> con<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.350> saw<00:02:02.710> for<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.040> feeder<00:02:03.310> was

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
the one con I saw for this feeder was

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.600 
the one con I saw for this feeder was
that<00:02:04.330> if<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.780> knocked<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.110> around<00:02:05.470> seeds<00:02:06.310> did

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
that if you knocked it around seeds did

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.760 
that if you knocked it around seeds did
fall<00:02:06.850> out<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.330> if<00:02:07.780> smart<00:02:08.050> squirrels<00:02:08.380> would<00:02:08.590> use

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
fall out so if smart squirrels would use

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.350 
fall out so if smart squirrels would use
that<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.160> their<00:02:09.280> advantage<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:10.030> they<00:02:10.090> just

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
that to their advantage and they just

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.990 
that to their advantage and they just
eat<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.660> seeds<00:02:10.869> off<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.230> ground<00:02:12.000> otherwise

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
eat the seeds off the ground otherwise

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.610
