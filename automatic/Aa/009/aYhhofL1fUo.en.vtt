this<00:00:35.399> hand<00:00:35.670> signals<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.809> me<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.140> he<00:00:37.320> thinks

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
this hand signals to me that he thinks

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.090 
this hand signals to me that he thinks
he<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.550> hate<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.379> matchup<00:00:40.920> that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
he has hate for the matchup that

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.160 
he has hate for the matchup that
warrants<00:00:41.610> keeping<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> hand<00:00:42.149> without<00:00:42.300> vile<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
without Lackey which seems to me to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.139 
without Lackey which seems to me to
indicate<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:46.079> he<00:00:46.320> has<00:00:46.530> either<00:00:47.520> multiple

cast the Warchief here which is an
important<00:01:21.119> part<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.540> him<00:01:21.780> being<00:01:21.990> able<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.200> stop

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
important part of him being able to stop

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.999 
important part of him being able to stop
the<00:01:22.770> combo<00:01:23.210> because<00:01:24.210> he<00:01:24.450> does<00:01:24.720> indeed<00:01:25.080> need<00:01:25.770> to
