00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.700
 I did the experiment I liked it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.400
 I loved the color when the lake is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.869
 okay so come for you to do it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.960

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 I love your pigment that gives color that you 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.060
 choose is what you want to use as 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.270
 button it's all a duckling for you 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.930
 put to make the cotton blend a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 object for you to clean it because it is 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.220
 It's good that you get infected before you're one. 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.880
 brush for the lips that I go 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.479
 to use is the sigma that the army is 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.570
 with me today 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.829
 and how am I going to do with cotton 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.560
 gel cop 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.990
 I'm going to drip here a little bit that is 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.909
 important you always clean 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.990
 be clean, it 's good to pass alcohol guy 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.829
 right gel 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.829
 and I step outta here say made 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.670
 Clean now we'll do the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.900
 next I will first apply the olive grove 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.450
 my lips 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.970
 now I'll get my spatula and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.269
 I'll take a little 10 of the lip balm is 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.099
 that I'll put here 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.860
 There you will see the amount that you 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.440
 They will want to put love to get the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.170
 pigment and I'll play a little here 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.620
 these pigments are dailus they are well 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:49.319
 extensive know they are not loose powder so 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:53.190
 a kiss from a bacterium looks maternal 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:03:00.330
 now I take my brush of the lips and 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:02.660
 Grandma kneading joining all that 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.170
 you did 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.720
 finally I mixed it up that my debut 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.840
 and now what you're going to do is apply 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:24.420
 on your lips then enjoy what is 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:29.010
 brush and let's go, then 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.260
 so I pick up a piece of paper is genius 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.769
 You can get up there and I can only 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.739
 I give a little kiss like this to take the 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.829
 and it became a beautiful color then 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.359
 so if you get quite moisturizing 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.020
 he will stay the June woman 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.380
 but you spend less 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.630
 the segment it will stay dry and will 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.940
 look good but rather sparkling 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.310
 very beautiful but I liked that courage 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.070
 beautiful or so is this I hope you 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.380
 Have you liked this tip? 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.050
 which is very simple uses little that 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.200
 you all have these products at home and 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:09.070
 If you do not have it, it's very cheap. 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.960
 buy and the color is still beautiful 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.270
 I would like the color you want if you 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.820
 want to blue also buying south and 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.739
 I pass the blue but in several phases well 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.350
 so cool for you to do as a button 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.720
 so there's a tip I do not know that 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.420
 works for other beautiful pigments 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.610
 these things because I have not tried more 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.310
 I know dae gave us right through 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.100
 he is more consistent and there is 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.410
 next time I'll do a tutorial with just 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.300
 using pigments that legal also 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.010
 first acts as a button is that the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.650
 Duration is like a lipstick. 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.680
 so I liked very much okay 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.960
 and if you want to apply a primer first 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.700
 of all this can be comfortable or 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.190
 Concealer to last longer 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.290
 but I guarantee it lasts a long time for 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.600
 least my lips enough to he 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.920
