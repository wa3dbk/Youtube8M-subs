00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.300
 ah 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.670
 cats are very territorial animals 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.160
 that is, they have a very strong link 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.290
 with the space in which the many 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.420
 of their signals are precisely for 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.640
 defend this territory for them is 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 your most precious treasure is they will defend it 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.220
 every time it is invaded 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.000
 just to avoid getting to the extreme 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.550
 of a fight 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.649
 cats use a series of signals 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.930
 to warn strangers that that 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.460
 territory is already inhabited cats 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.020
 they can mark their territory with a 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.540
 series of signals that can be grouped 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.660
 in two groups visual cues or signals 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.660
 olfactory 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.519
 the visual cues are often scratches 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.140
 on vertical surfaces then it 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.850
 indicates in a rest area for the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.410
 animal that's why it's very common that 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.570
 do on sofas where many sleep 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.539
 hours do not do it on the side or behind 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.579
 but just in front because that's what 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.940
 they see the other animals and they fulfill their 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.940
 task 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.710
 the olfactory signals are what 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.870
 they make pheromones through their urine 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.640
 or scratching the pheromones are 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.250
 substances that humans can not 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.620
 detect but that cats perceive them 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 perfectly urine marks are usually 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.340
 be left in areas of passage zones of 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.020
 border between territories its frequency 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.510
 increases especially in times of heat 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 because there are many more cats and also 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.560
 about being left in vertical areas and the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.210
 urine is deposited in small 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.820
 amounts the marks by rubbing 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.070
 the cat uses them to mark objects 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.290
 people or other animals that you consider 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.970
 your family environment then you're 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.950
 pheromones what they give off is 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 tranquility this marking goes 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.150
 renewing periodically and then what 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.740
 rubbing the chin on the face or the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.070
 cost on the object you want 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.070
 mark 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.350
 there is another group of brands that are less 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.420
 frequent that are the alarm signals 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.950
 Well the cat when he perceives a 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.870
 violent stress situation segregates 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.980
 a substance that is to remind you 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.980
 where is that danger 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.810
 in times of heat, cats also 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.210
 Males use markings components 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.860
 sexual then when we castrate a cat 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.620
 what we do is eliminate this kind of 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.660
 mark your smell to be urinated by sites 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.280
 where we do not feel like it but all the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.770
 other signals are not influenced by 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.600
 the sex hormones of the cat so 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.850
 the visual and olfactory cues of 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.800
 cat are inherent to him to us we 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.200
 they can be annoying but they go with it 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.660
 we must have the patience of 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.240
 all the more stable the way 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.750
 where you live less need will have 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.750
 to mark 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.250
 in situations of changes like a 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.170
 moving a change of furniture 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.690
 reforms that a new member comes to the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.250
 family, this is a stress and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.390
 may increase the frequency of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.390
 marking of the territory 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.930
 and a lot
