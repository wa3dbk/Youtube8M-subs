00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.050
 this is the way at the same time experiencing 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.910
 primus still means it was worth the canned food 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.800

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.670
 our 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.670
 Here is such a thing 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.330

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.750

 red-hot we try by the way I want to give 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.310
 One piece of advice is that there were no mice in the garage and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.310
 rats do not leave any food in the garage 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.120
