00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and if you look at them they could make

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.790 
and if you look at them they could make
a<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:49.110> interesting<00:00:49.940> tree<00:00:50.940> armature<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
a really interesting tree armature that

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.930 
a really interesting tree armature that
looks<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> small<00:00:53.309> tree<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.910> just

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
looks like a small tree that just

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.729 
looks like a small tree that just
doesn't<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.539> any<00:00:54.600> leaves<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.500> now

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
doesn't have any leaves on it right now

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.529 
doesn't have any leaves on it right now
so<00:00:56.370> I'll<00:00:56.489> show<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.730> how<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> make<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> leaf

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
so I'll show you how to make the leaf

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.750 
so I'll show you how to make the leaf
portions<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:58.920> we'll<00:00:59.039> attach<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
portions and then we'll attach to the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.630 
portions and then we'll attach to the
tree<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:01.140> we'll<00:01:01.340> eventually<00:01:02.340> put<00:01:02.550> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
tree and then we'll eventually put it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030 
tree and then we'll eventually put it
into<00:01:02.940> our<00:01:02.969> diorama<00:01:03.559> let's<00:01:04.559> take<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> poly

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
into our diorama let's take the poly

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
into our diorama let's take the poly
fiber<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> we'll<00:01:07.680> make<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:08.280> thin<00:01:08.900> notice

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
fiber and we'll make it very thin notice

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.649 
fiber and we'll make it very thin notice
that<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> wants<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> break<00:01:10.680> off<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.130> sheets<00:01:11.659> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that it wants to break off in sheets so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.480 
that it wants to break off in sheets so
we'll<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.960> tear<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.470> these<00:01:13.560> sheets<00:01:13.920> off

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.580 

after<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.850> thin<00:01:18.180> sheet<00:01:18.509> apart<00:01:18.900> just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
after you get that thin sheet apart just

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.249 
after you get that thin sheet apart just
take<00:01:19.860> an<00:01:19.979> elongated<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.790> little<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.210> work<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
take an elongated a little bit work it

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.070 
take an elongated a little bit work it
out<00:01:23.420> we're<00:01:24.420> gonna<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.049> little

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
out we're gonna make kind of a little

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.170 
out we're gonna make kind of a little
grass<00:01:25.530> mat<00:01:25.950> we'll<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:26.759> two<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.030> them

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.539 

and<00:01:33.180> we'll<00:01:33.539> take<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> chunk<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:35.340> pull

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
and we'll take a chunk of it just pull

and we'll take a chunk of it just pull
off<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> chunk<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:38.189> kind<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.549> wide<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.450> into<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
off a chunk and kind of wide it into a

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.850 
off a chunk and kind of wide it into a
ball<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.219> your<00:01:41.340> bush<00:01:42.469> or<00:01:43.469> one<00:01:43.740> of

being a three to one mixture that I
already<00:01:58.289> have<00:01:58.590> mixed<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.219> you'll<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.789> a

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
already have mixed up here you'll have a

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.350 
already have mixed up here you'll have a
spray<00:02:00.210> ready<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.630> go<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.789> foliage

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
spray ready to go to use on the foliage

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.160 
spray ready to go to use on the foliage
here<00:02:03.780> let's<00:02:04.709> take<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.979> poly<00:02:05.189> fiber<00:02:06.049> spray<00:02:07.049> it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
here let's take the poly fiber spray it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.850 
here let's take the poly fiber spray it
down<00:02:07.319> so<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.740> damp<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:10.440> take<00:02:10.679> your

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
down so it's damp and then take your

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.860 
down so it's damp and then take your
green<00:02:11.160> shaker<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.000> shake<00:02:12.799> it<00:02:13.799> all<00:02:14.040> over<00:02:14.370> it

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
there are different things here that we

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.120 
there are different things here that we
had<00:03:13.380> picked<00:03:13.620> out<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.130> garden<00:03:16.130> there's

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
had picked out in the garden there's

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.190 
had picked out in the garden there's
different<00:03:17.550> stuff<00:03:17.760> like<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.210> piece<00:03:18.990> of

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
different stuff like this piece of

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.300 
different stuff like this piece of
evergreen<00:03:20.240> just<00:03:21.240> think<00:03:21.420> all<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.750> would<00:03:21.930> look

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
evergreen just think all that would look

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.500 
evergreen just think all that would look
if<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.520> made<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.000> into<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> bush<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.530> some<00:03:25.920> sort

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
if we made that into a bush of some sort

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.660 
if we made that into a bush of some sort
so<00:03:27.510> let's<00:03:27.720> take<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.140> one<00:03:28.250> we'll<00:03:29.250> spray<00:03:29.550> it

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670

down with some green ware or with the
cement<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.790> we<00:03:32.910> made<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:35.180> shake<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.210> little

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
cement that we made and shake a little

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.050 
cement that we made and shake a little
bit<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.750> green<00:03:36.960> into<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.410> one

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
see the nice thing about the cement is

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.030 
see the nice thing about the cement is
not<00:03:47.160> only<00:03:47.340> does<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.640> give<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:49.380> holds<00:03:49.709> on<00:03:49.830> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
not only does it give it it holds on the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.570 
not only does it give it it holds on the
coating<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.150> grass<00:03:51.360> here<00:03:52.340> giving<00:03:53.340> us<00:03:53.490> a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
coating of the grass here giving us a

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.699 
coating of the grass here giving us a
nice<00:03:53.790> bulk<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:57.480> we'll<00:03:57.600> give<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:58.410> hint

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709
