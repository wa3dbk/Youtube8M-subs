this<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:47.100> Pikmin<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> launch<00:00:47.820> title<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.270> the

this was Pikmin the launch title for the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.590 
this was Pikmin the launch title for the
Gamecube<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.700> it<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.910> beautiful

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
Gamecube and it was beautiful

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.410 
Gamecube and it was beautiful
I<00:00:51.629> think<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.350> its<00:00:52.469> time<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.070> game<00:00:53.309> was

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
I think for its time this game was

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.330 
I think for its time this game was
extremely<00:00:54.420> good<00:00:54.620> extremely<00:00:55.620> expansive<00:00:56.219> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
extremely good extremely expansive it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.610 
extremely good extremely expansive it
had<00:00:56.489> quite<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> few<00:00:57.300> different<00:00:57.570> areas<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:58.050> four

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
had quite a few different areas at four

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
had quite a few different areas at four
or<00:00:58.739> five<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> first<00:01:00.329> picking

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
or five and this was the first picking

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420 
or five and this was the first picking
game<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.020> played<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.920> by<00:01:02.070> far<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
game I played and it is by far the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
game I played and it is by far the
simplest<00:01:02.789> I'll<00:01:03.149> give<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.960> its<00:01:04.739> charm

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
simplest I'll give it that and its charm

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
simplest I'll give it that and its charm
is<00:01:05.489> incredible<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.810> definitely<00:01:07.740> believe<00:01:07.920> if

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
is incredible I definitely believe if

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.770 
is incredible I definitely believe if
you<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> fan<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.299> three<00:01:09.330> and

instead of paying quite a bit for the
GameCube<00:01:33.540> version<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.860> my<00:01:35.070> plug

really rank them it's so hard I'm so I'm

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.190 
really rank them it's so hard I'm so I'm
surprised<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.390> guys<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> because

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
surprised how you guys did it because

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.120 
surprised how you guys did it because
I've<00:01:43.290> played<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.649> all<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.890> they're<00:01:43.979> all

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
I've played them all and they're all

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160 
I've played them all and they're all
awesome<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.659> Pikmin<00:01:46.020> one

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
awesome but I really do like Pikmin one

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.080 
awesome but I really do like Pikmin one
I<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.530> kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.799> underrated<00:01:47.100> in

Pikmin 2 and I would actually agree with
those<00:02:43.530> people<00:02:43.740> um<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.580> think<00:02:44.820> they<00:02:45.450> made<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
those people um I think they made the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.330 
those people um I think they made the
game<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.990> little<00:02:46.500> bit<00:02:46.620> easier<00:02:46.920> than<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.160> could

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
game a little bit easier than it could

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.750 
game a little bit easier than it could
be<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:48.180> 100%<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.260> game<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.770> no<00:02:50.190> pushover

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
be but 100% in that game is no pushover

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.630 
be but 100% in that game is no pushover
so<00:02:51.240> Pikmin<00:02:52.170> 2<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.320> have<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.800> represent<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.400> is

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
so Pikmin 2 I have on represent it is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.400 
so Pikmin 2 I have on represent it is
quite<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> game<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.540> really<00:02:55.050> think<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.380> is

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
quite a game I really think it is

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.320 
quite a game I really think it is
awesome<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.980> story<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.400> also<00:02:56.760> great<00:02:57.120> -

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
awesome and the story is also great -

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.260 
awesome and the story is also great -
definitely<00:02:57.810> better<00:02:57.930> than<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.170> first<00:02:58.410> Pikmin

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
definitely better than the first Pikmin

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.320 
definitely better than the first Pikmin
moving<00:03:00.270> on<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.480> Pikmin<00:03:00.840> 3<00:03:00.870> though<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.760> also

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
moving on to Pikmin 3 though it is also

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.570 
moving on to Pikmin 3 though it is also
an<00:03:03.930> upgrade<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.440> think<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.010> games<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.459> get

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
an upgrade I think the games just get

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.010 
an upgrade I think the games just get
better<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.030> better

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
better and better

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
others and I think that can be a bit of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.970 
others and I think that can be a bit of
a<00:04:09.060> downfall<00:04:09.299> at<00:04:09.900> times<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.470> was<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> little<00:04:10.860> bit

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
a downfall at times I was a little bit

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.860 
a downfall at times I was a little bit
overwhelmed<00:04:11.730> when<00:04:11.880> Pikmin<00:04:12.330> 3<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.570> know<00:04:12.660> there

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
overwhelmed when Pikmin 3 I know there

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.660 
overwhelmed when Pikmin 3 I know there
were<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> ton<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.350> fruit<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.799> get<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.250> there

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.340 
have to do that you could do and for
that<00:04:21.180> reason<00:04:21.539> my<00:04:21.660> first<00:04:21.900> playthrough<00:04:22.289> I

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
that reason my first playthrough I

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.200 
that reason my first playthrough I
didn't<00:04:22.650> do<00:04:22.740> those<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.160> still<00:04:23.490> haven't<00:04:23.700> 100

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
didn't do those I still haven't 100

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.840 
didn't do those I still haven't 100
sending<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.539> game<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.889> just<00:04:26.639> felt<00:04:26.789> a

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
sending the game and I just felt a

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.100 
sending the game and I just felt a
little<00:04:26.880> bit<00:04:27.120> overwhelmed<00:04:27.660> by<00:04:27.720> Pikmin<00:04:28.080> 3

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
little bit overwhelmed by Pikmin 3

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.719 
little bit overwhelmed by Pikmin 3
compared<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.800> first<00:04:28.979> one<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:29.490> that's<00:04:29.639> just

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
compared to the first one so that's just

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.330 
compared to the first one so that's just
my<00:04:29.910> personal<00:04:30.270> opinion<00:04:30.660> on<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:31.130> that's<00:04:32.130> pretty

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
my personal opinion on it that's pretty

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.409 
my personal opinion on it that's pretty
much<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:32.610> though<00:04:32.759> for<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.000> countdown<00:04:33.300> for

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
much it though for the countdown for

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.540 
much it though for the countdown for
Pikmin<00:04:33.810> kind<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.530> how<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.740> thought<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.370> was

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
Pikmin kind of how I thought it was

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.100 
Pikmin kind of how I thought it was
gonna<00:04:35.639> be<00:04:35.849> I<00:04:35.880> thought<00:04:36.030> Pikmin<00:04:36.569> 2<00:04:36.690> might<00:04:36.930> get

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
gonna be I thought Pikmin 2 might get

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.140 
gonna be I thought Pikmin 2 might get
first<00:04:37.349> there<00:04:37.530> was<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.680> chance<00:04:37.979> but<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.699> did<00:04:38.880> not

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
first there was a chance but it did not

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.089 
first there was a chance but it did not
and<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.139> think<00:04:40.319> it's<00:04:40.440> for<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> good<00:04:40.740> reason<00:04:40.800> I

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
and I think it's for a good reason I

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.350 
and I think it's for a good reason I
really<00:04:41.280> like<00:04:41.370> Pikmin<00:04:41.819> 3<00:04:41.849> and<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.150> think<00:04:42.300> it

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
really like Pikmin 3 and I think it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.570 
really like Pikmin 3 and I think it
deserves<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.870> number<00:04:43.110> 1<00:04:43.259> spot<00:04:43.560> now<00:04:44.340> let's<00:04:44.490> go
