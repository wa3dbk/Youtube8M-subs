00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
whatever the significance is I have a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.900 
whatever the significance is I have a
strange<00:00:16.410> feeling<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:17.010> may<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.340> something<00:00:17.699> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910

do with prison all things considered

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.910 
do with prison all things considered
because<00:00:20.130> now<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.640> had<00:00:20.880> two<00:00:21.660> songs<00:00:21.960> really

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920

come to our attention audio additions at

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.259 
come to our attention audio additions at
least<00:00:26.840> for<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.080> album<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.760> seems<00:00:30.150> that

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
least for this album and it seems that

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
least for this album and it seems that
both<00:00:30.539> certainly<00:00:30.929> share<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.529> theme<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219

both certainly share that theme and it
says<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> definitely<00:00:33.090> an<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.510> it's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600

aggression that has been very channeled

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.590 
aggression that has been very channeled
either<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.610> or<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.879> has<00:00:54.000> had<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> certain

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.569 
either that or it has had a certain
degree<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> unpredictability<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:56.340> its

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
degree of unpredictability to its

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.670 
degree of unpredictability to its
especially<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> earlier<00:00:57.899> years<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.530> their

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
especially in the earlier years of their

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.869 
especially in the earlier years of their
career<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.129> thinking<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.579> them

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
career I'm thinking about them

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.130 
career I'm thinking about them
specifically<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.960> new<00:01:01.530> American<00:01:02.010> gospel

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
specifically like a new American gospel

focused very very precise almost a hair
line<00:01:10.350> precision<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.970> tracks<00:01:12.420> very<00:01:13.049> very

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
line precision on these tracks very very

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
line precision on these tracks very very
much<00:01:13.860> knowing<00:01:14.310> exactly<00:01:14.760> where<00:01:15.450> they<00:01:15.600> want<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
about how that track really delivered

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
about how that track really delivered
the<00:01:46.500> atmosphere<00:01:47.130> prior<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.700> their<00:01:47.850> even<00:01:48.149> being

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the atmosphere prior to their even being

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480

any sort of vocalization or before we

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580 
any sort of vocalization or before we
even<00:01:50.670> hit<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> main<00:01:51.240> idea<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.290> something

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
even hit the main idea this is something

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.139 
even hit the main idea this is something
that's<00:01:52.649> built<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.130> very<00:01:53.340> nicely<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.759> five

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that's built in very nicely with five

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.690 
that's built in very nicely with five
one<00:01:54.540> two<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:55.079> well<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:55.950> establishes

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
one two as well that really establishes

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.840 
one two as well that really establishes
that<00:01:57.509> whole<00:01:57.750> core<00:01:58.020> idea<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.640> say

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that whole core idea and I have to say

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.940 
that whole core idea and I have to say
the<00:02:00.030> vocals<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.810> hear<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> Randy<00:02:01.799> on

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the vocals that you hear out of Randy on

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
the vocals that you hear out of Randy on
this<00:02:02.189> track<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:02.939> some<00:02:03.270> moments<00:02:03.509> where

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
this track there are some moments where

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.490 
this track there are some moments where
I<00:02:04.049> think<00:02:04.619> these<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.939> most<00:02:06.270> strained

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
I think these are the most strained

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.340 
I think these are the most strained
and<00:02:07.620> most<00:02:08.190> savage<00:02:08.910> vocals<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.600> Randy<00:02:10.200> has

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
and most savage vocals that Randy has

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.640 
and most savage vocals that Randy has
ever<00:02:10.619> attacked<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.520> microphone<00:02:12.210> with<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:13.350> some

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
ever attacked a microphone with in some

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.580 
ever attacked a microphone with in some
locations<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.550> are<00:02:14.730> some<00:02:15.120> noises<00:02:15.930> emitted

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
locations there are some noises emitted

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.580 
locations there are some noises emitted
from<00:02:16.740> his<00:02:16.980> body<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.880> can't<00:02:18.420> recall<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:19.260> any

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
from his body that I can't recall at any

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.130 
from his body that I can't recall at any
point<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.640> past<00:02:20.850> from<00:02:21.450> my<00:02:21.630> Lamb<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.870> God

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
point in the past from my Lamb of God

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.350 
point in the past from my Lamb of God
listening<00:02:22.650> ever<00:02:22.800> hearing<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.820> that's<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.180> good

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
listening ever hearing and that's a good

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.600 
listening ever hearing and that's a good
thing<00:02:24.600> because<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.170> shows<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.470> there<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.280> a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
thing because it shows that there is a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.380 
thing because it shows that there is a
real<00:02:27.480> element<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:29.010> truth<00:02:29.760> behind<00:02:30.000> this

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
real element of of truth behind this

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.570 
real element of of truth behind this
song<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.110> one<00:02:31.290> where<00:02:31.470> he<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.740> not<00:02:31.980> holding

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
song this is one where he is not holding

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.570 
song this is one where he is not holding
back<00:02:32.840> whatsoever<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.220> that's<00:02:35.220> where<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.520> think

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
back whatsoever and that's where I think

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.850 
back whatsoever and that's where I think
that<00:02:35.940> personal<00:02:36.540> idea<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.020> we<00:02:37.110> explored<00:02:37.590> in

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
that personal idea that we explored in

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.660 
that personal idea that we explored in
still<00:02:38.459> echoes<00:02:38.790> really<00:02:39.180> occurs<00:02:39.690> once<00:02:40.110> again

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
still echoes really occurs once again

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.820 
still echoes really occurs once again
with<00:02:41.670> 5:12<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> track<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.470> really

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
with 5:12 this is a track that really

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
with 5:12 this is a track that really
showcases<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.700> same<00:02:45.060> principle<00:02:45.600> which

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
showcases that same principle which

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320 
showcases that same principle which
leads<00:02:46.080> me<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> believe<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.400> not<00:02:48.090> only<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
leads me to believe as not only a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.280 
leads me to believe as not only a
reviewer<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.440> music<00:02:50.570> music<00:02:51.570> buff<00:02:51.840> music

not whatever you want to call it that

this<00:02:53.670> whole<00:02:53.850> entire<00:02:54.150> out<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.720> going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.989> be

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
this whole entire out is going to be

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.430 
this whole entire out is going to be
filled<00:02:55.470> with<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.670> same<00:02:57.030> element<00:02:57.780> that's<00:02:58.140> we

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
filled with this same element that's we

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.100 
filled with this same element that's we
hear<00:02:58.770> on<00:02:58.950> these<00:02:59.190> two<00:02:59.489> tracks<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.570> guitar<00:03:00.870> line

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
hear on these two tracks the guitar line

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.020 
hear on these two tracks the guitar line
on<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.590> certainly<00:03:02.040> one<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.459> helps<00:03:02.820> to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
on this is certainly one that helps to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.770 
on this is certainly one that helps to
boost<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.739> overall<00:03:05.390> darkness<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.570> guess

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
boost the the overall darkness I guess

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.320 
boost the the overall darkness I guess
that<00:03:07.020> is<00:03:07.140> cast<00:03:07.440> by<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.190> vocals<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.910> are<00:03:09.180> in

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
that is cast by the vocals that are in

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.970 
that is cast by the vocals that are in
front<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.260> one<00:03:10.530> where<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.830> two

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
front of it so it's one where the two

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.670 
front of it so it's one where the two
coupled<00:03:11.459> together<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.420> really<00:03:12.630> craft<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.350> very

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
coupled together to really craft a very

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.470 
coupled together to really craft a very
nice<00:03:13.920> scene<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.489> paints<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.970> picture<00:03:15.000> of

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
nice scene it paints a picture of

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.440 
nice scene it paints a picture of
desolation<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.290> paints<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.799> picture<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:18.239> is

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
desolation that paints a picture that is

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.130 
desolation that paints a picture that is
not<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> very<00:03:19.500> pretty<00:03:19.830> one<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.280> can<00:03:20.430> almost<00:03:21.140> see
