 Yes, certainly in Laufeld are driving 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.750
 and also the other cases are two 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.079
 horses in there but sometimes not 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:38.360
 new animals too so I 'm talking about 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:42.060

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.039
 lion and so on I mean that 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.809
 All in all, that's nine 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.420
 new animals should be 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.649

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.949
 I catch you well then today but 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.539
 First of all, and that needed 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.329
 but many things once a label 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.550
 premium extraction clients in addition to the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.050
 do not be surprised insurers and vereins 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.760
 the travel package that he also in others 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.350
 you get exactly what you want 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.090
 will again label the other now 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.370
 link appears as with it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 connected so we catch the best 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.869
 it opens at the same time 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.180
 package second and we just make the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.119
 Landes at the beginning against the credit 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.680
 suisse plus copy everything in here 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:34.909
 is in the fi connection surfer geno 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:39.090
 player motto file recovery colÃ³n enter 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.229
 press make safe write how to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.229
 for example, pure animals 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 powerless and we are too 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.340
 Already almost ready 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.670
 as well as you actually right 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.950
 then no data will be lost like that 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.850
 it was explained further need the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.590
 not too much 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.959
 we need to go in only the client 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.629
 and unstrut from fishing 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:12.519
 since it is in the pkv extraction apple 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.959
 and then pack the suit that works 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.140
 actually know by now 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.910
 not then it looks now again the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.590
 xxl then press the hook on start 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.120
 Do you come to a nice window that one 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.650
 I can just see where you are here 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.629
 must press you can that way 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.489
 even as a folder rear needs 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.769
 a second package pure is also about 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.519
 ruth and you have a pc is the go 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.780
 once inside and copy it with upper one 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.420
 part and there are still in the lower part 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.819
 that one is now the upper part that becomes 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.269
 believe everything also have one 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.329
 mp goal is of course synonymous with notepad 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.310
 and where you end the last with 0 so 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.959
 this master or whatever he does 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.220
 that calls the heart the way then it works 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.709
 continue right now and you have 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.250
 here you see here already 2 0 1 1 0 2 1 1 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.470
 1 1 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.569
 so good and so are yours 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.099
 cinema we delete them first because 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.630
 he is otherwise displayed something wrong 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.340
 delete the times out that bemba 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.319
 Rockland is which front if I then 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.590
 was looking for that should be already 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.849
 everything had been around females 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.669
 if you did that, you do not have to 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.669
 calculate it could be recommended 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:27.280
 but so far his job so then 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.609
 Let's go through these these points as 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.299
 never 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:35.130
 and they have such a file so 21 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.080
 bauer and so on we copy 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.720
 The goal is like when they report here 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.370
 stop making calls simply numbers 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.849
 he is also supposed to be like that 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.200
 appearance 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.810
 you can of course also at the bottom 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.800
 You can also attach sometimes 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:54.069
 you save it goes on cook 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.440
 double pack in the well in there is on the 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:03.670
 20 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.959
 so in Carinthia have to be so small then 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.660
 we are never second 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.200
 Elfer through that was a thing 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.980
 we would have been here a reindeer 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.419
 eccentric and we insert that 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.180
 copy once so took it only 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.489
 animals and write in the opening 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.320
 index with plus and write so behind 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.630
 this last place calls that in there 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.200
 Looks like he's gonna be back 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.240
 you look 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.960
 if the last patch is a water castle 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.960
 it does not really matter 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.500
 that's the way it should look like so here it is 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.620
 also again shown how time 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.539
 you should like to introduce 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.950
 go out 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.850
 then we are already finished the 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.539
 surfer should be the attribute 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.560
 We start in new as usual 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.240
 then we could already 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.560
 you have the correct very much wrong 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.090
 you can not actually see that already 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.190
 so do not care how can you 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.190
 still soft after start anyway 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.860
 and if we now connect to the server 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:12.169
 what you do not do right now 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.659
 after two weeks the yard and now 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.710
 know us log in and with certain 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:22.789
 We can order yellow now 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:24.440
 also implement as well as the 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.330
 dictate it reads another in the other 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.330
 in it 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.050
 he just underlines / mount 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.449
 test la paz 2010 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.069
 then you should sit on the cellar 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.780
 Congratulations you too 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:42.500
 do 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.770
 yes, of course that gives me more 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.210
 animals, for example, that here then goes 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.979
 it always just continues in the 1 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.610
 the whole wide coach of the still mountain 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:55.810
 how they should all work 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:58.039
 and that's actually it for me 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.300
 For me, now only the lion is somehow 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.069
 a little bit can do this black 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.270
 beer is standing in the ground in you 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.830
 of course the unpacked version 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.099
 So get what you bring with you 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.539
 packed it'll give yes yes it gets 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.750
 the version of it now 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:14.120
 Somehow with me and good as well 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:18.500
 said because I then the lion works and then 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.020
 if not years does not work okay 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.380
 Well 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.810
 of course, maybe I have now 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.490
 some are actually presented 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.840
 That's exactly what they manage with them 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.159
 tutorial how to do the quest with the 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.789
 How you like them 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:30.650
 fits in 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.710
 so that you can see these lovely animals per se 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:37.150
 can call yes that was already with this 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.150
 tutorial as I said first time can 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.009
 will probably be displayed now 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.800
 the whole video about the male 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.120
 absolutely not important 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.240
 and that 's it with this one again 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.620
 tutorial would be if you liked and 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.150
