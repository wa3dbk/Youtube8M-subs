can bomb the 8080 so that means when

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.980 
can bomb the 8080 so that means when

y-wings can actually bomb the 80 80 s

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.370 
y-wings can actually bomb the 80 80 s
and<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:41.040> course<00:01:41.070> damage<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:43.229> know

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and of course damage it and you know

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.630 
and of course damage it and you know
stop<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.979> from<00:01:44.070> getting<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> shield

stop it from getting to the shield

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.999 
stop it from getting to the shield
generator<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.229> another<00:01:46.229> objective<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
generator and another objective is to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.370 
generator and another objective is to
destroy<00:01:47.189> incoming<00:01:47.810> snowspeeders<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.049> defend

destroy incoming snowspeeders to defend
the<00:01:49.500> 8080<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> snowspeeders<00:01:51.600> do<00:01:51.840> have

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the 8080 so the snowspeeders do have

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
the 8080 so the snowspeeders do have
weapons<00:01:52.710> are<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.220> course<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> blasters<00:01:53.970> on

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
weapons are of course the blasters on

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.810 
weapons are of course the blasters on
the<00:01:54.149> front<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> also<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> tow<00:01:55.619> cables<00:01:56.130> of

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the front and also the tow cables of

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280 
the front and also the tow cables of
both<00:01:57.090> which<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.689> use<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.930> try<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
both which they can use to try and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.469 
both which they can use to try and
destroy<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> 8080<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.640> also<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.240> final

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
destroy the 8080 and also the final

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.719 
destroy the 8080 and also the final
objective<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.890> close<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.490> shield

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
objective is to get close to the shield

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.730 
objective is to get close to the shield
generator<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.960> street<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
generator and a street so that's the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.520 
generator and a street so that's the
overall<00:02:05.040> objective<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.719> objectives<00:02:07.320> for

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
overall objective and the objectives for

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.160 
overall objective and the objectives for
the<00:02:07.680> rebel<00:02:08.039> faction<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.360> activate<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the rebel faction is to activate the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.740 
the rebel faction is to activate the
uplinks<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.679> time<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.610> course<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.599> do

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
uplinks this time so of course if we do

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.910 
uplinks this time so of course if we do
watch<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.050> game<00:02:13.170> play<00:02:13.379> right<00:02:13.620> now

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
watch the game play right now

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.230 
watch the game play right now
on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.099> screen<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.550> see<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.849> doing<00:02:15.090> that

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
on the screen you can see the doing that

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.260 
on the screen you can see the doing that
and<00:02:15.480> then<00:02:16.080> defend<00:02:16.530> them<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:17.459> if<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> do<00:02:17.970> see

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
and then defend them so if you do see

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.080 
and then defend them so if you do see
the<00:02:18.630> uplinks<00:02:19.380> at<00:02:19.560> first<00:02:19.950> they<00:02:20.459> are<00:02:20.610> neutral

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the uplinks at first they are neutral

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.199 
the uplinks at first they are neutral
and<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.739> shown<00:02:22.739> by<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.069> white<00:02:23.520> symbol

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and that is shown by the white symbol

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.140 
and that is shown by the white symbol
folio<00:02:24.630> blink<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.170> when<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.220> actual<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:26.910> blink

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
folio blink and when the actual or blink

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.839 
folio blink and when the actual or blink
is<00:02:27.300> activated<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.319> goes<00:02:28.500> blue<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.640> course

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
is activated it goes blue and of course

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.090 
is activated it goes blue and of course
in<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.090> rebels<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.630> defend<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.100> but

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
in the rebels have to defend that but

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.979 
in the rebels have to defend that but
for<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> Empire<00:02:32.670> once<00:02:33.120> they<00:02:33.270> are<00:02:33.300> activated

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
for the Empire once they are activated

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.920 
for the Empire once they are activated
and<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.980> does<00:02:35.190> actually<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:35.819> red<00:02:36.330> instead<00:02:36.840> of

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and it does actually go red instead of

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.559 
and it does actually go red instead of
blue<00:02:37.020> meaning<00:02:37.920> that's<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.340> target<00:02:38.819> that's<00:02:39.000> set

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
blue meaning that's a target that's set

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.600 
blue meaning that's a target that's set
for<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> Empire<00:02:40.560> faction<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.489> have

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
for you on the Empire faction you have

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.210 
for you on the Empire faction you have
to<00:02:41.730> go<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.120> shut<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.780> down<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.860> stops

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
to go and shut it down and that stops

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.550 
to go and shut it down and that stops
the<00:02:44.400> y-wings<00:02:44.880> bomb<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.300> 8080<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:46.470> of

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the y-wings bomb in the 8080 but of

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.530 
the y-wings bomb in the 8080 but of
course<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.160> longer<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.819> rebel<00:02:48.150> faction

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
course the longer that the rebel faction

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.970 
course the longer that the rebel faction
defends<00:02:49.080> these<00:02:49.230> orb<00:02:49.440> links<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.800> have<00:02:49.830> been

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
defends these orb links that have been

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.039 
defends these orb links that have been
activated<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.940> more<00:02:51.180> wire<00:02:51.420> rings<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.900> bomb

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
activated the more wire rings can bomb

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.110 
activated the more wire rings can bomb
the<00:02:52.230> 8080<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:53.190> these<00:02:53.400> wire<00:02:53.610> wings<00:02:53.880> are

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the 8080 now these wire wings are

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090 
the 8080 now these wire wings are
actually<00:02:54.569> needed<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.110> make<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.590> 8080

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
actually needed to make the 8080

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.650 
actually needed to make the 8080
vulnerable<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.150> when<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:57.450> vulnerable

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
vulnerable and so when it's vulnerable

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.960 
vulnerable and so when it's vulnerable
we<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.110> actually<00:02:58.230> destroy<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.830> 8080<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.519> we

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
we can actually destroy the 8080 and we

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.240 
we can actually destroy the 8080 and we
can<00:03:00.120> see<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.870> vulnerable<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:02.069> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
can see when it is vulnerable in the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.830 
can see when it is vulnerable in the
actual<00:03:02.459> gameplay<00:03:02.819> because<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.690> pay

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
actual gameplay because if you pay

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.750 
actual gameplay because if you pay
attention<00:03:03.959> you'll<00:03:04.739> see<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.069> when<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.340> 8080

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
attention you'll see that when the 8080

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.449 
attention you'll see that when the 8080
gets<00:03:06.030> bombed<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.630> has<00:03:06.989> blue<00:03:07.350> sparks<00:03:07.830> all<00:03:08.010> over

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
gets bombed it has blue sparks all over

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.490 
gets bombed it has blue sparks all over
it<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:09.239> marks<00:03:09.630> out<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.170> actually

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
it and that marks out that is actually

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.080 
it and that marks out that is actually
vulnerable<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.160> we<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.400> now<00:03:11.489> try<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:11.850> take

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
vulnerable and we can now try and take

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.150 
vulnerable and we can now try and take
it<00:03:12.239> down<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.660> once<00:03:13.110> this<00:03:13.290> has<00:03:13.440> happened<00:03:13.860> when

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
it down and once this has happened when

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.400 
it down and once this has happened when
the<00:03:14.280> 88<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.760> vulnerable<00:03:15.290> snowspeeders<00:03:16.290> are

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
the 88 is vulnerable snowspeeders are

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.319 
the 88 is vulnerable snowspeeders are
able<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.769> take<00:03:17.010> down<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> 8080<00:03:17.850> with<00:03:18.090> two

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
able to take down the 8080 with two

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.900 
able to take down the 8080 with two
cables<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.410> course<00:03:19.650> we<00:03:19.950> see<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
cables and of course we see this in the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.210 
cables and of course we see this in the
actual<00:03:21.269> gameplay<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.930> snow<00:03:22.560> speed<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.010> of

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
actual gameplay and snow speed is of

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.979 
actual gameplay and snow speed is of
course<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.519> vehicle<00:03:23.910> are<00:03:24.090> earned<00:03:24.630> through

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
course a vehicle are earned through

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.900 
course a vehicle are earned through
power-ups<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.799> that's<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> same<00:03:26.549> for<00:03:26.760> all

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
power-ups and that's the same for all

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.849 
power-ups and that's the same for all
the<00:03:27.060> other<00:03:27.209> vehicles<00:03:27.600> there<00:03:28.049> are<00:03:28.170> also<00:03:28.350> plenty

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
the other vehicles there are also plenty

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.210 
the other vehicles there are also plenty

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
to destroy the 80s tea you couldn't just

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.860 
to destroy the 80s tea you couldn't just
camp<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.640> wait<00:03:47.760> for<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.150> because<00:03:48.600> it'll<00:03:48.840> be

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
camp and wait for that because it'll be

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.750 
camp and wait for that because it'll be
in<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.019> different<00:03:49.140> location<00:03:49.380> each<00:03:49.859> time<00:03:50.220> so

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760
