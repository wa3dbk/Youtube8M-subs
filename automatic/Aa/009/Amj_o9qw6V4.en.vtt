00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.790
 welcome away today i 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.759
 I answer the question of the audience which 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.010
 asked how to forget a person with 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.630
 who were you in a relationship but he you 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.519
 by vin betrayed or offended or just left 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.340
 without explanation, there are different reasons 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.939
 situations but the output from these stations is one and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.430
 the same person yourself an abandoned person 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.940
 or a disappointed person feels 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.480
 himself terribly and totally does not understand how 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.829
 did he get the thought out of his head 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.739
 just fiends like we usually want 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.440
 exaggerating the degree of horror 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.050
 the person who we think we are 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.520
 offended but nonetheless still we 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.239
 feel awful and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.859
 and how what to do let's talk 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.660
 today about it you please 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.320
 join comments and i will you 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.650
 I'll tell you what I think about this issue 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.450
 firstly after it happened 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.390
 some kind of problem here 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.630
 let's say a man betrayed you he 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.290
 offended he did something up there to need 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.090
 soberly assess how awful it is 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 he did because while we are both wives 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.890
 while here we are in some kind of emotional 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.170
 rise we are not able to end 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.570
 adequately evaluate and it seems to us that he 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.180
 so bad again acted as simple 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.920
 impossible and just time passes we 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 starting to revise it already seems 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.100
 well, well, as if there is nothing 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.100
 such direct criminal but why 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.430
 try to reduce at least a little 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.649
 hot emotional passions and appreciate 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 the situation may be she will not seem to you 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.070
 so terrible if she still 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.360
 seems glaring most likely 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.159
 your mind the way it is on 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.060
 present moment so i give you 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.030
 such advice and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.420
 and he is very effective you need to distract 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.209
 your attention and shift him he's different 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.970
 center of gravity while you have a center of gravity 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.160
 this is the man in him constantly 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.069
 You think grieve to think about what he is bad 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.680
 he's done something terrible he 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.140
 so-and-so there he betrayed me as well 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.560
 further so on your center of gravity 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.050
 is on this person and you need 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.599
 this center, eat move to some 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.330
 a matter that will entice you this means 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.420
 what do you need from create your life 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.280
 maybe even a little bit artificial 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.080
 create difficulties and obstacles which 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.060
 you will need to overcome for example 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.209
 it may be 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.849
 career ambitions development yourself think 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.620
 Here I sit working there is not clear by whom 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.810
 it is not clear what salary right now 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.670
 it's about time when you left here and when 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.769
 you have such a test with and now the most 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.959
 time to try to move forward 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.739
 career can be changed job can 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.250
 to be better paid 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.320
 position or somehow raising your 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.720
 organize that is activated in 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.090
 another sphere put yourself some 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.100
 a task that fascinates you for example 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.940
 higher education or 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.880
 second higher education or 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.120
 or learn a new language ie find 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.100
 some goal that lights you up 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.200
 some kind of lighter inside can be 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.459
 this is what you dreamed from childhood to us 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.090
 always in childhood with some dreams 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.920
 who then go okay type really wanted 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.829
 go there I don't know to australia and 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.590
 see wild monkeys and then i mean 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.750
 met this scum and and all her life 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.340
 went awry and the monkey did not see 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.020
 But if something happened to you 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.550
 it's time 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.410
 pack up go to australia 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.630
 cable of poison and waiting for you new 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.730
 adventures new acquaintances that is you 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.410
 definitely need to shift the focus I'm not 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.060
 can give universal advice how 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.550
 shift the focus because all people are very 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.910
 different and each have their own 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.740
 hobbies interest but most importantly you 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.080
 find this little twinkle 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.330
 which is warming up maybe you 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.900
 he was abandoned maybe he have you already 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.630
 almost gone but you need to take it and 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.840
 I'll start to start growing this way 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.480
 just distract from grinding 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.510
 such negative thoughts will appear 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.400
 other problems here's the key word there in 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.020
 this passage of mine this 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.730
 find yourself other problems maybe 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.640
 you have them initially then just 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.440
 easy to switch but usually people 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.990
 suffer here for months and years 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.270
 riding that they simply have no other problems 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.360
 there is nothing more to suffer and here they are 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.830
 here suffers u suffer and suffers 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.680
 find why suffer another 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.540
 let this other be more useful in 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.400
 your life is because suffering 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.830
 past relationships is completely 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.169
 instructive suffering but he is not and is not 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.479
 gives it only takes you energy and 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.830
 all and if you suffer about 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.180
 your career if you suffer 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.490
 about your travels or dancing 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.710
 or a foreign language is positive and 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.410
 suffering because you're in the process 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.450
 can learn a language you can get settled 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.200
 get more money you can 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.580
 move to another country you can 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.169
 achieve something is here 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.229
 focus on your some 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.210
 achievements and everything is in it all 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.419
 the secret is clear that tomorrow is straight 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.610
 you will not forget it always hurt it 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.919
 always leaves a trace in the memory and 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.600
 probably we are so well forever that is 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.020
 impossible to take and throw out of your 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.460
 memory some events you can't 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.410
 create some near you do in your 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.140
 head and artificial there will always be 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.150
 remember this but with time memories 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.889
 painted more than something positive i 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.729
 undressed assure all the way all negative 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:03.759
 over time they lose their urgency 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.620
 that's all what would be negative 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.139
 the memory didn't haunt you 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.029
 you know what time will pass year two 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.129
 or five years and 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:15.580
 this memory will no longer be you 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:18.340
 be aware yes dude there did that and 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.469
 something but this will not be sharp you will 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.099
 just remember it as an experience and you will 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:26.110
 know that in the future people do that 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:28.319
 you will know about people will 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.650
 understand people better you will 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:35.139
 understand what happens and so yes it is 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.210
 means you have to be careful 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.639
 be more attentive to the little things necessary 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.469
 just better understand people and how 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.860
 once this negative experience gives you 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:47.080
 opportunity not to make those in the future 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.000
 mistakes that you have made here and 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.930
 everything so everything is fine anyway
