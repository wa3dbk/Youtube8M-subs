 of the International Horse Academy 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.210
 the pine stud is a race for 5 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.099
 at 8 years old on 2850 meters there are two 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110

 share beautiful five years a quinté of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 five years but first five this is the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.000
 five years indeed with the 3 avr course 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.000
 in front of the alex the winner say 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 atika the asset of montbrun leucate 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 absolute truth then the most seen 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.190
 in quotation marks with the eight villages 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.440
 5 natal want it thaw and six 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.390
 volcano dubbi yes so in mind you 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.340
 said it rank you on the 3rd of april 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.960
 who stays on a success that will be feet 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.400
 naked for the first time you have everything 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.470
 said déferré the first four times 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 it's still the big plus 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.430
 last time it was pornichet 16 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.890
 break-in the horse made his effort 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.159
 opposite that he has extended well until 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.020
 post 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.590
 it was not transcendent but it was 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.270
 well 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.549
 I really like the jean philippe driver 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.799
 collin who is rarely wrong the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.119
 horse is good right handed the fao good 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.729
 right handed facts to the first four 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.590
 times in front of cabourg horse 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.810
 relatively manageable it's better 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.310
 running hidden certainly but it smells good 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.469
 even if it's higher than the same 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.299
 case to pornichet I think the side 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.670
 of the first four times is going 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.200
 improve it I would be disappointed that it does not 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.209
 not figure on arrival distinction 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.039
 it smells very good for the 3 fair 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.109
 behind you classify the 16 to exile 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.509
 winner who is close to the lot the most 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.829
 rich by far the most titles and we get 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.329
 remember a very beautiful victory 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.020
 exactly in cabourg there are some 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.489
 seasons the only one makes a brief pass 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.770
 in the boxes of sébastien guarato that 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.929
 did not work hottie and that's 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.020
 like that it can happen back to 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.640
 the sender to know jean etienne dubois 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.079
 piron vercruysse for jean etienne 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.000
 dubois it smells good at worst vercruysse to 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.250
 cabourg it smells very good because it's 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.930
 not commonplace 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.660
 pierrot has recently come a gain from 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.950
 work properly racing in 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.250
 the legs after having worries of 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.980
 health 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.720
 it may not be enough to win that 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.829
 may not be enough by May 3 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.049
 in the hexagon hours it's still the 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.000
 class trotter cases the titles to 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.340
 argue and who already has very very 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.040
 well done to cabo I feel obliged to 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.299
 keep it win nothing to say it is 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.040
 not in the three audi cut down missed 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.170
 of a race where he had put so much 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.849
 high anyway it is that your height 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.920
 of the vercruysse turn that will see Kabul 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.880
 yes who moves or lesson to like the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.700
 winner it smells good 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.650
 in 3rd you rank the 10th ti-cats who 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.480
 just won twice 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.790
 it's very good yeah it's a mare 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.549
 intermittently illuminates a quality 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 empty passage and mythomaniac does not explain 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.870
 not the reasons precisely he does not know 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.790
 why but what is it that matters 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.590
 for us it is that the mare found 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.209
 of her superb twice she has 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.849
 especially won on this course a 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.310
 fortnight by already making 25 meters the 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.260
 only problem is that this time there will 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.180
 was going badly but I think that in the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.099
 means I even think she'll be 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.470
 installed favorite of the race yes because 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.740
 that she stays on two victories the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.660
 chronos andriat déferré hinds 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.180
 now I preferred him an evil that 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.310
 in front and with the wind agree 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.350
 right behind you rank this asset 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.330
 de montbrun I think before going back 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.250
 still on a brick interview b 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.050
 thomas it's arnaud lecomte who has 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:04:02.680
 met he'll just talk about my 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:04:06.940
 her last two successes does she 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.810
 has reached a plateau according to you and there we 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.810
 can see her triple the amount 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.500
 it would have been a shame to forget him 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.690
 is very confident even though he is very 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.970
 confident and that when aymeric thomas 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.100
 is moderately confident we saw it on Tuesday 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.210
 evening bye bye parishes the horse makes 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.940
 the arrival then when he is confident 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.410
 what are we going for 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.480
 behind I said you rank the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.670
 this asset of montbrun which returns very 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.720
 well he stays on a third place at 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.750
 mont saint michel we go elsewhere 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.200
 see his straight line voice were 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.950
 heartfelt 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.110
 yes green casaque here is one that 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.430
 would act against the liberty anyway yes 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.790
 but now he has had a good run in 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.390
 in it was it was 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.550
 little week he finished properly without 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.510
 more but the choice must go up on it 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.580
 to everybody 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.440
 I prefer that it be referred for 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.850
 put higher in a prognosis but 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.160
 to do without philippe daugeard in cabourg 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.050
 with a trotter who in front who is 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.280
 well placed who is on the rising who 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.320
 is a good right-hander who makes all his 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.020
 races that is regular it's difficult 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.300
 I think that sure blow instead in 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.310
 the five 5 and he runs close in 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.560
 invited on August 16th a summit is very 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.360
 close together but I think you had 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.040
 said he was asked to finish 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.630
 so it's a race I think it 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.860
 is doing good exactly 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.090
 here it is now I can still 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.500
 I think it's a hit in five 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.360
 sets it's a little what philippe 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.220
 daugeard said arnaud last 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.660
 we're going to listen to his interview 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.350
 speaks in particular of the state of form of 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.350
 his resident 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.230
 so he has that last picture 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.280
 mont saint michel the race was not 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.520
 too hard and I think he had 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.639
 recovered that's why I 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.969
 it's a nice consent for seniors 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.379
 yes it's a good commitment after 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.809
 I am aware that he has returned to 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:59.299
 100% despite everything and I hope I can 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:06:00.469
 finish by hand becomes the deputy he 

00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:02.419
 is confirmed what does it do for the acquaintance 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.909
 a little bit is not the professional 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.889
 the most confident but there we feel in 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.779
 his words that the horse is certainly not 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.329
 not 100% but who will do the street and in 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:13.429
 5th you rank leucate absolute truth 

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:14.389
 which is the most been seen to his advantage 

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:17.870
 on the grass 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.460
 recently this is what we saw six co 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.710
 that's what his trainer told us 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.520
 now this winter at vincennes against 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.440
 the only females 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.510
 it was still pretty much the lines 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.150
 are good 15 are the 2007 at vincennes 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.950
 we stay locked up with mares who 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.650
 have made gains since the deferred 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.810
 later valentin royer his rival 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.840
 evening know her by heart 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.180
 besides there the success valentin royer 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.520
 and the mare truth as very very 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.220
 good these shortcomings that favorite 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.570
 funny speculative instead well 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.820
 we will follow you we understand it in 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.010
 priority to young people and before concluding 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.200
 of a you also have a nice nugget 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.660
 for the cp meeting at the trotters who 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.580
 remains several disqualification so I 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.560
 adventure on a slippery slope with 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.870
 the 306 vino nobile 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.560
 but when he is king at cabourg in 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.940
 apprentices it was very good at enghien 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.120
 subsequently it went wrong 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.620
 free of the four is still a 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.440
 big advantage is the last time he 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.360
 was deferrée of the four to the mounted 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.580
 had won and well we will follow for a 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.860
 poker shot on the 306 thank you very much 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.870
 successful manicure tomorrow you will find 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:27.790
 our specialists in deauville i tell you
