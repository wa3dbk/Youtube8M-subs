00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
van today that's doing them zakk wylde

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.670 
van today that's doing them zakk wylde
has<00:00:24.300> been<00:00:24.480> doing<00:00:24.720> these<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.050> years<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.619> years

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
has been doing these for years and years

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.650 
has been doing these for years and years
and<00:00:25.859> years<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:26.789> he<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> one<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and years I think he was the one that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.450 
and years I think he was the one that
kind<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:29.029> pushed<00:00:30.029> these<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.929> type<00:00:31.170> of

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
kind of pushed these this type of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:51.650 
kind of pushed these this type of
technique<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> forefront<00:00:34.550> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.670> what

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.440 

so<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:54.010> basically<00:00:54.310> what<00:00:54.760> you're<00:00:54.850> doing<00:00:54.910> is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
so it's basically what you're doing is

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.900 
so it's basically what you're doing is
you're<00:00:55.840> you're<00:00:56.470> snapping<00:00:56.800> you're<00:00:57.610> snapping

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
you're you're snapping you're snapping

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.320 
you're you're snapping you're snapping
the<00:00:58.420> off<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.600> string<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.340> you're<00:01:00.760> not<00:01:00.880> flat

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
the off the string and you're not flat

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.090 
the off the string and you're not flat
picking<00:01:01.630> like<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.080> usually<00:01:02.170> do<00:01:02.620> with<00:01:02.770> single

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
picking like you usually do with single

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.870 
picking like you usually do with single
note<00:01:03.250> stuff

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.120 

angle<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.570> pic<00:01:08.930> gonna<00:01:09.590> end<00:01:09.770> with<00:01:09.829> a<00:01:09.950> pic

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
angle the pic gonna end with a pic

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.880 
angle the pic gonna end with a pic
differently<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.149> it's<00:01:13.119> not<00:01:14.119> full<00:01:14.770> you<00:01:15.770> don't

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
differently so it's not full you don't

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.410 
differently so it's not full you don't
want<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.070> be<00:01:16.159> vertical<00:01:16.700> towards<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.119> string

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
want to be vertical towards the string

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.800 
want to be vertical towards the string
but<00:01:17.659> enough<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.799> where<00:01:18.829> a<00:01:19.310> cat<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:20.570> kind<00:01:20.780> of

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
but enough to where a cat to kind of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.930 
but enough to where a cat to kind of
produce<00:01:21.079> this<00:01:21.320> out

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.020 

now<00:01:25.750> what<00:01:25.930> I'm<00:01:26.050> doing<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.560> my<00:01:27.550> thumb<00:01:27.910> is
