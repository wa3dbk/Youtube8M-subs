00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
what I'm saying is if you try to go for

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.429 
what I'm saying is if you try to go for
the<00:04:45.060> early<00:04:45.300> series<00:04:45.539> like<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.870> walk<00:04:46.050> here<00:04:46.289> and

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439
