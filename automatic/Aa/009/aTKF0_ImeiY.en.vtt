00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
better bet yeah and then the other the

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.800 
better bet yeah and then the other the
other<00:04:51.440> Beth<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.830> like<00:04:52.010> first<00:04:52.760> score<00:04:53.510> in<00:04:53.690> the

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
other Beth I like first score in the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.160 
other Beth I like first score in the
game<00:04:53.840> not<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.740> touchdown<00:04:55.310> at<00:04:55.520> plus<00:04:55.940> 1<00:04:56.270> 45<00:04:56.840> yeah

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
game not a touchdown at plus 1 45 yeah

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.440 
game not a touchdown at plus 1 45 yeah
great<00:04:57.620> odds<00:04:57.830> like<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.280> for<00:04:58.580> two<00:04:58.850> teams<00:04:59.150> that

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
great odds like that for two teams that

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.810 
great odds like that for two teams that
well<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.290> Seahawks<00:05:00.680> tend<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.160> start<00:05:01.370> slow<00:05:01.640> so

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
well the Seahawks tend to start slow so

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.800 
well the Seahawks tend to start slow so
I<00:05:01.880> can<00:05:01.910> see<00:05:02.150> them<00:05:02.270> starting<00:05:02.480> at<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.600> field

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
I can see them starting at the field

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.690 
I can see them starting at the field
goal<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.470> Patriots<00:05:04.070> of<00:05:04.220> course<00:05:04.280> we'll<00:05:04.610> have

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
goal the Patriots of course we'll have

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
goal the Patriots of course we'll have
to<00:05:04.850> score<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.150> would<00:05:05.240> have<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.480> score<00:05:05.660> a

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
to score it would have to score a

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.200 
to score it would have to score a
touchdown<00:05:06.020> on<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.530> Seahawks<00:05:07.430> often<00:05:07.730> are<00:05:08.000> on

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
touchdown on the Seahawks often are on

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.430 
touchdown on the Seahawks often are on
the<00:05:08.330> sale<00:05:08.480> seahawks<00:05:08.870> defense<00:05:09.170> which<00:05:09.320> is

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
the sale seahawks defense which is

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.800 
the sale seahawks defense which is
fantastic<00:05:09.620> in<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.220> red<00:05:10.370> zone<00:05:10.400> so<00:05:11.090> i<00:05:11.420> think<00:05:11.540> the

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
fantastic in the red zone so i think the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.480 
fantastic in the red zone so i think the
odds<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:12.260> their<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.920> first<00:05:13.100> car<00:05:13.250> being<00:05:13.400> a

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
odds of their the first car being a

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.820 
odds of their the first car being a
field<00:05:13.640> goal<00:05:13.880> or<00:05:14.090> even<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:15.020> safety<00:05:15.440> think<00:05:15.710> we've

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
field goal or even a safety think we've

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.580 
field goal or even a safety think we've
seen<00:05:16.010> that<00:05:16.160> before<00:05:16.340> too<00:05:16.730> I<00:05:17.230> like<00:05:18.230> that<00:05:18.260> one<00:05:18.530> a

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
seen that before too I like that one a

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.700 
seen that before too I like that one a
lot<00:05:18.680> yeah<00:05:19.040> I<00:05:19.070> think<00:05:19.310> that's<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.700> good<00:05:19.790> one<00:05:20.000> um

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
lot yeah I think that's a good one um

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.900 
lot yeah I think that's a good one um
Russell<00:05:21.710> Wilson<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.160> over/under<00:05:22.730> four

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
Russell Wilson the over/under four

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.030 
Russell Wilson the over/under four
interceptions<00:05:23.390> in<00:05:23.870> this<00:05:24.170> game<00:05:24.380> is<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:24.830> a

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
interceptions in this game is that a

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.970 
interceptions in this game is that a
half<00:05:25.400> so<00:05:26.000> you're<00:05:26.990> getting<00:05:27.230> equal<00:05:27.680> odds<00:05:27.800> that

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
half so you're getting equal odds that

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.250 
half so you're getting equal odds that
he<00:05:28.160> either<00:05:28.220> won't<00:05:28.700> throw<00:05:28.940> any<00:05:29.090> picks<00:05:29.330> or<00:05:29.540> we'll

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
he either won't throw any picks or we'll

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.410 
he either won't throw any picks or we'll
throw<00:05:30.290> at<00:05:30.710> least<00:05:30.890> one<00:05:31.130> I'm<00:05:31.910> gonna<00:05:32.090> go<00:05:32.330> ahead

the<00:05:39.800> stretch<00:05:40.040> Russell<00:05:40.520> Wilson<00:05:40.820> was<00:05:40.970> not<00:05:41.240> as

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
the stretch Russell Wilson was not as

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.540 
the stretch Russell Wilson was not as
good<00:05:41.690> taking<00:05:42.290> care<00:05:42.500> of<00:05:42.530> the<00:05:42.680> ball<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.190> you

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
good taking care of the ball and you

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.540 
good taking care of the ball and you
know<00:05:43.970> it<00:05:44.180> it's<00:05:44.690> not<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.170> hard<00:05:45.470> you<00:05:45.590> just<00:05:45.710> you

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
know it it's not that hard you just you

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.520 
know it it's not that hard you just you
get<00:05:46.670> a<00:05:46.700> bad<00:05:46.940> tip<00:05:47.300> of<00:05:47.570> receiver<00:05:47.960> bobbles<00:05:48.470> the

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
get a bad tip of receiver bobbles the

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.410 
get a bad tip of receiver bobbles the
ball<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.920> wrong<00:05:49.100> way<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:49.670> now<00:05:50.030> it's<00:05:50.210> suddenly

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
ball the wrong way and now it's suddenly

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.790 
ball the wrong way and now it's suddenly
an<00:05:50.630> interception<00:05:51.020> doesn't<00:05:51.350> have<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.650> be<00:05:51.770> a

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
an interception doesn't have to be a

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.620 
an interception doesn't have to be a
mistake<00:05:52.010> on<00:05:52.370> Russell<00:05:52.700> Wilson's<00:05:53.030> park<00:05:53.270> yeah

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
mistake on Russell Wilson's park yeah

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.840 
mistake on Russell Wilson's park yeah
yeah<00:05:53.990> I<00:05:54.020> think<00:05:54.290> that's<00:05:54.590> probably<00:05:54.800> one<00:05:55.610> of<00:05:55.640> the

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
yeah I think that's probably one of the

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.790 
yeah I think that's probably one of the
safer<00:05:56.180> bets<00:05:56.390> you<00:05:56.540> can<00:05:56.720> make<00:05:56.900> not<00:05:57.470> that<00:05:57.680> you

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
safer bets you can make not that you

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.560 
safer bets you can make not that you
should<00:05:58.040> be<00:05:58.160> making<00:05:58.370> bets<00:05:58.790> and<00:05:58.970> this<00:05:59.120> video<00:05:59.390> was
