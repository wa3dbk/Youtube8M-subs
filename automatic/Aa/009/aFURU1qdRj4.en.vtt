00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:11.120
 with roman mcmahon I am the second best in the world is a curious thing because 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.290
 he could send the only thing he does with the left is a less player 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.480
 if you have to catch a ball to the network 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.019
 another seven with the right 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.349
 is right-handed 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.329
 if you have to always pull on the right 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.489
 jumps and the city of guatemala 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.489
 right and with the left 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.940
 but they are always small when with all hands because I had no strength 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.050
 but I thought it was 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.820
 much better a player than with two 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.290
 because there was almost no player 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.900
 the professional circuit that occurs with both hands the post and at the end 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
 are the tenths to play on the left 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.079
 let's remember how it was the first time you played with your left hand 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.579
 lorena cuÃ©llar 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.580
 that rope or 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.640
 added that it is essentially due to the current rare sensation 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.550
 the first tournament he played with a 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.960
 as I said after 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 it was quite difficult 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.850
 it was a steps that you have ideas 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.970
 Besides playing tennis you can do more things with the left 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 for now work 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 3 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 easy 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.050
 on the right 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.409
 points passing by hand common hand 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.409
 arrival the moment of truth 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.999
 according to the designation of the official 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:18.119
 I do not know if you want inspiration from the workers is not possible either 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.939
 get very high 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.939
 from much more information 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.809
 based on work to be based 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:27.679
 the talent
