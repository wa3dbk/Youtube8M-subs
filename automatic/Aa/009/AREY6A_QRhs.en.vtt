hi I'm Charles Stewart jr. and I'm going

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.679 
hi I'm Charles Stewart jr. and I'm going
to<00:00:02.730> show<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.120> troubleshoot<00:00:03.389> a

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
to show you how to troubleshoot a

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.499 
to show you how to troubleshoot a
computer<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:04.259> won't<00:00:04.440> start<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:05.609> know<00:00:06.270> this

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
computer that won't start I know this

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.750 
computer that won't start I know this
sounds<00:00:06.839> really<00:00:07.130> kind<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.220> stupid<00:00:08.550> sometimes

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
sounds really kind of stupid sometimes

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.669 
sounds really kind of stupid sometimes
but<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.719> want<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.960> make<00:00:10.080> sure<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
but you want to make sure that the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.400 
but you want to make sure that the
computer<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.429> plugged<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.120> or<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.990> maybe<00:00:13.200> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
computer is plugged in or that maybe the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.620 
computer is plugged in or that maybe the
power<00:00:13.590> strip<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> computer<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:15.059> plugged<00:00:15.450> into

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
power strip the computer is plugged into

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.260 
power strip the computer is plugged into
is<00:00:15.960> turned<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.470> because<00:00:17.029> believe<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.150> not

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
is turned on because believe it or not

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.900 
is turned on because believe it or not
that<00:00:18.330> tends<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.189> to<00:00:20.189> fix<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.580> problem

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that tends to be the to fix the problem

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.099 
that tends to be the to fix the problem
most<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:21.779> you're<00:00:21.930> hitting

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
most of the time so if you're hitting

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
most of the time so if you're hitting
the<00:00:22.199> power<00:00:22.470> button<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> computer<00:00:23.100> it's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the power button on the computer it's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.390 
the power button on the computer it's
not<00:00:24.090> turning<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.630> go<00:00:25.320> over<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.160> make

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
not turning on go over and you know make

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.820 
not turning on go over and you know make
sure<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.820> somehow<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.750> outlet<00:00:28.470> didn't

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
sure that somehow that the outlet didn't

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.259 
sure that somehow that the outlet didn't
get<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.130> know<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> cording<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:29.970> pulled<00:00:30.179> out

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
get you know the cording it pulled out

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
get you know the cording it pulled out
of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.420> outlet<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:30.960> maybe<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> power<00:00:31.500> strip

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
of the outlet or maybe the power strip

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.680 
of the outlet or maybe the power strip
someone<00:00:32.520> accidentally<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
someone accidentally you know or it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.450 
someone accidentally you know or it
might<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.260> might<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.530> flipped<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
might have it might have flipped the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.830 
might have it might have flipped the
breaker<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.940> power<00:00:36.239> strips<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> might

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
breaker in the power strips you might

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
breaker in the power strips you might
need<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> turn<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.380> back<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.710> that's<00:00:38.340> usually

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
need to turn it back on that's usually

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
need to turn it back on that's usually
I'd<00:00:39.690> say<00:00:39.870> most<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.230> time<00:00:40.410> will<00:00:40.559> fix<00:00:40.770> your

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I'd say most of time will fix your

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.430 
I'd say most of time will fix your
problem<00:00:41.450> also<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:42.989> you've<00:00:43.230> done

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
problem also you know if you've done

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.869 
problem also you know if you've done
that<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.770> might<00:00:43.800> want<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> check<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.550> know<00:00:44.579> if

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that you might want to check you know if

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.190 
that you might want to check you know if
someone's<00:00:45.210> flipped<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> switch<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> house

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
someone's flipped a switch in the house

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
someone's flipped a switch in the house
that<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> outlet<00:00:47.039> might<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that that outlet might be on which you

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.130 
that that outlet might be on which you
probably<00:00:48.420> don't<00:00:48.570> want<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> computer

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
probably don't want to have a computer

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.950 
probably don't want to have a computer
on<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> outlet<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.070> that's<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> case<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.960> go

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
on that outlet if that's the case or go

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
on that outlet if that's the case or go
check<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> breaker<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.949> make<00:00:53.340> sure<00:00:53.460> no

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
check the breaker and make sure no

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.459 
check the breaker and make sure no
breakers<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.120> been<00:00:54.270> flipped<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:55.110> outlet

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
breakers have been flipped that outlet

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.430 
breakers have been flipped that outlet
could<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.739> been<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.930> you've<00:00:58.260> done

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
could have been on and if you've done

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
could have been on and if you've done
all<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:59.010> still<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.460> you<00:01:00.149> know

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
all that and it's still not you know

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
all that and it's still not you know
booting<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.899> turning<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.859> it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
booting up or turning on then it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.850 
booting up or turning on then it's
probably<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.640> computer<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.619> that<00:01:04.619> case

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
probably the computer and in that case

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890 
probably the computer and in that case
you're<00:01:05.339> you're<00:01:05.880> most<00:01:06.090> likely<00:01:06.299> running<00:01:06.600> into

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
you're you're most likely running into

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.560 
you're you're most likely running into
either<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.260> power<00:01:07.770> supply<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.250> died<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
either your power supply is died or the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.840 
either your power supply is died or the
motherboard<00:01:10.020> itself<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.680> shorted<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.580> not

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
motherboard itself is shorted out not

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
motherboard itself is shorted out not
working<00:01:12.299> anymore<00:01:12.619> because<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> very

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
working anymore because at the very

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
working anymore because at the very
least<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:15.240> power<00:01:15.479> supply<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.869> working<00:01:16.290> it

least if your power supply is working it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
least if your power supply is working it
should<00:01:16.650> boot<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.330> if<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.900> those

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
should boot up you know if one of those

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.510 
should boot up you know if one of those
two<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.439> working<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> should<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.189> least<00:01:20.280> boot

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
two are working it should at least boot

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.550 
two are working it should at least boot
up<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> hard<00:01:21.930> drive<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.439> get

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
up and if it's a hard drive you can get

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.399 
up and if it's a hard drive you can get
an<00:01:22.650> error<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.299> best<00:01:24.450> thing<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.110> if

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
an error so the best thing to do is if

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.120 
an error so the best thing to do is if
you<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.299> savvy<00:01:27.299> enough<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:27.900> buy<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.409> new<00:01:28.920> hard

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you are savvy enough go buy a new hard

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.730 
you are savvy enough go buy a new hard
drive<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.880> take<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.079> Best<00:01:31.229> Buy<00:01:31.409> to

in<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:34.140> them<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.590> swap<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
in and have them you know swap out the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
in and have them you know swap out the
power<00:01:36.840> supply<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.350> probably<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> first

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
power supply it's probably the first

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710 
power supply it's probably the first
thing<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.189> would<00:01:38.369> do<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
thing I would do and then see if that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.149 
thing I would do and then see if that
solves<00:01:39.930> your<00:01:40.079> problem<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.770> computer

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
solves your problem if your computer

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.590 
solves your problem if your computer
cranks<00:01:41.490> right<00:01:41.640> back<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:42.450> it's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
cranks right back up then you know it's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.410 
cranks right back up then you know it's
a<00:01:42.659> power<00:01:42.899> supply<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.729> usually<00:01:44.729> they'll

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
a power supply and usually they'll

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.210 
a power supply and usually they'll
they'll<00:01:45.960> die<00:01:46.140> eventually<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.890> that's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
they'll die eventually you know that's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.350 
they'll die eventually you know that's
just<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> things<00:01:47.880> they'll<00:01:48.060> happen

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
just one of the things they'll happen

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
just one of the things they'll happen
over<00:01:48.570> time<00:01:48.780> your<00:01:49.409> power<00:01:49.649> supply<00:01:49.829> will<00:01:50.280> die

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
over time your power supply will die

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
over time your power supply will die
hopefully<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:51.780> computer<00:01:52.170> will<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.590> around

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
hopefully your computer will be around

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.910 
hopefully your computer will be around
long<00:01:53.130> before<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> does<00:01:53.729> decide<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
long before it does decide to go out the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
long before it does decide to go out the
next<00:01:55.950> thing<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.850> motherboard<00:01:57.299> now

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
next thing would be the motherboard now

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
next thing would be the motherboard now
if<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> happens<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.890> might<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.159> well<00:01:59.280> go

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
if that happens you might as well go

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
if that happens you might as well go
ahead<00:01:59.880> and<00:01:59.969> get<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> new<00:02:00.240> computer<00:02:00.750> because

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
ahead and get a new computer because

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.880 
ahead and get a new computer because
that's<00:02:01.770> kind<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.590> backbone<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that's kind of the the backbone of the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.319 
that's kind of the the backbone of the
computer<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.430> your<00:02:05.579> motherboard<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.270> if

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
computer is your motherboard so if

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.150 
computer is your motherboard so if
something's<00:02:07.079> gone<00:02:07.259> wrong<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.890> then

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
something's gone wrong with that then

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.339 
something's gone wrong with that then
you'd<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.819> swap<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.479> which<00:02:09.989> you

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
you'd have to swap that out which you

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.830 
you'd have to swap that out which you
know<00:02:10.470> could<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.730> built<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> computer

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
know could be if you built the computer

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.309 
know could be if you built the computer
a<00:02:13.170> $50<00:02:14.099> or<00:02:14.250> $100<00:02:15.000> part<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.290> a

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
a $50 or $100 part but if you have a

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.960 
a $50 or $100 part but if you have a
