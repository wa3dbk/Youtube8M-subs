00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.139
 have these friendly 17 for a whole 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.969
 little video how to make a sword 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.230
 does pschitt and rogers end it's not 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.940
 really a shit sword and may but that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.640
 reports more than usual even with 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:27.529
 released biotech purposes and I showed you 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:31.619
 so there will be a good tan 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:40.739
 why obama latin dance 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:46.500
 here is not yet so here yes 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.120
 I hope the video with Martin 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.320
 good gore for now does not have much 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.370
 of people in any case who saw it but 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.280
 you liked it and helped you especially 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 I hope I think we will do 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 others but not so seems guillaume 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.270
 Lachaud serious piece I expect it 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.939
 busy already makes you fuck me then 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.670
 I walked pawns 25 can choose 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.170
 other things you take my 3 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.700
 because it does not cover everything 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.750
 and the assad completely but that's it and I 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700
 think it works for people 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.509
 armor 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.509
 so I'll take that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.439
 that's why you need a game too 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:41.450
 such a lot you need 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.450
 libraries and a charming table 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.020
 here is good wind and sitting and already 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:53.810
 perfect here already we will ask the table 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.600
 in champion this is as usual after 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.329
 Well, actually, I think when I'm 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.259
 knows knows for what enchantment be 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.239
 evidenced stronger sometimes more 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.239
 Beyond 30 maximum I know 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.910
 and you have to put libraries 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:16.280
 back is so you see there that there is 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:22.079
 bd letters raids 6th 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.140
 number made you two three cubes of 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.140
 top 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.859
 here is winch team I do not know if we are 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.239
 obliged not to take off for the 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:42.959
 games that I do not stick to them 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:46.790
 I do not know it works well here after 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.790
 so we'll do it again 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.709
 and I close it and just leave a 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.409
 space to return breaststroke ladies 1 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.099
 So here when you quite okay 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.450
 bother at the top fisher ben on va 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.620
 first do it below because otherwise we 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:17.419
 will not see anything so below you put 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:29.930
 to give you a layer in itself and I 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:33.709
 put one and now to the past to the fact 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.329
 is it just cover everything and there he 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.599
 everything has to be surrounded by big 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.739
 motets and kick off close a 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.480
 went up need to see I think you 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.819
 see I have a passion game turns and a 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.650
 good torch so had to enchant the swords 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.909
 to the first so I cut down chantÃ´me 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.569
 axis and with a little luck 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:56.509
 good there every 9 3 no box because that's 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.919
 I guess it's not bad, but 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.019
 after a lot of luck we can 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:04.489
 to have really sick stuff 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:06.759
 every 9.4 of stuff to try again we have 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.759
 tried everything 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.069
 finished four lots thing 3 I do not know of 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.949
 everything I do not know at all 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:25.600
 enchantments protection 3 breathing 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:29.630
 three campuses and channel protection 4 and 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.580
 and projectiles protection 4 so in fact 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.140
 take care of our sheep and we can 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:40.550
 do that with the ch or the lizards that 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:43.100
 is very good here so for you I 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.530
 I passed the very good or not you see 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.620
 not too much and so after fake affair 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.590
 to attacks on his piggy party 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.470
 at its local Shanghai and we will test 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.470
 every summer so after we know now 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.920
 we will test the swords now 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.340
 a little bit every time I get 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.340
 unchecking 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:22.980
 So here I am again what am I 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.160
 announced because I was it's the 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.340
 second set that 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:34.800
 this is the first answer not how 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:38.389
 hello and the last one every 9 3 where I 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.389
 believe this is the second good 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.160
 yeah so we have to launch that's where the 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.780
 better it's the middle I can finally 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.970
 it but after you can have some 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.150
 super strong stuff that supported this fight 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.700
 in the end I already saw that and try to 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.260
 sick now I do not know how 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.780
 they do that but must admit to having 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.729
 really lucky that as long as you're 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.380
 well here it was actually it was just a 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.510
 little video so we leave everything 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.500
 after 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.100
 I hope this video will have you 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.900
