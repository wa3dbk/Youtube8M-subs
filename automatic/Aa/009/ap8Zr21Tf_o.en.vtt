short stack shoving techniques that I'm
about<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.840> show<00:02:41.170> you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.800 

I<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:46.740> golden<00:02:47.740> rule<00:02:47.980> for<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:49.630> is

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
I have a golden rule for you it is

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.070 
I have a golden rule for you it is
something<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.709> use<00:02:51.300> pretty<00:02:52.300> religiously

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
something that I use pretty religiously

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.370 
something that I use pretty religiously
it<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.010> something<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.990> came<00:02:55.990> up<00:02:56.200> with

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
it is something that I came up with

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.850 
it is something that I came up with
years<00:02:56.709> ago<00:02:57.510> there's<00:02:58.510> actually<00:02:58.959> been<00:02:59.170> similar

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
years ago there's actually been similar

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.920 
years ago there's actually been similar
ideas<00:03:02.860> written<00:03:03.160> about<00:03:03.489> since<00:03:03.880> then<00:03:04.150> actually

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
ideas written about since then actually

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.559 
ideas written about since then actually
by<00:03:05.140> Dan<00:03:05.530> Harrington<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.880> one<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.150> his<00:03:07.270> books

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
by Dan Harrington and one of his books

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.000 
by Dan Harrington and one of his books
but<00:03:07.950> basically<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.640> called<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:11.170> 20%

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
but basically it is a called the 20%

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.530 
but basically it is a called the 20%
rule<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.980> let's<00:03:14.980> talk<00:03:15.220> about<00:03:15.430> exactly<00:03:16.120> what

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
rule and let's talk about exactly what

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.259 
rule and let's talk about exactly what
the<00:03:16.570> 20%<00:03:17.200> rule<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.310> what<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.640> means<00:03:18.910> and

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
the 20% rule is and what it means and

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.240 
the 20% rule is and what it means and
you<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:21.750> how<00:03:22.750> how<00:03:23.260> we're<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.739> use<00:03:23.800> that

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
you know how how we're going to use that

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.170 
you know how how we're going to use that
to<00:03:24.640> decide<00:03:26.820> when<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:27.970> where<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.330> shove<00:03:28.830> so

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
to decide when and where to shove so

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.520 
to decide when and where to shove so
simply<00:03:31.180> breaking<00:03:32.080> down<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:33.360> 20%<00:03:34.360> rule<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
simply breaking down the 20% rule the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.160 
simply breaking down the 20% rule the
20%<00:03:36.010> rule<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.959> idea<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:39.060> if<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.840> were<00:03:40.989> to

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
20% rule is the idea of if you were to

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.610 
20% rule is the idea of if you were to
win<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.620> pot<00:03:44.280> uncontested<00:03:46.319> just<00:03:47.319> stealing

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
win the pot uncontested just stealing

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.530 
win the pot uncontested just stealing
the<00:03:47.980> blinds<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.549> annie's<00:03:50.880> what<00:03:51.880> percent

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
the blinds and annie's what percent

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.900 
the blinds and annie's what percent
would<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:53.440> increase<00:03:53.920> your<00:03:53.950> stack<00:03:54.459> by<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.910> if

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
would that increase your stack by and if

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.690 
would that increase your stack by and if
it<00:03:58.239> increases<00:03:58.690> your<00:03:58.900> stack<00:03:59.320> by<00:03:59.590> 20%<00:04:00.220> or

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
it increases your stack by 20% or

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.789 
it increases your stack by 20% or
greater<00:04:02.040> then<00:04:03.540> mathematically<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:05.320> okay<00:04:05.739> to

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
greater then mathematically it's okay to

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.979 
greater then mathematically it's okay to
shove<00:04:06.160> there<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:09.420> basically<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.570> idea

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
shove there and basically the idea

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.949 
shove there and basically the idea
behind<00:04:11.049> this<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:13.019> that<00:04:15.120> by<00:04:16.120> shoving<00:04:16.720> there

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
behind this is is that by shoving there

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.860 
behind this is is that by shoving there
and<00:04:17.350> if<00:04:18.340> everyone<00:04:18.760> folds<00:04:19.060> like<00:04:19.570> in<00:04:19.750> this

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
and if everyone folds like in this

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.159 
and if everyone folds like in this
situation<00:04:20.470> here<00:04:20.680> with<00:04:20.859> King<00:04:21.310> six<00:04:21.640> I'm<00:04:22.419> shoving

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
situation here with King six I'm shoving

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.670 
situation here with King six I'm shoving
here<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:24.310> everyone<00:04:24.850> folds<00:04:25.180> I'm<00:04:26.020> gonna<00:04:26.470> go

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
here if everyone folds I'm gonna go

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.279 
here if everyone folds I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:26.979> pick<00:04:27.280> up<00:04:27.520> fifty<00:04:28.419> seven<00:04:28.780> thousand

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
ahead and pick up fifty seven thousand

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.670 
ahead and pick up fifty seven thousand
five<00:04:29.440> hundred<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:29.950> chips<00:04:30.630> which<00:04:31.630> if<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.050> just

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
five hundred and chips which if you just

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.950 
five hundred and chips which if you just
take<00:04:32.890> a<00:04:32.950> look<00:04:33.580> at<00:04:33.760> my<00:04:33.910> stack<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.300> two<00:04:34.690> hundred

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
take a look at my stack of two hundred

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.440 
take a look at my stack of two hundred
and<00:04:35.020> twenty<00:04:35.350> thousand<00:04:35.890> a<00:04:36.669> 20<00:04:37.270> percent

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
and twenty thousand a 20 percent

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.110 
and twenty thousand a 20 percent
increase<00:04:37.750> there<00:04:38.320> would<00:04:38.560> be<00:04:38.910> forty<00:04:39.910> four

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
increase there would be forty four

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.290 
increase there would be forty four
thousand<00:04:40.979> so<00:04:41.979> it's<00:04:42.010> actually<00:04:42.550> increasing<00:04:43.060> my

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
thousand so it's actually increasing my

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
thousand so it's actually increasing my
stack<00:04:43.630> by<00:04:43.890> almost<00:04:44.890> 30<00:04:45.310> percent<00:04:46.110> right<00:04:47.110> around

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
stack by almost 30 percent right around

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.300 
stack by almost 30 percent right around
thirty<00:04:47.650> percent<00:04:48.419> if<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:49.840> if<00:04:50.169> I<00:04:50.380> get<00:04:50.620> everyone<00:04:51.070> to

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
thirty percent if I if I get everyone to

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.060 
thirty percent if I if I get everyone to
lay<00:04:51.490> down<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:52.150> this<00:04:52.300> shove<00:04:55.289> however<00:04:56.289> sometimes

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
lay down to this shove however sometimes

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.380 
lay down to this shove however sometimes
we're<00:04:57.520> going<00:04:57.640> to<00:04:57.700> get<00:04:57.849> called

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
we're going to get called

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.050 
we're going to get called
and<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:59.680> know<00:04:59.800> especially<00:04:59.920> with<00:05:00.580> hands<00:05:00.820> like

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
and you know especially with hands like

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.680 
and you know especially with hands like
King<00:05:01.330> 6<00:05:01.720> or<00:05:02.530> worse<00:05:02.980> you<00:05:03.940> know<00:05:04.090> you're<00:05:04.390> rarely

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
King 6 or worse you know you're rarely

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.250 
King 6 or worse you know you're rarely
going<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.140> be<00:05:05.290> in<00:05:05.620> in<00:05:06.780> in<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.470> lead<00:05:08.680> but

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
going to be in in in the lead but

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.960 
going to be in in in the lead but
usually<00:05:11.260> you'll<00:05:11.560> find<00:05:11.590> yourself<00:05:12.340> only<00:05:12.580> as<00:05:12.940> a

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
usually you'll find yourself only as a

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.010 
usually you'll find yourself only as a
40<00:05:13.510> 60<00:05:13.720> dog<00:05:14.610> occasionally<00:05:15.610> worse<00:05:16.510> of<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.840> dog

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
40 60 dog occasionally worse of a dog

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.340 
40 60 dog occasionally worse of a dog
than<00:05:17.260> that<00:05:17.470> but<00:05:18.420> you<00:05:19.420> know<00:05:19.510> generally<00:05:19.840> it's

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
than that but you know generally it's

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.290 
than that but you know generally it's
going<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.590> be<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:20.770> 40<00:05:21.190> 60<00:05:21.430> dog<00:05:22.380> so<00:05:23.380> really<00:05:24.300> what

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
going to be a 40 60 dog so really what

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.610 
going to be a 40 60 dog so really what
this<00:05:25.570> bet<00:05:25.990> is<00:05:26.430> doing<00:05:27.430> is<00:05:28.170> you're<00:05:29.170> trying<00:05:29.440> to

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
this bet is doing is you're trying to

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.090 
this bet is doing is you're trying to
find<00:05:29.710> spots<00:05:30.400> where<00:05:30.970> you're<00:05:31.810> gonna<00:05:31.930> be<00:05:32.830> able<00:05:32.950> to

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
find spots where you're gonna be able to

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.350 
find spots where you're gonna be able to
shove<00:05:33.850> pick<00:05:34.300> up<00:05:34.480> more<00:05:34.660> than<00:05:34.840> 20%<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:37.090> feel

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
shove pick up more than 20% and you feel

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.980 
shove pick up more than 20% and you feel
like<00:05:37.390> that's<00:05:38.020> going<00:05:38.260> to<00:05:38.350> be<00:05:38.440> successful<00:05:39.990> well

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990
