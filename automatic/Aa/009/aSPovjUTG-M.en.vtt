okay what we got here is an example of a
really<00:00:06.450> abused<00:00:07.380> wheel<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.099> 1996's

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
really abused wheel this is in 1996's

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.860 
class Mercedes
we<00:00:10.769> got<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> base<00:00:11.129> clear<00:00:11.490> finish<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.419> this<00:00:12.570> wheel

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
we got a base clear finish on this wheel

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900 
we got a base clear finish on this wheel
but<00:00:13.589> as<00:00:13.709> you<00:00:13.799> can<00:00:13.889> see<00:00:14.129> it's<00:00:14.490> been<00:00:14.700> subjected

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
but as you can see it's been subjected

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.910 
but as you can see it's been subjected
to<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> lot<00:00:15.749> of<00:00:15.900> custom<00:00:16.260> chemicals<00:00:16.710> and

to a lot of custom chemicals and
probably<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> lot<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.910> abuse<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.539> far<00:00:18.780> as<00:00:18.960> people

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
probably a lot of abuse as far as people

probably a lot of abuse as far as people
not<00:00:19.680> cleaning<00:00:19.950> it<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> regular<00:00:20.430> basis<00:00:21.000> we've

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
not cleaning it on a regular basis we've

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.820 
not cleaning it on a regular basis we've
actually<00:00:21.780> gone<00:00:22.020> through<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.650> thorough

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
actually gone through a really thorough

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.070 
actually gone through a really thorough
prep<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.330> only<00:00:24.450> way<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.780> were<00:00:24.870> able

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to dislodge the brake this was with a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.390 
to dislodge the brake this was with a
really<00:00:27.240> strong<00:00:27.300> acid<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> caustic<00:00:28.740> acid<00:00:29.190> and

really strong acid a caustic acid and
that's<00:00:29.970> where<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> white<00:00:30.660> module<00:00:30.870> really

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
that's where the white module really

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.139 
that's where the white module really
benefits<00:00:31.680> you<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.129> if<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.820> at

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
on brake dust you're creating damage on

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.959 
on brake dust you're creating damage on
the<00:00:42.420> finish<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.679> over<00:00:44.219> time<00:00:44.429> this<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.820> what

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the finish so over time this is what

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
the finish so over time this is what
you're<00:00:45.120> left<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.510> mean<00:00:45.749> it<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.409> could<00:00:46.620> be

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
you're left with I mean it it could be

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.829 
you're left with I mean it it could be
better<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.159> at<00:00:47.579> 15<00:00:47.999> years<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.510> about<00:00:48.659> any

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
better but at 15 years just about any

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.270 
better but at 15 years just about any
base<00:00:49.019> clear<00:00:49.319> finish<00:00:49.499> is<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:49.920> look<00:00:50.069> like

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
base clear finish is going to look like

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.860 
base clear finish is going to look like
this

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.870 
go around the outer rim and even coat
your<00:01:36.530> wheel<00:01:36.679> weight<00:01:36.890> if<00:01:37.069> you<00:01:37.189> want<00:01:37.369> to

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.690 

what<00:01:44.509> we're<00:01:44.630> trying<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.930> achieve<00:01:45.049> here<00:01:45.700> is

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
what we're trying to achieve here is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.600 
what we're trying to achieve here is
just<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.630> try<00:01:48.469> to<00:01:48.530> get<00:01:48.680> some<00:01:48.799> dignity<00:01:49.219> back<00:01:49.430> to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
just to try to get some dignity back to

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.560 
just to try to get some dignity back to
this<00:01:49.729> wheel<00:01:49.939> it's<00:01:50.119> never<00:01:50.299> gonna<00:01:50.479> look

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
this wheel it's never gonna look

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.440 
this wheel it's never gonna look
brand-new<00:01:51.159> but<00:01:52.159> as<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.369> can<00:01:52.490> see<00:01:52.700> that's

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
brand-new but as you can see that's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.139 
brand-new but as you can see that's
incredible

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
incredible

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.810 
incredible
it's<00:01:56.149> a<00:01:56.299> huge<00:01:56.630> improvement<00:01:56.929> and<00:01:57.820> we've

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
it's a huge improvement and we've

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.460 
it's a huge improvement and we've
essentially<00:01:59.240> arrested<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.899> damage<00:02:00.229> at<00:02:00.350> this

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
essentially arrested the damage at this

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.700 
essentially arrested the damage at this
point<00:02:00.770> -<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.189> not<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.700> get<00:02:01.820> any<00:02:02.000> worse

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
point - it's not going to get any worse

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.590 
point - it's not going to get any worse
and<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.100> other<00:02:04.310> benefit<00:02:04.909> even<00:02:05.179> if<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.420> have<00:02:05.569> a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
and the other benefit even if you have a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.650 
and the other benefit even if you have a
wheel<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:05.960> old<00:02:06.229> is<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.619> from<00:02:06.770> now<00:02:06.799> on<00:02:07.660> you'll

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
wheel this old is it from now on you'll

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.389 
wheel this old is it from now on you'll
be<00:02:08.780> able<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.989> clean<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.289> with<00:02:09.380> ease<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.039> older

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
be able to clean it with ease the older

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.650 
be able to clean it with ease the older
they<00:02:10.550> get<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.120> worse<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.420> finish

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
they get and the worse the finish

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.690 
they get and the worse the finish
becomes<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.230> more<00:02:12.440> tenaciously<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.519> brake

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
becomes the more tenaciously the brake

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.370 
becomes the more tenaciously the brake
dust<00:02:13.910> holds<00:02:14.209> onto<00:02:14.360> there<00:02:14.599> so<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.050> can<00:02:15.230> do

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
dust holds onto there so if you can do

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.979 
dust holds onto there so if you can do
this<00:02:15.650> even<00:02:16.310> at<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:16.700> advanced<00:02:17.090> stage<00:02:17.420> it's

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
this even at this advanced stage it's

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.150 
this even at this advanced stage it's
gonna<00:02:18.110> make<00:02:18.290> your<00:02:18.380> life<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.650> lot<00:02:18.769> easier<00:02:18.830> to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
gonna make your life a lot easier to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.870 
gonna make your life a lot easier to
keep<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.430> wheel<00:02:19.670> clean<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:24.730> are<00:02:25.730> you

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
keep in that wheel clean so are you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.360 
keep in that wheel clean so are you
kidding<00:02:26.239> me
