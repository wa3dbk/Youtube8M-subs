how to install the GroupWise ascot
windows<00:00:09.370> client<00:00:09.760> from<00:00:09.940> a<00:00:10.059> Samba<00:00:10.510> share<00:00:10.780> on<00:00:11.049> our

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
windows client from a Samba share on our

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.200 
windows client from a Samba share on our
Linux<00:00:11.559> server<00:00:11.799> during<00:00:12.490> the<00:00:12.610> installation<00:00:12.820> on

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
Linux server during the installation on

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.000 
Linux server during the installation on
Linux<00:00:13.240> the<00:00:13.960> Windows<00:00:14.200> client<00:00:14.349> was<00:00:14.650> installed

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
Linux the Windows client was installed

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.230 
Linux the Windows client was installed
to<00:00:15.099> the<00:00:15.160> software<00:00:15.519> distribution<00:00:15.730> directory

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
to the software distribution directory

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.240 
to the software distribution directory
of<00:00:16.360> the<00:00:16.450> Linux<00:00:16.840> server<00:00:17.080> so<00:00:17.560> we<00:00:17.680> can<00:00:17.920> access

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
of the Linux server so we can access

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.400 
of the Linux server so we can access
that<00:00:18.670> for<00:00:19.150> installation<00:00:19.630> so<00:00:20.080> what<00:00:20.170> we<00:00:20.259> need<00:00:20.380> to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
that for installation so what we need to

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.279 
that for installation so what we need to
do<00:00:20.560> is<00:00:20.740> create<00:00:21.009> a<00:00:21.310> Samba<00:00:21.970> share<00:00:22.210> on<00:00:22.449> our<00:00:22.510> Linux

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
do is create a Samba share on our Linux

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.080 
do is create a Samba share on our Linux
server<00:00:23.500> so<00:00:23.890> I'm<00:00:24.130> on<00:00:24.250> our<00:00:24.279> linux<00:00:24.670> server

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
server so I'm on our linux server

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.840 
server so I'm on our linux server
I'll<00:00:25.510> run<00:00:26.500> yest<00:00:32.400> what<00:00:33.400> we'll<00:00:33.489> need<00:00:33.580> to<00:00:33.640> do<00:00:33.820> is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
I'll run yest what we'll need to do is

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.960 
I'll run yest what we'll need to do is
go<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.239> our<00:00:34.480> network<00:00:34.930> services<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:36.040> select

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
go to our network services and select

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.619 
go to our network services and select
the<00:00:37.090> Samba<00:00:37.540> server<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.579> what<00:00:43.030> we'll<00:00:43.120> do<00:00:43.300> is<00:00:43.450> we

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
the Samba server and what we'll do is we

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.150 
the Samba server and what we'll do is we
will<00:00:43.840> add<00:00:44.110> a<00:00:44.590> new<00:00:44.739> share<00:00:45.070> I'll<00:00:45.640> call<00:00:45.879> it<00:00:46.110> GW

nobody has access to it

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.080 
nobody has access to it
and<00:01:14.110> we'll<00:01:14.260> select<00:01:14.470> ok<00:01:15.010> we'll<00:01:15.820> finish<00:01:15.939> that

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
and we'll select ok we'll finish that

off<00:01:16.390> that<00:01:17.020> will<00:01:17.170> actually<00:01:17.470> mount<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.890> share

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
off that will actually mount the share

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.700 
off that will actually mount the share
at<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:18.670> point<00:01:18.869> I've<00:01:19.869> also<00:01:20.110> gone<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.500> created

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
at this point I've also gone and created

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.710 
at this point I've also gone and created
a<00:01:20.770> local<00:01:21.009> user<00:01:21.130> called<00:01:21.430> GW<00:01:21.909> ient<00:01:22.119> as<00:01:22.210> well<00:01:22.420> and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
a local user called GW ient as well and

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.200 
a local user called GW ient as well and
we'll<00:01:22.840> use<00:01:22.869> that<00:01:23.229> as<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.650> login<00:01:24.100> for<00:01:24.460> the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
we'll use that as the login for the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.999 
we'll use that as the login for the
share<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.250> I'm<00:01:27.430> going<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.650> open<00:01:29.650> up<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.860> terminal

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
share so I'm going to open up a terminal

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.219 
share so I'm going to open up a terminal
window<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.729> what<00:01:31.360> we<00:01:31.420> do<00:01:31.509> need<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.689> do<00:01:31.869> is<00:01:32.020> give

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
window and what we do need to do is give

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.910 
window and what we do need to do is give
the<00:01:32.439> GW<00:01:33.159> client<00:01:33.640> account<00:01:34.329> a<00:01:34.600> Samba<00:01:35.380> password

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
the GW client account a Samba password

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.620 
the GW client account a Samba password
so<00:01:36.490> I'm<00:01:36.549> just<00:01:36.640> going<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:36.850> become<00:01:36.939> root<00:01:37.329> of

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
so I'm just going to become root of

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
so I'm just going to become root of
turtle

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.050 

and<00:01:42.130> then<00:01:42.520> once<00:01:42.760> we're<00:01:42.910> there<00:01:42.940> it's<00:01:43.380> SMD

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and then once we're there it's SMD

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.490 
and then once we're there it's SMD
password<00:01:47.580> SMB<00:01:48.580> password<00:01:49.180> -<00:01:49.780> 8<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.170> add<00:01:50.290> the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
password SMB password - 8 to add the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.160 
password SMB password - 8 to add the
user<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:53.170> users<00:01:53.500> name<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:53.980> GW<00:01:54.400> client

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
user and the users name so GW client

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.420 
user and the users name so GW client
it's<00:01:56.170> gonna<00:01:56.260> ask<00:01:56.470> for<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.680> password<00:01:56.830> so<00:01:57.310> we'll

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
it's gonna ask for a password so we'll

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.130 
it's gonna ask for a password so we'll
put<00:01:57.580> our<00:01:57.730> super<00:01:58.150> functional<00:01:58.390> Vela<00:01:58.750> password

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
put our super functional Vela password

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.430 
put our super functional Vela password
in<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:03.340> establishes<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.120> share<00:02:04.440> I'll

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
in and that establishes the share I'll

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.590 
in and that establishes the share I'll
now<00:02:05.620> navigate<00:02:06.280> over<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.490> our<00:02:06.640> Windows<00:02:07.030> XP<00:02:07.360> box

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
now navigate over to our Windows XP box

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.730 
now navigate over to our Windows XP box
and<00:02:08.080> we'll<00:02:08.890> actually<00:02:09.100> create<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.850> want<00:02:10.420> to

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
and we'll actually create and want to

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.130 
and we'll actually create and want to
mount<00:02:11.740> a<00:02:12.040> mapping<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.270> sharepoint<00:02:13.840> so

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
mount a mapping to that sharepoint so

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.960 
mount a mapping to that sharepoint so
I'll<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.320> open<00:02:14.440> up<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:14.770> computer<00:02:14.880> we'll<00:02:15.880> go

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
I'll just open up my computer we'll go

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.570 
I'll just open up my computer we'll go
to<00:02:16.030> tools<00:02:16.270> map<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.080> network<00:02:17.290> drive<00:02:17.470> we'll<00:02:18.430> give

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
to tools map a network drive we'll give

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.110 
to tools map a network drive we'll give
it<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.760> drive<00:02:18.970> letter<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.800> G<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:21.340> GroupWise<00:02:21.730> and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
it a drive letter of G for GroupWise and
