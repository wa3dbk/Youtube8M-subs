now<00:00:00.780> you're<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.230> have<00:00:01.350> two<00:00:01.709> or<00:00:02.010> three

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.330 
now you're going to have two or three

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.599 
now you're going to have two or three
cases<00:00:03.330> right<00:00:03.570> here<00:00:03.780> either<00:00:04.200> all<00:00:04.620> these<00:00:04.950> edges

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
cases right here either all these edges

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.870 
cases right here either all these edges
are<00:00:05.850> solved<00:00:06.600> already<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.519> you're<00:00:08.519> done<00:00:08.730> with

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
are solved already and you're done with

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.480 
are solved already and you're done with
cube<00:00:09.210> or<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.679> be<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.070> where<00:00:11.370> it's

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
cube or it's going to be one where it's

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.440 
cube or it's going to be one where it's
like<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:12.230> where<00:00:13.230> there<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:14.120> slightly<00:00:15.120> on

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
like this where there are slightly on

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.890 
like this where there are slightly on
these<00:00:15.929> two<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.940> need<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> be<00:00:18.119> flipped<00:00:18.420> or<00:00:18.630> it's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
these two are need to be flipped or it's

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.870 
these two are need to be flipped or it's
going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> be<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.670> Shh<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:22.580> think<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.730> those

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
going to be on Shh I think about those

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.770 
going to be on Shh I think about those
roads<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.300> ya<00:00:25.050> ok<00:00:32.270> or<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.420> gonna<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.660> like

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
roads are ya ok or it's gonna be like

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.090 
roads are ya ok or it's gonna be like
this<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.260> they're<00:00:34.469> opposite<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:34.950> each

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
this where they're opposite from each

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.760 
this where they're opposite from each
other<00:00:35.280> either<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.630> there's<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.350> algorithm

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
other either way there's one algorithm

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.530 
other either way there's one algorithm
you<00:00:38.190> need<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.000> use<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.420> both<00:00:39.540> cases<00:00:39.840> um

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
you need that you use in both cases um

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.729 
you need that you use in both cases um
what<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
what you do is with this one is you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
what you do is with this one is you
start<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.539> will<00:00:45.719> show

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
start like this because this will show

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.470 
start like this because this will show
us<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.079> two<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> cases<00:00:47.120> start<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
us the two of the cases start like this

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.369 
us the two of the cases start like this
and<00:00:49.670> here's<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> algorithm<00:00:51.360> okay<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.199> this

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and here's the algorithm okay like this

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:06.520 
and here's the algorithm okay like this
up<00:00:55.250> over<00:00:57.920> middle<00:00:58.920> down<00:01:00.949> over<00:01:02.539> middle<00:01:03.539> up<00:01:04.970> over

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
up over middle down over middle up over

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.620 
up over middle down over middle up over
middle<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:08.750> over<00:01:10.460> middle<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:12.380> top<00:01:13.380> twice

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
middle down over middle up top twice

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.390 
middle down over middle up top twice
middle<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:16.670> then<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.880> rotate<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> cube

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
middle down then you rotate the cube

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.399 
middle down then you rotate the cube
this<00:01:20.400> direction<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> piece<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
this direction to the piece that's in

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.070 
this direction to the piece that's in
the<00:01:22.530> correct<00:01:22.860> place<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.659> need<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> do

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the correct place and then we need to do

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.990 
the correct place and then we need to do
is<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.500> rotate<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.670> exact

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
is you need to rotate just the exact

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
is you need to rotate just the exact
same<00:01:27.180> algorithm<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> minute<00:01:28.860> ago

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
same algorithm we use just a minute ago

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
same algorithm we use just a minute ago
where<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.970> piece<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.780> get<00:01:30.900> brought

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
where this piece is going to get brought

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.690 
where this piece is going to get brought
over<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.040> one's<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> get

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
over here this one's going to get

now you're at this point right here and

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.060 
now you're at this point right here and
I'm<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.649> get<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
I'm with this this is on this get to you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
I'm with this this is on this get to you
exactly<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.579> point<00:01:56.820> word<00:01:57.000> before<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.659> you're

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
exactly a point word before this you're

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.510 
exactly a point word before this you're
almost<00:01:58.079> solved<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.070> need<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
almost solved you just need to do that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.300 
almost solved you just need to do that
algorithm<00:02:00.030> i<00:02:00.270> did<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> second<00:02:00.899> ago<00:02:01.110> again<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
algorithm i did a second ago again you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.639 
algorithm i did a second ago again you
line<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.549> up<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.530> these

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
line it up so it's like this so these

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.190 
line it up so it's like this so these
two<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.670> crowd<00:02:06.540> away<00:02:06.810> from<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
two are right here a crowd away from you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.859 
two are right here a crowd away from you
and<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.950> side<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.729> right<00:02:09.479> side<00:02:09.629> over

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and on this side this right side over

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.520 
and on this side this right side over
here<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.920> middle<00:02:11.250> up

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
here you middle up

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.130 
here you middle up
over<00:02:13.530> middle<00:02:14.460> down<00:02:14.990> back<00:02:15.990> over<00:02:16.410> middle<00:02:17.400> up

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
over middle down back over middle up

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.210 
over middle down back over middle up
over<00:02:19.140> little<00:02:19.920> down<00:02:20.210> over<00:02:21.210> middle<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.220> top

over little down over middle up top

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.600 
over little down over middle up top
twice<00:02:23.720> little<00:02:24.720> back<00:02:24.960> down<00:02:25.200> rotate<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.400> cube

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
twice little back down rotate the cube

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.420 
twice little back down rotate the cube
and<00:02:27.390> then<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.560> use<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:28.800> algorithm<00:02:29.190> we

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and then you just use that algorithm we

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.000 
and then you just use that algorithm we
already<00:02:29.640> used<00:02:29.820> swing<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.930> piece<00:02:31.200> over<00:02:31.470> to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
already used swing this piece over to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.940 
already used swing this piece over to
hear<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.730> 12<00:02:33.360> year<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.500> there

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
hear this 12 year and this one there

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.090 
hear this 12 year and this one there
with<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.970> middle<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:39.410> middle<00:02:40.410> down<00:02:41.360> twice

back in place cube assault there's only

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.680 
back in place cube assault there's only
going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.520> one<00:02:47.610> other<00:02:47.970> case<00:02:48.270> for<00:02:48.600> this

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
going to be one other case for this

00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:01.820 
going to be one other case for this
bottom<00:02:49.080> layer<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.710> give<00:02:49.950> me<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.100> sec<00:03:00.830> there

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
bottom layer and I give me a sec there

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:11.240 
bottom layer and I give me a sec there
yeah<00:03:08.780> okay<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.650> only<00:03:10.770> other<00:03:10.980> case

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
yeah okay this is the only other case

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.880 
yeah okay this is the only other case
where<00:03:11.490> altomare<00:03:11.910> flipped<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.710> doesn't

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
where altomare flipped this it doesn't

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.580 
where altomare flipped this it doesn't
matter<00:03:14.190> where<00:03:14.460> you<00:03:14.490> do<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.670> algorithm<00:03:15.090> from

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
matter where you do that algorithm from

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.530 
matter where you do that algorithm from
you<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.770> on<00:03:17.040> whatever<00:03:17.430> way<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.120> like

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
you just on whatever way you do it like

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.860 
you just on whatever way you do it like
them<00:03:18.900> oh<00:03:20.209> yeah<00:03:21.209> I'll<00:03:21.330> do<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.570> one<00:03:21.690> more<00:03:21.750> time

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
them oh yeah I'll do it one more time

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.740 
them oh yeah I'll do it one more time
just<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.470> guys<00:03:22.560> can<00:03:22.650> get<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.310> sure

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
just so you guys can get it for sure

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.960 
just so you guys can get it for sure
middle<00:03:24.750> up<00:03:25.550> over<00:03:26.810> middle<00:03:27.810> down<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:29.400> bed<00:03:29.640> blue

middle up over middle down the bed blue

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.790 
middle up over middle down the bed blue
over<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.390> blue<00:03:30.570> again<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:32.310> over<00:03:32.700> middle<00:03:33.390> up

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
over the blue again so over middle up

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.060 
over the blue again so over middle up
over<00:03:34.800> middle<00:03:35.610> down<00:03:35.990> over<00:03:36.990> puts<00:03:37.709> these<00:03:37.830> back

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
over middle down over puts these back

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.860 
over middle down over puts these back
together<00:03:38.430> it'll<00:03:39.420> up<00:03:39.570> top<00:03:40.290> twice<00:03:40.530> middle<00:03:41.490> down

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
together it'll up top twice middle down

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.070 
together it'll up top twice middle down
rotate<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.200> cube<00:03:44.450> red<00:03:45.450> ones<00:03:45.660> already<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:45.990> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
rotate the cube red ones already in the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.480 
rotate the cube red ones already in the
right<00:03:46.200> spot<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.800> now<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:46.980> need<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.250> rotate

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
right spot so now you need to rotate

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.340 
right spot so now you need to rotate
these<00:03:47.880> three<00:03:48.180> again<00:03:48.390> which<00:03:49.110> is<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:50.010> over<00:03:51.350> mill

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
these three again which is the over mill

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.840 
these three again which is the over mill
down<00:03:52.670> back<00:03:53.670> over<00:03:54.120> little<00:03:54.990> up<00:03:55.140> over<00:03:58.850> my

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
down back over little up over my

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.540 
down back over little up over my
screensaver<00:04:00.300> winner<00:04:00.690> okay<00:04:01.470> I'm<00:04:01.650> sorry<00:04:02.220> and

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
screensaver winner okay I'm sorry and

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.970 
screensaver winner okay I'm sorry and
then<00:04:03.240> you're<00:04:03.450> back<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.660> here<00:04:04.200> which<00:04:04.620> is<00:04:04.800> where

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
then you're back to here which is where

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.949 
then you're back to here which is where
you're<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.370> doing<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:05.640> again<00:04:06.090> line<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.870> up

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
you're just doing this again line it up

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.970 
you're just doing this again line it up
like<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:09.410> then<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.830> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
like this and then you just do the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.979 
like this and then you just do the
algorithm<00:04:11.489> I'm<00:04:11.790> not<00:04:12.360> going<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.570> explain<00:04:12.720> it

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
algorithm I'm not going to explain it

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.050 
algorithm I'm not going to explain it
again<00:04:13.140> because<00:04:13.410> I'm<00:04:13.650> tired<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:17.250> yeah<00:04:17.400> that's

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
again because I'm tired so yeah that's

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.360 
again because I'm tired so yeah that's
how<00:04:18.270> to<00:04:18.330> solve<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.660> rubik's<00:04:18.959> cube<00:04:19.260> um<00:04:19.470> you're

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
probably gonna have a lot of questions

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.750 
probably gonna have a lot of questions
because<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:23.010> was<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.190> really<00:04:23.460> bad

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
because that was a really bad

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.210 
because that was a really bad
