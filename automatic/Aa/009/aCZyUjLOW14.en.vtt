this<00:00:17.880> game<00:00:18.119> play<00:00:18.390> at<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> stars<00:00:18.900> because<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
this game play at the stars because the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.380 
this game play at the stars because the
streak<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.039> them<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> Moab<00:00:20.850> doesn't<00:00:21.180> start

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
streak of them on the Moab doesn't start

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
streak of them on the Moab doesn't start
year<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.810> starts<00:00:22.699> well<00:00:23.699> when<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> game<00:00:24.090> took

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
year it starts well when the game took

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.060 
year it starts well when the game took
kind<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.480> slows<00:00:24.689> down<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.170> I'll<00:00:25.800> let<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:25.980> know

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
you can get every purchase it doesn't

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.820 
you can get every purchase it doesn't
matter<00:03:35.190> afterwards<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.410> another<00:03:37.410> important

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
matter afterwards and another important

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.350

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
thing is always to pick up another prime

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.199 
thing is always to pick up another prime
rib<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.750> as<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.080> can<00:03:40.230> see<00:03:40.260> i<00:03:40.410> picked<00:03:40.680> up<00:03:40.800> the

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209

rib and as you can see i picked up the
g36c<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:43.380> kind<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.620> got<00:03:43.680> really<00:03:44.270> really

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
g36c and that kind of got really really

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.449 
g36c and that kind of got really really
low<00:03:45.480> recoil<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.530> good<00:03:46.680> for<00:03:46.830> those<00:03:46.890> longer

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
low recoil so it's good for those longer

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.790 
low recoil so it's good for those longer
distances<00:03:47.970> even<00:03:48.180> though<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.480> mp7<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:49.320> really

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
distances even though the mp7 is really

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.410 
distances even though the mp7 is really
good<00:03:49.980> at<00:03:50.130> every<00:03:50.459> range<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.850> got<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> guy<00:03:51.239> walk

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
spores are really weird in this game and

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.310 
spores are really weird in this game and
you<00:04:08.970> should<00:04:09.150> always<00:04:09.330> be<00:04:09.630> on<00:04:09.780> your<00:04:09.900> guard<00:04:10.050> at
