plug<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.049> only<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
plug in the only one that we know it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
plug in the only one that we know it
won't<00:01:41.220> work<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> h2o<00:01:42.450> audio<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
won't work with is the h2o audio and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.950 
won't work with is the h2o audio and
that's<00:01:43.770> simply<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.159> h2o<00:01:45.030> has<00:01:45.420> developed

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that's simply because h2o has developed

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.649 
that's simply because h2o has developed
their<00:01:46.110> case<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.680> proprietary<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.790> only

their case to be proprietary and only

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.719 
their case to be proprietary and only
work<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.140> their<00:01:49.380> own<00:01:49.530> headphones<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
work with their own headphones so it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.190 
work with their own headphones so it
won't<00:01:50.939> work<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.240> h2o<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:52.049> work

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
won't work with h2o but it will work

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990 
won't work with h2o but it will work
with<00:01:52.350> all<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> other<00:01:52.770> cases<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.340> and
