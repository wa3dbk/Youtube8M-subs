Hi everyone !

00:00:01.603 --> 00:00:03.599
Today I am with Céline ! 

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:04.374
Hi !

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:06.985
At her house ! 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.360
We are gonna watch the MV of Block B's sub unit

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.280
which is called Bastarz

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.340
and their song Zero For Conduct

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.300
Céline already watched it

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:31.685
and she lloved it !

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:34.574
But I didn't watch it because I didn't have the time --'

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:37.459
Let's go !

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.060
It's a bit loud, isn't it ?

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.220
It's B-Bomb

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.480
I don't know them... Just P.O

00:01:21.692 --> 00:01:24.892
We're gonna see girls like this during the whole MV ?

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.892
Yeah, all the time... But there is him too ^^

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.880
They're here too so you don't care about those girls

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.540
Oh that's cool !

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.109
But this is very weird !

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:52.294
How he is dressed ?

00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:55.577
No, the face that comes out... This thing !

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:02.754
It's embarassing...

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:06.635
Listen to the music !

00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:31.735
His name was written behind him

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.335
It was hard to miss ! 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800
It's very embarassing...

00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:05.854
Yeah... With their plastic clothes...

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:11.275
Why is he wearing a bathrobes ?

00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:17.035
We don't see their face ! 

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.265
Yeah, just their breasts and their ass

00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:37.738
Is he a vampire ?

00:03:49.814 --> 00:03:51.814
That's it !

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.540
I hope this Mv haven't got any sense because I don't get it

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.475
me neitheir, don't worry

00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:59.200
We watched it for their music and their face

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.840
So yeah that was cool !

00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:16.107
But I don't really like those girls..

00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:20.994
I don't really enjoy seeing them ^^

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.240
The MV was weird... But it's like Block B's

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:30.396
The music was awesome !

00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:41.687
So ! Yeah I'm really happy of this MV

00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:44.475
They made a mini album ?

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:51.097
Yeah. They released a video with the tracklist

00:04:51.097 --> 00:04:52.354
Is it good ?

00:04:52.842 --> 00:04:54.842
Yeah, it seems to ^^

00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:58.175
So another album I have to download...

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.480
I really really really enjoy this MV !

00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:15.868
They were in their style, in Block B's world

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.060
So I hope you liked the video !

00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:29.275
I hope you liked the MV too !

00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:31.477
Thanks for everything !

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:34.596
Hope you enjoy my video about the Japan Touch !

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.180
