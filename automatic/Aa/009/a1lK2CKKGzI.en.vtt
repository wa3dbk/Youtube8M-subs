00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.890
Counter Strike Global Offensive is a first
person competitive game where terrorists play

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.440
against counter terrorists. There's more to
it than that, but that is determined by the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.390
game mode you're playing, which can be chosen
from the main menu.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.870
I'll now go through the game types. You can
skip bits if you look in the description of

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.850
this video.
The main game-style of CSGO can be split into

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.170
two different map types. The most popular
is defuse and if you happen to watch a competitive

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.590
match between pro teams, the chances are it's
this mode that's being played. Terrorists

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.160
start with a bomb and can choose one of two
bombsites to plant it at. The CTs start nearer

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.420
to those sites and must defend. Either team
can win by eliminating the other team completely,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.829
or by detonating or defusing the bomb. If
time runs out, Counter Terrorists win.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.070
Hostage rescue maps are opposite. Terrorists
start with two hostages which the Counter

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.620
Terrorists must reach, rescue and return to
their start zone- they only need to save one

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.872
to win the round. Once again you can also
win by killing the other team, and the terrorists

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:55.600
can run down the clock and win on time.
These two map types can be played casually

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.160
or competitively. Casual is played on a 10
v 10 server. There's no team killing, it's

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.860
far more forgiving and you only have to reach
8 rounds to win. Competitive mode is ranked,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.990
meaning that the game puts you in a 5 v 5
game with balanced teams (in theory!) and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.280
your score is determined by how well you perform
and whether you win. If you die, you remain

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.759
dead until the current round is over, which
can take up to several minutes. After each

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.170
round, depending on how you've done and which
team won, you're awarded money for bigger

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.229
and better weapons and items. You play on
one side for 15 rounds and then switch to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.030
the other, with the first team to 16 winning
the game. Play enough games in this mode and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.219
you get a badge to show you how perform compared
with everybody else in the game. This rank

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.409
can go up or down, depending on whether you
get better or worse. More on this in a later

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:48.520
video- it's best not to jump straight into
this mode if you know nothing about the game.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:02:26.170
There are 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.659
several other modes supported which tend to
favour more casual, drop-in play. These are

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.209
Deathmatch, Demolition and Arms Race.
Deathmatch is simplest. If you die, you spawn

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.360
again somewhere in your level. You can choose
which weapons to use and you must kill everybody

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.830
on the other team. The action is fast-paced
and it's a great mode should you want to practice

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.110
for a proper match.
In Demolition there's a single bombsite and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.820
the maps are smaller. It's like a more laid-back
version of Defuse and is a race to reach 11

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.910
wins first. If you die then you remain dead
but if you manage to kill somebody then your

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.110
weapon is upgraded for the next round. The
weapons get worse before they get better but

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.380
get kills most rounds and you can gain access
to some powerful sniper rifles.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.320
And finally, there's Arms Race. It's like
deathmatch only you start with a certain weapon

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.370
and work through the list by killing people.
The final task is to knife an enemy which

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.319
finishes the game and wins it for your team.
But don't expect your team to be pleased with

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.760
you. It's every man for himself in this mode!
A recent update made it so that the top player

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.379
can be seen by others through walls, making
it drastically more difficult for one person

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.900
to pull ahead of others in this mode. I personally
find Arms Race very frustrating but there's

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.870
been a thriving community for this mode for
a number of years, well before CS GO even

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.700
came out.
Counter Strike is a big game and it's growing

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.540
rapidly. It gets regular updates and new features
and is a great game to get into. There's always

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.730
a match to be played and I have had many memorable
experiences in my time playing it. I wish

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.290
you all the best in yours!
What's the next step? I have a basic tutorial

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.990
on how to aim and what health and armour does,
which I recommend viewing if you're wanting

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.599
to get started with the game. Just click on
it to watch it. It's right there. Just wanting

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.059
to be clicked. Go on... you know you want
to!
