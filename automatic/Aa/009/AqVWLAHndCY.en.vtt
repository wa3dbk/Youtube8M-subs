the pressures of doing an annualised

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.270 
the pressures of doing an annualised
cycle<00:00:43.420> I<00:00:43.540> think<00:00:43.780> makes<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.440> game<00:00:44.620> only<00:00:44.920> better

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280

you<00:00:45.490> know<00:00:45.610> on<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.970> development<00:00:46.420> side<00:00:46.450> you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
you know on the development side you

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.120 
you know on the development side you
just<00:00:46.960> love<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.320> have<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.470> time<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:47.920> polish

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
just love to have that time to polish

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.770 
just love to have that time to polish
and<00:00:48.490> tune<00:00:48.700> and<00:00:49.000> I<00:00:49.270> think<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.600> game<00:00:49.750> is

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
and tune and I think the game is

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.650 
and tune and I think the game is
actually<00:00:50.020> better<00:00:50.320> for<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:51.360> accessibility<00:00:52.360> for

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
actually better for it accessibility for

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.450 
actually better for it accessibility for
UFC<00:00:52.900> Undisputed<00:00:53.380> 3<00:00:53.410> has<00:00:53.680> been<00:00:53.860> huge<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.310> mean

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
sort of look as well so I think the game

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.940 
sort of look as well so I think the game
is<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.180> be<00:03:02.269> better<00:03:02.480> for<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.959> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
transition system was certainly one of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.319 
transition system was certainly one of
the<00:03:05.930> more<00:03:06.440> difficult<00:03:06.620> or<00:03:07.160> nuance<00:03:07.549> things<00:03:08.030> in

Telegraph<00:04:17.989> or<00:04:18.229> faint<00:04:18.440> transition<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.609> it's<00:04:20.090> a

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
Telegraph or faint transition so it's a

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.240 
Telegraph or faint transition so it's a
good<00:04:20.389> balance<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:21.049> allowing<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.889> get<00:04:22.040> into

the game while still keeping the
hardcore<00:04:24.740> at<00:04:25.220> an<00:04:25.340> advantage<00:04:25.699> I<00:04:26.060> think<00:04:26.270> when

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
hardcore at an advantage I think when

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.990 
hardcore at an advantage I think when
new<00:04:26.690> users<00:04:27.139> play<00:04:27.380> UFC<00:04:27.650> Undisputed<00:04:28.220> 3<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.699> think

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
new users play UFC Undisputed 3 I think

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.680 
new users play UFC Undisputed 3 I think
it'll<00:04:29.150> be<00:04:29.240> very<00:04:30.370> clear<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.550> them<00:04:31.669> how<00:04:31.910> easy<00:04:32.360> it

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
it'll be very clear to them how easy it

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.300 
it'll be very clear to them how easy it
is<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.840> play<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.350> game<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.740> mean<00:04:33.889> it's<00:04:34.100> really

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
is to play the game I mean it's really

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.950 
is to play the game I mean it's really
got<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.729> pick-up-and-play<00:04:35.180> aspect<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.930> it

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
got that pick-up-and-play aspect to it

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.810 
got that pick-up-and-play aspect to it
especially<00:04:36.169> with<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.770> new<00:04:36.820> alternate

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
especially with the new alternate

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.760 
especially with the new alternate
control<00:04:38.180> scheme<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.690> think<00:04:39.139> new<00:04:39.229> users<00:04:39.590> will

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770

we've<00:04:44.840> done<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.020> lot<00:04:45.229> of<00:04:45.260> tuning<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.889> in<00:04:46.100> just<00:04:46.310> in

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
we've done a lot of tuning to in just in

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.400 
we've done a lot of tuning to in just in
terms<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.760> where<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.360> sweet<00:04:47.630> spot<00:04:47.900> is<00:04:47.930> for

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
terms of where the sweet spot is for

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.279 
terms of where the sweet spot is for
standing<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.130> striking<00:04:49.910> and<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.539> the<00:04:51.050> game

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
standing and striking and so the game

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.290 
standing and striking and so the game
tends<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.979> just<00:04:52.190> look<00:04:52.340> good<00:04:52.580> no<00:04:52.880> matter<00:04:52.910> what

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
tends to just look good no matter what

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.060 
tends to just look good no matter what
situation<00:04:53.510> you're<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.169> I<00:04:54.590> think<00:04:54.979> the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
situation you're in I think the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.439 
situation you're in I think the
alternate<00:04:55.520> control<00:04:55.850> scheme<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.240> going<00:04:56.389> to

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
alternate control scheme is going to

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.000 
alternate control scheme is going to
help<00:04:56.630> people<00:04:56.960> get<00:04:57.080> out<00:04:57.139> of<00:04:57.440> frustrating

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
help people get out of frustrating

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.850 
help people get out of frustrating
situations<00:04:58.639> hardened<00:04:59.570> undisputed<00:05:00.530> veteran

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
situations hardened undisputed veteran

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.070 
situations hardened undisputed veteran
who's<00:05:01.039> played<00:05:01.280> every<00:05:01.550> game<00:05:01.580> since<00:05:02.000> 2009<00:05:02.810> is

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
who's played every game since 2009 is

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.350 
who's played every game since 2009 is
just<00:05:03.680> going<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.889> see<00:05:04.070> that<00:05:04.280> this<00:05:04.430> is<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:05.150> best

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
just going to see that this is the best

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.180 
just going to see that this is the best
version<00:05:05.900> of<00:05:05.990> undisputed<00:05:06.320> I<00:05:06.740> mean<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.039> game

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
version of undisputed I mean the game

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.040 
version of undisputed I mean the game
looks<00:05:07.460> better<00:05:07.699> it<00:05:08.210> plays<00:05:08.479> better<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:08.870> mean

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
looks better it plays better I mean

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.540 
looks better it plays better I mean
we've<00:05:09.169> always<00:05:09.320> been<00:05:09.560> running<00:05:09.830> at<00:05:09.949> 60<00:05:10.220> frames<00:05:10.250> a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
we've always been running at 60 frames a

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.250 
we've always been running at 60 frames a
second<00:05:10.940> but<00:05:11.090> for<00:05:11.330> some<00:05:11.479> reason<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.870> just<00:05:11.900> feels

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
second but for some reason it just feels

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.340 
second but for some reason it just feels
faster<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:13.010> more<00:05:13.130> Perez<00:05:13.750> so<00:05:14.750> I<00:05:14.780> think<00:05:14.900> it's

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
faster and more Perez so I think it's

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.020 
faster and more Perez so I think it's
just<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.710> amount<00:05:16.130> of<00:05:16.280> tuning<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:16.789> we<00:05:16.910> were

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
just the amount of tuning that we were

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.900 
just the amount of tuning that we were
able<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.330> do<00:05:17.570> and<00:05:17.810> just<00:05:17.870> how<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:19.460> the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
able to do and just how the the the

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.240 
able to do and just how the the the
combat<00:05:20.360> has<00:05:20.599> just<00:05:20.900> evolved<00:05:21.410> now<00:05:21.740> you<00:05:21.800> know<00:05:22.099> in

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
combat has just evolved now you know in

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.370 
combat has just evolved now you know in
its<00:05:22.400> fifth<00:05:22.789> year<00:05:22.910> of<00:05:23.090> development<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.900> think

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
its fifth year of development I think

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.320 
its fifth year of development I think
the<00:05:24.610> undisputed<00:05:25.610> veteran<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.030> going<00:05:26.150> to<00:05:26.210> be

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
the undisputed veteran is going to be
