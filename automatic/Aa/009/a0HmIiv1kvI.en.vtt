away<00:02:50.060> from<00:02:50.120> 200<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.760> 12,000<00:02:52.760> on<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.510> which<00:02:53.720> is

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
away from 200 to 12,000 on this which is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.330 
away from 200 to 12,000 on this which is
a<00:02:53.900> ridiculous<00:02:54.650> amount<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.980> really<00:02:55.190> is

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
a ridiculous amount it really is

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.190 
a ridiculous amount it really is
ridiculous<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:56.510> obviously<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.900> could<00:02:57.020> use

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
ridiculous it obviously you could use

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.050 
ridiculous it obviously you could use
your<00:02:57.350> left<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.650> right<00:02:57.800> click<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.460> have<00:02:58.670> your

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
your left and right click you have your

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.510 
your left and right click you have your
DPA<00:02:59.420> DPI<00:02:59.990> it<00:03:00.110> down<00:03:00.380> button<00:03:00.770> there<00:03:00.950> which<00:03:01.490> is

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
DPA DPI it down button there which is

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.630 
DPA DPI it down button there which is
that<00:03:02.270> one<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.080> there<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:04.220> also<00:03:04.400> have

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
that one that one there you also have

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.940 
that one that one there you also have
your<00:03:04.790> dpi<00:03:05.120> up<00:03:05.360> sorry<00:03:06.260> one<00:03:06.470> sec<00:03:06.650> one<00:03:06.770> sec<00:03:06.920> one

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
your dpi up sorry one sec one sec one

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.980 
your dpi up sorry one sec one sec one
sec<00:03:07.160> I've<00:03:07.310> leaves<00:03:07.520> click<00:03:07.790> type<00:03:07.940> thing<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.300> you

sec I've leaves click type thing so you

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.630 
sec I've leaves click type thing so you
have<00:03:09.080> your<00:03:09.110> dpi<00:03:09.470> down<00:03:09.770> if<00:03:09.950> UD<00:03:10.160> q<00:03:10.280> up<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.520> you'll

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
have your dpi down if UD q up and you'll

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.760 
have your dpi down if UD q up and you'll
serve<00:03:10.820> fewer<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.840> basically<00:03:12.110> switch<00:03:12.380> profile

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
serve fewer you basically switch profile

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.840 
serve fewer you basically switch profile
says<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.490> free<00:03:13.640> different

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
software that you get with the lobby to

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.710 
software that you get with the lobby to
gamers<00:05:09.640> shows<00:05:10.090> your<00:05:10.240> week<00:05:10.330> on<00:05:10.450> different

gamers shows your week on different

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.610 
gamers shows your week on different
buttons<00:05:10.960> there<00:05:11.140> so<00:05:11.290> you<00:05:11.350> can<00:05:11.470> select

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
buttons there so you can select

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
buttons there so you can select
different<00:05:11.740> buttons<00:05:12.190> and<00:05:12.340> stuff<00:05:12.490> for

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
different buttons and stuff for

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.310 
different buttons and stuff for
different<00:05:12.880> programmable<00:05:13.300> macros<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:13.840> you

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
different programmable macros and you

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.600 
different programmable macros and you
will<00:05:14.470> see<00:05:14.560> what<00:05:14.650> your<00:05:14.740> dpi<00:05:14.980> says<00:05:15.220> Davis<00:05:15.520> you

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
will see what your dpi says Davis you

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.370 
will see what your dpi says Davis you
can<00:05:15.760> change<00:05:15.970> literally<00:05:16.240> anywhere<00:05:16.630> from<00:05:16.720> 200

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
can change literally anywhere from 200

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.530 
can change literally anywhere from 200
to<00:05:17.410> 12,000<00:05:18.190> so<00:05:18.760> you<00:05:18.820> got<00:05:18.940> diff<00:05:19.060> five<00:05:19.300> different

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
to 12,000 so you got diff five different

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.210 
to 12,000 so you got diff five different
levels<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:19.780> DPI<00:05:20.080> you've<00:05:20.260> got<00:05:20.380> different<00:05:20.500> 1<00:05:21.070> 2<00:05:21.190> 3

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
levels of DPI you've got different 1 2 3

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.580 
levels of DPI you've got different 1 2 3
profiles<00:05:21.700> you<00:05:22.600> can't<00:05:22.810> see<00:05:22.930> a<00:05:22.960> sign<00:05:23.230> your<00:05:23.380> shift

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
profiles you can't see a sign your shift

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.770 
profiles you can't see a sign your shift
key<00:05:23.830> just<00:05:24.700> there<00:05:24.910> so<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.180> can<00:05:25.300> assign<00:05:25.480> shift

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
key just there so you can assign shift

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.930 
key just there so you can assign shift
key<00:05:25.930> with<00:05:26.050> that<00:05:26.340> initially<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.430> can<00:05:27.580> click

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
key with that initially you can click

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.220 
key with that initially you can click
through<00:05:28.060> all<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.270> them<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.540> basically<00:05:28.990> switch

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
through all of them and basically switch

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.130 
through all of them and basically switch
so<00:05:29.350> ever<00:05:29.500> DP<00:05:29.800> is<00:05:29.890> setting<00:05:30.400> his<00:05:30.550> your<00:05:30.730> preferred

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
so ever DP is setting his your preferred

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.910 
so ever DP is setting his your preferred
memory<00:05:32.140> and<00:05:32.260> look<00:05:32.380> on<00:05:32.500> this<00:05:32.590> what's<00:05:32.830> the

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
of tracking for that mouse pad obviously

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.560 
of tracking for that mouse pad obviously
they've<00:06:47.340> got<00:06:47.460> ones<00:06:47.580> already<00:06:47.700> NSE<00:06:48.060> or<00:06:48.240> coughing

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
they've got ones already NSE or coughing

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.670 
they've got ones already NSE or coughing
they<00:06:48.630> got<00:06:48.750> hard<00:06:48.990> one<00:06:49.200> which<00:06:49.320> the<00:06:49.410> logs<00:06:49.560> that

they got hard one which the logs that

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.990 
they got hard one which the logs that
will<00:06:49.800> not<00:06:49.890> a<00:06:49.950> factory<00:06:50.220> default<00:06:50.610> but<00:06:50.910> you<00:06:50.940> can
