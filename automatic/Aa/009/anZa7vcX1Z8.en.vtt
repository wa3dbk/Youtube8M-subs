this version of Android so this the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.490 
this version of Android so this the
first<00:00:14.910> time<00:00:15.150> Google<00:00:15.540> has<00:00:15.690> built<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.139> its<00:00:16.289> own

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500

battery<00:00:17.400> saving<00:00:17.730> tech<00:00:18.140> usually<00:00:19.140> OEMs<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
battery saving tech usually OEMs have to

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.580 
battery saving tech usually OEMs have to
do<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:21.330> Nexus<00:00:21.689> devices<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.470> sort

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
do this and Nexus devices have just sort

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.480

the<00:00:53.219> device<00:00:53.579> will<00:00:54.649> basically<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:56.190> less<00:00:56.550> fun<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the device will basically be less fun to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.439 
the device will basically be less fun to
use<00:00:57.239> background<00:00:57.930> tasks<00:00:58.739> won't<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.449> won't

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
use background tasks won't really won't

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.399 
use background tasks won't really won't
really<00:01:00.629> operate<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.289> don't<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.710> data<00:01:01.980> sync

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
really operate you don't get data sync

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.010 
really operate you don't get data sync
animations<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.650> away<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.360> ends<00:01:06.960> up

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
animations go away and it just ends up

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
animations go away and it just ends up
quite<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> bit<00:01:07.799> slower<00:01:08.180> also<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> brightness

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
quite a bit slower also the brightness

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
quite a bit slower also the brightness
will<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:10.200> way<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.010> apparently

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
will go way way down so apparently

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
will go way way down so apparently
Google<00:01:11.820> decided<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.900> enough<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
Google decided that this was enough of a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.899 
Google decided that this was enough of a
problem<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.250> wanted<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> make<00:01:14.700> sure

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
problem that they wanted to make sure

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.630 
problem that they wanted to make sure
people<00:01:15.119> knew<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.799> were<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.250> battery

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
people knew that they were in battery

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.330 
people knew that they were in battery
saver<00:01:18.000> mode<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.869> when<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> turn<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.460 

see<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.610> turns<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.390> status<00:01:24.840> bar<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> nav

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
see it turns the status bar and the nav

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.880 
see it turns the status bar and the nav
bar<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.280> obnoxious<00:01:26.490> orange<00:01:27.330> color

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
bar this really obnoxious orange color

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.350 
bar this really obnoxious orange color
and<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.070> stays<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:30.079> every<00:01:31.079> place<00:01:31.320> in

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
and it stays like that every place in

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.399 
and it stays like that every place in
the<00:01:33.360> OS<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.740> probably<00:01:37.950> tell<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:39.409> all

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the OS so you can probably tell like all

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.210 
the OS so you can probably tell like all
of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> neat<00:01:41.130> animations<00:01:41.909> are<00:01:42.770> are<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.829> sort

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
of the neat animations are are just sort

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.760 
of the neat animations are are just sort
of<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:45.560> not<00:01:46.560> happening<00:01:47.040> anymore

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
of not not happening anymore

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.429 
of not not happening anymore
but<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.000> will<00:01:51.299> obviously<00:01:51.810> save<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
but you know you will obviously save a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.179 
but you know you will obviously save a
bit<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> battery<00:01:53.700> power<00:01:53.790> doing<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:56.070> you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
bit of battery power doing that and you

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.399 
bit of battery power doing that and you
also<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.299> notification<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.170> there

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
also have this the notification up there

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.889 
also have this the notification up there
that<00:01:59.280> tells<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.060> battery<00:02:00.479> stay<00:02:00.630> resign

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that tells you that battery stay resign

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.520 
that tells you that battery stay resign
let<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> turn<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.829> off<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.579> tap<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.469> you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
let you turn it off the tap so if you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.810 
let you turn it off the tap so if you
don't<00:02:04.649> want<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> deal<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.070> turning<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.579> on

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
don't want to deal with turning this on

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.350 
don't want to deal with turning this on
automatically<00:02:06.630> every<00:02:07.049> time<00:02:07.429> or<00:02:08.429> manually<00:02:09.209> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
automatically every time or manually you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.630 
automatically every time or manually you
can<00:02:09.509> turn<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.810> automatically<00:02:10.440> at<00:02:11.069> either<00:02:11.280> 5<00:02:11.610> or

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
can turn on automatically at either 5 or

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.950 
can turn on automatically at either 5 or
15%

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
15%

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.660 
15%
hurry<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:16.380> maybe<00:02:16.620> reasonable<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.370> to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
hurry so it's maybe reasonable just to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.490 
hurry so it's maybe reasonable just to
turn<00:02:17.850> on<00:02:18.090> at<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.200> one<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.410> these

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
turn on at you know at one of these

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.320 
turn on at you know at one of these
levels<00:02:19.710> because<00:02:20.490> at<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.730> point<00:02:20.910> you

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
levels because at that point you

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.670 
levels because at that point you
