human culture climate change and from my

human culture climate change and from my
side<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.520> understood<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> 70s<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
side of it I understood in the 70s that

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.219 
side of it I understood in the 70s that
if<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.640> did<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> way<00:01:18.420> things<00:01:18.479> were

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
if we did not like the way things were

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.710 
if we did not like the way things were
going<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.950> society<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.820> needed<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.330> find

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
going in the society we needed to find

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.609 
going in the society we needed to find
positive<00:01:22.490> alternatives<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.439> one<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
positive alternatives to that and one of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.679 
positive alternatives to that and one of
the<00:01:25.740> alternatives<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.610> building<00:01:27.060> community

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the alternatives is building community

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.010 
the alternatives is building community
and<00:01:28.310> guy<00:01:29.310> university<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> set<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
and guy university is set up as a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.270 
and guy university is set up as a
dispersed<00:01:31.770> model<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.909> enable<00:01:33.180> us<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
dispersed model that will enable us to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.640 
dispersed model that will enable us to
have<00:01:35.280> regional<00:01:36.090> centers<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.840> local

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
have regional centers in local

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.310 
have regional centers in local
communities<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.659> localize

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
communities so that we can localize

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.280 
communities so that we can localize
higher<00:01:40.619> education<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> Sandel<00:01:42.420> our<00:01:42.630> most

imagine that there's a very wide variety
of<00:02:41.710> projects<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.250> means<00:02:42.490> doing<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.510> order<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
do that so for example I might need to

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.760 
do that so for example I might need to
learn<00:02:45.670> about<00:02:45.790> how<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.660> grow<00:02:46.960> all<00:02:47.290> year<00:02:47.650> round

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
food crops in an urban setting so I'll

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.040

project to the next in what we can see

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.540 
project to the next in what we can see
is<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.580> coherent<00:04:04.090> pattern<00:04:05.310> which<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.430> would

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
is a coherent pattern which you would

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.070 
is a coherent pattern which you would
not<00:04:06.640> be<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.239> couldn't<00:04:07.510> do<00:04:07.630> that<00:04:07.780> in<00:04:07.989> a

organize<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.490> regional<00:04:35.120> center<00:04:35.540> those<00:04:36.170> people

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
organize a regional center those people

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.110 
organize a regional center those people
need<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.860> go<00:04:37.010> through<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.310> guy<00:04:37.520> university

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
need to go through a guy university

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.930 
need to go through a guy university
program<00:04:38.600> so<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.170> they<00:04:39.730> understand<00:04:40.730> the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
program so that they understand the

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.440 
program so that they understand the
quality<00:04:41.480> sharing<00:04:41.870> systems<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.740> know<00:04:43.070> how<00:04:43.340> to

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
quality sharing systems and know how to

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.150 
quality sharing systems and know how to
operate<00:04:44.450> in<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.750> way<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.110> gives<00:04:45.380> increased

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
operate in the way that gives increased

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.510 
operate in the way that gives increased
credibility<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.210> University<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.350> so<00:04:49.130> we

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
credibility to that University and so we

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.930 
credibility to that University and so we
now<00:04:49.820> have<00:04:50.120> two<00:04:50.450> operating<00:04:50.900> regional<00:04:51.440> centers

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
now have two operating regional centers

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.850

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
coherence to the 30 or 40 year old

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.260 
coherence to the 30 or 40 year old
movements<00:05:40.340> that<00:05:40.430> have<00:05:40.520> been<00:05:40.670> working<00:05:41.030> on<00:05:41.120> this

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
movements that have been working on this

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.790 
movements that have been working on this
sort<00:05:41.510> of<00:05:42.250> regenerating<00:05:43.250> human<00:05:43.820> cultural<00:05:44.150> work

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
sort of regenerating human cultural work

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.620 
sort of regenerating human cultural work
over<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.890> past<00:05:46.130> and<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.910> have<00:05:47.180> tended<00:05:47.480> I've

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
over the past and I have tended I've

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.870 
over the past and I have tended I've
tended<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.380> be<00:05:48.520> isolated<00:05:49.520> from<00:05:49.610> each<00:05:49.730> other

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
tended to be isolated from each other

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.120 
tended to be isolated from each other
and<00:05:50.120> to<00:05:50.480> be<00:05:50.600> somewhat<00:05:51.020> individualistic<00:05:52.010> in

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
and to be somewhat individualistic in

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.360 
and to be somewhat individualistic in
their<00:05:52.280> approach<00:05:52.640> so<00:05:53.300> guy<00:05:53.990> university<00:05:54.470> is<00:05:54.650> part

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
their approach so guy university is part

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.880 
their approach so guy university is part
of<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:56.060> new<00:05:56.210> paradigm<00:05:56.780> of<00:05:57.080> global

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
of the new paradigm of global

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.970 
of the new paradigm of global
collaboration<00:05:58.690> in<00:05:59.690> order<00:05:59.810> to<00:06:00.080> provide<00:06:00.440> a

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
collaboration in order to provide a

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.320 
collaboration in order to provide a
coherent<00:06:02.290> alternative<00:06:03.290> to<00:06:04.330> neoliberal

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
coherent alternative to neoliberal

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.930 
coherent alternative to neoliberal
capitalism
