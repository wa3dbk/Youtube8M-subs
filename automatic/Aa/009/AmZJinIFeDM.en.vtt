00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.979 
we're getting a thousand dollars back on
our<00:03:01.500> school<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:03.120> next<00:03:03.420> one<00:03:03.569> in<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.750> line<00:03:03.959> I

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
our school the next one in the line I

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.839 
our school the next one in the line I
know<00:03:04.170> says<00:03:04.560> add<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.799> classroom<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.579> school

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
know says add a classroom to a school

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.490 
know says add a classroom to a school
and<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.659> twenty-thousand-dollar

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
and it's like a twenty-thousand-dollar

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.349 
and it's like a twenty-thousand-dollar
reward<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.159> I<00:03:08.220> think<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.459> classroom<00:03:08.879> costs<00:03:09.180> 10

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
reward and I think a classroom costs 10

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.149 
reward and I think a classroom costs 10
or<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.659> costs<00:03:09.840> 20<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.409> it's<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:10.709> adding<00:03:10.980> a

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
or it costs 20 so it's like adding a

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.039 
or it costs 20 so it's like adding a
free<00:03:11.370> classroom<00:03:11.819> so<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:12.390> you're<00:03:12.599> planning<00:03:12.959> on

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
free classroom so if you're planning on

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.050 
free classroom so if you're planning on
doing<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.380> great<00:03:13.620> school<00:03:13.950> anyway<00:03:14.489> which<00:03:14.760> most

here that's taking up one of the spots

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.149 
here that's taking up one of the spots
that<00:05:39.009> a<00:05:39.430> person<00:05:40.090> could<00:05:40.300> use<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.960> park<00:05:41.199> for<00:05:41.440> so

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
prevent that from happening again one or

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.020 
prevent that from happening again one or
two<00:05:48.130> of<00:05:48.219> them<00:05:48.280> is<00:05:48.400> not<00:05:48.520> going<00:05:48.639> to<00:05:48.699> be<00:05:48.789> a<00:05:48.820> big

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
two of them is not going to be a big

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.969 
two of them is not going to be a big
problem<00:05:49.180> but<00:05:49.509> if<00:05:49.599> you<00:05:49.690> start<00:05:49.930> getting<00:05:50.110> 30<00:05:50.560> 40

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
problem but if you start getting 30 40

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.010 
problem but if you start getting 30 40
50<00:05:51.099> in<00:05:51.400> here<00:05:51.639> this<00:05:51.759> park<00:05:52.060> is<00:05:52.210> very<00:05:52.449> ineffective

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
50 in here this park is very ineffective

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.320 
50 in here this park is very ineffective
it's<00:05:53.860> also<00:05:54.039> very<00:05:54.310> difficult<00:05:54.849> to<00:05:54.940> get<00:05:55.060> rid<00:05:55.300> of

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
it's also very difficult to get rid of

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.149 
it's also very difficult to get rid of
homeless<00:05:55.780> so<00:05:55.990> they<00:05:56.139> stay<00:05:56.409> around<00:05:56.620> for<00:05:56.919> a<00:05:56.949> long

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
homeless so they stay around for a long

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.459 
homeless so they stay around for a long
time<00:05:57.509> eventually<00:05:58.509> though<00:05:58.690> they<00:05:58.930> will<00:05:59.139> just

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
time eventually though they will just

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.969 
time eventually though they will just
leave<00:05:59.919> the<00:06:00.070> map<00:06:00.280> or<00:06:00.460> die<00:06:01.650> so<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:02.710> don't<00:06:02.889> have

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
leave the map or die so you don't have

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.620 
leave the map or die so you don't have
to<00:06:03.159> worry<00:06:03.310> about<00:06:03.460> them<00:06:03.820> if<00:06:03.969> you<00:06:04.090> have<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.270> huge

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
to worry about them if you have a huge

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.120 
to worry about them if you have a huge
population<00:06:04.960> of<00:06:05.409> homeless<00:06:05.590> people<00:06:05.800> you<00:06:06.099> just

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
population of homeless people you just

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.439 
population of homeless people you just
kind<00:06:06.370> of<00:06:06.400> have<00:06:06.460> to<00:06:06.610> wait<00:06:06.759> for<00:06:06.789> them<00:06:07.090> to<00:06:07.120> go<00:06:07.360> away

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
kind of have to wait for them to go away

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.120 
kind of have to wait for them to go away
there's<00:06:08.050> nothing<00:06:08.199> really<00:06:08.469> you<00:06:08.650> can<00:06:08.800> do<00:06:08.949> other

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
there's nothing really you can do other

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.820 
there's nothing really you can do other
than<00:06:09.370> stop<00:06:09.849> more<00:06:10.150> from<00:06:10.419> coming<00:06:10.780> so<00:06:11.530> that's
