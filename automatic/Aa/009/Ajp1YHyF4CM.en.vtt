shared as of this video about two weeks
ago<00:00:17.940> or<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:19.640> green<00:00:20.640> smoothie<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.539> make

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
ago or so the green smoothie that I make

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.810 
ago or so the green smoothie that I make
every<00:00:22.140> morning<00:00:22.560> which<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.250> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> similar

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
every morning which is kind of similar

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.529 
every morning which is kind of similar
to<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.210> Joe<00:00:24.449> Rogan<00:00:24.869> has<00:00:24.900> except<00:00:25.560> i<00:00:25.710> add<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
to what Joe Rogan has except i add a

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.740 
to what Joe Rogan has except i add a
plant-based<00:00:27.539> protein<00:00:28.199> powder<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.750> that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
plant-based protein powder and that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.269 
plant-based protein powder and that
protein<00:00:31.199> powder<00:00:31.439> may<00:00:31.679> switch<00:00:32.009> but

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
protein powder may switch but

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.110 
protein powder may switch but
essentially<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.329> kale<00:00:34.110> spinach<00:00:34.770> celery<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
essentially it's a kale spinach celery a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.410 
essentially it's a kale spinach celery a
pair<00:00:36.950> sometimes<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.160> throw<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.760> blueberries

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
pair sometimes I do throw in blueberries

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.680 
pair sometimes I do throw in blueberries
so<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.440> greens<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.910> pair<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.510> an

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so it's not all greens it's a pair or an

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.650 
so it's not all greens it's a pair or an
apple<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.579> bit<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.820> ginger<00:00:45.059> root<00:00:45.480> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
apple a little bit of ginger root is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.619 
apple a little bit of ginger root is
chopped<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.210> put<00:00:48.450> in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
chopped up in there and then I put in

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.610 
chopped up in there and then I put in
coconut<00:00:49.260> milk<00:00:49.640> sometimes<00:00:50.640> sliced<00:00:51.629> almonds

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
coconut milk sometimes sliced almonds

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.000 
coconut milk sometimes sliced almonds
and<00:00:53.539> that's<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.860> my

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and that's it so that's really my

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.709 
and that's it so that's really my
breakfast<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:57.000> fills<00:00:57.239> me<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.480> pretty

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
breakfast it actually fills me up pretty

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.650 
breakfast it actually fills me up pretty
good<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:58.949> lunch<00:00:59.370> could<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.120> anywhere

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
good and then my lunch could be anywhere

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.360 
good and then my lunch could be anywhere

for breakfast haven't had bacon for a
while<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.509> I<00:01:27.509> was<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.799> said<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
while and I was like I said the the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.660 
while and I was like I said the the
meats<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.909> i'll<00:01:30.119> choose<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.170> be

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
meats that i'll choose are going to be

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.210 
meats that i'll choose are going to be
organic<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:33.320> if<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> meats<00:01:34.979> they're

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
organic or if it's the meats they're

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.210 
organic or if it's the meats they're
going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.670> grass-fed<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.170> finding<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
going to be grass-fed so finding way to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219 
going to be grass-fed so finding way to
get<00:01:38.460> those<00:01:38.610> high<00:01:38.820> quality<00:01:39.270> proteins<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.020> very

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
get those high quality proteins is very

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.469 
get those high quality proteins is very
important<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.250> I've<00:01:41.400> actually<00:01:41.610> lowered<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
important but I've actually lowered the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
important but I've actually lowered the
amount<00:01:42.899> i<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.409> at<00:01:43.619> each<00:01:43.649> meal<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
amount i have at each meal and I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700 
amount i have at each meal and I
increase<00:01:45.299> big-time<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.350> amount<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
increase big-time the amount of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
increase big-time the amount of
vegetables<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.579> my<00:01:47.729> plate<00:01:48.030> even

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
vegetables that are on my plate even

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.660 
vegetables that are on my plate even
though<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> was<00:01:49.140> still<00:01:49.170> getting<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.009> some

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
though I was still getting in some

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.850 
though I was still getting in some
vegetables<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.600> oftentimes<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.320> salad<00:01:52.770> every

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
vegetables and oftentimes a salad every

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.580 
vegetables and oftentimes a salad every
day<00:01:53.189> now<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.939> more<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.390> two<00:01:54.750> salads<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.380> day

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
day now it's more like two salads a day

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.709 
day now it's more like two salads a day
or<00:01:56.240> mixed<00:01:57.240> vegetables<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.110> every<00:01:58.140> meal<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
or mixed vegetables with every meal and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
if I am in a rut sometimes I will get a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.999 
if I am in a rut sometimes I will get a
protein<00:02:03.180> shake<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> big<00:02:03.990> fan<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.649> I'll

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
protein shake not a big fan of that I'll

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.730 
protein shake not a big fan of that I'll
snack<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> little<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.380> some<00:02:07.380> mixed<00:02:07.710> nuts
