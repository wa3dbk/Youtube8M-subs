00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.080
 royal ascot r 121 hr 122 ribbon microphones 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.379
 the microphones of the r series of the royal are the modern revival of the 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.829
 classic type of ribbon microphones from the 20s 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.969
 an aluminum wire on aluminum that vibrating between two magnificent notes 

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:24.659
 change the garment 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.119
 with a project that could streamline my size but increase its size 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.920
 robustness and royal performance to created a usable microphone both in 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.649
 I also study the rhyme with the natural sound characteristics 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.120
 which are the main assumption from the ribbon microphones 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.250
 in fact the reference of these microphones is to take back the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.740
 sound as it is natural 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.580
 roi rr 121 b &amp; r 122 microphones adapt to any sound pressure 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.160
 this too is generated by acoustic instruments ohana means 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.260
 from wind instruments vote the voice in this case with the precaution of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.120
 use a little 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.010
 from royer microphones of the r series the auto polarity hey front and rear e 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.719
 rear 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.229
 it is typical of ribbon microphones and is characterized by the royal box patent 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.520
 and the positioning of the detector star 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.170
 compared to the microphone cuckoo axis and what has to do with it 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.010
 this peculiarity determines an intrinsic equalization 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.110
 differentiated between front and rear front 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.590
 and how to have two microphones in one with a different sound depending on the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.410
 forehead using 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.200
 here are the differences between the two lerre 121 microphones and the electrodynamic solution 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770
 without electronic tv 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.980
 lerre 122 in the version with phantom power which translates to 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.430
 greater sensitivity difficult to find in normal microphones a 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.560
 tape 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.880
 thyroid rnr 121 pr 122 will project into the fascinating world of penalties

 bellan tendo a lifetime to wrap the sounds as yours hear them 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.630
 ears 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.799
 hola 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.499
 a comment . 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.289
 but
