00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.049
 the game and very focused behind the possibility not only of creating movies 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.490
 but also very funny trailers for the past we the good thing 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:19.039
 with our friends and family and leave the oppressed 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.329
 thing effects that way very 11 he alone is responsible for creating for us only 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.329
 we have to choose one of the themes that the mobile proposes 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.519
 we see how we have the apeb and solís action on the right side include a 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.590
 name the proportions 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.490
 and we have the available frames and the viewer becomes 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.600
 of projects 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.800
 in the warehouse kind of notebook in which we have 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.690
 the summary tabs of your own or the workshop itself a storyboard of 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.110
 all the frames we need a stylist summary of all the shots 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.900
 it's as simple as filling in the fields that kim uvi proposes to us 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.540
 come on and when his name sounded more than we are interested 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.990
 and this mind we see as it goes off in the belly on the right side in the 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.229
 preview mode 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.489
 of the trailer movie in this case 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.530
 let's see how they are going to change all the interviews or texts of the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.320
 delta and apec that we are creating ourselves to this example do not 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.680
 we complicate a lot just let's go filling it up to create contain very 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.000
 simple to start as corn was able to observe d 1 of the 100 samples that 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.850
 moby provides us 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.910
 as we are going to add the titles 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.590
 they're going to leave us like something reigning and in the storyboard we're going to support or 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.290
 Introduce 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.880
 from Havana from the 2 500 all the headquarters tomás that as we have also has 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.840
 one million 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.280
 park do not get confused and we automatically select balloons what 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.350
 that the thunder itself needs in this case the first shot was a landscape 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.030
 we are going to add randomly we see how in the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.520
 following take or spider a person 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.740
 we go and selecting different shots in addition even if we have is a 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.880
 event already created specifically with the idea of ​​a trailer in general 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.399
 Well, we can see 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.600
 is what is asking us to be innovative because a quiet person in a landscape is a 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.920
 person the mode of action because it can be for example running ecétera 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.510
 us as we do not have percent let's follow these shots 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.120
 let's go adding but good this defect for this example the or we are going to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.069
 To be able to achieve 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.150
 and it is that it exhibits mind what is immobile going to be born, uniting all the shots 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.279
 with him the taibilla format that we have selected to obtain 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.199
 a 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.780
 my mounted movie 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.999
 that of course I am convinced that it will surprise us all 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.609
 let's add tiago we have more or less complete 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.159
 And even if we already have it and we want to change it, we see how it can be done 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.349
 hundred 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.200
 to create other frames other parts 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.689
 if you do not get confused showed we are confusing and we want 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.459
 claim differences 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.789
 today we have it 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.849

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.469
 and directly 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.419
 and very still fenosa mounted this trailer from the texts that included 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:03.899
 the transitions directly and automatically I can not stand to put stationary 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.449
 the trailer made with all the shots we want included 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.349
 ourselves 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.069
 We can not visualize just how we are doing with the button 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.290
 guard on the left which we have pressed 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.519
