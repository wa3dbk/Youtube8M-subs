the cold tub for one minute and what
you're<00:00:45.149> doing<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.510> you're<00:00:45.539> kind<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you're doing is you're kind of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.540

with the cold and it's almost like a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
with the cold and it's almost like a
pump<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> pump<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.289> some

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
pump and you can kind of pump out some

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
pump and you can kind of pump out some
of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> metabolites<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.550> been<00:00:53.699> built

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
a minimum of forty percent and so you

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.210 
a minimum of forty percent and so you
can<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.590> things<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.010> water
