how to draw the spies from spiders fine
besides<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.750> grasp<00:00:07.020> on<00:00:08.660> you're<00:00:09.660> not<00:00:09.809> going<00:00:09.990> to

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
besides the grasp on you're not going to

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.410 
besides the grasp on you're not going to
be<00:00:10.139> able<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.440> see<00:00:10.679> too<00:00:10.980> well<00:00:11.059> because<00:00:12.059> I'm

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
be able to see too well because I'm

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.049 
be able to see too well because I'm
right-handed<00:00:12.950> and<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.219> hold<00:00:14.429> my<00:00:14.549> camera<00:00:14.610> with

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
right-handed and I hold my camera with

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.430 
right-handed and I hold my camera with
the<00:00:15.150> right<00:00:15.179> hand<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.719> let's<00:00:15.750> see<00:00:16.049> if<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.199> can<00:00:16.320> do

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the right hand so let's see if I can do

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.300 
the right hand so let's see if I can do
this<00:00:16.699> now<00:00:17.699> first<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.300> draw<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.570> Hat<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.310> draw

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
this now first to draw the Hat you draw

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.040 
this now first to draw the Hat you draw
a<00:00:20.840> straight<00:00:21.840> line<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:23.570> now<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:26.210> um<00:00:27.210> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
a straight line like that now you um I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.279 
a straight line like that now you um I
made<00:00:28.890> those<00:00:29.070> two<00:00:29.310> lines<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:30.990> that

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
made those two lines so you can see that

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.410 
made those two lines so you can see that
and<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> make<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> little<00:00:32.219> flat<00:00:32.790> surface<00:00:33.239> right

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and you make a little flat surface right

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.380 
and you make a little flat surface right
there<00:00:33.800> now<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> little<00:00:35.790> small

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
there now you make a little small

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.380 
there now you make a little small
rectangle<00:00:36.989> right<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.350> top<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:39.210> then

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
rectangle right on top of that and then

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.340 
rectangle right on top of that and then
you<00:00:39.719> draw<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:41.329> don't<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.780> draw

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you draw like I don't know just draw

reasonable distance from the Hat now you
draw<00:01:10.470> another<00:01:10.860> circle<00:01:11.130> inside<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
draw another circle inside of there and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.990 
draw another circle inside of there and
you<00:01:13.590> fill<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:15.150> outside<00:01:15.869> circle<00:01:17.000> keeping

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
you fill in the outside circle keeping

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.510 
you fill in the outside circle keeping
the<00:01:18.119> inside<00:01:18.509> circle<00:01:18.720> light<00:01:19.110> both<00:01:19.920> spies<00:01:20.220> do

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the inside circle light both spies do

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.320 
the inside circle light both spies do
that<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.210> wear<00:01:21.960> glasses<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:23.330> you

that because they wear glasses now you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.010 
that because they wear glasses now you
draw<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> line<00:01:25.080> connecting<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.710> hat<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.159> there

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
draw a line connecting the hat to there

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.670 
draw a line connecting the hat to there
now<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.080> draw<00:01:28.890> another<00:01:29.549> line<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
now you draw another line like that so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.550 
now you draw another line like that so
you'll<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.979> something<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.759> far

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
you'll have something like that so far

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.510 
you'll have something like that so far
now<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.450> are<00:01:36.450> gonna<00:01:38.540> draw<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> line<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
now you are gonna draw a line like that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.109 
now you are gonna draw a line like that
and<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:42.170> go<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.970> not
