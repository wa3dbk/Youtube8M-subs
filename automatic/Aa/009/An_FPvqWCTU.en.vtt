00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
they're too small they look like daggers

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.300 
they're too small they look like daggers
but<00:02:02.509> yeah<00:02:03.049> you<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.320> see<00:02:03.530> those<00:02:03.860> are<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.070> dual

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
but yeah you can see those are the dual

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.529 
but yeah you can see those are the dual
wheel<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.729> see<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.119> can<00:02:05.240> probably<00:02:05.390> make

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
wheel to see it you can probably make

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.210 
wheel to see it you can probably make
the<00:02:05.689> blade<00:02:05.929> part<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.320> them<00:02:06.439> shining<00:02:06.649> blue<00:02:06.860> like

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
the blade part of them shining blue like

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.430 
the blade part of them shining blue like
the<00:02:07.399> rest<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.759> colors<00:02:08.030> but<00:02:08.630> honestly<00:02:09.319> I

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the rest of the colors but honestly I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.860 
the rest of the colors but honestly I
think<00:02:09.590> those<00:02:09.920> look<00:02:10.069> like<00:02:10.130> something<00:02:10.519> for

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 
think those look like something for

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
think those look like something for
cutting<00:02:11.870> notes<00:02:12.080> back<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> olden<00:02:12.860> days

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
cutting notes back in the olden days

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.580 
cutting notes back in the olden days
like<00:02:13.310> opening<00:02:13.790> notes<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.690> don't<00:02:15.290> think<00:02:15.470> they're

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
like opening notes I don't think they're

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.059 
like opening notes I don't think they're
too<00:02:15.709> great<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:15.980> on<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.850> next<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:18.290> hand

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
too great but on to the next the hand

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.699

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
because that will probably take one

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.270

don't really like that little circle
thing<00:04:45.010> there<00:04:45.220> but<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.970> blade<00:04:46.150> itself<00:04:46.449> looks

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
thing there but the blade itself looks
