bridge and show you demonstrate a few

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.900 
bridge and show you demonstrate a few
bridges<00:00:07.830> here<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.460> might<00:00:08.610> be<00:00:08.639> able<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
bridges here that you might be able to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.560 
bridges here that you might be able to
use<00:00:09.000> when<00:00:09.599> playing<00:00:10.550> there's<00:00:11.550> control<00:00:12.120> bridges

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
use when playing there's control bridges

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.209 
use when playing there's control bridges
and<00:00:12.809> there's<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.230> unstable<00:00:13.679> bridge<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
and there's the unstable bridge is

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.860 
and there's the unstable bridge is
depending<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:14.910> your<00:00:15.059> shot<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.660> and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
depending on what your shot is like and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.090 
depending on what your shot is like and
I'll<00:00:15.929> give<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.320> couple<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.680> examples<00:00:19.100> this

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
I'll give you a couple of examples this

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.790 
I'll give you a couple of examples this
would<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.279> considered<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.850> control<00:00:21.210> bridge

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
would be considered a control bridge

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.650 
would be considered a control bridge
where<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:23.039> rest<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.519> queue<00:00:23.820> depending

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
where you can rest the queue depending

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
where you can rest the queue depending
on how<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.560> some<00:00:26.369> people<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> like

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
on how you do it some people do it like

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.380

that my fingers aren't made that way but
I<00:00:30.480> provide<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> balanced<00:00:31.470> position<00:00:31.820> of<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
I provide a balanced position of the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.310 
I provide a balanced position of the
queue<00:00:33.440> where<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.710> control<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> cue<00:00:36.320> my

you're<00:03:02.870> creating<00:03:03.469> a<00:03:03.650> bridge<00:03:04.250> point<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.450> that

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
you're creating a bridge point and that

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.709 
you're creating a bridge point and that
bridge<00:03:06.140> point<00:03:06.439> is<00:03:06.590> kind<00:03:06.799> of<00:03:06.920> hard<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.159> make

you'll see it rotate in those are the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.420 
you'll see it rotate in those are the

this<00:04:50.550> area<00:04:51.200> now<00:04:52.200> you'll<00:04:52.380> see<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:53.870> practice

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
this area now you'll see the practice

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.990 
this area now you'll see the practice
ball<00:04:55.110> here<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:56.340> don't<00:04:56.490> want<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.670> hit<00:04:56.790> blow
