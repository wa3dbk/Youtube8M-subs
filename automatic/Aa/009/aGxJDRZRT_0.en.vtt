okay so here's the para book 1400 see
this<00:00:04.080> machine<00:00:04.259> doesn't<00:00:04.589> actually<00:00:04.770> have<00:00:05.040> a

this machine doesn't actually have a
hard<00:00:05.310> drive<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.060> because<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.540> removed<00:00:06.839> it

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
hard drive in it because I removed it

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.770 
hard drive in it because I removed it
earlier<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.340> here<00:00:08.639> instead<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.690> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
hard drive I'm going to be using a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.180 
hard drive I'm going to be using a
compact<00:00:12.120> flash<00:00:12.360> card<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:14.299> PCMCIA<00:00:15.299> or<00:00:16.190> PC

compact flash card in a PCMCIA or PC
card<00:00:17.460> adapter<00:00:19.189> this<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> card<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:21.660> this

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
card adapter this is the card here this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.230 
card adapter this is the card here this
is<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.800> high-speed<00:00:23.010> card<00:00:23.580> says<00:00:23.850> meant<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.150> be

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
is a high-speed card says meant to be

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.670 
is a high-speed card says meant to be
quite<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> bit<00:00:24.660> faster<00:00:25.050> than<00:00:25.170> your<00:00:25.350> ordinary

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
quite a bit faster than your ordinary

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.099 
quite a bit faster than your ordinary
compact<00:00:26.189> flash<00:00:26.430> cards<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.420> let's<00:00:27.599> try<00:00:27.779> slide

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
compact flash cards so let's try slide

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.169 
compact flash cards so let's try slide
it<00:00:28.320> slide<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.619> into<00:00:28.769> our<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> PC<00:00:29.640> card<00:00:29.849> slots

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it slide it into our the PC card slots

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.020 
it slide it into our the PC card slots
in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.480> pair<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.720> ik<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.640> let's<00:00:32.640> try<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.910> boot

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
in the pair of ik and let's try and boot

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:41.360 
in the pair of ik and let's try and boot
from<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:34.010> here<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.130> go<00:00:39.649> now<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.770> course<00:00:40.920> because

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
from it here we go now of course because

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
from it here we go now of course because
this<00:00:41.550> isn't<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.879> hard<00:00:42.090> drive<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.660> will<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.050> out

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
this isn't a hard drive that will be out

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.600 
this isn't a hard drive that will be out
so<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.469> know<00:00:43.649> no<00:00:43.860> use<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.160> whatsoever

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so that you know no use for whatsoever

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.959 
so that you know no use for whatsoever
so<00:00:45.329> let's<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> look<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:47.129> whether

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so let's have a look and see whether

00:00:47.969 --> 00:01:43.310 
so let's have a look and see whether
this<00:00:48.149> will<00:00:48.329> move<00:00:48.920> silently

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.800 

the<00:01:43.860> wonderful<00:01:44.610> sound<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.060> silence<00:01:45.510> during

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the wonderful sound of silence during

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:59.370 
the wonderful sound of silence during
this<00:01:46.110> process

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.490 

there<00:02:00.380> we<00:02:00.470> are<00:02:00.500> at<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.100> desktop<00:02:02.230> we<00:02:03.230> give<00:02:03.410> it

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
there we are at the desktop we give it

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.130 
there we are at the desktop we give it
another<00:02:03.650> moment<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.280> will<00:02:04.400> load<00:02:04.640> up<00:02:04.670> my

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
another moment it will load up my

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.510 
another moment it will load up my
desktop<00:02:06.140> picture<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.830> machine<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.370> running

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
desktop picture this machine is running

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.160 
desktop picture this machine is running
systems<00:02:08.150> seven<00:02:08.990> point<00:02:09.380> six<00:02:09.740> point<00:02:10.100> one<00:02:10.490> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
systems seven point six point one I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.010 
systems seven point six point one I
believe<00:02:12.170> there's<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.280> picture<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.210> took<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.720> while

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
believe there's a picture I took a while

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.860 
believe there's a picture I took a while
ago<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:16.070> there<00:02:16.340> we<00:02:16.460> are<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.850> that's<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
ago so there we are and that's a the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.980 
ago so there we are and that's a the
compact<00:02:18.350> flash<00:02:18.560> card<00:02:18.890> appeared<00:02:19.250> at<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.370> top

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
compact flash card appeared at the top

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.600 
compact flash card appeared at the top
with<00:02:20.990> all<00:02:21.140> my<00:02:21.290> files<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.950> which<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.250> copied

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
with all my files on it which I copied

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.420 
with all my files on it which I copied
over<00:02:22.730> from<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.300> hard<00:02:23.750> drive<00:02:24.220> every<00:02:25.220> try

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
over from the hard drive every try

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.100 
over from the hard drive every try
shutting<00:02:25.760> down<00:02:26.120> now<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.980> will<00:02:28.160> see<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:29.110> it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
shutting down now you will see that it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.950 
shutting down now you will see that it
actually<00:02:30.350> pops<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:32.740> flash<00:02:33.740> drive<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.220> think<00:02:34.960> so

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
actually pops the flash drive I think so

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.550 
actually pops the flash drive I think so
quite<00:02:36.620> violent<00:02:37.040> actually<00:02:37.570> anyway<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:39.140> that's

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
quite violent actually anyway so that's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.490 
quite violent actually anyway so that's
that<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:40.130> seems<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.460> work
