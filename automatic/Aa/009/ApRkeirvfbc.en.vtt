there's<00:02:43.109> team<00:02:43.380> are<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:44.239> nearly<00:02:45.239> anywhere

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
there's team are not nearly anywhere

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.590 
there's team are not nearly anywhere
near<00:02:46.500> as<00:02:46.680> good<00:02:46.709> as<00:02:47.040> previous<00:02:47.640> italian<00:02:48.359> say<00:02:48.540> so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
near as good as previous italian say so

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.819 
near as good as previous italian say so
i<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:48.930> inland<00:02:49.320> should<00:02:49.470> work<00:02:49.680> with

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
i think inland should work with

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.830 
i think inland should work with
confidence<00:02:50.310> with<00:02:50.459> belief<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.390> they<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.690> get

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
confidence with belief that they can get

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.449 
confidence with belief that they can get
out<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.140> group<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.560> just<00:02:53.130> don't<00:02:53.310> believe

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
out of the group I just don't believe

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.120 
out of the group I just don't believe
that<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:56.160> depth<00:02:56.959> quality<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.950> get

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
that they have the depth quality to get

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.830 
that they have the depth quality to get
much<00:02:59.310> follow<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.790> quarter-final<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.540> think<00:03:00.750> of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
much follow the quarter-final I think of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.010 
much follow the quarter-final I think of
England<00:03:01.109> air<00:03:01.230> either<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.709> what<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> final

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.320 

and<00:03:05.530> lost<00:03:05.830> then<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.370> think<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.090> would<00:03:07.210> be

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
and lost then I think that would be

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.690 
and lost then I think that would be
regardless<00:03:07.690> fairly<00:03:08.170> successful<00:03:08.740> and<00:03:08.980> awfully

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
regardless fairly successful and awfully

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.070 
regardless fairly successful and awfully
