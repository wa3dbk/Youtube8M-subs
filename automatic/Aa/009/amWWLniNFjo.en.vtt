00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
lives being short you know as much this

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
lives being short you know as much this
shows<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:46.050> anything<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.280> kind<00:00:47.460> of

supernatural elements and the horror and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
supernatural elements and the horror and
stuff<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.880> it's<00:00:51.000> actually<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.780> me<00:00:51.960> it's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
stuff I think it's actually to me it's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.389 
stuff I think it's actually to me it's
about<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.680> group<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.399> people<00:00:53.820> who<00:00:55.160> it's<00:00:56.160> about

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
about a group of people who it's about

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.840 
about a group of people who it's about
being<00:00:56.820> mortal<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:58.170> mortality<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
being mortal and all mortality and I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.229 
being mortal and all mortality and I
think<00:01:00.719> that's<00:01:00.899> why<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.230> will<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.440> appealing

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
think that's why it will be appealing

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.490 
think that's why it will be appealing
now<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> course<00:01:03.480> we're<00:01:03.660> taking<00:01:04.019> literary

audience

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:24.649 
audience
I<00:01:17.749> suppose<00:01:18.749> I<00:01:21.829> mean<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:23.399> materials<00:01:24.060> there<00:01:24.329> you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I suppose I mean the materials there you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.449 
I suppose I mean the materials there you
know<00:01:24.810> there's<00:01:25.109> it's<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.039> well<00:01:26.429> written

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459 
know there's it's it's so well written

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.969 
know there's it's it's so well written
and<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.479> well<00:01:27.840> crafted<00:01:28.139> by<00:01:28.979> John<00:01:29.549> Megan<00:01:29.969> who<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
and so well crafted by John Megan who is

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.739 
and so well crafted by John Megan who is
you<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.130> he's<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:33.840> smart<00:01:34.289> and

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
you know he's really really smart and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.010 
you know he's really really smart and
lively<00:01:36.749> so<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.609> and<00:01:39.149> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.840> he

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
lively so and and and I think that he

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.589 
lively so and and and I think that he
kind<00:01:40.319> of<00:01:40.409> does<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.849> that<00:01:41.849> work<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.389> you

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599 
kind of does that that work for you

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.809 
kind of does that that work for you
earlier<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.319> think<00:01:46.189> this<00:01:47.189> reading<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
earlier and I think this reading the

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.129 
earlier and I think this reading the
script<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.359> like<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.779> that<00:01:48.929> kind<00:01:49.109> of

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
script it's like it's that kind of

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:51.760 
script it's like it's that kind of
insatiable<00:01:49.939> experience<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.240> know<00:01:51.389> there

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
insatiable experience you know there

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.769 
insatiable experience you know there
that<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:53.099> part<00:01:53.429> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.939> appeal<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.450> me<00:01:54.569> that

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:54.779 
that was part of the appeal for me that

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:56.239 
that was part of the appeal for me that
I<00:01:54.810> actually<00:01:55.109> lived<00:01:55.649> she<00:01:55.799> couldn't<00:01:56.039> put<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
I actually lived she couldn't put the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.479 
I actually lived she couldn't put the
script<00:01:56.429> down<00:01:56.609> and<00:01:56.880> I'd<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.749> say<00:01:58.279> 77%<00:01:59.279> of

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
script down and I'd have to say 77% of

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:00.709 
script down and I'd have to say 77% of
the<00:01:59.609> time<00:01:59.819> you<00:01:59.969> could<00:02:00.119> put<00:02:00.239> the<00:02:00.329> script<00:02:00.569> down

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the time you could put the script down

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.989 
the time you could put the script down
so<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:01.919> this<00:02:02.669> was<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.209> rare<00:02:03.539> beast<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
so this was this was a rare beast and so

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.669 
so this was this was a rare beast and so
every<00:02:05.999> day<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.329> turning<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.989> in

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
every day you're just turning up in

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.729 
every day you're just turning up in

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
you know thrown around and here's a
