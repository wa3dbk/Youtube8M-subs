a<00:00:35.130> very<00:00:35.219> kind<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> existential<00:00:36.000> piece<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
a very kind of existential piece about a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.049 
a very kind of existential piece about a
couple<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.100> hitmen<00:00:38.340> who<00:00:38.430> come<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> kill<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> guy

and he's okay with it doesn't mind dying
it's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> great<00:00:42.930> story<00:00:43.230> there's<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it's a great story there's not really a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.690 
it's a great story there's not really a
movie<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.750> weirdly<00:00:45.750> enough<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:47.370> version

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
movie there weirdly enough this version

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.720 
movie there weirdly enough this version
is<00:00:48.090> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> remake<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.440> some<00:00:49.710> ways<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
is kind of a remake in some ways of the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
is kind of a remake in some ways of the
film<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.390> came<00:00:51.539> before<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.440> sort<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
film that came before that was sort of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
film that came before that was sort of
an<00:00:53.250> odd<00:00:53.460> adaptation<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> short<00:00:54.600> stories

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
an odd adaptation of the short stories

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.330 
an odd adaptation of the short stories
got<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> very<00:00:55.230> strange<00:00:55.500> lineage<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.160> probably

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
got a very strange lineage they probably

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.979 
got a very strange lineage they probably
would<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.640> done<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:56.969> better<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.780> call<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
would have done a lot better to call it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.770 
would have done a lot better to call it
something<00:00:58.260> other<00:00:58.590> than<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> killers<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> hey

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
something other than the killers but hey

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
something other than the killers but hey
it's<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> pretty<00:01:01.800> solid<00:01:02.070> film<00:01:02.399> at

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
