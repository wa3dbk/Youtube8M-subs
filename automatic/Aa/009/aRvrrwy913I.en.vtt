00:01:41.810 --> 00:03:18.630 

so<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.140> moving

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.850 

okay<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:26.510> go<00:03:26.660> home<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.930> little<00:03:27.080> bit<00:03:27.290> slower<00:03:27.620> the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
okay we go home a little bit slower the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.150 
okay we go home a little bit slower the
whales<00:03:28.100> have<00:03:28.430> massive<00:03:28.940> ones<00:03:29.209> in<00:03:30.170> our<00:03:30.560> waters

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
whales have massive ones in our waters

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.630 
whales have massive ones in our waters
they<00:03:31.340> have<00:03:31.519> what<00:03:31.670> we<00:03:31.700> call<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> dog<00:03:32.239> cycle<00:03:33.640> and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
they have what we call a dog cycle and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.670 
they have what we call a dog cycle and
that's<00:03:34.790> simply<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.570> tolling<00:03:36.050> they<00:03:36.320> speed

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
that's simply a tolling they speed

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.040 
that's simply a tolling they speed
beneath<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.220> water<00:03:37.459> willing<00:03:38.390> come<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.810> at<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
beneath the water willing come on at the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.759 
beneath the water willing come on at the
surface

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
surface

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.680 
surface
take<00:03:40.370> another<00:03:40.700> breath<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.209> will<00:03:41.300> be<00:03:41.450> at

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
take another breath that will be at

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.199 
take another breath that will be at
seven<00:03:42.140> minutes<00:03:42.550> that<00:03:43.550> means<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.910> could<00:03:44.030> be<00:03:44.150> a

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
seven minutes that means it could be a

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.150 
seven minutes that means it could be a
while<00:03:44.390> here<00:03:44.690> right<00:03:44.930> now<00:03:45.170> could<00:03:45.500> be<00:03:45.530> beneath<00:03:45.920> us

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
while here right now could be beneath us

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.030 
while here right now could be beneath us
the<00:03:46.640> real<00:03:46.880> answer<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.269> break<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.989> surface<00:03:48.230> so

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
the real answer to break the surface so

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.400 
the real answer to break the surface so
going<00:03:49.400> home<00:03:49.640> we<00:03:49.910> money<00:03:50.150> just<00:03:50.480> move<00:03:51.230> through

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
going home we money just move through

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.790 
going home we money just move through
the<00:03:51.530> water<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.830> little<00:03:52.040> bit<00:03:52.190> slower<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:53.000> cover

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
the water a little bit slower and cover

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:03.119 
the water a little bit slower and cover
all<00:03:54.800> eyes<00:03:55.010> all<00:03:55.040> my<00:03:55.489> owners<00:03:55.760> every<00:03:56.570> direction

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.619 

that<00:04:04.129> was<00:04:04.400> how<00:04:04.549> many<00:04:04.609> sales<00:04:04.909> he<00:04:05.180> went<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.569> the

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
that was how many sales he went to the

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:20.640 
that was how many sales he went to the
hot<00:04:05.780> tell<00:04:06.109> you

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.200 

so<00:04:21.650> I've<00:04:21.739> now<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:22.010> disengage<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.850> engines

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
so I've now to disengage the engines

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.020 
so I've now to disengage the engines
they<00:04:23.360> just<00:04:23.540> in<00:04:23.690> neutral<00:04:24.370> just<00:04:25.370> let<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.880> while

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
they just in neutral just let the while

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:55.200 
they just in neutral just let the while
still<00:04:26.300> with<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.510> one<00:04:26.720> today

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.960 

so<00:04:56.110> again<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.470> wilds<00:04:56.860> know<00:04:56.949> exactly<00:04:57.520> where<00:04:57.759> we

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
so again the wilds know exactly where we

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.480 
so again the wilds know exactly where we
are<00:04:58.180> they<00:04:58.509> know<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.690> Gracie<00:04:59.199> some<00:05:00.100> sorts<00:05:00.400> of

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
are they know the Gracie some sorts of

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.850 
are they know the Gracie some sorts of
curious
