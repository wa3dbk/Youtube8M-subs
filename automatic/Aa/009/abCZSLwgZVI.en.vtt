so I'm my mistake I did get all of them
I<00:01:57.719> think<00:02:01.070> yeah<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.869> anyway<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.729> these<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.880> all

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
I think yeah so anyway I these are all

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.570 
I think yeah so anyway I these are all
the<00:02:06.090> files<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.689> need<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> date<00:02:08.220> fix

the files that you need for the date fix

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.920 
the files that you need for the date fix
and<00:02:09.379> first<00:02:10.379> step<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.950> go<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.599> way<00:02:12.599> you've

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
and first step is you go to way you've

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.830 
and first step is you go to way you've
installed
