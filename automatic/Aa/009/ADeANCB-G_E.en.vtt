00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.200
 and the behavior of the cat in the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.420
 Domestic environment depends on first 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.670
 place of its nature we should 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.289
 remember they are lonely animals and 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.940
 very territorial although yes that is 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.470
 true that domestication and 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.090
 logically the selection by the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.130
 man has modified in parts and 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.520
 characteristics and increasingly they are 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.980
 more sociable and more affectionate animals 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.930
 secondly it also depends on the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.029
 management by the owners and 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.469
 yes logically from the information that 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.570
 has support in relation to 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.519
 behavior of the cat in many 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.379
 occasions behaviors that are 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.300
 completely normal from the point of 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.089
 biological view of the species can 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.219
 be very annoying to the owners 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.199
 and it is important to note that these 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.030
 behaviors are performed by the cat 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.379
 he just does not have a feeling of revenge 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.379
 towards the owners 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.490
 and we have behaviors that is 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.050
 important that cats can perform 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.210
 among them we talk about behavior 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.950
 of the game and exploratory behavior 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.710
 at least it is important that the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.450
 Priority is informed of how it should 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.750
 play with your cat at what time of the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.750
 Journey with your cat and how you should play 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.230
 with his father and in this way we will avoid 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.820
 that the game re-elect towards objects 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.400
 undesirable I conclude solitary acids 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.040
 it is important to provide the cat with 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.440
 suitable toys an ideal toy for 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.670
 the cat is the one that does not weigh too much or 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.040
 therefore the cat can 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.170
 transport easily in the market 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.200
 there are many options some of them 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.030
 is for example this type of toy or 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.900
 this type of toy that the cat can 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.970
 pursue it is important that the 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.820
 owner is involved in the game not 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.440
 it's enough that the cat has toys 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.170
 but the owner must play 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.500
 correctly consulted if the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.649
 owner prefers that it is the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.670
 use the vertical structures 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.250
 shelves on top of the furniture 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.320
 we will have to provide some 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.090
 structure that the cat can increase 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.190
 that three- dimensional space either in 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.620
 shape of towers or some other type 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.690
 type of structure and not only that but 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.640
 that we must also provide some 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.110
 type of material structure that the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.180
 cat can mark mark with nails 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.030
 remember that nail marking is a 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.830
 normal and necessary behavior is the way 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.870
 to mark the territory but 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.750
 we provide 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.849
 a suitable substrate and the cat will look 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.849
 an alternative substrate that may well 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.120
 be the sofa the bed or the curtains by 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.519
 so look for some type of scraper 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.180
 where the cat can set a record 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.150
 in necessary conduct is 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.650
 very important for the cat there is a guy 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.200
 particular of toys that we could 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.970
 call food dispenser toys 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.370
 which allows you to enter your 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.500
 interior food that allows us that type 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.569
 of toys on the one hand increase the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.180
 exploratory behavior and also the 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.099
 behavior of the game to the cat and in addition it 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.170
 will be rewarded because every time 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.030
 move the toy is not only going to perform 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.000
 more exercises but you will receive a 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.579
 award less game behaviors 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.250
 hunting are very similar in fact the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.739
 Game behavior includes sequences 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.500
 typical of the box sequence as 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.239
 would be hypervigilance or stalking that 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.519
 it is important to keep in mind that if not 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.860
 the right toys will be used that 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.160
 game because they could be redirected 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.310
 the owners is to say we should avoid 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.380
 use body parts in the hands 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.380
 the feet or chase the cat 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.420
 in those occasions that we see the cat 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.580
 will perform a prank is important in 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.880
 instead of using physical punishment the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.530
 interrupt the annoying behavior of 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.630
 a shape that the cat can not associate 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.580
 what directly with the owner we 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.890
 we can keep away from making a 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.320
 noise for example with a clap but 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.660
 we should never never use punishments 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.820
 very difficult physical the cats apply 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.820
 correctly the punishment at the time 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.800
 timely and with the right intensity and 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.390
 on many occasions they can appear 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.100
 problems of adversity for fear towards 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.050
 the owners derived from the 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.050
 application of inadequate punishment 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.220
 is important in those cases that 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.720
 detect 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.430
 a behavior change with a 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.260
 problem behavior simply that 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.880
 conduct is annoying to the 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.980
 owner independently 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.740
 normal or not normal from that point of view 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.620
 biological , consult a specialist 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.500
 in feline behavior especially in 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.930
 those cases in which housing 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.360
 there are therefore familiar elderly children or 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.020
 people with some physical hope or 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.020
 disease 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.100
 or
