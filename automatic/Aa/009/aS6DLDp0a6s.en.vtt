 form of tape and place the flaps 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.990

 to ensure that the final finish of the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.840
 paint defender will have a very thin line 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.540
 this second line with the tape of 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.910

 correct adhesion of the tape making 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.030
 uniform pressure this will prevent the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.250
 liquid pass underneath before applying 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.170
 the defending pin should be applied a wax 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.990
 with a microfiber cloth over the area 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.180

 immediately this process is 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.100
 fundamental to be able to withdraw 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.459

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.770
 horizontal on the spray can 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.300
 then the can must be shaken for 1 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.690
 minute before applying the paint 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.220

 to get the best results 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.330
 keep the nozzle at a distance of 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.850
 between 15 to 20 centimeters of the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.100
 surface is very important to ensure the 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.900
 total coverage of the area to achieve 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.150
 final finish of very good 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.950
 features apply at a speed 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.890
 constant between 10 to 15 centimeters 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.530
 per second apply a total of 3 layers 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.480
 without stopping it is not necessary to wait for 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.120
 to dry between layers to be able to apply 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.860
 correctly the paint defender of 3m the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.590
 first layer is applied from right to 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.540

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.940
 down and the third layer from left to 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.940
 right 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.780
 repeat the process in the other half of the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.030
 capot once finished check the 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.760
 covering and retouching if necessary 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.030
 keep in mind that the paint defender is 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.650
 will level itself by drying out if it does not 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.780
 has correctly applied the paint 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.209

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.459
 a correct application will have a 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.310
 lumpy, peel-like appearance 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.530
 of an orange has been applied too 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.660
 the paint defender will be thick and 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.639
 white before the paint dries

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.639
 tape layer 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.130
 I took the end tape and remove it from 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.710
 the surface still wet without touching the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.539

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.380
 hours depending on the temperature of the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.480

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.980
 after dry the film can be
