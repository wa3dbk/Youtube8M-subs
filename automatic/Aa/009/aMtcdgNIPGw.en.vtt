00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
well the underlying motivation is of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.010 
well the underlying motivation is of

that look like there might be some

that look like there might be some

accountability and this report is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.310 
accountability and this report is
interpreted<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.300> almost<00:01:24.570> everybody<00:01:25.080> as

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
interpreted by almost everybody as

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.670 
interpreted by almost everybody as
saying<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:26.130> had<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> junk<00:01:26.880> our<00:01:27.680> accountability

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
saying we had a junk our accountability

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.670 
saying we had a junk our accountability
statutes<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:30.210> haven't<00:01:30.480> worked<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.170> we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
statutes that they haven't worked and we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.250 
statutes that they haven't worked and we
shouldn't<00:01:32.010> be<00:01:32.100> thinking<00:01:32.400> about<00:01:32.640> them<00:01:33.060> well<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
shouldn't be thinking about them well so

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.830 
shouldn't be thinking about them well so
what<00:01:34.410> are<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.590> problems<00:01:35.010> with<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> report

what are your problems with the report

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.560 
what are your problems with the report
well<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> simplest<00:01:37.200> problem<00:01:38.360> given<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
well the simplest problem given that the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.210 
well the simplest problem given that the
National<00:01:39.990> Research<00:01:40.230> Council<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.830> supposed<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
National Research Council is supposed to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.940 
National Research Council is supposed to
waive<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.940> scientific<00:01:42.630> evidence<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.590> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
waive the scientific evidence is that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.270 
waive the scientific evidence is that
they<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.160> an<00:01:44.400> extraordinarily<00:01:44.760> bad<00:01:45.270> job<00:01:45.660> of

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
they do an extraordinarily bad job of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.560 
they do an extraordinarily bad job of
reviewing<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.640> evidence<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.240> available

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
reviewing the evidence that's available

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.990 
reviewing the evidence that's available
on<00:01:48.870> accountability<00:01:49.290> systems<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.820> come

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
on accountability systems and they come

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.410 
on accountability systems and they come
out<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.360> absolutely<00:01:52.020> bizarre<00:01:52.310> conclusions

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
out with absolutely bizarre conclusions

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.280 
out with absolutely bizarre conclusions
their<00:01:54.440> first<00:01:55.440> conclusion<00:01:55.950> says

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
their first conclusion says

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
their first conclusion says
accountability<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.770> bring<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.730> United

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
accountability will not bring the United

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.810 
accountability will not bring the United

nations in the world accountability by

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.760 
nations in the world accountability by
itself<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.720> might<00:02:06.900> think<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.260> it's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
itself now you might think that it's

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.219 
itself now you might think that it's
more<00:02:08.009> natural<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.640> say<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.539> productive<00:02:10.080> or

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
more natural to say is it productive or

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.260 
more natural to say is it productive or
not<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.560> opposed<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.790> panacea

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
not as opposed to is this the panacea

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.810 
not as opposed to is this the panacea
well<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:13.830> they<00:02:14.040> saying<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.550> are<00:02:14.700> they

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
well so are they saying that are they

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.250 
well so are they saying that are they
saying<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.270> accountability<00:02:15.900> has<00:02:16.020> no

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
saying that accountability has no

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.119 
saying that accountability has no
positive<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
positive and

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.440 
positive and

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
that it's on the order of 14 trillion

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.270 
that it's on the order of 14 trillion
dollars<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.109> 15<00:03:19.590> trillion<00:03:20.069> dollar

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
dollars we have a 15 trillion dollar

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.240 
dollars we have a 15 trillion dollar
economy<00:03:20.760> today<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.599> all<00:03:22.379> of<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.739> discussions

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
economy today and all of the discussions

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.159 
economy today and all of the discussions
about<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.759> recession<00:03:24.120> are<00:03:24.540> about<00:03:24.870> one

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
about the recession are about one

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.170 
about the recession are about one
trillion<00:03:25.530> dollars<00:03:26.069> so<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.729> a<00:03:26.759> policy

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
trillion dollars so this is a policy

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.460 
trillion dollars so this is a policy
that's<00:03:27.810> much<00:03:28.409> much<00:03:28.680> larger<00:03:30.019> all<00:03:31.019> right<00:03:31.169> so

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
that's much much larger all right so

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.740 
that's much much larger all right so
they<00:03:32.069> think<00:03:32.269> accountability<00:03:33.269> wouldn't<00:03:33.569> bring

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
they think accountability wouldn't bring

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.229 
they think accountability wouldn't bring
much<00:03:33.989> improvement<00:03:34.590> do<00:03:34.680> they<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:35.009> any

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
much improvement do they have any

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.219 
much improvement do they have any

suggestions for how to bring about

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.800 
suggestions for how to bring about
improvement<00:03:38.030> well<00:03:39.030> that's<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.449> funny<00:03:39.599> part

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
improvement well that's the funny part

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.309 
improvement well that's the funny part
