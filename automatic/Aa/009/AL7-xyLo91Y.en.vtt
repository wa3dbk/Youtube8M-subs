00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:27.519
 [Music] 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.830
 we are on the way to one 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.930
 So-called small group so 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 a cage cage for chickens and us 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.710
 will take 30 animals there today and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.900
 they will get a nice new one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.220
 home where you can live so long 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.940
 at some point of a natural death 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.530
 to die 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.330
 This is a so-called open animal 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.040
 Liberation means that means we show 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.170
 to go consist our faces 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.059
 What we do there we do not find that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 that in some form illegal or one 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.570
 on the contrary, crime is what is in 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 is done to many there that is that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.689
 actual crime 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.540
 [Music] 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:09.100
 So we get 30 chickens today 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.509
 the plant is going to be pretty big 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.430
 an estimated 150,000 tyroleans will be in it 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.159
 in principle it is best if one of 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.680
 reaches over the wings at the back and then 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:44.990
 forgets so fast again 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:44.990
 [Music] 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:13.240
 [Music] 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.180
 yes it's about these eggs for nothing 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.100
 other and some animals 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.900
 not a few are dying here 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.550
 prematurely as just seen here 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.320
 have and the others have last 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.940
 comment on the end of the slaughterhouse 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.360
 that we want to spare only 30 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.720
 take back with you 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.900
 [Music] 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.579
 against each other 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.459
 if the caster goes there you have to go here 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:44.430
 the backward to rejoice 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.860
 Just do it and get it out and that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:58.750
 was it 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:58.750

 [Music] 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.610
 millions of hands live among them 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.230
 conditions like here in Germany the 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.520
 What we did to save 30 animals 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.570
 that's just a drop in the end 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.340
 in the hot stone 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.540
 we would like to save everyone but that 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.460
 We can not do that last time 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.590
 the consumer only he has the power 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.270
 through his consumer behavior products the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.010
 associated with animal cruelty in the 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.840
 supermarket shelves let it 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.350
 it will eventually be such an animal cruelty 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.350
 no longer exists 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.689
 [Applause]

 [Music] 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.319
 On the advice of the court brought the rest of her 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.909
 Spending the life we have is that 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.590
 First time grass under the claws 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.000
 can the first time sand bathe 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.319
 already everywhere on the peck 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.970
 ground around and find that really great 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.129
 although they have never been in their lives 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.900
 have experienced or seen fold 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.220
 now from each other as well 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.509
 and the effort has definitely 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.509
 worth it as 30 animals
