00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.160
 Hello my name is Eugene Kotlyarova 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.290
 and today we have the sixth lesson and talk 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 about what to do if you are tired 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.900
 ride in a two-dimensional plane 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.270
 go to the three-dimensional space 3d 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.670
 any beautiful mound will do for this 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.870
 on which there is no particular vegetation 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.989
 the woodedness of power lines away 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.210
 grown find such a bag you can get 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.400
 complete freedom from ski resorts 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.830
 from the lifts and using only power 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.409
 winds realize your wildest fantasies 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.089
 very fast without using a lift 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.620
 climb up and so 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.890
 fly fast down 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:13.330
 perlite hotel for enemies jump over 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.370
 canyon and whatever it is 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.090
 pay attention came riding on 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.420
 relief 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.720
 the first is the right choice of slope and how 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.450
 I already said the hill should be without lines 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.860
 electricity without forests and preferably 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.260
 without detached trees 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.439
 having found such a hill you need to look 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.090
 banished to the wind blew in the forehead mountains and 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.590
 then we use the guitar part 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.840
 mountains for skiing 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.310
 you should avoid the lee 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.500
 part of the mountain that stands in itself 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.549
 some hazards in the form of rotors 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.250
 turbulence as well as choosing 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.439
 skiing in 3d format is better to change skis 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.299
 On shorter wider this 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.640
 will be much more comfortable 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.619
 Also, do not ride near the collective farms 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.320
 so as not to stumble on any for 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:04.149
 thrown and forgotten and spare parts from harvesters 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:08.100
 and so great mountain most suitable 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.100
 wind try to ride
