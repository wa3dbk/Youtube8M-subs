dust<00:00:43.739> cover<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.640> still<00:00:44.850> use<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
dust cover but you can still use this

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420

aftermarket dust cover which you can see

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.350 
aftermarket dust cover which you can see
here<00:00:48.980> but<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> most<00:00:50.340> important<00:00:50.910> change<00:00:51.180> I

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
here but the most important change I

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
here but the most important change I
think<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.050> slipper<00:00:52.320> clutch<00:00:52.410> why<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.219> ask

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
think is the slipper clutch why you ask

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
think is the slipper clutch why you ask
I<00:00:53.850> mean<00:00:54.300> see<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.690> yourself<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> older

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
I mean see for yourself in the older

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
I mean see for yourself in the older
version<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> -<00:00:56.219> 390<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> am<00:00:57.000> finding<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.629> so

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
version of - 390 I am finding it so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.869 
version of - 390 I am finding it so
difficult<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.620> press<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> clutch<00:00:59.340> using<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
difficult to press the clutch using a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.870 
difficult to press the clutch using a
single<00:01:00.210> finger<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.719> two

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.290 

but<00:01:04.480> on<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.690> new<00:01:04.870> 2015<00:01:05.620> Jeep<00:01:06.010> 390<00:01:06.580> it's<00:01:06.910> like<00:01:07.270> a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
but on the new 2015 Jeep 390 it's like a

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.600 
but on the new 2015 Jeep 390 it's like a
piece<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.630> cake<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.290> press<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.800> with<00:01:09.040> just<00:01:09.400> one

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
piece of cake to press it with just one

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.730 
piece of cake to press it with just one
finger<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:10.180> mean<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:10.840> easy<00:01:10.870> that<00:01:11.260> you<00:01:11.560> can

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
finger I mean it's so easy that you can

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.160 
finger I mean it's so easy that you can
even<00:01:11.890> use<00:01:12.010> your<00:01:12.250> pinky<00:01:12.970> finger<00:01:13.000> if<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:13.840> wish

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
even use your pinky finger if you wish

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.550 
even use your pinky finger if you wish
to<00:01:14.320> do<00:01:14.440> so

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.650 

the<00:01:20.980> heating<00:01:21.370> is<00:01:21.490> still<00:01:21.730> a<00:01:21.760> problem<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
the heating is still a problem on the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.870 
the heating is still a problem on the
2015<00:01:23.410> two<00:01:23.560> or<00:01:23.650> three<00:01:23.860> ninety<00:01:24.160> but<00:01:24.370> now<00:01:24.610> they

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
2015 two or three ninety but now they

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.540 
2015 two or three ninety but now they
have<00:01:25.030> this<00:01:25.270> fan<00:01:26.020> cover<00:01:26.350> installed<00:01:26.950> which<00:01:27.280> they

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
have this fan cover installed which they

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.490 
have this fan cover installed which they
claim<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:28.060> divert<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.600> heat<00:01:28.840> somewhere<00:01:29.170> else

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
claim to divert the heat somewhere else

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.040 
claim to divert the heat somewhere else
but<00:01:30.220> I<00:01:30.280> feel<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.790> still<00:01:31.000> feel<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.510> heat<00:01:31.810> but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
but I feel you still feel the heat but

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.460 
but I feel you still feel the heat but
not<00:01:32.560> as<00:01:32.830> much<00:01:33.130> as<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.460> old<00:01:33.670> Duke<00:01:33.910> 390<00:01:34.150> as<00:01:34.660> you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
not as much as the old Duke 390 as you

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.680 
not as much as the old Duke 390 as you
can<00:01:35.680> clearly<00:01:35.860> see<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.430> difference<00:01:36.820> over<00:01:37.479> here

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
can clearly see the difference over here

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.530 
can clearly see the difference over here
with<00:01:38.080> and<00:01:38.320> without<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.070> fan<00:01:39.460> cover<00:01:39.670> they<00:01:40.360> also

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
with and without a fan cover they also

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.600 
with and without a fan cover they also
have<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.020> front<00:01:41.380> shock<00:01:41.740> absorber<00:01:42.310> sight

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
have this front shock absorber sight

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.370 
have this front shock absorber sight
cover<00:01:43.000> which<00:01:43.210> i<00:01:43.360> think<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.690> going<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.930> be<00:01:44.050> very

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
cover which i think is going to be very

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.960 
cover which i think is going to be very
useful<00:01:45.010> in<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.220> rainy<00:01:45.400> season

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
useful in the rainy season

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.630 
useful in the rainy season
luckily<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:46.750> feel<00:01:47.140> we<00:01:47.410> can<00:01:47.650> put<00:01:48.010> most<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.430> this

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
luckily I feel we can put most of this

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
luckily I feel we can put most of this
on<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.060> older<00:01:49.360> version<00:01:49.660> of<00:01:49.810> Duke<00:01:50.170> 390<00:01:50.410> as<00:01:50.830> well

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
on the older version of Duke 390 as well

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.389 
on the older version of Duke 390 as well
