Magic Man sports and here we got a nice
little<00:00:04.290> undersized<00:00:05.069> lineup<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.549> picked<00:00:05.759> the

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
little undersized lineup I picked the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.579 
little undersized lineup I picked the
shortest<00:00:06.270> player<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:06.779> each<00:00:06.870> position<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.560> we

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
shortest player at each position so we

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.240 
shortest player at each position so we
got<00:00:07.799> Mugsy<00:00:08.280> bows<00:00:08.460> at<00:00:08.760> 53<00:00:09.360> Jeff<00:00:10.349> hornacek<00:00:10.740> at

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
got Mugsy bows at 53 Jeff hornacek at

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.289 
got Mugsy bows at 53 Jeff hornacek at
six<00:00:11.880> foot<00:00:12.150> three<00:00:12.240> Dandridge<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.590> 66<00:00:14.309> Bill

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
six foot three Dandridge at 66 Bill

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.750 
six foot three Dandridge at 66 Bill
bridges<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:16.049> 66<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.039> willis<00:00:17.670> reed<00:00:17.760> at<00:00:17.960> 69<00:00:18.960> so

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
bridges at 66 and willis reed at 69 so

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.820 
bridges at 66 and willis reed at 69 so
in<00:00:20.760> real<00:00:21.630> life<00:00:21.840> they<00:00:22.050> would<00:00:22.199> be<00:00:22.289> under<00:00:22.590> sized

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
in real life they would be under sized

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.099 
in real life they would be under sized
at<00:00:23.340> their<00:00:23.970> position<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.930> kind<00:00:25.080> of

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
at their position so this is kind of

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.750 
at their position so this is kind of
what<00:00:25.230> inspired<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.890> lineup<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.609> see

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
what inspired this lineup as you see

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
what inspired this lineup as you see
we're<00:00:26.910> starting<00:00:27.119> off<00:00:27.390> running<00:00:28.050> plays<00:00:28.410> which<00:00:28.830> I

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
we're starting off running plays which I

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.519 
we're starting off running plays which I
don't<00:00:29.189> normally<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:30.960> lineup<00:00:31.260> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
don't normally do but with this lineup I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.630 
don't normally do but with this lineup I
just<00:00:31.830> thought<00:00:32.070> maybe<00:00:32.969> I'd<00:00:33.180> experiment<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
just thought maybe I'd experiment and

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.119 
just thought maybe I'd experiment and
run<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:35.850> plays<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.500> see<00:00:37.500> kind<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> like

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
run some plays and see kind of like

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.220 
run some plays and see kind of like
where<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.969> liked<00:00:39.239> running<00:00:39.480> plays<00:00:39.750> more<00:00:40.020> than

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
where if I liked running plays more than

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
where if I liked running plays more than
just<00:00:40.500> running<00:00:41.280> around<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.940> trying<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> dunk

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
just running around and trying to dunk

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.869 
just running around and trying to dunk
on<00:00:42.510> people<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> case<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.579> after

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
on people and that was the case so after

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.990 
on people and that was the case so after
this<00:00:45.000> game<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:46.260> felt<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.309> don't<00:00:47.579> know<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> felt

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
this game I felt I don't know it felt

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.040 
this game I felt I don't know it felt
more<00:00:48.420> rewarding<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:50.300> run<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> play<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.930> get

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
more rewarding to run a play and get

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.840 
more rewarding to run a play and get
something<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.710> there's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.280> couple<00:00:53.430> snags

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
something going there's a couple snags

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.750 
something going there's a couple snags
that<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> run<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.489> when<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> play

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that you run into like here when a play

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.310 
that you run into like here when a play
kind<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> blows<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.750> kinda<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> make

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
kind of blows up you kinda have to make

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.700 
kind of blows up you kinda have to make
something<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> nothing<00:01:00.590> there's<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
something out of nothing there's a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.160 
something out of nothing there's a
there's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> few<00:01:02.370> minor<00:01:02.760> things<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.930> kind<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
there's a few minor things that kind of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590 
there's a few minor things that kind of
takes<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.470> long<00:01:04.680> time<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.979> start<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.670> play<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.119> if

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
takes a long time to start a play and if

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
takes a long time to start a play and if
someone<00:01:06.869> reaches<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.400> only<00:01:08.549> have

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
someone reaches in and you only have

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.270 
someone reaches in and you only have
about<00:01:09.360> 10<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.830> 14<00:01:11.280> seconds<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.210> run<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> play

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
about 10 to 14 seconds to run a play

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
about 10 to 14 seconds to run a play
it's<00:01:14.280> pretty<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:16.020> shoe<00:01:16.350> one

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's pretty much you have one shoe one

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's pretty much you have one shoe one
shot<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.610> off<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.820> shot<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.330> he's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
shot to get off a shot and if he's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.320 
shot to get off a shot and if he's
playing<00:01:18.630> good<00:01:18.840> defense<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.590> uh<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.369> not

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
to the gameplay Muggsy Bogues were

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.339 
to the gameplay Muggsy Bogues were
actually<00:03:27.090> hitting<00:03:27.269> some<00:03:27.510> mid<00:03:27.629> range<00:03:27.840> jumpers

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
actually hitting some mid range jumpers

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.360 
actually hitting some mid range jumpers
for<00:03:28.560> me<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.720> yeah<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.930> normally<00:03:31.769> doesn't<00:03:32.010> or

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
for me and yeah that normally doesn't or

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460 
for me and yeah that normally doesn't or
shouldn't<00:03:32.400> happen<00:03:33.060> he<00:03:33.180> only<00:03:33.299> has<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> 77

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
shouldn't happen he only has a 77

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.199 
shouldn't happen he only has a 77
mid-range<00:03:34.859> so<00:03:35.159> we<00:03:35.400> were<00:03:35.489> getting<00:03:35.730> lucky<00:03:36.000> that

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
mid-range so we were getting lucky that

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.229 
mid-range so we were getting lucky that
float<00:03:36.449> we<00:03:36.599> had<00:03:36.720> floor<00:03:36.959> general<00:03:37.409> on<00:03:37.590> our<00:03:38.340> Center

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
float we had floor general on our Center

ten assists maybe nine well seeing the

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.160 
ten assists maybe nine well seeing the
