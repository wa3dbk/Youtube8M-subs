00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Well, in this video, I'm going to teach you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.850
 how to tune your guitar in an easy way 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.519
 and fast with the help of an application 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.670
 what is called Chinese guitar that you can 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.650
 download to your smartphone either a 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.170
 iphone or an android 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.710
 once you 've done it you have to open 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.420
 the application I for this is tuned 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.840
 intentionally my guitar 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.200
 ok let's step by step tune up let's 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.200
 open the application 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.970
 that once you load you have to go to the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.199
 tuner screen if you do not land 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.629
 on this screen 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.590
 possibly you land is in the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.670
 metronome screen 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.080
 Click or rather press this option 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.420
 hence it is the middle where it says 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.210
 tuner so you can see this same 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.600
 screen that I 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 and also make sure it's enabled 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.519
 the automatic option here in the part 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.040
 top right that if it's gray is that 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.400
 is not enabled then 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.990
 touch it to be enabled if it is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.290
 green means that it is enabled 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.200
 then once that's done 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.460
 let's tune the strings one by one 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.460
 let's start with the sixth string 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.190
 see how a marker appears in the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.960
 top and left side and 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.170
 a legend on the right side that says your 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.170
 Blog 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.560
 That means the rope is very 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.639
 low and you have to increase tension 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.639
 [Music] 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.609
 see how the marker is progressing 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.049
 to the right the objective is that 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.049
 stay exactly in the center 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.819
 [Music] 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:15.760
 ready now fifth string that is one side 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:18.670
 [Music] 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.480
 very good we go with fourth string 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.480
 what is a king 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.160
 in this case it is very high appears the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.080
 right side of the marker 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.880
 and the legend on the left says that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.680
 have to say that it is very high and there 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.650
 that release tension on that rope 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.450
 [Music] 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.450
 I will intentionally spend 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.280
 and I'm going to tune from the bottom up 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.210
 and it's always good to tune your strings 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.340
 from low tones to the ideal tone 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.160
 then we continue with third string that 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.470
 is a sun 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:13.029
 is very low we increase tension 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.029
 [Music] 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.010
 then second string that is a yes 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.170
 [Laughs] 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.500
 [Music] 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.229
 [Laughs] 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.229
 [Music] 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.220
 it was also too low 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.360
 i 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.830
 [Music] 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.759
 or 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.759
 [Music] 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.700
 ready now first rope that is a me 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.850
 [Music] 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:07.940
 its very high 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:07.940
 [Music] 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.120
 there it is we are going to verify the one by 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.120
 a 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.100
 [Music] 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.880

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.880
 Y 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.199
 ah 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.750
 now we have a well-tuned guitar 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.460
 [Music] 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.620
