00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
so there's nothing actually very

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.660 
so there's nothing actually very
exciting<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.379> mod<00:00:49.620> there's<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> bronze

pickaxe and just all these basic tools

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
pickaxe and just all these basic tools
but<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.670> reason<00:00:53.969> why<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:54.149> showing<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> mod

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
but the reason why I'm showing this mod

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.049 
but the reason why I'm showing this mod
is<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.680> because

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
is because I really like it is because

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
is because I really like it is because
that<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.180> quite<00:00:57.390> hard<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.899> get<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> create

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that it's quite hard to get the create

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.060 
that it's quite hard to get the create
these<00:00:59.399> actual<00:00:59.730> tools<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:01.140> need<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.800> said

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
these actual tools you need as I said

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.889 
these actual tools you need as I said
you<00:01:02.160> need<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.489> ten<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.059> copper<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you need one ten and one copper which I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.479

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.960 
to do slots here now you will put your
tin<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:46.079> your<00:01:46.409> copper<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.670> wait<00:01:47.790> here

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
tin and your copper and if you wait here

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
tin and your copper and if you wait here
you<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.390> one<00:01:49.220> bronze<00:01:50.220> bar<00:01:50.549> which<00:01:50.729> you'll<00:01:50.990> wait

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
you get one bronze bar which you'll wait

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.139 
you get one bronze bar which you'll wait
for<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:53.250> quickly<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.670> there's<00:01:54.000> more

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
for just quickly here there's more

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.460 
for just quickly here there's more
that's<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.450> cool<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.170> one

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that's really cool but there is one

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740 
that's really cool but there is one
little<00:01:55.710> bug<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> wanna<00:01:56.130> say<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:57.149> um<00:01:57.420> you're

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
little bug I wanna say that's um you're

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.340 
little bug I wanna say that's um you're
supposed<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.350> able<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.560> create<00:01:59.840> dust<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
supposed to be able to create dust this

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.170 
supposed to be able to create dust this
this<00:02:01.710> dust<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.159> light<00:02:02.430> redstone<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> can

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
this dust this light redstone it can

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.020 
this dust this light redstone it can
replace<00:02:03.540> redstone<00:02:04.200> basically<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.759> can't

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
replace redstone basically so it can't

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.330 
replace redstone basically so it can't
replace<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.509> wiring<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:07.200> redstone<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
replace the wiring for redstone but it

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.770 
replace the wiring for redstone but it
can<00:02:08.489> replace<00:02:08.759> things<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.360> say<00:02:09.599> you're

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
can replace things like say you're

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.500 
can replace things like say you're
building<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.310> piston<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.790> using<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.330> bit<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
building a piston and so using a bit of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
building a piston and so using a bit of
redstone<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:13.020> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
redstone there you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
redstone there you
to<00:02:13.620> use<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:14.040> bit<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.430> copper<00:02:14.730> dust<00:02:14.910> which<00:02:15.330> works

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
to use a bit of copper dust which works

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.710 
to use a bit of copper dust which works
the<00:02:15.990> same<00:02:16.140> as<00:02:16.250> redstone<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.690> you

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the same as redstone but is it so you

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720 
the same as redstone but is it so you
can't<00:02:19.050> use<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.830> wiring<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.520> that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
can't use it for the wiring but that

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.770 
can't use it for the wiring but that
doesn't<00:02:21.030> actually<00:02:21.090> work<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.600> mod<00:02:21.750> you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
doesn't actually work in this mod you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.110 
doesn't actually work in this mod you
create<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.290> by<00:02:22.410> doing<00:02:22.709> like<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.130> but<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.060> you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
create it by doing like this but as you

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460 
create it by doing like this but as you
can<00:02:24.209> see<00:02:24.270> nothing<00:02:24.720> comes<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.290> doesn't

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
can see nothing comes up so it doesn't

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.960 
can see nothing comes up so it doesn't
really<00:02:25.560> work<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:28.220> once<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.550> saw<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:29.790> just

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
really work so once we just saw we just

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.180 
really work so once we just saw we just
got<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.209> bronze<00:02:30.510> inga<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.080> through<00:02:31.680> outside

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
got this bronze inga out through outside

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.490 
got this bronze inga out through outside
there<00:02:32.630> I'll<00:02:33.630> show<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.900> how<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.110> all<00:02:34.260> works

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
there I'll show you how this all works

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.770 
there I'll show you how this all works
okay<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.220> time<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.700> test<00:02:35.970> each<00:02:36.330> one<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.660> these

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
okay so time to test each one of these

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.559 
okay so time to test each one of these
we<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.489> pickaxe<00:02:38.850> here<00:02:39.030> actually<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
we have the pickaxe here actually the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.050 
we have the pickaxe here actually the
cobblestone<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:41.010> mines<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.400> pretty<00:02:41.700> much<00:02:41.819> as

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
cobblestone that mines is pretty much as

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.570 
cobblestone that mines is pretty much as
just<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.480> bit<00:02:42.630> faster<00:02:42.840> than<00:02:43.200> them<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:43.860> iron

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
just a bit faster than them then iron

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.090 
just a bit faster than them then iron
and<00:02:44.819> there<00:02:45.600> we<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.430> speed<00:02:49.100> see

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
and there we have this the the speed see

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.040 
and there we have this the the speed see
how<00:02:50.190> fast<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.519> goes<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.000> finally<00:02:51.690> we<00:02:51.780> have

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
how fast that goes and finally we have

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.290 
how fast that goes and finally we have
the<00:02:52.590> wood<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:55.610> very<00:02:56.610> nice<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.910> fast<00:02:57.060> I

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
the wood so this very nice and fast I

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.970 
the wood so this very nice and fast I
