 But simulation was never the focus of 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.960
 english but rather the mixture 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.880
 from comprehensible pseudo

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.710
 All knitted solid and judged 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.390
 getting ready for the mass audience 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.730

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.989

 apron or advertising for a publisher 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.660
 a rather uncommon behavior 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.970
 while the trabi is a title 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 history it appears as litter of the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.140
 But dirt is a ghost 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.140

 the continuous game series on hip 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.950
 you get after the events team updates 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.780
 which have the same effect as bonuses 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.690
 Low weight reduction of the car 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.940
 or other upgrades detailgrad 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.830
 noticeable in the gameplay 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.510
 codemasters simulates physically 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.910
 driving the mechanics of the rally correctly 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.010
 as well as the influences of the underground the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.440
 drought on a sunny wet day 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.860
 Snow and rain on a cloudy day 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.690
 case 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.610
 These factors have a direct influence 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.130
 on the ride under mirror feels 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.120
 at all is the control 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.830
 excellent thanks to jet 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.460
 Vibration function has the feeling 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.620
 Every floor wave can be felt there rallys 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.210
 Gameplay is clearly isolation genre 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.950
 to classify and operate these 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.450
 alignment but not the part 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.910
 Setting the vehicle setup are 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.710
 possible however after telemetry option 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.200
 and similar searches will be disappointed and 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.880
 referred to other titles besides the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.560
 Career mode with championship race 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.780
 and online events daily 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.950
 weekly and monthly online 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.230
 There are also challenges to offer 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.610
 lie and individual events lie 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.370
 enable championship with 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.360
 invited players like girlfriend 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.470
 individual events leave the players 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.880
 route and weather decide 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.650
 Regarding the courage per modes should still 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.290
 be mentioned that this so far only 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.700
 the synchronous form is offered 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.410
 Implementation of a direct 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.239
 simultaneous pvp game mode 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.330
 or other competitive 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.980
 game modes should follow in august 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.020
 The graphic wins at first glance 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.940
 no beauty the textures 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.250
 come a bit muddy therefore and the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.470
 Public models are for the year 2015 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.790
 too simple 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.739
 but who pays attention during the ride 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.420
 on such details what it is 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.920
 rally game really matters is 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.860
 grandiose realized 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.540
 already fit in the early access 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.970
 for example, on the topic of weather showed 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.920
 used graphic engine steel hard muckis 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.440
 and as currently a stable frame rate 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.540
 the 60 fps run at 10 80 p even at 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.280
 medium strong hardware guarantees the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.239
 cockpit view of the vehicles ensures 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.280
 great version 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.080
 especially when rain snow or 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.030
 Dust the windshield or the 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.030
 Bolide through streams or deep puddles 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.390
 with dirt track at a legend again 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.700
 back to home screens 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.709
 it relies on the erstwhile strengths of 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.360
 colin mcrae series extends this, however 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.580
 courageous and with technical possibilities 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.350
 the game modern there is no annoying 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.690
 announce in the main menu and no 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.370
 imposed on the hip is the result 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.590
 is a hardcore racing game for 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.780
 rally fans that do not shy away from it 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.910
 elements that are as realistic as possible 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.380
 how damping wheelbase live underground 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.690
 and to use weathering 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.300
 It also looks easy for the time being 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.160
 word choice saugeil when stock stone 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.970
 and mud in blatant curves through the 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.760
 shoot air 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.919
 the 36 routes offer enough content 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.110
 for the next few weeks to months with it 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.490
 the different weather conditions 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.690
 arise some stretched versions the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.419
 different on the 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.270
 Game experience training of the early 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.650
 access release be clever move 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.150
 codemasters are gradually new 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.070
 content such as cars or trains 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.450

 Gameplay and the Thai rallye is 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.620
 a positive example for coming 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.510
 early access offers in its present 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.880
 form many contents for little money 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.780
 and can rally fans technically like 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.780
