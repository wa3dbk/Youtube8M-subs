really cool great job they've done so
far<00:01:38.490> looks<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> whole<00:01:39.570> world<00:01:39.750> still

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
far looks like the whole world still

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.230 
far looks like the whole world still
rendering<00:01:40.290> which<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.250> insane<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:42.030> got<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
rendering which is insane it's got that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.270 
rendering which is insane it's got that
 up<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.350> bed<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.950> you're

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
 up there the bed you know you're

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.569 
 up there the bed you know you're
like<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> toy<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.890> honey<00:01:47.340> get

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
like the toy so is this like a honey get

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.039 
like the toy so is this like a honey get
up<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.850> anyway<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> don't<00:01:48.570> even<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.840> them

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
up there anyway I don't even know them

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.139 
up there anyway I don't even know them
in<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> way<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:50.040> go<00:01:50.130> onto<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> bed<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
in a way to go onto the bed I'm to the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.060 
in a way to go onto the bed I'm to the
some<00:01:51.360> sort<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.259> anyway<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:53.009> looks

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
some sort of way but anyway it looks

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
some sort of way but anyway it looks
like<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.340> still<00:01:53.430> generating<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.299> these

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
like it's still generating go all these

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.410 
like it's still generating go all these
drawers<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:55.079> all<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.040> stuff<00:01:56.340> very<00:01:57.119> cool
