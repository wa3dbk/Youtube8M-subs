00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
 for 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.130
 1 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.110
 the first step the collection of milk 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.360
 so eventually we can deduce that they produce every two days 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.789
 the friend of the trucks 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.149
 so who is supplying the machined before dirhams enough in the technical language 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.610
 let go of the producers 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.540
 and there is so he brings the collective to bring it to the isi yes the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.310
 store many large tents 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.210
 the big time of big cisterns 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.579
 then the man's milk undergoes and receive a treatment that will 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.090
 the most prepared 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.090
 at M 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.270
 against the mans 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.930
 it's through culture is actually you write it 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.700
 m fat 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.280
 because the cream next 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 and then it was therefore necessary for this credit 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.370
 for nothing in the world the first operation must be an operation of 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.330
 of heating 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.270
 does she have pasteurization 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.620
 pasteurization must heat the milk about 1 85 90 degrees what will 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.270
 allow to have to achieve to get rid of them 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.700
 any possible bad germs bad bacteria that could 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.430
 who could be there 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 the legacy to pass in a geoffroy-guichard which is the refrain says 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.020
 the temperature at which farms can be added 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 but the 'clean' states of the funeral making right now 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.220
 therefore a lactic fermentation 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.930
 polio these few hours 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.490
 kessÃ© a few hours for the fromage frais it's longer 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.040
 then it is necessary that the power 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.060
 the weight is maintained at the correct fermentation temperature a level 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.010
 very stable to allow the development of tim halliday of 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.259
 bacteria and demons are closing 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.079
 quick who make who will make the yogurts 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.079
 what is fruit yogurt by mixing makes the ingredients 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.129
 ingredients the fruits or even other ingredients like 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.559
 mixed cereals 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:26.469
 after 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.449
 after the fermentation of white cheeses and pastry cooks 5% will 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.349
 also fermented products 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.659
 and in the manufacture of different titles 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.739
 that of yoghurt that is to say we will separate a little like for cheese 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.469
 the part that was made up 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.449
 of the whey workshop to have removed the little lake these are called 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:51.379
 dresses only entering industrial language is called centrifugation 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 no dripping 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.639
 milk desserts fresson 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.659
 also fresh dairy products this then says manufacturing process 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.429
 is a little different 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:08.560
 from that of the Swiss small fresh cheeses and then rise 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.830
 there the texture the thickness the consistency of these products is obtained 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.340
 by adding ingredients that will allow us to buy them this book 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.180
 the artisan of water extracted from corn or from one of the potatoes 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:24.829
 then as for the choice of starch% and on the moment the starch will swell 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.279
 the starch not been cyr the whole street of the preparation it's going to give me 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:35.439
 so-called texture of art and consistency to the product released 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.299
 the process is almost ancestral yes because we were inspired in the 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.689
 industrial manufacture 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.069
 of what has been done naturally for thousands of years 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.889
 on the other hand obviously there will always be a lot of research on the 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.019
 manufacturing of his products with several voices at several levels 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.189
 on the quality of milk first itself and then mostly we work 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.989
 a lot a lot about ferments 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.919
 on these famous% small good bacteria to hear about and who do 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.779
 the subject of two hermann search
