you know it could go in the kitchen and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.380 
you know it could go in the kitchen and
you<00:02:44.890> could<00:02:45.130> use<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.400> as<00:02:45.670> sort<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.030> center

island<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.989> like<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.590> fact<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:47.890> these<00:02:48.040> have

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
island I like the fact that these have

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.650 
island I like the fact that these have
Castor's<00:02:48.940> or<00:02:49.090> at<00:02:49.150> least<00:02:49.270> one<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.510> them<00:02:49.630> has

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
Castor's or at least one of them has

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.059 
Castor's or at least one of them has
casters<00:02:50.260> on<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.650> could<00:02:50.770> move<00:02:50.890> it

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
casters on it so you could move it

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.530 
casters on it so you could move it
around

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
around

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.140 
around
and<00:02:51.629> then<00:02:51.959> these<00:02:52.200> are<00:02:52.939> probably<00:02:53.939> more

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and then these are probably more

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.920 
and then these are probably more
serviceable<00:02:54.840> they're<00:02:55.230> just<00:02:55.439> damn<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.129> stripe

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
serviceable they're just damn a stripe

these<00:03:51.209> I've<00:03:51.510> got<00:03:51.659> a<00:03:51.690> collection<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.349> these<00:03:52.500> I

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
these I've got a collection of these I

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.559 
these I've got a collection of these I
think<00:03:53.370> I've<00:03:53.489> got<00:03:53.670> five<00:03:53.940> hanging<00:03:54.389> in<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
think I've got five hanging in the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.229 
think I've got five hanging in the
bathroom<00:03:54.750> already<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.799> little<00:03:56.639> overkill<00:03:57.060> on

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
bathroom already so little overkill on

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.000 
bathroom already so little overkill on
that<00:03:57.449> so<00:03:57.599> there's<00:03:57.780> no<00:03:57.870> reason<00:03:58.199> to<00:03:58.230> them<00:03:58.500> gee<00:03:58.859> I

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
that so there's no reason to them gee I

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.650 
that so there's no reason to them gee I
guess<00:03:59.129> it's<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.489> little<00:03:59.760> dresser<00:04:00.269> but<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.540> guess

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
guess it's a little dresser but I guess

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.390 
guess it's a little dresser but I guess
you<00:04:00.780> could<00:04:00.900> use<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.349> in<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.500> tiny<00:04:01.739> dining<00:04:02.190> or<00:04:02.310> I'm

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
you could use it in a tiny dining or I'm

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.839 
you could use it in a tiny dining or I'm
good<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.790> don't<00:04:03.389> see<00:04:03.599> why<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.810> couldn't<00:04:04.849> well

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
these days I think different uses of

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.229 
these days I think different uses of
yeah<00:04:08.280> mix<00:04:08.669> it<00:04:08.849> all<00:04:09.000> up

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
yeah mix it all up

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.689 
yeah mix it all up
makes<00:04:10.169> it<00:04:10.319> a<00:04:10.349> lot<00:04:10.440> more<00:04:10.500> interesting<00:04:11.129> I
