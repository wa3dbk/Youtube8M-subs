00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.669
 it feels 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.900
 if so 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.080
 we continue from the surgical center 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.610
 rosary and we are next to the doctor 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.070
 guillermo being one of the surgeons 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.349
 most recognized of the rosary and the area 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.170
 actually more reliable doctor is a 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.630
 I'm glad to be here again and really 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.160
 this credit is not in vain because 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.900
 we talked before not outside of camera 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.759
 the importance of taking each patient 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.500
 in integral form no and good so 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.180
 welcome good many thanks for 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.190
 your concept in many thanks and today 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.899
 talking about moms and the size of 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.620
 the moms we had behind on the screen 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.330
 just a well-known actress vedette 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.890
 young lady that's how the faucet is 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.140
 she has got good moms of a size 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.270
 very important and what this means 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.490
 brought to the society the comment of 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.290
 this hearing is wrong beyond 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.020
 social part that is not in the concept 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.330
 from each one know about the clinical part 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.060
 clear from the point of view of impact 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.390
 media was terrible because all the 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.790
 media talked about this situation but 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.549
 from the point of view of the surgery 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.439
 the surgeons what we belong to the 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.630
 Argentine society of surgery and others 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.450
 we have a rather harmonic concept 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.100
 and we think that decide the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.799
 size of the breast implant is a 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.619
 hard work deciding the size no no 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.880
 must say the size happily for the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.470
 desire but you have to measure 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.299
 specifically what is the anatomy of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 every patient if I have a patient 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.369
 to make the singles of a plant 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.799
 that has a thorax measuring 24 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.929
 centimeters bone 12 centimeters each 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.959
 side I'm not going to go to buy a 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.759
 prosthesis that has a base of 14 because 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.220
 if it is not going to be evident that they are going to 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.830
 get out from under the arm as we see in 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.929
 these cases then it's not that I can 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.670
 choose the size and it's not the same 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.439
 someone who breastfeed and who had 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.500
 several children and that the skin has it 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.899
 stretched where no doubt will enter a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.569
 larger prosthesis instead on 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.360
 patients who do not have children for more 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.299
 wishing a large implant one would 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.870
 have to warn that the presence of 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.209
 striae will be almost inevitable 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.080
 violent stretching of that skin is going to 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.320
 achieve 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.560
 everywhere or worse yet it's going to be that 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.050
 the suture where is where we put 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.870
 implant the cut open the incision 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.430
 due to the exaggerated tension then 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.170
 the best advice for all 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.840
 patients who are thinking about this 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.390
 issue of breast implants is that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.880
 charlene with her surgeons take the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.560
 measurements and look at the catalog all 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.330
 the companies that sell in prostheses 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.720
 they have a catalog that says for example 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.420
 the one with 300 cubic centimeters measures 12 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.060
 centimeters by 4 centimeters of me 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.770
 I look in the thorax and if I'm 11 I'm not going to 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.420
 buy that time he buys from another but 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.830
 this for a matter let's say medical 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.870
 aesthetics now well if to this patient 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.540
 as in this case he likes moms 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.480
 exaggerated because it is a symptom a 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.840
 symbol of sexuality or sex appeal what 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.780
 What does a doctor do to this? 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.730
 patient comes and raises me that he wants to 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.860
 this age and with the sector to expose 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.750
 this size of moms I personally will 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.630
 I say no because the risk that I am 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.550
 running is a lot from the point of 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.660
 medical view that the wound is opened 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.370
 to tear 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.800
 muscle and from the point of view 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.410
 aesthetic I know that hundreds of women 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.300
 they know me they follow me if they think 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.620
 that I did this they will not come to me 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.100
 console me so from the point of 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.140
 seen even from my this work and 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.600
 from my economic concept to me is 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.160
 totally against who plays me if 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.690
 everyone thinks that this is what 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.970
 we do the plastic surgeon and this does not 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.530
 is what we do and I talk about it 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.670
 patient who wants that size there is 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.050
 surgeons who do not abstain from 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.930
 same way that if someone comes to me 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.610
 ask him to put a giant lip like 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.920
 we saw now in magazines that a 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.500
 famous model of the 80s had to 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.570
 operate to take it out and good when I 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.300
 I came to pose that and look, this is not 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.960
 what I do because one has to read 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.920
 the works published in the journals 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.810
 international books and 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.060
 manuals where it clearly says this is not 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.890
 is done because it does not go with the body to see 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.540
 there are cases of teenagers who have 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.210
 many moms and they have to get out 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.180
 the for their risks of columns 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.990
 totally or let's go to the essence 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.830
 to plastic surgery cosmetic surgery 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:41.880
 aims to imitate with techniques 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.180
 surgical imitate the harmonic imitate 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.509
 the beauty is aimed at 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.490
 plastic surgery mimic the grotesque 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.320
 So, if I 'm a plastic surgeon, 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.500
 jacto action as platico have to 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.870
 understand beauty and not what is 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.580
 about exposed that's why we 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.229
 love when we come and chat with 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.910
 serious professionals because they make the 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.800
 profession a teaching not and actually 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.410
 this here is seen in the surgical center 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.210
 rosary because they really have very in 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.440
 account to the person there are people who 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.780
 they feel very safe how they are 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.759
 fantastic and the one that not today that you 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.199
 upset in society at work in 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.599
 your personal life is necessary to have 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.580
 people who advise him suddenly what 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.430
 necessary to be in harmony 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.750
 if you notice that I also like 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.210
 that I think there are many people who 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.539
 it does not occur to him to think about a surgery or 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.960
 in aesthetics but in reality it is the 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.090
 minority group because it's enough that 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.990
 any of us notice the diary 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.510
 in any 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.670
 announcement where they ask for work first 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.920
 what figure is to have good presence 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.560
 narcissistic sister and then yes I 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.780
 I need this to work to be 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.910
 comfortable partnership to get a partner 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.770
 for others because I'm going to deny this 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.360
 possibility if total I have to evaluate 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.670
 what we call the equation 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.190
 aesthetic where on the one hand I have to 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.900
 put the chances of success that I'm going 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.510
 to achieve and on the other hand I have to see 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.070
 what are the risks if the possibility 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.990
 of success are much greater than 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.730
 minimum risk that I run is worth it 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.050
 try it and is not re case either to 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.000
 men who like moms so 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.040
 big or nothing clear when I look 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.560
 when I looked at this magazine I got 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.810
 they argue that if this girl 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.580
 we put in the middle of the court when 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.090
 the fans arrive, we will all be 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:27.120
 fantastic but let's see how many go 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.520
 to decide to have her as a partner to 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.380
 all life true then if my daughter 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.450
 this is what I'm going to tell my daughter 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.990
 me the daughter think it because it can be very 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.760
 striking and attractive a few hours later 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.889
 can hardly carry the boys 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.419
 to school to the garden by the hand 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.039
 balance is the hardest thing to 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.930
 achieve you do not hear what is necessary 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.770
 doctor many thanks to a taste 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.770
 thank you very much for coming
