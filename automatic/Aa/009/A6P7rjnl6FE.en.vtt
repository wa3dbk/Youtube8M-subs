light to cut in two volumes kind of like

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.650 
light to cut in two volumes kind of like
as<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> look<00:01:53.580> through<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.880> how<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.390> moves

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
as you look through it how it all moves

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.969 
as you look through it how it all moves
and<00:01:55.200> I've<00:01:55.290> always<00:01:55.380> been<00:01:55.530> intrigued<00:01:55.830> about

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and I've always been intrigued about

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.840 
and I've always been intrigued about
trying<00:01:56.400> to<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.970> painting<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> move<00:01:58.850> like

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
trying to get a painting to move like

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.000 
trying to get a painting to move like
the<00:02:00.090> image<00:02:00.420> moves<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.960> you're<00:02:01.110> walking<00:02:01.620> in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
the image moves when you're walking in

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.360 
the image moves when you're walking in
in<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.790> dense<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.960> dense<00:02:04.229> walk<00:02:04.530> park<00:02:05.130> like

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
in a dense you know dense walk park like

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.340 
in a dense you know dense walk park like
likely<00:02:06.210> no<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.540> fair<00:02:06.720> in<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:06.900> forbidden

likely no and the fair in the forbidden

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.260 
likely no and the fair in the forbidden
on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.130> forbidden<00:02:08.490> driver<00:02:08.729> something<00:02:09.149> like

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
on the forbidden driver something like

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.210 
on the forbidden driver something like
that<00:02:09.450> him<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.700> wasn't<00:02:11.880> really<00:02:12.180> possible

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
that him and that wasn't really possible

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.830 
that him and that wasn't really possible
but<00:02:14.220> what<00:02:14.490> was<00:02:14.610> probably<00:02:14.850> possible<00:02:15.600> when<00:02:15.750> I'm

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
but what was probably possible when I'm

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.510 
but what was probably possible when I'm
trying<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.350> here<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.709> I'm<00:02:16.800> successful<00:02:17.370> to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
trying to do here and I'm successful to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.880 
trying to do here and I'm successful to
some<00:02:17.790> degree<00:02:17.959> instead<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.230> at<00:02:19.380> establish

different pains and different
reflectivity<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.280> sectors<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.900> moved

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
reflectivity and sectors as you moved

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.890 
reflectivity and sectors as you moved
the<00:02:25.470> piece<00:02:26.070> appeared<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.700> move<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.450> would<00:02:27.660> come

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the piece appeared to move it would come

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.160 
the piece appeared to move it would come
into<00:02:28.170> focus<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.920> we'd<00:02:29.100> lose<00:02:29.310> focus<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.170> so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
into focus and we'd lose focus and so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.750 
into focus and we'd lose focus and so
they<00:02:31.350> just<00:02:31.500> start<00:02:31.709> they<00:02:31.980> start<00:02:32.220> building<00:02:32.640> all

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
they just start they start building all

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.490 
they just start they start building all
these<00:02:32.880> forms<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:33.510> when<00:02:34.020> I'm<00:02:34.110> looking<00:02:34.380> at

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
these forms and then when I'm looking at

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.990 
these forms and then when I'm looking at
the<00:02:34.590> botanical<00:02:35.100> forms<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.459> wanted<00:02:35.730> them<00:02:35.820> to

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the botanical forms I wanted them to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.130 
the botanical forms I wanted them to
look<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.270> little<00:02:36.420> bit<00:02:36.570> differently<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.930> want<00:02:37.050> to

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
look a little bit differently I want to

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.870 
look a little bit differently I want to
strip<00:02:37.380> them<00:02:37.470> down<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.010> was<00:02:38.489> part<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
strip them down so that was part of the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.340 
strip them down so that was part of the
computer<00:02:39.239> process<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.750> taking<00:02:39.900> them<00:02:40.170> down

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
computer process of taking them down

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.140 
computer process of taking them down
it's<00:02:40.860> stripping<00:02:41.190> them<00:02:41.400> down<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
it's stripping them down to like the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's stripping them down to like the
resent<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.630> lines<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.640> keep

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
resent you lines and so as you keep

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.310 
resent you lines and so as you keep
rolling<00:02:45.090> back<00:02:45.269> pulling<00:02:45.540> back<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.110> all<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
rolling back pulling back and all of a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.199 
rolling back pulling back and all of a
sudden<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.739> get<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.070> point<00:02:47.100> where<00:02:47.400> at<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
sudden you get to a point where at a

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.490 
sudden you get to a point where at a
certain<00:02:48.480> degree<00:02:48.720> you're<00:02:49.019> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
certain degree you're going to see the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.930 
certain degree you're going to see the
image<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.040> come<00:02:50.459> closer<00:02:50.700> you're

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
image and as you come closer you're

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.729 
image and as you come closer you're
going<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.120> lose<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.420> image<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:52.380> goes<00:02:52.560> back

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
going to lose the image that goes back

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.560 
going to lose the image that goes back
to<00:02:52.950> some<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.130> my<00:02:53.280> early<00:02:53.519> training<00:02:53.670> my<00:02:54.030> early

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
to some of my early training my early

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.539 
to some of my early training my early
interesting<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.920> comes<00:02:56.100> back<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.340> this

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
interesting and it comes back to this

his<00:03:24.299> brush<00:03:24.600> stroke<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.049> see<00:03:25.200> paint<00:03:25.500> and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.620 
strokes and all that did you pull back
it<00:03:28.410> just<00:03:28.680> comes<00:03:28.890> into<00:03:29.100> focus<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.360> was

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
it just comes into focus and so that was

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.600 
it just comes into focus and so that was

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
of my artwork and my painting you know

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.950 
of my artwork and my painting you know
and<00:03:45.540> way<00:03:46.049> bagon<00:03:46.320> grad<00:03:46.590> school

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
and way bagon grad school

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.650 
and way bagon grad school
that<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.650> had<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:47.950> French<00:03:48.250> palette<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.420> for

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
that I had this French palette and for

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.120 
that I had this French palette and for
some<00:03:49.810> reason<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:50.170> wasn't<00:03:50.440> very<00:03:50.470> nice<00:03:50.800> very

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
some reason that wasn't very nice very

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.340 
some reason that wasn't very nice very
good<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:52.270> I<00:03:52.300> thought<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.690> this<00:03:52.840> painting<00:03:53.110> show

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
good so I thought in this painting show

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.720 
good so I thought in this painting show
the<00:03:53.620> original<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.130> what<00:03:54.340> was<00:03:54.430> left<00:03:54.550> over

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
the original this is what was left over

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.400 
the original this is what was left over
from<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.060> original<00:03:55.420> thought<00:03:55.750> about<00:03:55.960> this<00:03:56.140> two

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
from the original thought about this two

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.080 
from the original thought about this two
years<00:03:56.680> going<00:03:56.980> into<00:03:57.130> painting<00:03:57.430> gonna<00:03:57.820> be<00:03:57.910> about

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
years going into painting gonna be about

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.060 
years going into painting gonna be about
painting<00:03:58.450> one<00:03:58.660> big<00:03:58.900> image<00:03:59.230> was<00:03:59.740> going<00:03:59.920> to<00:03:59.980> be

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
painting one big image was going to be

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.510 
painting one big image was going to be
all<00:04:00.250> dedicated<00:04:01.020> around<00:04:02.020> her<00:04:02.260> or<00:04:02.740> push<00:04:03.070> by<00:04:03.340> this

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.530 
painting by fragonard Eugene fragonard
eighteen<00:04:05.740> century<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.820> was<00:04:06.850> called<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.210> swing

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
eighteen century it was called a swing

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
eighteen century it was called a swing
and<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:09.430> little<00:04:10.240> bit<00:04:10.330> about<00:04:10.480> its<00:04:10.690> content<00:04:11.260> that

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
and a little bit about its content that

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.990 
and a little bit about its content that
was<00:04:11.680> interested<00:04:12.100> in<00:04:12.190> but<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.400> was<00:04:12.580> also<00:04:12.670> really

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
was interested in but I was also really

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.060 
was interested in but I was also really
interested<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.050> kind<00:04:14.860> of<00:04:14.920> like

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
interested in and that kind of like

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.820 
interested in and that kind of like
softness<00:04:15.520> that<00:04:15.760> wasn't<00:04:16.420> that<00:04:16.510> color<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.350> so

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
softness that wasn't that color and so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.530 
softness that wasn't that color and so
that<00:04:18.160> was<00:04:18.310> kind<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.640> letting<00:04:18.910> impetus<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.300> push

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
that was kind of letting impetus to push

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.440 
that was kind of letting impetus to push
all<00:04:19.750> this<00:04:19.900> long<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:21.850> just<00:04:22.030> kept<00:04:22.270> moving

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
all this long and so I just kept moving

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.630 
all this long and so I just kept moving
that<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.020> then<00:04:23.140> that<00:04:23.590> turns<00:04:23.860> into<00:04:24.100> these<00:04:24.400> big

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
that and then that turns into these big

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.900 
that and then that turns into these big
color<00:04:24.910> fields<00:04:25.390> of<00:04:25.680> my<00:04:26.680> French<00:04:26.980> palette<00:04:27.400> and

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
color fields of my French palette and

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.460 
color fields of my French palette and
then<00:04:28.060> breaking<00:04:28.330> them<00:04:28.570> into<00:04:28.780> different<00:04:28.960> colors

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
then breaking them into different colors

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.890 
then breaking them into different colors
and<00:04:29.680> then<00:04:30.400> building<00:04:30.700> his<00:04:30.850> gradients<00:04:31.450> in<00:04:31.600> and

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
and then building his gradients in and

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.690 
and then building his gradients in and
working<00:04:32.440> them<00:04:32.650> in<00:04:32.740> groups<00:04:32.890> of<00:04:33.130> painting<00:04:33.520> like

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
working them in groups of painting like

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.850 
working them in groups of painting like
big<00:04:33.880> color<00:04:34.150> fields<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.750> then<00:04:34.840> screening<00:04:35.710> the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
big color fields and then screening the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.410 
big color fields and then screening the
botanical<00:04:36.700> images<00:04:37.030> over<00:04:37.270> top<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.510> them<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:39.420> so

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
botanical images over top of them and so

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.520 
botanical images over top of them and so
there<00:04:40.600> was<00:04:40.690> something<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.020> had<00:04:41.260> a<00:04:41.290> great

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
there was something that had a great
