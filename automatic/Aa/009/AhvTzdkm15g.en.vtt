00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
done here in the video garden for the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.350 
done here in the video garden for the
for<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:05.940> pathways<00:00:07.340> essentially<00:00:08.340> what<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.240> did

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
for the pathways essentially what we did

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.850 
for the pathways essentially what we did
was<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:09.719> got<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.900> whole<00:00:10.110> bunch<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.380> tan<00:00:10.590> bark

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
was we got a whole bunch of tan bark

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.189 
was we got a whole bunch of tan bark
mulch<00:00:11.099> as<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:11.849> see<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:13.049> stuff<00:00:13.259> here<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
mulch as you can see this stuff here and

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.730 
mulch as you can see this stuff here and
we<00:00:16.199> also<00:00:16.379> got<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.039> few<00:00:17.699> rolls<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.240> weed<00:00:18.570> mat<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
we also got a few rolls of weed mat and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.529 
we also got a few rolls of weed mat and
we've<00:00:19.890> laid<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.279> weed<00:00:20.460> mat<00:00:20.699> out<00:00:20.880> between<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
we've laid the weed mat out between the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.490 
we've laid the weed mat out between the
veggie<00:00:22.199> garden<00:00:22.650> beds<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.420> then<00:00:24.420> put<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
veggie garden beds and then put the the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.609 
veggie garden beds and then put the the
the<00:00:26.130> mulch<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.580> top<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.080> found<00:00:28.320> is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the mulch on top and what we found is

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
the mulch on top and what we found is
this<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.070> area<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.609> pretty<00:00:29.910> heavily<00:00:30.119> weeded

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
this this area was pretty heavily weeded

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.430 
this this area was pretty heavily weeded
pretty<00:00:31.590> heavily<00:00:31.890> overgrown<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.899> cacao<00:00:33.899> you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
pretty heavily overgrown with cacao you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
pretty heavily overgrown with cacao you
know<00:00:34.530> sort<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.860> grass<00:00:35.100> sort<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.000> very<00:00:36.210> um

invasive<00:00:37.350> type<00:00:37.559> grasses<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.280> we've<00:00:39.000> found

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
invasive type grasses and we've found

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.080 
invasive type grasses and we've found
that<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.590> combination<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> weed<00:00:41.610> mat<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that the combination of the weed mat and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.459 
that the combination of the weed mat and
the<00:00:42.960> mulch<00:00:43.260> has<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:45.079> stopped<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> weeds

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the mulch has really stopped the weeds

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.990 
the mulch has really stopped the weeds
from<00:00:46.710> coming<00:00:46.800> through<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> large<00:00:47.789> degree

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
from coming through to a large degree

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.330 
from coming through to a large degree
they<00:00:48.750> still<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.140> come<00:00:49.410> through<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.250> me

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
they still do come through don't get me

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
they still do come through don't get me
wrong<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.420> we've<00:00:52.289> got<00:00:52.350> some

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
wrong you can see here we've got some

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.430 
wrong you can see here we've got some
weeds<00:00:52.890> coming<00:00:53.280> through<00:00:53.660> but<00:00:54.660> they<00:00:54.840> are<00:00:54.989> much

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
weeds coming through but they are much

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.160 
weeds coming through but they are much
easier<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:56.039> pull<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.449> than<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:57.899> then

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
easier to pull up than they would then

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.360 
easier to pull up than they would then
there<00:00:58.320> would<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.859> didn't<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
there would be if we didn't have the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.860 
there would be if we didn't have the
weed<00:00:59.550> map<00:00:59.760> so<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.329> grabbed<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.660> weed

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
weed map so if I just grabbed this weed

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.270 
weed map so if I just grabbed this weed
there<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:01.949> go

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
there we go

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.820 
there we go
pulled<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.719> they're<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.199> easy<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.680> just

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
pulled up so they're very easy to just

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.080 
pulled up so they're very easy to just
pull<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:07.220> because<00:01:08.220> they<00:01:08.580> can't<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.030> good

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
pull out because they can't get a good

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
pull out because they can't get a good
root<00:01:09.630> system<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:11.220> below<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
root system in because just below the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.920 
root system in because just below the
surface<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.659> dig<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> bit<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.330> this

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
surface if I dig down a bit is this this

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.399 
surface if I dig down a bit is this this
weed<00:01:16.200> map<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:17.540> did<00:01:18.540> pull<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
weed map I did pull out some of the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
weed map I did pull out some of the
weeds<00:01:19.560> before<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.100> put<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> down<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> be

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
weeds before we put it down but to be

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.170 
weeds before we put it down but to be
honest<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> second<00:01:23.430> half<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.970> veggie

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
honest for the second half of the veggie

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.370 
honest for the second half of the veggie
garden<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.170> quite<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
garden because you can see it's quite a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.469 
garden because you can see it's quite a
large<00:01:25.619> area<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.030> got<00:01:27.150> sick<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.420> tired

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
large area I kind of got sick and tired

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.539 
large area I kind of got sick and tired
of<00:01:27.659> doing<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.070> put<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> weed

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
of doing that so we just put the weed

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.920 
of doing that so we just put the weed
map<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.939> straight<00:01:30.299> over<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> top<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
map down straight over the top of the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.560 
map down straight over the top of the
grass<00:01:31.520> my<00:01:32.520> theory<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.450> going

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
grass my theory is that it's just going

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
grass my theory is that it's just going
to<00:01:33.630> kill<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> grass<00:01:34.110> anyway<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.340> why<00:01:35.520> bother

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to kill the grass anyway so why bother

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
to kill the grass anyway so why bother
pulling<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:37.470> honesty<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
pulling it out and in all honesty it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
pulling it out and in all honesty it
really<00:01:38.790> makes<00:01:39.000> no<00:01:39.210> difference<00:01:39.390> from<00:01:40.170> what

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
really makes no difference from what

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.969 
really makes no difference from what
I've<00:01:40.500> seen<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.259> was<00:01:43.470> recommending

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I've seen so if if I was recommending

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.749 
I've seen so if if I was recommending
someone<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
someone do this

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.880 
someone do this
don't<00:01:45.600> bother<00:01:45.780> too<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.439> pulling<00:01:46.799> out

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
don't bother too much about pulling out

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
don't bother too much about pulling out
all<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> grass<00:01:47.369> certainly<00:01:48.180> try<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.570> level<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
all the grass certainly try and level it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.530 
all the grass certainly try and level it
out<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.939> wasn't<00:01:50.939> too<00:01:51.119> fussy

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
out a bit if you can I wasn't too fussy

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
out a bit if you can I wasn't too fussy
about<00:01:51.570> making<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.229> perfectly<00:01:52.619> level<00:01:52.979> because

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
about making it perfectly level because

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
about making it perfectly level because
we<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.119> sort<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> natural

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
we are going for that sort of natural

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.280 
we are going for that sort of natural
look<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.799> want<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.159> look<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.960> native

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
look we want it to look like a native

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.679 
look we want it to look like a native
sort<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.740> garden<00:01:59.100> type<00:01:59.909> area<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.509> having

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
sort of garden type area so having

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.050 
sort of garden type area so having
perfectly<00:02:01.259> flat<00:02:01.439> paths<00:02:02.070> wasn't<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
perfectly flat paths wasn't really a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.800 
perfectly flat paths wasn't really a
priority<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.780> us<00:02:03.810> but

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.749 

filling<00:02:07.650> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> big<00:02:08.009> holes<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.460> getting<00:02:08.580> rid

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
filling in the big holes and getting rid

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.100 
filling in the big holes and getting rid
of<00:02:08.820> those<00:02:08.940> big<00:02:09.179> bumps<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.690> obviously

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
of those big bumps is obviously

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.470 
of those big bumps is obviously
something<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.649> need<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.100> see<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.360> can

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
something you need to do see as you can

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.960 
something you need to do see as you can
see<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.040> pathway<00:02:14.040> stretches<00:02:14.670> all<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.850> way

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
see the pathway stretches all the way

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.050 
see the pathway stretches all the way
down<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.340> an<00:02:17.550> area<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.880> we

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
down here and this is an area that we

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.410 
down here and this is an area that we
haven't<00:02:18.240> really<00:02:19.130> completed<00:02:20.130> yet<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.330> I'll

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
haven't really completed yet and I'll

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.760 
haven't really completed yet and I'll
just<00:02:21.600> take<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> edge

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
just take you to the edge

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.910 
just take you to the edge
my<00:02:23.100> latest<00:02:23.280> edge<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.600> can<00:02:24.810> see<00:02:25.020> here<00:02:25.350> we've

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
my latest edge so you can see here we've

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.400 
my latest edge so you can see here we've
got<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:27.090> mulch<00:02:27.300> sitting<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.020> top<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.230> this

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
got the mulch sitting on top of this

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.350 
got the mulch sitting on top of this
weed<00:02:28.680> map<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.310> underneath<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.850> weed<00:02:30.000> mat<00:02:30.180> is

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
weed map and underneath the weed mat is

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.740 
weed map and underneath the weed mat is
the<00:02:30.570> grass<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.990> just<00:02:31.020> still<00:02:31.410> there<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:33.090> that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the grass is just still there and that

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.240 
the grass is just still there and that
will<00:02:33.930> just<00:02:34.170> die<00:02:34.350> off<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.830> next<00:02:35.070> few<00:02:35.220> weeks

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
will just die off in the next few weeks

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.870 
will just die off in the next few weeks
and<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.920> shouldn't<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.340> too<00:02:38.550> many<00:02:38.670> problems

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
and we shouldn't have too many problems

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.850 
and we shouldn't have too many problems
with<00:02:39.150> weeds<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.930> said<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.230> weed<00:02:40.380> still<00:02:40.709> do

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
with weeds as I said the weed still do

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.130 
with weeds as I said the weed still do
come<00:02:41.040> up<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.489> spots<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.120> that's<00:02:42.630> from<00:02:42.810> seeds

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
come up in spots but that's from seeds

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.890 
come up in spots but that's from seeds
that<00:02:43.350> have<00:02:43.470> landed<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> mulch<00:02:45.750> and

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
that have landed in the in the mulch and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.390 
that have landed in the in the mulch and
have<00:02:46.050> managed<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.350> somehow<00:02:46.709> get<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> bit<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
have managed to somehow get a bit of a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.270 
have managed to somehow get a bit of a
foothold<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.000> sprout<00:02:48.930> but<00:02:49.860> they're<00:02:50.040> very

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
foothold and sprout but they're very

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.800 
foothold and sprout but they're very
easy<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.760> pull<00:02:50.940> out<00:02:51.090> because<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.600> mulch

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
easy to pull out because the mulch

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.330 
easy to pull out because the mulch
doesn't<00:02:52.140> give<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.350> any<00:02:52.470> support<00:02:52.920> at<00:02:53.010> all<00:02:53.450> and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
doesn't give it any support at all and

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.880 
doesn't give it any support at all and
in<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.760> whole<00:02:57.000> area<00:02:57.300> we<00:02:57.930> don't<00:02:58.410> spend<00:02:58.680> too

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
in this whole area we don't spend too

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.560 
in this whole area we don't spend too
much<00:02:59.040> time<00:02:59.100> doing<00:02:59.370> weeding<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> paths<00:03:00.300> to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
much time doing weeding on the paths to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.180 
much time doing weeding on the paths to
be<00:03:00.660> honest<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.200> um<00:03:01.350> pretty<00:03:01.680> quick<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.040> easy

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
be honest it's um pretty quick and easy

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.070 
be honest it's um pretty quick and easy
job<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:02.820> as<00:03:03.209> you're<00:03:03.450> walking<00:03:03.720> along<00:03:03.900> if

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
job you just as you're walking along if

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.960 
job you just as you're walking along if
you<00:03:04.140> see<00:03:04.350> one<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.800> rip<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.040> out<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.370> it's

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you see one you just rip it out and it's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.040 
you see one you just rip it out and it's
done<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:07.020> yeah<00:03:08.010> if<00:03:08.790> you're<00:03:09.030> creating<00:03:09.810> paths

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
done so yeah if you're creating paths

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.690 
done so yeah if you're creating paths
I'd<00:03:10.320> highly<00:03:10.680> recommend<00:03:11.070> using<00:03:11.250> weed<00:03:11.519> mat

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
I'd highly recommend using weed mat

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.550 
I'd highly recommend using weed mat
underneath<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.330> know<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.810> lot<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.110> people<00:03:13.380> will

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
underneath I know a lot of people will

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.039 
underneath I know a lot of people will
say<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.370> doesn't<00:03:14.610> work<00:03:14.790> but<00:03:15.299> from<00:03:15.930> my

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
say that it it doesn't work but from my

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.780 
say that it it doesn't work but from my
experience<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:16.769> we<00:03:16.950> had<00:03:17.130> put<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.489> down

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
experience if we had put this down

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.300 
experience if we had put this down
straight<00:03:18.299> over<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.660> dirt<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.920> would<00:03:20.130> have

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
straight over the dirt we would have

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.509 
straight over the dirt we would have
weeds<00:03:20.670> galore<00:03:21.209> growing<00:03:21.959> through<00:03:22.200> here<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.430> it

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
weeds galore growing through here so it

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.380 
weeds galore growing through here so it
kind<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.820> depends<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.299> your<00:03:24.360> situation<00:03:25.190> but

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
kind of depends on your situation but

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.150 
kind of depends on your situation but
for<00:03:27.390> us<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.720> definitely<00:03:27.900> worked<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.769> of

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
for us it's definitely worked and of

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.650 
for us it's definitely worked and of
course<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.519> could<00:03:29.640> put<00:03:29.820> gravel<00:03:30.030> over<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.480> top

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
course you could put gravel over the top

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.170 
course you could put gravel over the top
instead<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:32.459> some<00:03:32.670> degree<00:03:32.940> I'd<00:03:33.030> almost

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
instead to some degree I'd almost

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.789 
instead to some degree I'd almost
recommend<00:03:33.750> using<00:03:33.900> gravel<00:03:34.320> instead<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
recommend using gravel instead of the

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.860 
recommend using gravel instead of the
mulch<00:03:35.010> because<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.970> mulch<00:03:36.180> will<00:03:36.420> break<00:03:36.660> down

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
mulch because the mulch will break down

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.630 
mulch because the mulch will break down
over<00:03:37.049> time<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.620> will<00:03:37.739> need<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.040> replace<00:03:38.370> it

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
over time and will need to replace it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.220
