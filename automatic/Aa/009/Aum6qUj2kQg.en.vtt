00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.640 
wanting to work so I'll do it this way
all<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.170> need<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> loop

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
all I need is a loop

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.789 
all I need is a loop
okay<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.090> there's<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.390> loop<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.780> there's<00:02:19.560> two

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
okay so there's my loop and there's two

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.160 
okay so there's my loop and there's two
screws<00:02:20.040> one<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.209> end<00:02:21.450> I'm<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.049> those

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
screws one on this end I'm one of those

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.140 
screws one on this end I'm one of those
sent<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:23.159> little<00:02:23.400> loom<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.819> got<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
sent and this little loom I got it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.610 
sent and this little loom I got it
Joanne's<00:02:24.709> like<00:02:25.709> really<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:26.640> cheap<00:02:27.409> and<00:02:28.409> I

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
Joanne's like really really cheap and I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.039 
Joanne's like really really cheap and I
had<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.799> coupon<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.580> under<00:02:30.209> five<00:02:30.390> bucks<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:30.930> was

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
had a coupon so under five bucks it was

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.039 
had a coupon so under five bucks it was
great<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:33.090> my<00:02:33.269> loop<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.629> I<00:02:33.690> have<00:02:33.840> that

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
great so I have my loop and I have that

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.080 
great so I have my loop and I have that
hooked<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.470> there<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.760> sketched

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
hooked right there and I just sketched

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.690 
hooked right there and I just sketched
some<00:02:36.750> drawings<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.440> I'm<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> do<00:02:38.069> this

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
some drawings and I'm going to do this

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.720 
some drawings and I'm going to do this
one<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.180> found<00:02:40.079> this<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.500> graph<00:02:40.980> paper<00:02:41.010> for

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
one I found this on graph paper for

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.490 
one I found this on graph paper for
beading<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.239> online<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.549> so<00:02:45.349> you<00:02:46.349> just

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
beading on online and so you just

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.319 
beading on online and so you just
printed<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.040> out<00:02:47.159> and<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.459> have<00:02:47.579> blank<00:02:47.849> pieces

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
printed it out and you have blank pieces

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.089 
printed it out and you have blank pieces
of<00:02:48.480> paper<00:02:48.599> so<00:02:49.019> I'm<00:02:49.319> going<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.859> horse

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
of paper so I'm going to do the horse

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.940 
of paper so I'm going to do the horse
and<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:51.150> design<00:02:51.690> right<00:02:51.870> here<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.650> haven't

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
and a design right here and I haven't

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.920 
and a design right here and I haven't
decided<00:02:53.190> what<00:02:53.459> color<00:02:53.579> I<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:53.879> sketched<00:02:54.629> out<00:02:54.870> I

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
decided what color I just sketched out I

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.650 
decided what color I just sketched out I
can<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:55.440> any<00:02:55.560> color<00:02:55.799> I<00:02:55.859> want<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.510> it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
can do it any color I want so I have it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.180 
can do it any color I want so I have it
16<00:02:58.650> by<00:02:59.220> 38<00:02:59.730> it<00:03:00.450> doesn't<00:03:00.780> matter<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.170> 38<00:03:01.709> what

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
16 by 38 it doesn't matter the 38 what

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.390 
16 by 38 it doesn't matter the 38 what
you<00:03:02.310> need<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.760> 16<00:03:03.450> wide<00:03:03.870> 16<00:03:04.799> beads<00:03:05.099> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
you need is the 16 wide 16 beads and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.000 
you need is the 16 wide 16 beads and
you're<00:03:05.730> going<00:03:05.849> to<00:03:05.879> do<00:03:06.120> one<00:03:06.870> more<00:03:06.900> thread<00:03:07.500> then

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
you're going to do one more thread then

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.199 
you're going to do one more thread then
you're<00:03:08.250> sixteen<00:03:08.760> bees<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.579> it's<00:03:11.760> sixteen

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
you're sixteen bees so if it's sixteen

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.119 
you're sixteen bees so if it's sixteen
beads<00:03:12.420> you're<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.720> do<00:03:12.870> sixteen<00:03:13.440> warp

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
beads you're going to do sixteen warp

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.399 
beads you're going to do sixteen warp
threads<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.569> I'm<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:16.019> going<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.260> go<00:03:16.379> through

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
threads so I'm just going to go through

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.860 
threads so I'm just going to go through
here<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.129> I'm<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:17.970> start<00:03:18.359> if<00:03:18.599> you<00:03:18.720> can

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
here and I'm going to start if you can

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.449 
here and I'm going to start if you can
see<00:03:19.109> this<00:03:24.019> I'm<00:03:25.019> going<00:03:25.169> to<00:03:25.260> start<00:03:25.530> going

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
see this I'm going to start going

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.789 
see this I'm going to start going
through<00:03:26.549> here<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:27.989> 17<00:03:29.690> there's<00:03:30.690> one<00:03:31.410> and

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
through here and do 17 there's one and

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.970 
through here and do 17 there's one and
the<00:03:32.400> first<00:03:32.609> one<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:32.910> always<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.599> double<00:03:34.139> just<00:03:34.739> to

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
the first one I always do double just to

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.319 
the first one I always do double just to
make<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.840> little<00:03:36.840> bit<00:03:37.019> thicker<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:39.060> kind

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
make it a little bit thicker and I kind

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.170 
make it a little bit thicker and I kind
of<00:03:39.389> try<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.660> keep<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.139> tension<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.799> same

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
of try to keep the tension the same

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.309 
of try to keep the tension the same
because<00:03:42.180> you'll<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.019> getting<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:45.810> tight<00:03:46.079> in<00:03:46.260> a

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
because you'll be getting it tight in a

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.710 
because you'll be getting it tight in a
minute<00:03:46.590> after<00:03:47.069> you<00:03:47.400> get<00:03:47.519> all<00:03:47.669> these<00:03:47.819> on<00:03:50.720> so

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
minute after you get all these on so

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.589 
minute after you get all these on so
that's<00:03:51.900> three<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.090> help<00:03:54.209> me<00:03:54.359> count

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
that's three and have to help me count

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.240 
that's three and have to help me count
because<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.989> will<00:03:55.169> forget<00:03:55.349> I'll<00:03:55.709> have<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:56.010> count

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
because I will forget I'll have to count

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:05.540 
because I will forget I'll have to count
them<00:03:56.400> you'll<00:03:56.549> watch<00:03:58.970> or

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.120 

five<00:04:09.510> just<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:11.140> best<00:04:11.290> thing<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.650> keeping<00:04:11.980> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
five just the best thing is keeping the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:19.650 
five just the best thing is keeping the
tension<00:04:12.430> good<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:17.730> can<00:04:18.730> kind<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.090> fill<00:04:19.329> it<00:04:19.480> with

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
tension good I can kind of fill it with

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.430 
tension good I can kind of fill it with
my<00:04:19.840> hand

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
my hand

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:30.540 
my hand
what<00:04:20.709> kind<00:04:20.980> of<00:04:21.040> tension<00:04:21.519> I<00:04:21.640> have<00:04:29.310> it's<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.370> lot

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
what kind of tension I have it's a lot

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.590 
what kind of tension I have it's a lot
of<00:04:30.580> fun<00:04:30.820> it's<00:04:31.600> pretty<00:04:31.870> easy<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:33.480> lot<00:04:34.480> of

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
of fun it's pretty easy to a lot of

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.050 
of fun it's pretty easy to a lot of
things<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:35.350> know<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.590> learn<00:04:36.070> but<00:04:36.430> I'm<00:04:36.700> taking

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
things to know and learn but I'm taking

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.990 
things to know and learn but I'm taking
a<00:04:37.120> Native<00:04:37.419> American<00:04:37.510> class<00:04:38.200> at<00:04:39.160> our<00:04:39.220> college

a Native American class at our college

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.420 
a Native American class at our college
here<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.570> doing<00:04:40.840> some<00:04:41.169> beadwork<00:04:41.410> also<00:04:42.160> I

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
here and doing some beadwork also I

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.210 
here and doing some beadwork also I
already<00:04:43.090> knew<00:04:43.210> how<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.390> loom<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.890> wanted<00:04:45.160> to

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
already knew how to loom but I wanted to
