00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.579
 but probably also need to congratulate 

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:03.659
 silver medals declined in this 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.569
 the country has been on the team here since after 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.670
 yesterday's finals what the girls said 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.699
 at all 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.479
 I do not know how the silver championship 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:12.849
 Europe 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.509
 but of course the structure was very bad 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.509
 because he 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 I think that we will win all the same remained on 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.880
 victory but unfortunately not enough because 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.449
 true 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.410
 but the forces did not have a lot given 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.410
 energy and generally myself here 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.129
 In a match with Latvia from Spain, we are very 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.550
 so heavy 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.640
 the way all this final turned out and to 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.690
 Unfortunately they did not have enough strength and also 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.390
 one war 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 of course not enough 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.490
 and so that these she came to us 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.950
 so everything changed the whole game and of course 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.930
 in the midst of the championship interfere so settled 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.530
 what is that particular style 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.590
 she came and had to cancel here 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.250
 so 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.890
 I think that one other imposed families 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.800
 first game lost against france then 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 IT has led to the fact that we have 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130
 there were three last games in a row each 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.810
 day and n rotation was not very big 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.540
 its main players 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.970
 tired and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.110
 exhausted on the final 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.140
 and since all the same, yes, you relate to the state 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080
 that only one of our svetlana abrosimova 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.130
 polsela lyashko national team is not enough 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.440
 I'm basically ready 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.220
 oh completely calm 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 and also because I know how it is 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.060
 with subjective 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.770
 I'm completely legal 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.580
 but certainly not the heels of our national team 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.710
 was the best in this European Championship 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.510
 I do not know that I am not informed that we are 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.240
 senior trainer she will become 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.560
 do you think goes from rotating prices in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 team riot but 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.190
 rate on rejuvenation that is, it is about 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.160
 full swing yesterday principle price world 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.150
 but we will again see that the bet is still 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.520
 many of our veterans on proven fighters 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.869
 Well, yes, you yourself have seen and watched 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.620
 yesterday's hunger and 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.340
 but I donâ€™t know yet the coaching staff 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.729
 admit there youth n 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.979
 play a lot I think that's all 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.759
 change because it's still early or 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.149
 it will be necessary later to introduce new forces in 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.239
 team here and he don't know when 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.279
 will happen but I think that will happen soon 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:25.289
 in the last question you can talk about 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.169
 that our team got stronger after exactly 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.179
 from Europe and the World Cup all 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:30.959
 there may be the biggest 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:31.949
 result 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.430
 I do not know 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.270
 could we become stronger 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.030
 ostensibly in principle I do not see any increase 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.189
 and naturally gate 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.189
 began to play worse than before 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.229
 he didn't know about pure drawing and we all 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.249
 victories were given very hard July and 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.989
 in the same france we won before 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.329
 and now we lost 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.409
 Well, I do not know need to analyze the course 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.699
 just an hour 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.769
 hard to say here on 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.769
 I'm certainly not very happy because 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.769
 n the same France they have it but 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.950
 players us news is weaker than ours but they 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.779
 often played as a team 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.289
 and onyango pad would be the case 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:17.199
 in the head 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.749
 and really cohesive and therefore 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.689
 they won but we have it like that 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:23.679
 it was a single dynamics 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.439
 an individual game so i think that 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.309
 for that we lost 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:29.869
 Unfortunately 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.289
 I honestly am very upset and 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.459
 disappointed
