00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
performance tests right you look at

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.479 
performance tests right you look at
paper<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.230> look<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.529> specs<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.309> their

kind of stuff we're going to be showing
you<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> design<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.280> dell<00:00:35.399> XPS<00:00:35.790> x.x<00:00:36.239> well

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you the design of the dell XPS x.x well

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.840 
you the design of the dell XPS x.x well
some<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.050> software<00:00:38.040> features<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
some of the software features of the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.010 
some of the software features of the
dell<00:00:39.149> XPS<00:00:40.399> 15<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.640> well<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.629> course<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> first

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
dell XPS 15 and well of course the first

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.240 
dell XPS 15 and well of course the first
thing<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.230> notice<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> comes<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.070> very

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
thing you notice is it comes with a very

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.049 
thing you notice is it comes with a very
interesting<00:00:44.539> box<00:00:45.559> I<00:00:46.559> don't<00:00:47.460> recommend<00:00:47.850> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
interesting box I don't recommend you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.790 
interesting box I don't recommend you
actually<00:00:48.480> using<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.899> boxes<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> some

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
actually using this boxes like a some

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.170 
actually using this boxes like a some
sort<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.219> suitcase<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.789> carry<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.059> laptop

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
sort of a suitcase to carry your laptop

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.860 
sort of a suitcase to carry your laptop
around<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.989> would<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.170> kind<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> strange<00:00:52.590> but

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
around that would be kind of strange but

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.099 
around that would be kind of strange but
this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.350> 15th<00:00:56.280> Z<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.899> heavy

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
this is the 15th Z it is a little heavy

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.360 
this is the 15th Z it is a little heavy
so<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.829> 2.5<00:00:59.430> kilograms<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.620> yeah<00:01:01.620> well<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.100> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
so it's 2.5 kilograms so yeah well it is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.549 
so it's 2.5 kilograms so yeah well it is
15<00:01:02.730> inch<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.570> guess<00:01:03.750> that's<00:01:04.019> probably<00:01:04.229> um

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
15 inch so I guess that's probably um

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.700 
15 inch so I guess that's probably um
you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:06.000> deserves<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.720> heavy<00:01:06.869> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you know it deserves to be that heavy so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.160 
you know it deserves to be that heavy so
let's<00:01:08.580> take<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.729> look<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> design<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.990> can

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
let's take a look at the design we can

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.310 
let's take a look at the design we can
find<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.680> machine<00:01:10.890> um<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.780> battery

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
find on this machine um so the battery

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
find on this machine um so the battery
is<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.710> integrated<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.700> that's<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
is actually integrated so that's one of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
is actually integrated so that's one of
the<00:01:15.180> first<00:01:15.330> things<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.140> find<00:01:16.770> very

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the first things that you will find very

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.300 
the first things that you will find very
interesting<00:01:17.220> about<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.729> computer<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:19.409> so

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
interesting about this computer and so

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.770 
interesting about this computer and so
you<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.700> very<00:01:20.909> nice<00:01:21.030> grills<00:01:21.420> all

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you can see this very nice grills all

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
you can see this very nice grills all
over<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> place<00:01:22.320> I've<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:23.159> power<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.759> got

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
over the place I've got power you got

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
over the place I've got power you got
ethernet<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.619> thing

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
ethernet this right here and this thing

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.010 
ethernet this right here and this thing
vide<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.130> heavy<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> side<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
vide is heavy and on the side you have a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.649 
vide is heavy and on the side you have a
whole<00:01:28.170> bunch<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.439> ports<00:01:28.710> HDMI<00:01:29.400> over<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
whole bunch of ports HDMI over here this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.289 
whole bunch of ports HDMI over here this
is<00:01:30.780> DisplayPort<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.220> over<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> have

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
is DisplayPort and over here you have

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.350 
is DisplayPort and over here you have
eSATA<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> usps<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.310> you've<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.549> three

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
eSATA with the usps and you've got three

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.420 
eSATA with the usps and you've got three
USB<00:01:36.630> ports<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.049> tall<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.829> meaning<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.189> this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
USB ports and tall so meaning that this

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.030 
USB ports and tall so meaning that this
is<00:01:38.640> both<00:01:39.450> an<00:01:39.630> eSATA<00:01:39.960> port<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.710> USB

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
is both an eSATA port as well so USB

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.649 
is both an eSATA port as well so USB
port<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.640> plug<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.000> both<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.329> either

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
port so you can plug in both you either

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
port so you can plug in both you either
you<00:01:42.960> start<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.229> drive<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.950> plug<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you start a drive or you can plug in the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.120 
you start a drive or you can plug in the
USB<00:01:44.340> stuff<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.020> an<00:01:46.229> SD<00:01:46.470> card<00:01:46.500> slot<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
USB stuff and this is an SD card slot a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
USB stuff and this is an SD card slot a
battery<00:01:47.820> indicator<00:01:48.210> light<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.869> I've<00:01:48.960> only<00:01:49.079> got

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
battery indicator light so I've only got

quite alright solved it's not too
difficult<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:19.060> press<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.480> all<00:03:19.569> that<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.530> you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
difficult to press and all that so you

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.590

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
interesting thing about this try pack

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.650 
interesting thing about this try pack
this<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.519> actually<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.819> multi-touch<00:03:28.389> trackpad

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
actually use two fingers so that this

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.120 
actually use two fingers so that this
one's<00:03:35.049> kind<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.260> obvious<00:03:35.560> two<00:03:35.709> fingers<00:03:35.980> as<00:03:36.099> a

four fingers you put four fingers up so
it<00:04:01.510> doesn't<00:04:01.810> it's<00:04:02.109> not<00:04:02.319> you<00:04:02.590> know<00:04:02.620> exactly
