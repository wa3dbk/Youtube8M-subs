for<00:01:49.820> people<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.210> might<00:01:50.329> as<00:01:50.450> well<00:01:50.540> do<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.780> for

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
for people we might as well do it for

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.429 
for people we might as well do it for
trees<00:01:51.140> exactly<00:01:51.770> ice<00:01:51.890> too<00:01:52.130> right<00:01:53.049> perfect

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
trees exactly ice too right perfect

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.350 
trees exactly ice too right perfect
there's<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.430> lot<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.700> branches<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.240> way

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
there's a lot of branches in the way

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.060 
there's a lot of branches in the way
here<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:56.780> as<00:01:56.900> I<00:01:57.079> went<00:01:57.290> under<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.710> tree<00:01:57.890> what<00:01:58.040> I

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
here but as I went under the tree what I

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.319 
here but as I went under the tree what I
noticed<00:01:58.430> is<00:01:58.520> there's<00:01:58.700> some<00:01:58.820> crossing

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
noticed is there's some crossing

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.090 
noticed is there's some crossing
branches<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.110> we're<00:02:00.439> going<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.619> go<00:02:00.770> in<00:02:00.950> there

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
branches so we're going to go in there

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.020 
branches so we're going to go in there
we're<00:02:01.250> going<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.430> remove<00:02:01.640> some<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:01.880> those

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
we're going to remove some of those

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.030 
we're going to remove some of those
branches<00:02:02.240> alright<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:02.990> actually<00:02:03.560> I'm<00:02:03.950> gonna

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
branches alright so actually I'm gonna

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.760 
branches alright so actually I'm gonna
take<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.310> crack<00:02:05.030> at<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.360> right<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.140> try<00:02:06.320> I'm

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
take a crack at this right so to try I'm

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.319 
take a crack at this right so to try I'm
ready<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.159> get<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.460> here<00:02:07.899> ok<00:02:08.899> whoa<00:02:09.079> whoa<00:02:09.549> so<00:02:10.549> one

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
ready to get in here ok whoa whoa so one

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.420 
ready to get in here ok whoa whoa so one
of<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.510> most<00:02:11.630> common<00:02:12.079> mistakes<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.709> see<00:02:12.769> is

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
of the most common mistakes I see is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.949 
of the most common mistakes I see is
when<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> large<00:02:14.420> branch<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.900> you

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
when you have a large branch that you

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.210 
when you have a large branch that you
want<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.200> remove<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.530> trying<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.829> do<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.070> all<00:02:16.130> at

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
want to remove is trying to do it all at

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.190 
want to remove is trying to do it all at
once<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.940> take<00:02:17.120> too<00:02:17.329> much<00:02:17.450> off<00:02:17.630> at<00:02:17.810> once<00:02:17.989> that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
once you take too much off at once that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.960 
once you take too much off at once that
that<00:02:18.470> part<00:02:18.769> can<00:02:18.950> peel<00:02:19.310> back<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.760> tear<00:02:19.940> down

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
that part can peel back and tear down

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.729 
that part can peel back and tear down
the<00:02:20.239> tree<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.959> we<00:02:21.019> want<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.260> remove<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.650> in

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
the tree so we want to remove it in

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.259 
the tree so we want to remove it in
sections<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.340> reduce<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.820> weight<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
sections to reduce the weight on the

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.600 
sections to reduce the weight on the
branch<00:02:23.620> we<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.799> you<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.220> keep<00:02:25.340> me<00:02:25.519> in

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
branch we have you here to keep me in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.640 
branch we have you here to keep me in
check<00:02:25.640> we<00:02:26.120> do<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.540> knew<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.079> what<00:02:27.500> do<00:02:27.560> you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
check we do I knew it so what do you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.750 
check we do I knew it so what do you
think<00:02:27.799> this<00:02:27.920> looks<00:02:28.070> like<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.280> good<00:02:28.459> spot<00:02:28.610> right

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
think this looks like a good spot right

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.270 
think this looks like a good spot right
about<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.299> no<00:02:29.480> yes<00:02:30.350> that'd<00:02:30.590> be<00:02:30.680> good<00:02:30.860> ok

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
about here no yes that'd be good ok

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.380 
about here no yes that'd be good ok
great

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.610 

now<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.570> I've<00:02:35.660> cut<00:02:35.900> here<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.380> go<00:02:36.530> ahead

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
now that I've cut here I can go ahead

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.280 
now that I've cut here I can go ahead
and<00:02:36.800> come<00:02:36.950> back<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.570> ya<00:02:38.570> just<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:39.020> safe

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
and come back to ya just to be safe

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.810 
and come back to ya just to be safe
maybe<00:02:39.590> cut<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.950> one<00:02:40.070> more<00:02:40.250> time<00:02:40.430> over<00:02:40.670> here

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
maybe cut it one more time over here

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.780 
maybe cut it one more time over here
usually<00:02:41.570> we<00:02:41.780> recommend<00:02:41.930> three<00:02:42.500> cuts

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.520 

cutting<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.810> easier<00:02:50.110> than<00:02:50.260> getting<00:02:50.349> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
cutting it is easier than getting the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.199 
cutting it is easier than getting the
branch<00:02:50.770> down<00:02:50.950> there<00:02:51.160> we<00:02:51.340> go<00:02:51.459> alright<00:02:51.819> so<00:02:52.000> now

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
branch down there we go alright so now

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.750 
branch down there we go alright so now
just<00:02:52.450> remember<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.140> want<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.410> come<00:02:53.620> not<00:02:54.370> flush

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
just remember you want to come not flush

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.729 
just remember you want to come not flush
with<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.150> trunk<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.599> not<00:02:55.959> at<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.200> 90-degree

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
with the trunk and not at a 90-degree

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.580 
with the trunk and not at a 90-degree
angle<00:02:56.769> but<00:02:57.129> about<00:02:57.340> halfway<00:02:57.550> in<00:02:57.819> between<00:02:58.590> how

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
angle but about halfway in between how

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.100 
angle but about halfway in between how
about<00:02:59.769> there<00:02:59.950> okay<00:03:03.780> how'd<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.810> do

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
about there okay how'd I do

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.890 
about there okay how'd I do
that<00:03:05.590> looks<00:03:05.739> good<00:03:06.209> okay<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.269> does<00:03:07.599> it<00:03:07.720> matter

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
that looks good okay so does it matter

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.360 
that looks good okay so does it matter
at<00:03:08.140> all<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.560> we<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> little<00:03:09.069> bit<00:03:09.280> of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
at all that we have a little bit of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.220 
at all that we have a little bit of
damage<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.970> bark<00:03:10.180> here<00:03:10.450> or<00:03:10.690> around<00:03:10.930> no

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
damage to the bark here or around no

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.380 
damage to the bark here or around no
this<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> pretty<00:03:12.099> big<00:03:12.340> branch<00:03:12.640> here<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.269> is

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
this is a pretty big branch here this is

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.750 
this is a pretty big branch here this is
gonna<00:03:13.569> heal<00:03:13.810> up<00:03:13.840> pretty<00:03:13.959> quickly<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:15.040> it's

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
gonna heal up pretty quickly so it's

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.059 
gonna heal up pretty quickly so it's
just<00:03:15.880> an<00:03:16.299> amenable<00:03:16.660> unavoidable<00:03:17.590> sometimes

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
just an amenable unavoidable sometimes

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.309 
just an amenable unavoidable sometimes
when<00:03:18.280> you're<00:03:18.400> doing<00:03:18.489> pruning<00:03:18.970> yeah<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.930> can<00:03:20.170> see

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
when you're doing pruning yeah I can see

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.770 
when you're doing pruning yeah I can see
that<00:03:20.700> he's<00:03:21.700> gonna<00:03:21.849> heal<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.120> fine<00:03:22.360> give<00:03:22.690> you

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
that he's gonna heal just fine give you

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.350 
that he's gonna heal just fine give you
all<00:03:22.870> right<00:03:22.989> buddy<00:03:23.170> good<00:03:23.709> be<00:03:23.830> okay<00:03:24.239> let's<00:03:25.239> hit

all right buddy good be okay let's hit

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.059 
all right buddy good be okay let's hit
this<00:03:25.510> branch<00:03:25.780> right<00:03:25.870> here<00:03:26.019> alright<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:26.980> I'm

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
this branch right here alright so I'm

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.580 
this branch right here alright so I'm
gonna<00:03:27.160> get<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.549> here<00:03:29.640> just<00:03:30.640> like<00:03:30.819> so<00:03:31.590> like

gonna get in here just like so like
buttah<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.760> know<00:03:33.849> what<00:03:34.030> this<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.870> actually<00:03:35.260> a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
buttah you know what this is actually a

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.930 
buttah you know what this is actually a
lot<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.500> fun<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.829> could<00:03:36.099> get<00:03:36.250> carried<00:03:36.549> away<00:03:36.640> and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
lot of fun I could get carried away and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.150 
lot of fun I could get carried away and
just<00:03:37.030> start<00:03:37.269> cutting<00:03:37.349> like<00:03:38.349> crazy<00:03:38.650> right<00:03:38.980> but

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
just start cutting like crazy right but

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.289 
just start cutting like crazy right but
you<00:03:39.250> don't<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.579> want<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.760> be<00:03:39.819> careful<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.239> that

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
you don't you want to be careful of that

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.940 
you don't you want to be careful of that
right<00:03:40.660> right<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.110> very<00:03:41.440> easy<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.799> get

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
right right it's very easy to get

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.289 
right right it's very easy to get
carried<00:03:42.130> away<00:03:42.310> when<00:03:42.519> you're<00:03:42.670> pruning<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.180> is

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
carried away when you're pruning it is

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.990 
carried away when you're pruning it is
fun<00:03:43.569> so<00:03:44.110> take<00:03:44.319> a<00:03:44.349> step<00:03:44.500> back<00:03:44.920> in<00:03:45.280> between<00:03:45.760> your

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
fun so take a step back in between your

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.670 
fun so take a step back in between your
larger<00:03:46.390> cuts<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.900> just<00:03:47.110> take<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.290> look<00:03:47.500> at<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
larger cuts and just take a look at the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.830 
larger cuts and just take a look at the
tree<00:03:47.920> reevaluate<00:03:48.849> and<00:03:49.000> then<00:03:49.180> come<00:03:49.390> back<00:03:49.420> so

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
tree reevaluate and then come back so

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.780 
tree reevaluate and then come back so
we'll<00:03:50.230> step<00:03:50.410> away<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.829> see<00:03:51.430> what<00:03:51.640> we've<00:03:51.760> done

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
we'll step away and see what we've done

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.160 
we'll step away and see what we've done
so<00:03:52.120> far<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.510> then<00:03:52.599> see<00:03:52.750> if<00:03:52.840> there's<00:03:53.019> maybe

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
so far and then see if there's maybe

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.660 
so far and then see if there's maybe
other<00:03:53.410> tools<00:03:53.769> that<00:03:53.950> would<00:03:54.040> be<00:03:54.190> good<00:03:54.340> for<00:03:54.519> some

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
other tools that would be good for some

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.160 
other tools that would be good for some
of<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.819> smaller<00:03:55.090> branches<00:03:55.569> or<00:03:55.780> harder<00:03:56.079> to

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
of the smaller branches or harder to

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.390 
of the smaller branches or harder to
reach<00:03:56.290> places<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.739> think<00:03:56.769> we<00:03:57.010> should<00:03:57.160> come<00:03:57.280> back

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
reach places I think we should come back

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.740 
reach places I think we should come back
in<00:03:57.549> with<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:57.730> hand<00:03:57.910> pruners<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.269> get<00:03:58.480> some<00:03:58.690> of

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
in with the hand pruners and get some of

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.150 
in with the hand pruners and get some of
these<00:03:58.840> little<00:03:59.290> bit<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.560> smaller<00:03:59.739> branches

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
these little bit of the smaller branches

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.460 
these little bit of the smaller branches
there's<00:04:00.370> on<00:04:00.579> our<00:04:00.760> way<00:04:01.079> that's<00:04:02.079> why<00:04:02.230> you're<00:04:02.380> the

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
there's on our way that's why you're the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.379 
there's on our way that's why you're the
professional<00:04:02.980> new<00:04:03.370> tool<00:04:03.579> now<00:04:03.819> I<00:04:03.850> have<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> hand

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
professional new tool now I have a hand

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.120 
professional new tool now I have a hand
printer<00:04:04.750> right<00:04:04.959> for<00:04:05.350> some<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.859> smaller

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
printer right for some of the smaller

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.220 
printer right for some of the smaller
jobs<00:04:06.489> on<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.850> tree<00:04:07.060> obviously<00:04:07.900> I'm<00:04:08.019> not<00:04:08.109> going

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
jobs on the tree obviously I'm not going

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.720 
jobs on the tree obviously I'm not going
to<00:04:08.350> take<00:04:08.470> something<00:04:08.829> of<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.040> size<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.549> cut

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
to take something of this size and cut

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.509 
to take something of this size and cut
off<00:04:10.530> without<00:04:11.530> you're<00:04:11.829> gonna<00:04:11.920> want<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.280> use<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
off without you're gonna want to use the

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.009 
off without you're gonna want to use the
Walker<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:13.090> we're<00:04:13.269> just<00:04:13.299> kind<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.630> coming<00:04:13.900> in

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
Walker so we're just kind of coming in

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.590 
Walker so we're just kind of coming in
here<00:04:14.049> doing<00:04:14.350> some<00:04:14.590> fine-tuning<00:04:15.479> cleaning<00:04:16.479> up

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
here doing some fine-tuning cleaning up

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.729 
here doing some fine-tuning cleaning up
some<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.989> remaining<00:04:17.289> low-hanging

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
some of the remaining low-hanging

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.949 
some of the remaining low-hanging
branches<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.370> are<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.910> know<00:04:19.030> less<00:04:19.239> than<00:04:19.269> 3/4

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
branches that are you know less than 3/4

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.620 
branches that are you know less than 3/4
inch<00:04:20.079> in<00:04:20.200> diameter<00:04:20.639> that's<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:21.910> that's<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.479> key

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
inch in diameter that's the that's a key

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.200 
inch in diameter that's the that's a key
3/4<00:04:23.139> inch<00:04:23.320> here<00:04:23.530> yeah<00:04:23.800> okay<00:04:24.130> perfect<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.150> think

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
3/4 inch here yeah okay perfect I think

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.909 
3/4 inch here yeah okay perfect I think
I<00:04:25.389> can<00:04:25.570> measure<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.080> out<00:04:26.289> I<00:04:26.320> can't<00:04:26.650> have<00:04:26.770> all

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
I can measure that out I can't have all

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.730 
I can measure that out I can't have all
that<00:04:27.600> what<00:04:28.600> about<00:04:28.690> this<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.110> branch<00:04:29.500> here

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
that what about this this branch here

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.180 
that what about this this branch here
appears<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.250> be

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
appears to be

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.100 
appears to be
longer<00:04:31.580> living<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.240> branch<00:04:32.510> is<00:04:32.660> dead<00:04:32.900> so<00:04:33.050> you

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
longer living that branch is dead so you

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.540 
longer living that branch is dead so you
want<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.350> take<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:33.650> back<00:04:33.890> all<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.370> way<00:04:34.400> to

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
want to take that back all the way to

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.930 
want to take that back all the way to
the<00:04:34.700> yeah<00:04:34.820> notice<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.830> perfect<00:04:36.830> done<00:04:37.220> get

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
the yeah notice it perfect done get

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.220 
the yeah notice it perfect done get
better<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.480> he<00:04:38.540> has<00:04:38.660> this<00:04:38.780> other<00:04:38.930> dead

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
better it and he has this other dead

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.390 
better it and he has this other dead
wood<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.650> can<00:04:39.770> clean<00:04:39.980> that<00:04:40.160> up<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:43.100> all<00:04:43.250> these

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
wood you can clean that up so all these

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.310 
wood you can clean that up so all these
little<00:04:43.460> guys<00:04:43.880> here<00:04:44.270> those<00:04:44.690> are<00:04:44.840> all<00:04:44.930> dead<00:04:45.140> this

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
little guys here those are all dead this

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.200 
little guys here those are all dead this

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
is gonna help and this is this help keep

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.200 
is gonna help and this is this help keep
the<00:04:47.360> tree<00:04:47.570> healthier<00:04:48.470> yes<00:04:49.340> anytime<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:50.090> have

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
the tree healthier yes anytime you have

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.940 
the tree healthier yes anytime you have
dead<00:04:50.480> wood<00:04:50.750> on<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:50.900> tree<00:04:51.290> that's<00:04:51.650> gonna

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
dead wood on a tree that's gonna

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.740 
dead wood on a tree that's gonna
naturally<00:04:52.520> be<00:04:52.910> an<00:04:53.000> invitation<00:04:53.240> for

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
naturally be an invitation for

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.920 
naturally be an invitation for
decomposers<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.710> insects<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.310> come<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.930> how

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
decomposers and insects to come in how

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.460 
decomposers and insects to come in how
about<00:04:57.080> that

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
about that

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.150 
about that
that<00:04:58.370> looks<00:04:58.520> great<00:04:58.820> we<00:04:59.360> pruned<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.440> tree<00:05:00.470> and

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
that looks great we pruned the tree and

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.610 
that looks great we pruned the tree and
cleared<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:01.940> path<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.750> looks<00:05:02.960> amazing<00:05:03.230> I

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
cleared a path and it looks amazing I

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
with the with the hedge shears it has

with the with the hedge shears it has
the<00:05:30.470> longer<00:05:30.770> blades<00:05:31.010> right<00:05:31.280> so<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.790> point<00:05:32.000> of

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
the longer blades right so the point of

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.900 
the longer blades right so the point of
that<00:05:32.150> is<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.750> catch<00:05:33.160> more<00:05:34.160> branches<00:05:34.580> at<00:05:34.730> once

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
that is to catch more branches at once

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.520 
that is to catch more branches at once
right<00:05:35.240> so<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.570> can<00:05:35.750> use<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.080> head<00:05:36.200> shears

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
right so you can use the head shears

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.560 
right so you can use the head shears
just<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:36.860> clean<00:05:37.100> up<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.400> shape<00:05:37.610> head<00:05:38.270> shears

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
these suckers at the bottom of this tree

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.480

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.450 
they don't remove the suckers which are
the<00:06:38.230> branches<00:06:38.680> that<00:06:38.830> are<00:06:38.950> coming<00:06:39.310> and

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
the branches that are coming and

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.070 
the branches that are coming and
sprouting<00:06:39.910> up<00:06:40.060> from<00:06:40.300> the<00:06:40.390> base<00:06:40.570> of<00:06:40.780> the<00:06:40.840> tree

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
sprouting up from the base of the tree

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.630 
sprouting up from the base of the tree
and<00:06:41.110> what<00:06:41.320> happens<00:06:41.710> over<00:06:41.800> time<00:06:41.950> if<00:06:42.340> you<00:06:42.430> leave

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640

these here they will start to compete

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.620 
these here they will start to compete
with<00:06:44.950> the<00:06:45.160> tree<00:06:45.460> so<00:06:46.030> we're<00:06:46.150> going<00:06:46.270> to<00:06:46.330> remove

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630
