00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.190
 Hello 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.930
 good greeting to all the people of youtube 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.510
 let's continue this time with a 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.900
 video which will teach them how 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.119
 you can create a list from 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.570
 of files that you have in your 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.480
 good computer what kind of files 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 files can be mp3 can be videos 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.619
 it can be this karaoke music 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.270
 any file that you have in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.879
 your computer that you would like to have 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.580
 list a list of what you 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.199
 have how many times has it happened to us that 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.260
 we have our hard drive full of 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.080
 music and then we do not know what 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.040
 we have truly good this time in 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.629
 the bottom part where where we have 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.690
 this video I'm going to leave the link in 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.879
 where you can download this no 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.400
 could you call it program is pretty much 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.049
 as an application it is called generator 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.900
 of lists I am going to give them 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.540
 totally 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.690
 and this is the application that is going to 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.340
 allow generating the list from 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.220
 our files in this case look 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.600
 I have here a folder with some music 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.300
 obviously I know that maybe you 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.580
 you have a lot more music you can have the 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.140
 amount of music that you want and then 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.050
 let's do the following to generate 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.170
 the list from this of this folder 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.060
 that I have here we open we give it double 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.940
 Double click on the application if you 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.680
 ask if you want to run it 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.060
 you say yes even here you have a 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.450
 little arrow so that I do not turn to 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.670
 ask and it is something super super 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.380
 simple 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.820
 here we basically have the functions 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.800
 general what is this application 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.619
 The first thing we are going to do is give it 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.630
 bruce to select the folder where 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.440
 we have the music in this case my folder 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.980
 it's called mix music I'll give it ok 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.500
 here we have some this some 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.300
 options I do not regularly move 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.420
 nothing but then for example here is 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.430
 selected that includes your photoshop 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.960
 folders within that background imagine 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.090
 that inside that folder you have other 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.470
 folders with other things then good 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.270
 he will also take them into account if 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.250
 you obviously remove the little arrow here 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.690
 Well, it's not going to take you into account. 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.640
 I'll leave it on but of all 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.610
 ways I do not have any folders 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.530
 inside that folder 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.110
 we are going to remove him here where he says peace 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.840
 because regularly because there he gives you the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.250
 location that is the cce the name of 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.590
 your computer and things so not 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.060
 we need neither do we need to get 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.310
 the name of the folder is the only thing 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.250
 We need to know is the name of the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.070
 file does not name the song of 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.620
 this side you have the option to choose 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.930
 what format in what format do you want 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.610
 get that listing 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.440
 the program initially comes in 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.680
 text format that is like me always 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.750
 I leave it you can also do it in html or 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.350
 you can generate it in cbs that is for 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.790
 microsoft office excel document and 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.040
 Well, here are some other options 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.350
 all this I just left so I leave it on 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.230
 text and nothing else I tell you that here 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.540
 down the team this little arrow that says 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.660
 adhere the extension in the output and then 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.790
 here you are going to select where you want 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.430
 I'll generate that list, I'll put it 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.370
 give me this on my desk and 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.530
 I can here you put the name 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.750
 example my mix music 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.400
 list 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.340
 I give him save and give him a run or grant 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.620
 in a matter of less than a second I already 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.620
 gender the list here I have it 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.650
 I'm going to tell you to open it to me 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.670
 and here we have it 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.129
 and here we have the whole list now I 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.819
 regularly what I do is order the 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:04:00.239
 I'm going to copy all 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.239
 and I'm going to graze it in excel 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.800
 because I want to make some 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.160
 simple modifications so that it remains 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.350
 my list I'm going to graze what I copied there 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.690
 and here then I'm going to remove for example 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.550
 above gives me the title of the file 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.290
 name is that it tells me the name of the 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.320
 song so I do not need it just 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.880
 deleted in the part of up to the bottom of the 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.040
 list also puts me the number of 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.760
 files that he found that in this case 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.400
 I'm 76 I'm going to erase it too 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 and then the first thing I do is 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.940
 order everything where it says data that I 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.529
 put it from a to z correctly 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.990
 sorry I have to select here 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:47.080
 and now for everything to be automatically 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.150
 of the z obviously starts with the number 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.690
 true now if you realize 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.100
 here you have mp3 at the end that is not 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.110
 You can remove it but we are going to remove it 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.530
 here in excel we 're going to go where 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:04.190
 says find or find and where it says 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.920
 replace there let's put mp3 point 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.330
 to replace that word and below what 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.090
 let's leave blank and we're going to 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.550
 put replaces everything when we give 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.710
 it replaces everything automatically 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.200
 removed the extension at the end and then here 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.690
 your list is finished and finished then what 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.190
 only that you have left if you want the 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.680
 you can leave there in excel so that 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.969
 take your control there or you can return it 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.559
 to move to a 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:35.039
 even this from 1 and here you have your 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:36.299
