00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.460 

okay<00:00:09.679> so<00:00:10.009> through<00:00:10.460> that<00:00:10.490> corner<00:00:11.230> did<00:00:12.230> a<00:00:12.260> little

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:12.470 
okay so through that corner did a little

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.799 
okay so through that corner did a little
bit<00:00:12.650> of<00:00:12.680> break<00:00:12.890> in<00:00:13.070> with<00:00:13.340> my<00:00:13.460> back<00:00:13.640> wheel<00:00:13.880> to

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
bit of break in with my back wheel to

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.620 
bit of break in with my back wheel to
sort<00:00:14.990> of<00:00:15.050> break<00:00:15.200> my<00:00:15.380> back<00:00:15.559> end<00:00:15.800> loose<00:00:16.010> and<00:00:16.630> make

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
sort of break my back end loose and make

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.419 
sort of break my back end loose and make
the<00:00:17.900> radius<00:00:18.710> of<00:00:18.769> the<00:00:18.859> corner<00:00:19.099> a<00:00:19.130> little<00:00:19.189> bit

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:19.429 
the radius of the corner a little bit

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.269 
the radius of the corner a little bit
smaller<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.199> I<00:00:21.199> did<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.650> lot<00:00:21.800> of<00:00:21.859> breaking

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
smaller so I did a lot of breaking

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.239 
smaller so I did a lot of breaking
before<00:00:23.119> I<00:00:23.150> got<00:00:23.359> to<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.539> corner<00:00:23.949> after<00:00:24.949> I<00:00:25.130> went

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:25.249 
before I got to the corner after I went

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:26.589 
before I got to the corner after I went
over<00:00:25.489> those<00:00:25.609> big<00:00:25.849> roots<00:00:26.089> in<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:26.300> entrance

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
over those big roots in the entrance

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.689 
over those big roots in the entrance
because<00:00:27.409> there's<00:00:27.679> nice<00:00:27.980> patch<00:00:28.339> of<00:00:28.369> dirt

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
because there's nice patch of dirt

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.669 
because there's nice patch of dirt
they're<00:00:28.970> real<00:00:29.210> buff<00:00:29.509> and<00:00:29.810> smooth<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:30.409> clean

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
they're real buff and smooth and clean

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.679 
they're real buff and smooth and clean
no<00:00:30.949> pebbles<00:00:31.220> so<00:00:31.939> I<00:00:31.999> did<00:00:32.149> a<00:00:32.180> lot<00:00:32.329> of<00:00:32.360> breaking

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
no pebbles so I did a lot of breaking

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.780 
no pebbles so I did a lot of breaking
there<00:00:32.899> with<00:00:33.559> both<00:00:33.770> my<00:00:33.950> front<00:00:34.220> brake<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:34.579> my

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
there with both my front brake and my

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.090 
there with both my front brake and my
rear<00:00:35.000> brake<00:00:35.210> then<00:00:36.110> when<00:00:36.260> I<00:00:36.290> got<00:00:36.350> in<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:36.740> corner

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
rear brake then when I got in the corner

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.120 
rear brake then when I got in the corner
to<00:00:37.340> really<00:00:37.580> make<00:00:37.760> it<00:00:38.320> zoom<00:00:39.320> into<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.650> corner<00:00:39.980> I

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
to really make it zoom into the corner I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.790 
to really make it zoom into the corner I
had<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.640> do<00:00:40.790> some<00:00:41.690> back-breaking<00:00:41.930> in<00:00:42.560> the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
had to do some back-breaking in the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.490 
had to do some back-breaking in the
corner<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.790> take<00:00:44.480> out<00:00:44.660> my<00:00:44.690> back<00:00:44.990> end<00:00:45.200> a<00:00:45.260> little

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
corner to take out my back end a little

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.650 
corner to take out my back end a little
bit<00:00:45.650> so<00:00:46.400> I<00:00:46.430> get<00:00:46.670> got<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:46.940> better<00:00:47.180> angle<00:00:47.360> on<00:00:47.540> my

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
bit so I get got a better angle on my

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.090 
bit so I get got a better angle on my
front<00:00:47.900> tire<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.650> make<00:00:48.770> it<00:00:48.890> all<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.010> way

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
front tire to make it all the way

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.260 
front tire to make it all the way
through<00:00:49.840> so<00:00:50.840> this<00:00:51.590> corner<00:00:51.890> down<00:00:52.040> here<00:00:52.270> I'm

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
through so this corner down here I'm

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.819 
through so this corner down here I'm
going<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.660> do<00:00:53.720> all<00:00:53.750> my<00:00:53.870> breaking<00:00:54.290> before<00:00:54.590> I<00:00:54.620> get

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
going to do all my breaking before I get

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.980 
going to do all my breaking before I get
to<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:54.980> corner<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.430> then<00:00:56.210> just<00:00:56.360> really<00:00:56.720> you

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
to the corner and then just really you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.819 
to the corner and then just really you
know<00:00:57.110> focus<00:00:57.829> on<00:00:57.980> angulated<00:00:58.730> down<00:00:58.970> through<00:00:59.270> it

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
know focus on angulated down through it

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:15.580 
know focus on angulated down through it
so<00:01:13.179> so<00:01:14.179> if<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:14.420> saw<00:01:14.600> from<00:01:14.749> the<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.289> probably

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
so so if you saw from the you probably

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.349 
so so if you saw from the you probably
saw<00:01:15.829> that<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.759> know<00:01:16.789> it<00:01:17.030> looks<00:01:17.210> pretty

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
saw that you know it looks pretty

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:18.940 
saw that you know it looks pretty
similar<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:17.869> what<00:01:18.049> i<00:01:18.079> was<00:01:18.200> doing<00:01:18.439> before<00:01:18.560> but

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
similar to what i was doing before but

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.260 
similar to what i was doing before but
there<00:01:19.069> wasn't<00:01:19.189> like<00:01:19.340> dirt<00:01:19.639> coming<00:01:19.850> up<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.179> you

see<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.539> grounds<00:01:21.409> not<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.710> disturbed<00:01:22.159> if<00:01:22.880> I

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
see the grounds not that disturbed if I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.929 
see the grounds not that disturbed if I
was<00:01:23.179> breaking<00:01:23.450> over<00:01:23.840> there<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:24.289> those<00:01:24.939> those

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939

was breaking over there and those those
leaves<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.829> as<00:01:27.829> I<00:01:28.130> ride<00:01:28.819> through<00:01:29.060> this

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
leaves and as I ride through this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.020 
leaves and as I ride through this
section<00:01:29.630> again<00:01:30.079> and<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:31.520> see<00:01:31.729> me<00:01:31.880> coming

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
through from the front you'll see that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.120 
through from the front you'll see that
all<00:01:35.079> of<00:01:36.079> my<00:01:36.200> braking<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:36.679> happening<00:01:37.009> before

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
all of my braking is happening before

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.469 
all of my braking is happening before
there<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.670> I'm<00:01:37.759> not<00:01:37.880> even<00:01:38.090> touching<00:01:38.209> my

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
there and I'm not even touching my

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:56.090 
there and I'm not even touching my
brakes<00:01:38.749> as<00:01:38.959> I<00:01:39.530> go<00:01:39.679> through<00:01:39.709> this<00:01:40.009> section

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.030 

so<00:01:57.100> I'm<00:01:57.160> making<00:01:57.730> sure<00:01:57.880> I'm<00:01:58.090> clipped<00:01:58.330> in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
so I'm making sure I'm clipped in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.010 
so I'm making sure I'm clipped in
looking<00:02:00.040> nice<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.220> far<00:02:00.550> ahead<00:02:00.960> started<00:02:01.960> my

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
looking nice and far ahead started my

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.240 
looking nice and far ahead started my
breaking<00:02:02.350> now<00:02:02.820> then<00:02:03.820> just<00:02:04.030> leaning<00:02:04.300> over<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
breaking now then just leaning over and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.490 
breaking now then just leaning over and
I'm<00:02:06.490> off<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.760> brakes<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.740> I<00:02:09.570> mean<00:02:10.570> because<00:02:11.290> of

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
I'm off the brakes so I mean because of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.900 
I'm off the brakes so I mean because of
how<00:02:11.680> far<00:02:11.950> ahead<00:02:12.070> we're<00:02:12.340> trying<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.610> look<00:02:12.730> when

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
how far ahead we're trying to look when

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.980 
how far ahead we're trying to look when
we<00:02:13.030> ride<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:14.560> know<00:02:14.590> even<00:02:14.920> though<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.310> was<00:02:15.990> 20

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
we ride you know even though I was 20

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.320 
we ride you know even though I was 20
yards<00:02:17.230> away<00:02:17.320> up<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.890> hill<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.310> was<00:02:19.120> still

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
yards away up that hill I was still

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.690 
yards away up that hill I was still
looking<00:02:19.480> through<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.320> corner<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:21.550> if<00:02:21.640> you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
looking through the corner and if you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.240 
looking through the corner and if you
could<00:02:21.790> see<00:02:21.970> my<00:02:22.090> face<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:23.590> soon<00:02:23.800> as<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.010> was<00:02:24.130> off

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
could see my face as soon as I was off

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.310 
could see my face as soon as I was off
the<00:02:24.400> brakes<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.870> was<00:02:25.870> looking<00:02:26.110> all<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.230> way

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
the brakes I was looking all the way

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.890 
the brakes I was looking all the way
down<00:02:26.560> there<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.489> we<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.330> our<00:02:28.450> breaking<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
down there so we do our breaking in a

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.330 
down there so we do our breaking in a
straight<00:02:29.140> line<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.500> our<00:02:29.590> tires<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:30.070> do<00:02:30.160> what

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
straight line so our tires can do what

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.020 
straight line so our tires can do what
their<00:02:30.459> son<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.790> do<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> most<00:02:31.239> when<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:32.440> are

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
their son to do the most when we are

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.050 
their son to do the most when we are
recording<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.650> that's<00:02:35.920> two<00:02:36.640> different<00:02:36.760> types

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
recording so that's two different types

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.390 
recording so that's two different types
of<00:02:37.180> corners<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.630> two<00:02:38.530> different<00:02:39.190> ways<00:02:39.280> of

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
of corners and two different ways of

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.550 
of corners and two different ways of
breaking
