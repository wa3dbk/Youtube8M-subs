00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
i'm guessing the rear huggers that's the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.210 
i'm guessing the rear huggers that's the
lip<00:01:22.270> obviously<00:01:22.960> it's<00:01:23.530> got<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.740> bolts<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.130> it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
lip obviously it's got the bolts in it

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.310 
lip obviously it's got the bolts in it
in<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> two<00:01:24.850> side<00:01:25.060> skirts<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.600> little<00:01:25.750> bent<00:01:26.080> i

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
in the two side skirts a little bent i

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.740 
in the two side skirts a little bent i
did<00:01:27.220> read<00:01:27.370> online<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:27.730> if<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.270> put<00:01:28.450> them<00:01:28.600> in

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
did read online that if you put them in

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.620 
did read online that if you put them in
the<00:01:29.520> sunlight<00:01:31.260> normal<00:01:32.260> temperature<00:01:32.620> days

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the sunlight normal temperature days

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.210 
the sunlight normal temperature days
then<00:01:34.630> right<00:01:34.810> back<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:35.290> guess<00:01:35.740> that's<00:01:35.890> from

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
then right back I guess that's from

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.770 
then right back I guess that's from
being<00:01:36.430> in<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.610> box<00:01:38.430> let's<00:01:39.480> let's<00:01:40.480> open<00:01:40.690> this

probably<00:04:07.420> wondering<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.840> mother<00:04:07.989> lit<00:04:08.200> what<00:04:08.379> it

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
probably wondering a mother lit what it

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.360 
probably wondering a mother lit what it
looks<00:04:08.590> like<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:10.510> looks<00:04:10.690> pretty<00:04:10.900> good<00:04:11.109> I<00:04:11.409> do

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
looks like that looks pretty good I do

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.479 
looks like that looks pretty good I do
see<00:04:12.879> some<00:04:13.120> strange<00:04:13.540> markings<00:04:14.170> on<00:04:14.440> it

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.550 

actually<00:04:18.180> now<00:04:18.329> looking<00:04:19.109> at<00:04:19.199> it<00:04:19.349> I'm<00:04:19.440> not

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
actually now looking at it I'm not

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.590 
actually now looking at it I'm not
really<00:04:19.709> liking<00:04:19.949> it<00:04:20.160> too<00:04:20.310> much

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.720 

looks<00:04:24.140> like<00:04:24.350> rubs<00:04:24.770> or<00:04:25.040> scratches<00:04:25.580> I'm

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
looks like rubs or scratches I'm

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.050 
looks like rubs or scratches I'm
guessing<00:04:26.090> from<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.270> plastic<00:04:26.810> from<00:04:26.990> shipping

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
guessing from the plastic from shipping

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.580 
guessing from the plastic from shipping
you<00:04:29.060> know<00:04:29.180> I'm<00:04:29.390> just<00:04:29.570> anal<00:04:29.780> though<00:04:30.050> I'm<00:04:30.380> sure

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
you know I'm just anal though I'm sure

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.900 
you know I'm just anal though I'm sure
you<00:04:30.710> could<00:04:30.830> probably<00:04:31.040> just<00:04:31.250> put<00:04:31.430> some<00:04:31.550> overall

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
you could probably just put some overall

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.310 
you could probably just put some overall
or<00:04:32.120> something<00:04:32.420> else<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.750> would<00:04:32.960> be<00:04:33.080> fine

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
or something else on it would be fine

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.719 
or something else on it would be fine
but

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.290 

further<00:04:37.300> inspected<00:04:38.729> see<00:04:39.729> if<00:04:39.789> it<00:04:39.909> matches<00:04:40.089> up

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
further inspected see if it matches up

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.850 
further inspected see if it matches up
sure<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.080> won't<00:04:41.229> see<00:04:41.379> it<00:04:41.499> will<00:04:41.620> be<00:04:41.710> on<00:04:41.830> the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860
