00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.709
 and that for kids to buy it and 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.869
 commenting on another video more if we are with 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.500
 the tutorial on how to get the modern 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.689
 warfare 3 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.009
 a video and I have asked that of 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.590
 modern warfare 2 and good we did when 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.020
 hit 3 before you have very clear the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.000
 this map these three zones that marked ab 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.640
 and very clear you have to have for 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.220
 understand Romans to the enemy responds the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.830
 Green points are response and points 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.100
 big greens the initial response good 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.859
 we are already heading 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.760
 we started you have already seen on the side that 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.019
 start 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.180
 I recommend that if you have sinners, 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.890
 strips to the enemy responds country getting 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.199
 measure with attentive hunter in that area 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.370
 and if they are not there they are in this one you want 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.190
 he killed one and good 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.560
 as I do not lack bullets because they can be 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.900
 be doing with a 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.460
 with a bank and good that guy you have 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.690
 seen that we see him with company with 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.560
 recognition therefore I knew that 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 I was there and here and killed him good the 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.090
 important point my colleagues and I 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.910
 we've gotten into the area of ​​a so 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.980
 so instead there are also therefore 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.320
 the enemies that are inside the 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.520
 reprendo dome there is a response 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.690
 important of the dome so you have 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.820
 to keep it in mind 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.190
 if I point to the dome and there comes one 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.260
 and the other 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.210
 des mato 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.160
 you know that if you put the dome 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.420
 you are going to change the rest so on the side 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.220
 opposite now for example they will be 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.530
 leaving the semi effect therefore I 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.050
 I get on the catwalk point out there not 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.820
 there is nobody because they are there in the tunnel 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.230
 between the spirit bunker is very good and 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.930
 to influence very good but I do not here 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.670
 I took care and now you will see how it looks 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.360
 an enemy neither from the back and stealthy 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.980
 you are dead 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.920
 If there had been a little 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.320
 careful and I would have realized that my 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.880
 comrades had gotten a lot 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.600
 I could have killed here that everything 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.600
 I was still 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.850
 the dome kills me was trying to 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.960
 land is by surprise but nothing here 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.960
 love is the network 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.880
 I hope it's becoming clear about the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.520
 responsos the agave areas is very 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.470
 important to know 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.840
 time in practice you 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.260
 worry if you have not gotten 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.730
 very simple what we call bets and 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.380
 you have taken us a one then not you 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.020
 worry that they will arrive with time 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.080
 the first meters is a lot and 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.410
 once you get the first one 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.370
 there were many 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.380
 here and something I think 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.990
 and the first c 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.460
 two weeks with a lot a point 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.950
 important I've seen you have to be with a 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.690
 Attentive hunter covering me always 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.030
 behind the things that you see that my 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.400
 comrades are put in the east zone by 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.290
 so they are reappearing instead of 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.650
 the badges and how we have killed them 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.060
 Well now they are going to reappear more in the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.680
 area of ​​a 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.830
 therefore I get with the plates 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.380
 Attentive that there is no one 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.020
 right now this is the rest of / is 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.370
 everything already here you see that meter always by 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.050
 the laterals care on the sides 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.420
 they look at two corners you have felt 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.610
 roaming around a camper and another 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.770
 I am good and I know here that they are 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.250
 reappearing there in front with his shot 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.250
 the radar 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.200
 this makes a point answer to me as the 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.380
 dome that is going to give a lot inside 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.600
 that contribution appointment here waiting for it 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.160
 for novales and as I say they are 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.630
 totally advantageous because I give myself the 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.060
 turn around and go back to 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.600
 catch lijo surprise with another extra sheet 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.600
 and as a gift 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.540
 caught him around here with the radar but what 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.340
 are reappearing he killed another more 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.900
 I turn again to find that is 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.849
 in the middle of friends without having given the 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.030
 return and the rest to the car this car is 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.790
 very good position 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.709
 very important also know how to do the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.709
 drop if I see it very useful to get 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.330
 fashion in this issue 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.459
 in a moment he saved my life when 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.900
 You want to go back my partner do 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.870
 this as I have not seen it I'm going to 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.430
 back then he finished it killed the customer 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.500
 I see that many people come, another comes 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.170
 the other side killed him and attentive you 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.690
 seen how we've gotten ourselves in ve and 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.280
 my companions are not sorry I in ay 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.840
 my companions are instead therefore 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.329
 answer is between the dome or en 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.100
 Well I'm very attentive looking at the dome 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.030
 another one comes out and well I'm leaving here 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.580
 so more comments 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.100
 weapons that I use I recommend that 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.590
 you use the map depends how you feel 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.960
 more like two points a submachine gun or a 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.790
 submachine gun here you see that you understand me that 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.620
 come back he responds enemy and I get in 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.419
 keep reappearing more people killed s 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.750
 and now I'm going to answer and friend is 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.750
 completely 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.000
 I was encouraged to go out a bit but I realized 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.409
 that many people come and one and not 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.899
 be nothing, I'm going very fast 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.459
 I get to commenting on the weapons 

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:56.080
 said a his function in his rifle as or 

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:57.459
 be a rifle to a submachine gun as you sit 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.379
 more comfortable with silencer is always 

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:00.489
 very important specialist streaks and 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.459
 one of game and this one when low 

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:05.259
 confirmed but if you go to your penamoa 

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:07.119
 if you have not retain a fashion as 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.649
 I recommend that you try in domain and that 

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.989
 play with friends with the micro and that 

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:12.759
 it helps a lot helps a lot if you have in 

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:15.159
 troubles 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.719
 and good here I expose again so that 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.550
 you realize how important it is 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:21.399
 I answer mine the two red dots 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.729
 where are my allies and 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:26.709
 where the enemies come from is very simple 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.370
 master the answer in serious question of 

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:31.229
 practice with time are caught 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.910
 you are learning you learn good here 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.910
 always hit the sides 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.699
 I think I have recognition too 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.250
 important when you see that career the 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.540
 fashion to participate specialist take out 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.490
 other advantages the bull because it is very 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.500
 useful and good here I am very close the 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.980
 fashion but the creator that I hide 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:56.180
 here he pointed there 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.220
 and here you have a pretty jacket 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.840
 let's say a has been very fast but good 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.840
 there are 6 in 48 domain points 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.470
 and you know very important to master is 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.720
 answer the most important thing what 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.970
 What else do I think help? 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.710
 to take out the country that killed three does not have 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.300
 why because then there are four stages 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.639
 I think they take away one 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.620
 if they took off one to two with weapons and 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.300
 well here and respawn again instead 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.879
 It made a lot of sense to look at it, it was very simple 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.550
 always attentive and go covering with go 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.949
 covering them with objects is never what 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.159
 thing always with head no camps for 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.840
 please no campeis but with head there 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:38.380
 you see behind 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.880
 let's say men those waiting for 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.550
 my colleagues go ahead always and 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.710
 of the hussars as bait and here you see 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.970
 as he pointed and there because I know he's going to 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.110
 someone makes us return my 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.850
 comrades are on the other side they have 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.380
 stuck and now I'm going completely 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.660
 kill 6 and that goes represents the 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.820
 culture why I go to this side 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.240
 I go very fast here I know they are 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.660
 handing out in the bunker therefore 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.380
 on the catwalk above they remove it 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.320
 then you have to try it have 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.580
 company with the back pointed out that 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.870
 it's because he thinks we're going to go but not 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.890
 My colleagues are here so they are going to leave 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.990
 in the buoy finishing the game against 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.060
 that last one with the plate of good removed 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.760
 the good game I hope you have 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.830
 I hope you have served the video I hope 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.780
 that if you do not know we just do not 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.720
 despair you are going to take it out with the 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.340
 time arrive and good 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.160
 thank you for watching the video 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.380
 I was served as a light network and I was 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.790
 delighted to speak favorites and good up 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.530
 the next kids there I leave you with the 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.130
 score and see you the next video 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.130
 goodbye
