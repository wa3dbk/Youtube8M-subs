00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
them to make a long strip and now fold

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.020 
them to make a long strip and now fold
at<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.960> end<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.469> three<00:00:49.890> equal<00:00:50.309> parts<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
at one end in three equal parts so that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.369 
at one end in three equal parts so that
each<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.960> fold<00:00:55.460> will<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.640> 30<00:00:56.969> degrees<00:00:57.390> each

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.709 

we<00:01:01.379> want<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> fold<00:01:01.949> equilateral<00:01:02.730> triangles<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
we want to fold equilateral triangles so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.469 
we want to fold equilateral triangles so
we<00:01:03.899> will<00:01:04.049> ignore<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.280> 30-degree<00:01:06.270> part

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
we will ignore the first 30-degree part

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.980 
we will ignore the first 30-degree part
and<00:01:06.689> that's<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.229> 60-degree<00:01:07.950> angle<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.990> now

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and that's the 60-degree angle and now

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.170 
and that's the 60-degree angle and now
we<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.320> start<00:01:10.590> folding<00:01:11.180> equilateral

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
we will start folding equilateral

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330 
we will start folding equilateral
triangles<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> ribbon<00:01:13.470> fold<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
triangles like a ribbon fold it on the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
triangles like a ribbon fold it on the
side<00:01:14.520> again<00:01:15.060> fold<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.930> side<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
side again fold it on the side to the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.120 
side again fold it on the side to the
end<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.180> keep<00:01:18.180> doing<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.799> for<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> whole

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
end and keep doing it for the whole

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
end and keep doing it for the whole
strip<00:01:22.640> because<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.790> want<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.240> 19<00:01:25.140> such

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380

hexaflexagon<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.070> ready<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.790> flex<00:02:38.000> it's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
hexaflexagon is ready to flex it's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.380 
hexaflexagon is ready to flex it's
called<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.440> hexa<00:02:39.740> hexaflexagon<00:02:40.520> because

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
called the hexa hexaflexagon because

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.350 
called the hexa hexaflexagon because
it's<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.320> hexagon<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.980> it's<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.880> paper<00:02:44.090> which

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
it's a hexagon and it's a paper which

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.500 
it's a hexagon and it's a paper which
flexes<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.560> flex<00:02:45.830> again<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:47.030> has<00:02:47.180> six

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
flexes so flex again and it has six

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.900 
flexes so flex again and it has six
different<00:02:47.720> phases<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:48.560> hexa<00:02:49.010> hexaflexagon

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
different phases so hexa hexaflexagon

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.080 
different phases so hexa hexaflexagon
this<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.050> second<00:02:51.380> phase<00:02:51.610> start<00:02:52.610> flexing

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
this is the second phase start flexing

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.800 
this is the second phase start flexing
the<00:02:53.450> third<00:02:53.720> one<00:02:53.930> shows<00:02:54.170> up<00:02:55.240> keep<00:02:56.240> playing

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the third one shows up keep playing

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.360 
the third one shows up keep playing
again<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:58.630> magically<00:02:59.630> if<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.500> turn<00:03:00.800> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
again and magically if you turn the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.870 
again and magically if you turn the
fourth<00:03:01.640> one<00:03:01.880> shows<00:03:02.090> up<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:04.370> fifth<00:03:04.580> one

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
fourth one shows up and the fifth one

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.050 
fourth one shows up and the fifth one
and<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.800> sixth<00:03:06.800> one<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> hardest<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.850> find

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
and the sixth one is the hardest to find

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.540 
and the sixth one is the hardest to find
but<00:03:08.750> if<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.020> keep<00:03:09.230> playing<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.920> will<00:03:10.190> get<00:03:10.400> it

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
but if you keep playing you will get it

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.180 
but if you keep playing you will get it
so<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.270> can<00:03:11.480> write<00:03:11.660> all<00:03:11.870> six<00:03:12.830> different

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
so you can write all six different

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.370 
so you can write all six different
