in order to break down the lock cylinder

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.110 
in order to break down the lock cylinder
we<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> look<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> end<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:38.940> now

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
there's a little check ball in here

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.549 
there's a little check ball in here
which<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:41.820> our<00:00:41.940> pick<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:43.230> release

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

further and it allows us to separate the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
further and it allows us to separate the
unit<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:54.739> now<00:00:55.739> you'll<00:00:55.920> notice<00:00:56.129> all<00:00:56.399> the
