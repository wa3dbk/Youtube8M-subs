going to come up too easily let's see

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
going to come up too easily let's see
what<00:01:30.210> degree<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> protection<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.200> offers<00:01:31.500> well

the<00:01:32.729> top<00:01:33.030> doesn't<00:01:33.960> protrude<00:01:34.260> so<00:01:34.830> this<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the top doesn't protrude so this one is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.969 
the top doesn't protrude so this one is
going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.640> protected<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:37.260> corner<00:01:37.860> in

just cut his back a bit but as such as
supplied<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.600> does<00:02:26.780> cover<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.260> microphone

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
supplied it does cover that microphone

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.090 
supplied it does cover that microphone
now<00:02:29.540> if<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.720> followed<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.230> case<00:02:30.380> open<00:02:30.650> like

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
now if I followed the case open like

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.010 
now if I followed the case open like
this<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.880> hold<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.270> iPad<00:02:32.600> as<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.840> normally

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
this I can hold the iPad as I normally

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.410 
this I can hold the iPad as I normally
would<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.700> little<00:02:34.700> bit<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.880> extra<00:02:35.030> bulk

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
would a little bit of extra bulk

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.500 
would a little bit of extra bulk
obviously<00:02:35.960> by<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.380> case<00:02:36.710> but<00:02:37.550> fully<00:02:38.240> usable

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
obviously by the case but fully usable

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.620 
obviously by the case but fully usable
like<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.730> if<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.820> want<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> use<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.270> in<00:02:41.480> its

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
like this and if I want to use it in its

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.590 
like this and if I want to use it in its
kickstand<00:02:42.170> position<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.740> have<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.550> open<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
kickstand position I have to open the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.010 
kickstand position I have to open the
case<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.710> then<00:02:46.130> place<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:47.540> ipad

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
case like so and then place the ipad

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.930 
case like so and then place the ipad
down<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.500> whatever<00:02:48.770> angle<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.340> one<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.820> go

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
down in whatever angle I one and go

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.120 
down in whatever angle I one and go
right<00:02:50.240> to<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.570> edge<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.840> case<00:02:51.080> or<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.890> can

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
right to the edge of the case or I can

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.240 
right to the edge of the case or I can
angle<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.460> up<00:02:52.670> more<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.410> then<00:02:55.070> its

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
angle it up more like this and then its

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.300 
angle it up more like this and then its
lowest<00:02:55.820> angle<00:02:56.180> you're<00:02:56.300> getting<00:02:56.510> roughly<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.470> 45

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
lowest angle you're getting roughly a 45

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.260 
lowest angle you're getting roughly a 45
degree<00:02:58.910> angle<00:02:59.150> on<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.080> iPad<00:03:00.500> now<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.640> would

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
degree angle on the iPad now I would

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.430 
degree angle on the iPad now I would
have<00:03:02.360> liked<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.750> have<00:03:02.780> seen<00:03:02.990> some<00:03:03.230> little

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
have liked to have seen some little

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.160 
have liked to have seen some little
ridges<00:03:03.860> along<00:03:04.010> here<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:05.240> stop<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.810> ipad

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
ridges along here to stop the ipad

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.500 
ridges along here to stop the ipad
slipping<00:03:06.650> but<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.460> said<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.030> does<00:03:08.210> feel

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
slipping but that said it does feel

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.630 
slipping but that said it does feel
fairly<00:03:09.020> stable<00:03:09.410> once<00:03:09.800> it's<00:03:10.040> in<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.280> angled

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
fairly stable once it's in the angled

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.910 
fairly stable once it's in the angled
position<00:03:10.820> I<00:03:11.270> don't<00:03:11.870> feel<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.530> it's<00:03:12.650> going<00:03:12.860> to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
position I don't feel that it's going to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.540 
position I don't feel that it's going to
actually<00:03:13.450> fall<00:03:14.450> down<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:16.010> let's<00:03:16.190> pop<00:03:16.400> this

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
actually fall down so let's pop this

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.450 
actually fall down so let's pop this
background<00:03:16.820> into<00:03:17.720> its<00:03:17.840> closed<00:03:18.140> position

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
background into its closed position

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.610 
background into its closed position
we've<00:03:19.460> got<00:03:19.670> hard<00:03:19.970> rigid<00:03:20.300> front<00:03:20.750> here<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:21.470> is

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
we've got hard rigid front here this is

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.260 
we've got hard rigid front here this is
quite<00:03:21.860> hard<00:03:22.160> as<00:03:22.400> obviously<00:03:22.700> got<00:03:22.850> some<00:03:23.000> board

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
quite hard as obviously got some board

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.210 
quite hard as obviously got some board
in<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.260> that's<00:03:24.440> offering<00:03:24.710> a<00:03:24.830> good<00:03:25.040> amount

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
in it so that's offering a good amount

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.210 
in it so that's offering a good amount
of<00:03:25.340> protection<00:03:25.490> to<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.150> screen<00:03:26.660> of<00:03:26.840> your<00:03:27.220> iPad

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
of protection to the screen of your iPad

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.490 
of protection to the screen of your iPad
the<00:03:28.880> back<00:03:29.150> has<00:03:29.360> got<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.600> double<00:03:29.930> thickness<00:03:30.230> of

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
the back has got the double thickness of

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.370 
the back has got the double thickness of
the<00:03:30.620> case<00:03:30.830> plus<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.520> micro<00:03:31.970> suede<00:03:32.270> lining<00:03:32.600> for

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
the case plus the micro suede lining for

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.750 
the case plus the micro suede lining for
the<00:03:33.440> back<00:03:33.709> stay<00:03:33.950> in<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.100> nice<00:03:34.250> amount<00:03:34.610> of

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
the back stay in a nice amount of

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.449 
the back stay in a nice amount of
protection<00:03:34.880> too<00:03:35.650> overall<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.890> think<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.400> is

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
protection too overall I think this is

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.550 
protection too overall I think this is
quite<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.910> nice<00:03:38.060> case<00:03:38.360> it's<00:03:38.990> got<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.230> added

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
quite a nice case it's got that added

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.080 
quite a nice case it's got that added
flexibility<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.520> can<00:03:40.640> use<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:40.850> for

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
flexibility that you can use it for

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.730 
flexibility that you can use it for
viewing<00:03:41.390> videos<00:03:41.750> when<00:03:42.020> it's<00:03:42.140> in<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.350> angled

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.949 
viewing videos when it's in that angled
position<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.400> it's<00:03:44.060> just<00:03:44.270> an<00:03:44.390> ice<00:03:44.510> pick<00:03:44.780> up
