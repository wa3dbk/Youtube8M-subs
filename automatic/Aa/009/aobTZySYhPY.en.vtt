00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
Air Force will it get you to shut up

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.300 
Air Force will it get you to shut up
about<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.660> time<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.649> cast<00:01:25.920> Robert

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
about the time that we cast Robert

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.029 
about the time that we cast Robert
Downey<00:01:26.490> jr.<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.179> was<00:01:28.170> thinking<00:01:28.380> about<00:01:28.830> the

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
Downey jr. I was thinking about the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.950 
Downey jr. I was thinking about the
house<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.550> trying<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.789> figure<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.360> kind

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
house and trying to figure out what kind

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.340 
house and trying to figure out what kind
of<00:01:31.110> design<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.649> should<00:01:31.830> be<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:33.259> even<00:01:34.259> though

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
of design it should be and even though

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.290 
of design it should be and even though
we<00:01:34.500> had<00:01:34.649> decided<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> angular

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
we had decided on this kind of angular

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.460 
we had decided on this kind of angular
flat<00:01:36.750> metallic<00:01:37.740> hard-edged<00:01:38.700> look<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:40.080> idea

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
flat metallic hard-edged look the idea

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.580 
flat metallic hard-edged look the idea
that<00:01:40.560> Robert<00:01:41.160> Downey<00:01:41.369> jr.<00:01:41.849> as<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> ck<00:01:43.229> comes

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that Robert Downey jr. as a ck comes

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.969 
that Robert Downey jr. as a ck comes
with<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.860> certain<00:01:44.869> vulnerability<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.740> him

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
with a certain vulnerability with him

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.180 
with a certain vulnerability with him
and<00:01:47.929> it<00:01:48.929> may<00:01:49.140> sound<00:01:49.349> strange<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.920> we

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
and it may sound strange but we

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.160 
and it may sound strange but we
redesigned<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.849> notion<00:01:51.300> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.569> house<00:01:51.660> after

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
redesigned the notion of the house after

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
redesigned the notion of the house after
casting<00:01:53.099> him<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.550> thought<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.940> he<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.239> be

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
casting him I thought that he would be

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.160 
casting him I thought that he would be
more<00:01:54.630> suitable<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.550> something<00:01:56.550> that

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
more suitable in something that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.240 
more suitable in something that
architectural<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.259> mirrored<00:01:58.619> who<00:01:58.800> he<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.220> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
architectural a mirrored who he was a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160 
architectural a mirrored who he was a
little<00:01:59.640> softer<00:02:00.179> inside<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.539> little<00:02:00.720> bit<00:02:00.929> more

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
little softer inside a little bit more

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
little softer inside a little bit more
susceptible<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.399> more<00:02:02.759> vulnerable

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
susceptible a little more vulnerable

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.940 
susceptible a little more vulnerable
there<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.929> certain<00:02:04.170> vulnerability<00:02:04.830> about

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
there was a certain vulnerability about

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.949 
there was a certain vulnerability about
him<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.459> thought<00:02:05.640> round<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.330> nice<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.780> more
