colors in here this was only four pounds
so<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.720> thought<00:02:21.870> why<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.200> give<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.590> go<00:02:22.739> it's

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
so I thought why not give it a go it's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.090 
so I thought why not give it a go it's
called<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.730> undress<00:02:24.120> me<00:02:24.329> 2<00:02:24.570> palette<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.410> by

called that undress me 2 palette and by
mua<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.560> then<00:02:28.560> believe<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.579> or<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:29.760> I've

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
