 well my name is pablo damián garcía 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.079
 I am a doctor graduated from the university 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.099
 national of argentina silver 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.890
 currently practicing as a doctor 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.279
 ophthalmologist 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 as a hierarchical specialist 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.340
 how I knew the technique is interesting 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.270
 out there tell me that for a long time 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.180
 I was in pain at the cervical level 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.780
 and I did massage but my discomfort 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.080
 they were always a friend told me that 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.690
 I realized the prophylaxis I left 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.030
 spend some time my symptoms still 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.700
 they continued cervicalgia 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.180
 it accentuates my headache and in a 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.190
 I also had ringing in my ears 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.550
 I turned to traumatologists who helped me 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.160
 they said he had the perfect cervical 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.340
 that I had no problem given to me 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.700
 ear problem to have recourse to an otorrino 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.440
 who after doing many tests 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.530
 clinical and many studies told me that 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.530
 mine was perfect gives me medication 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.320
 I continued with the buzzing one night 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.720
 not sleep tonight slept he arrived 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.399
 tired to work I went to a neurologist 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.729
 also because they told me that 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.890
 buzzing had no solution the neurologist 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.470
 I get a resonance and the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.750
 resonance 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.300
 it came out perfect thank you thank god ' 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.430
 some patients went to the office and 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.470
 they recommended me to do the therapy that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.750
 I was moving in a block in the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.030
 office and the patients made me 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.770
 doctor do the atlas look how good 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.590
 I feel like I 'm moving my neck like 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.780
 changed my life I feel rebién and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.410
 following these circumstances I decided 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.000
 this perform therapy and then 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.009
 Well obviously to perform the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.370
 I therapy was pain level 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.760
 cervical I got the buzzing and I 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.920
 I was the headache 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.209
 this is what I can tell from how 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.209
 will continue the therapy 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.709
 the motivation for which led me to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.959
 perform the training process is 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.480
 that once I had realized the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.860
 therapy to have felt I also started 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.980
 look for a lot of information through 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.099
 internet I realized that this had 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.209
 many scopes could be offered to 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.590
 a lot of people and that's what I 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.970
 took to train me and start 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.970
 investigate a little more about the subject 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.650
 actually what surprised me is that 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.240
 is a treatment that is performed 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.410
 once 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.440
 and I received a control 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.570
 and that seemed wonderful to me not to have 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.980
 have to resort many times to make a 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.409
 therapy 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.330
 I was surprised also in which I did not 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.549
 they made no brusque handling 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.120
 of the neck they did not put any 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.670
 injection 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.610
 I did not have to take absolutely never 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.080
 more no medication and good only that 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.500
 I really marvel at the 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.500
 technique 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.510
 doubts regarding the course 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.000
 I had not really come to learn 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.640
 something new something totally different 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.590
 for me and when I got to the course the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.450
 expectations that they covered were a lot 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.430
 more than I really expected 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.650
 I discovered that the technique has many more 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.640
 scope of what one can reach 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.580
 believe and that can encompass many 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.349
 diseases and you can do very well and 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.989
 you can heal a lot with this technique in 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.000
 I'm really very happy with what 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.040
 of the course discovered more than I 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.120
 I waited with the expectations of the course 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.810
 I found it very interesting very intensive 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.670
 the didactic material delivered was 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.070
 very interesting and very good 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.330
 the practice that was carried out was excellent 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.710
 I really can not contribute more than 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.600
 thanks to the way it was 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.540
 developed the course 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.290
 actually knowing so little with 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:42.170
 regarding therapy the expectations 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.140
 that I had were limited and I knew 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.050
 that he could do well maybe to a 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.570
 certain number of people once 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.480
 done the course I realized that this 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.910
 it expanded much more 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.430
 what I thought or I realized 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.260
 that I can cover much more and that there 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.490
 much more to embrace and to do with 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.490
 this therapy 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.760
 at the doctor level 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.980
 I think I will try many 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:22.540
 diseases in which many others 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.110
 professionals do not have scope to the 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.930
 same no autoimmune diseases 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.090
 degenerative this arthritis as for 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.350
 give an example multiple sclerosis is the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.750
 which are patients who come very 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.410
 suffered that are very medicated and with 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:42.210
 this technique may feel an improvement 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.210
 in most patients 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.500
 is that actually the benefits that I 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.990
 I have obviously noticed with colleagues that 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.490
 they are doing it and what I could see in 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.099
 the course 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.169
 the benefits are actually very 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.150
 good and very satisfactory 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.090
 and that was one of the reasons why 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.240
 it took me to investigate to get in and 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.729
 be currently doing this course 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.639
 what is remarkable about the technique is that it is 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:17.000
 a basic technique for patients who 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.880
 do not be afraid to be encouraged that 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.090
 simple to perform 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.010
 that are going to come out of bone they will enter 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.920
 office walking and they will leave 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:31.660
 walking and with an improvement very very 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.460
 notorious in your body in everything or 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.770
 This is a therapy in which 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.780
 linked we can say how how 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.150
 the gears of a clock work 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.550
 organic level let's find a 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.410
 improvement at a vascular level 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.940
 mechanical and neurological level that we 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.940
 will allow a healthier life
