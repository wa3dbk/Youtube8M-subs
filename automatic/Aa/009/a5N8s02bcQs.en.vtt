00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Welcome, I'm a teacher. 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.970
 manoel viana I'm here for today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.980
 comment with you but two questions 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.519
 foundation carlos nagas to the issues of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.330
 reason and proportion is the first of these 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.580
 Let's discuss the following 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.189
 if the ratio between two numbers and four 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.560
 and its shadow is equal to 27 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.210
 least of them is to have him 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.820
 alternatives is the prime number to be 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.000
 multiple of 77 divider of 5 c divider of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.800
 6 or if it is multiple of 9 staff when 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.930
 We are going to solve a problem of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 then speaking two numbers is always 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.059
 It is very important that you establish which 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.219
 are the variables and will represent these 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.430
 new ones, for example in this case the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.590
 I adopted as variables the letter a letter b 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.840
 the letter will represent the smallest of these 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.660
 numbers and the letter b will represent the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.360
 with the information that we 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.390
 we have there you can say there is about b 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.579
 equal to 4 climb 5 because it says the following 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.660
 eleven ratio between two numbers and four 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.570
 fifths 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 the reason is four fifths I am 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.180
 saying that the smaller I am and the greater I 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.360
 well then I'll write the child on the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.100
 greater than it will be equal to 4 5º certain 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 From here we can do what 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 Any cross multiplies five times the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.880
 equal to 5 a and b times four equal to 4 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.680
 python 5 to 4 pi some other information 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 that we have is what is the sum of these two 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 numbers equals 27 so I can say 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.610
 that there is more half to 27 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.670
 I will isolate myself here because the Blessing 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.250
 isolated pizzollo from b in this equation I 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.560
 I can substitute the other equation and so 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.540
 find the value of the air because I want to find 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.119
 direct the value of the air because it wants 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.399
 know which is the smallest of that number right 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.500
 So if I isolate the one I would find 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.390
 There the baby later I would have to go back 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.369
 here to find the value of air 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.720
 how do I know what he wants is value 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.689
 of the child than what is being 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.939
 represented by the one to isolate the beac 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.600
 b isolates us replaced Obina 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.250
 another equation and find direct value donated 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.409
 to isolate the good, just pass the apr 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.770
 other side subtracted as well equal to 20 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.160
 7 - the one now just take this equation 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.940
 and replaced b by 27 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 - Ah then taking that invasion 5 to 4 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.830
 b now replaces the bishop 27 - ah then 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.370
 5 to 4 times 27 - a false distributive a 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.420
 four times 27 four times - oh then 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.030
 four times 27 108 four times lower - 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.370
 to Africa - 4 to 1 to find the value of 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.250
 iva pass this -4 to the other side 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.490
 Adding then I will be with 5 more 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.660
 four here is equal to 108 5 plus 4 a 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.830
 equal to the 9th gate 9a equal to 108 for 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.490
 Find him out of the air 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:58.010
 just pass 19 divided so equal to 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.200
 108/9 108 / new item 12 up to the value 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.620
 of air the value said of the smaller of those 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.710
 numbers are 12 right and then I do not have 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.410
 alternative 12 that we have here 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.060
 cousin no 12 is not the prime number 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.880
 so we will not mark this 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.080
 alternative wide visible by five 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:21.470
 also no 12 is not divisible by 5 o ai 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.190
 multiple of 7 there is not multiple 7 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.050
 white visible for six yes 12 is 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.360
 divisible percent is alternative 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.340
 correct is the one here you can come here 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.750
 still to verify that it does not 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.160
 it would be correct right? 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.490
 I do not know, there are two alternatives 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.260
 correct then the 12 we found 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.270
 here multiples of 9 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.830
 no it's not the new kind then the only one 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.340
 correct alternative is actually 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.739
 alternative because here is worth 12 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.840
 divisible by six then you can dial 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.530
 as the correct alternative for 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.459
 this alternative issue of the 12th to 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.620
 divisible by 6 the next question that I 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.810
 I chose the question that says the following 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.330
 of the total number of animals inspected 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.770
 certain region knows that here we have 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.170
 two information 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.630
 the number of vaccinated and non- pregnant 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.000
 vaccinated in 45 units 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.560
 other information the ratio of the number 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.750
 unvaccinated animals and ott and 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.930
 vaccinated in this order and two fifths 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.729
 under these conditions the total number of animals 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.050
 it's inspected again we have a 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.210
 very much like land 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.220
 then we will establish that two 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.830
 variables and asked that each of them 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.659
 represent the letter will represent the 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.030
 vaccinated animals 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.460
 the letter b will represent animals not 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.960
 vaccines and what information 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.990
 we have the first number of 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.470
 vaccinees and serogroups not vaccinated in 45 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.949
 units of vaccinated animals and then the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.949
 equal to ab that is not vaccinated is more 45 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.099
 you joa and sérgio b 45 units 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.379
 I can write that the oab plus 45 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.360
 the other information said that the reason 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.479
 between the number of unvaccinated animals 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.349
 that the letter b and those of vaccinated animals 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.990
 that the letter in that order and the skeptics 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.629
 so I can have bis the piauí equal to two 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:20.330
 seventh and then multiply the cross again 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:23.469
 then two seven times b7 b and sometimes 22 a 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.719
 we already have there due to the b-am 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:29.120
 so just do what you replaced here 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:31.849
 for this information for four for good 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.210
 plus 45 then I get that same equation only 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:38.000
 I'm going to replace the 7th 7b 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.630
 which is equal to twice as much more 45 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.139
 distribute b2b twice and two 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.199
 times 45 and 90 to find the value of my 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:52.310
 pass 2b on the other hand then subtracting 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:56.870
 I get 7 b - 2b which is equal to 90 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.389
 7 - 2005 p 56 90 reduce the value of the property 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.080
 just pass the five dividing then 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:05.120
 bengo to 90/5 soon got to 18 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.759
 right now I can also find the 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.219
 value business value just grab this 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:13.310
 equation replaced alley 18 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:15.979
 then there will be 18 plus 45 already 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:21.259
 I got this equation already replaced apodi 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:25.190
 the peak 18 right then 18 plus 45 equal to 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:28.310
 63 then the amount donated is 63 was bloody 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:31.069
 on totem alternative 63 ac caution goes 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.590
 marking the 63 reasons why the 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:36.680
 exercise the right to request such 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.080
 total of inspected animals is that it 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.580
 want to know how many animals were 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.439
 inspected 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.110
 he inspected all these animals and 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:46.659
 found that it says 18 were not 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.240
 vaccinated and that 63 were vaccinated 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.830
 therefore the total number of animals 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.469
 inspected is only one of weapons b 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.000
 So now we add 63 plus 18 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:07:00.729
 is equal to 81 of the total animals 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.939
 inspected was 81 correct alternative 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:07.389
 the alternative is like this then 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:09.340
 these were the two questions of reason 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.469
 and proportion of the carlos chagas foundation and 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.969
 I hope you have enjoyed it and I 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:15.039
 I promise to come back soon with other 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:19.169
 issues resolved and commented on 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.169
 you a hug and see you there
