00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello, good morning to you, how are you? 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.429
 here is gerson today is a day 12 of 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.320
 March 2013 and today is a Tuesday 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.090
 good this video is more a tutorial giving 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
 some tips on how to make a 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.890
 recording using the computer from a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 interview for example most of the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.330
 people who interview at the time of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.130
 transcribe realize how difficult it is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.960
 do the transcript and sometimes 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.820
 Someone calls me wondering if they 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.779
 had a program that will do this 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.210
 recording 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.980
 in fact there are several programs that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.410
 the opposite process is to transform 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.230
 an audio text but few or almost 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.899
 none effectively turns a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.460
 I auditioned a text to the time behind the car of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.190
 a way of doing it in a more 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.100
 effective and eyes on a website of a guy who 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.360
 made a suggestion is a French website 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.129
 talking to use youtube then 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.940
 here I'll talk a little bit like you 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.140
 do it 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
 good do not have much time and youtube 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.129
 put a service that is to make the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.379
 transcript of the audio in general had only 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.850
 English only now that you have Portuguese too. 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.129
 so when you send a video to the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.309
 youtube now he can see the band 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.650
 and create try to create is the audio 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.900
 that speech does not actually try 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.000
 transcribed the audio is so that the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.380
 Perfect process but it helps a lot 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.020
 even because in addition to doing the transcription 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.909
 Then he puts the seconds then 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.310
 you see if he transcribed right or left 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.570
 wrong with some phrase that much thing 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.979
 simpler 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.259
 so my tip is for who has to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.720
 do some transcription is you get the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.729
 create a youtube account to record your 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.829
 interview I recommend that you record 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.630
 with a tape recorder close to the person 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.119
 do not have background noise the peak because 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.740
 is in good quality not serious with a 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.509
 microphone for example from a camera 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.549
 because the microphone and a camera is very 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.380
 bad if you recorded using these 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.420
 digital recorders that you have today 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.119
 can in any program of editing of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.460
 video including many free and 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.860
 put a black band and video 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.939
 put the audio behind it and upload 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.710
 for youtube 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.390
 even though not being perfect is the best 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.820
 program I've seen so far to 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.649
 do the transcript I've tested here with 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.880
 my videos you can test there in the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.100
 Youtube channel 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.140
 I put a background song then 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 This is quite detrimental to 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.390
 understanding youtube about audio 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.310
 but still it still gets quality 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.260
 very good and this video that I 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.790
 put a background song to see 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.709
 if it's how it's going to get transcript 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.330
 And you can take a look there 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.030
 feature will be available for new 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.380
 uploads so if you have an old video 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.569
 it will not work you have to 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.819
 resend request reprocessing and 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.010
 anecy reprocessing what it will do 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.110
 transcription of the audio and there in the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.940
 youtube page on the page that the video 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.220
 appears you will see an icon on your side 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.140
 calls transcription and it will already show the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.500
 Real-time audio just copy paste 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.450
 That's the word and there you have 90 percent 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.790
 given the job wants to make a 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.260
 audio transcription done by youtube 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.580
 well this is the tip I wanted to give 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.230
 because I know there are a lot of people who 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.000
 have to do an interview during a 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.709
 search something rather in making 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.600
 sometimes the person is 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.459
 wanting to do a content analysis 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.410
 so you're going to have to do broadcast 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.690
 image an interview this takes 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.920
 enough then youtube can 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.500
 help a lot 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.769
 that's a hug kiss to you and to 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.769
 next 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.790
 ah
