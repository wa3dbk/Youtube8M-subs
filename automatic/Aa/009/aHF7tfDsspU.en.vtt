00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
types of olive oils I don't know why

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.309 
types of olive oils I don't know why
they<00:04:01.310> listed<00:04:01.729> it<00:04:01.879> twice<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:02.689> seems<00:04:02.930> like<00:04:03.079> one

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
they listed it twice it seems like one

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.250 
they listed it twice it seems like one
is<00:04:03.500> Sun<00:04:03.739> oil<00:04:04.129> and<00:04:04.370> one<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.609> a<00:04:04.639> leaf<00:04:04.970> extract<00:04:05.260> it

also has a fruit oil and it is not
alcohol<00:04:09.709> free<00:04:10.220> like<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.639> first<00:04:11.000> Buster<00:04:11.479> is

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
alcohol free like the first Buster is

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.819 
alcohol free like the first Buster is
but<00:04:13.729> I<00:04:13.879> felt<00:04:14.329> like<00:04:14.479> I<00:04:14.540> didn't<00:04:14.989> get<00:04:15.259> to<00:04:15.319> use<00:04:15.650> it

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
but I felt like I didn't get to use it

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.649 
but I felt like I didn't get to use it
enough<00:04:16.039> times<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:17.000> really<00:04:17.500> tell<00:04:18.500> how<00:04:19.659> affected

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
enough times to really tell how affected

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.230 
enough times to really tell how affected
my<00:04:20.840> hair<00:04:21.169> because<00:04:21.979> by<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.310> time<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:22.729> was<00:04:23.060> done

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
my hair because by the time I was done

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.480 
my hair because by the time I was done
applying<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.960> my<00:04:24.080> hair<00:04:24.320> felt<00:04:24.590> he<00:04:24.860> sticky<00:04:25.250> to

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
applying it my hair felt he sticky to

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.720 
applying it my hair felt he sticky to
really<00:04:25.729> do

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
really do

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.300 
really do
so<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.540> tried<00:04:27.870> blow-drying<00:04:28.410> in<00:04:28.680> an<00:04:28.800> air<00:04:29.010> drying

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
so I tried blow-drying in an air drying

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.520 
so I tried blow-drying in an air drying
it<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.670> this<00:04:29.940> didn't<00:04:30.300> do<00:04:30.420> anything<00:04:30.810> for<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.260> it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
it and this didn't do anything for it it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.630 
it and this didn't do anything for it it
just<00:04:31.560> made<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.040> feel<00:04:32.250> stiff<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:32.990> sticky<00:04:33.990> and

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
just made it feel stiff and sticky and

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.850 
just made it feel stiff and sticky and
my<00:04:35.640> hair<00:04:35.850> wasn't<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.300> much<00:04:36.480> dry<00:04:36.960> as<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.350> was

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
my hair wasn't so much dry as it was

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.550 
my hair wasn't so much dry as it was
just<00:04:38.600> unmanageable<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.780> felt<00:04:40.020> like<00:04:40.140> I<00:04:40.230> couldn't

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
just unmanageable I felt like I couldn't

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.870 
just unmanageable I felt like I couldn't
do<00:04:40.800> anything<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.770> barely<00:04:44.280> used<00:04:44.670> any

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
do anything to it so I barely used any

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.940 
do anything to it so I barely used any
of<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:45.420> this<00:04:45.660> is<00:04:45.720> like<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.990> 1<00:04:46.320> out<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.590> 10

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
of this this is like a 1 out of 10

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.430 
of this this is like a 1 out of 10
because<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.790> smell<00:04:48.150> isn't<00:04:48.390> very<00:04:48.750> good<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:49.260> me

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
because the smell isn't very good to me

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.850 
because the smell isn't very good to me
it<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:50.130> sticky<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.790> feels<00:04:51.090> greasy<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:52.440> doesn't

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
it is sticky it feels greasy it doesn't

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.670 
it is sticky it feels greasy it doesn't
last<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.700> is<00:04:53.850> not<00:04:54.420> helpful<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.110> my<00:04:55.410> hair

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
last and it is not helpful to my hair

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.220 
last and it is not helpful to my hair
