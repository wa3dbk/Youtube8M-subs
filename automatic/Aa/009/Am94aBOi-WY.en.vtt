hi<00:00:00.390> I<00:00:00.690> get<00:00:01.230> people<00:00:01.439> asking<00:00:01.740> me<00:00:02.070> about<00:00:02.460> starting

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hi I get people asking me about starting

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.599 
hi I get people asking me about starting
fluid<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.629> diesel<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.980> course<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.400> should

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
fluid on a diesel and of course I should

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.179 
fluid on a diesel and of course I should
say<00:00:05.819> no<00:00:06.120> don't<00:00:06.420> ever<00:00:06.629> use<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.140> but<00:00:07.440> I'm<00:00:07.770> try<00:00:08.130> to

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
say no don't ever use it but I'm try to

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.520 
say no don't ever use it but I'm try to
be<00:00:08.340> realistic<00:00:08.700> whenever<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.300> say<00:00:09.570> anything<00:00:09.599> so

be realistic whenever I say anything so

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.830 
be realistic whenever I say anything so
we<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.160> all<00:00:11.309> know<00:00:11.519> people<00:00:11.880> use<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> want

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
we we all know people use it so I want

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.270 
we we all know people use it so I want
to<00:00:12.900> just<00:00:13.019> tell<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.290> some<00:00:13.440> precautions<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
to just tell you some precautions and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.680 
to just tell you some precautions and
this<00:00:14.910> one<00:00:15.030> right<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.389> actually<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
this one right here is actually a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.260 
this one right here is actually a
perfect<00:00:15.929> candidate<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.590> starting<00:00:17.400> fluid<00:00:17.609> so

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
perfect candidate for starting fluid so

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.029 
perfect candidate for starting fluid so
I<00:00:18.300> want<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.510> show<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> proper<00:00:19.170> use<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.680> or

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
I want to show the proper use of it or

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.470 
I want to show the proper use of it or
at<00:00:20.160> least<00:00:20.189> what<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.520> found<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> proper

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
at least what I found to be the proper

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.500 
at least what I found to be the proper
use<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.109> explain<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> few<00:00:23.130> things<00:00:23.550> first

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
use of it and explain a few things first

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.990 
use of it and explain a few things first
of<00:00:24.689> all<00:00:24.779> Diesel's<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.410> designed<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> slow

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of all Diesel's are designed for a slow

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
of all Diesel's are designed for a slow
combustion<00:00:27.750> rate<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.410> diesel<00:00:28.590> fuel

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
combustion rate because diesel fuel

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.800 
combustion rate because diesel fuel
ignites<00:00:29.369> slowly<00:00:29.849> that's<00:00:30.179> how<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.420> works

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
ignites slowly that's how it works

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.530 
ignites slowly that's how it works
and<00:00:30.929> starting<00:00:31.920> fluid<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.520> gasoline<00:00:32.820> ignites

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and starting fluid like gasoline ignites

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.319 
and starting fluid like gasoline ignites
quicker<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.469> at<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> lower<00:00:35.430> temperature<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
quicker and at a lower temperature so

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.900 
quicker and at a lower temperature so
you've<00:00:36.960> got<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.410> careful<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:38.190> you're

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
you've got to be careful if you're

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.690 
you've got to be careful if you're
anywhere<00:00:39.570> under<00:00:39.870> sixty<00:00:40.559> degrees<00:00:40.890> outside

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
anywhere under sixty degrees outside

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.790 
anywhere under sixty degrees outside
you<00:00:42.030> could<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.329> an<00:00:42.480> air<00:00:42.660> intake<00:00:42.899> heater<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you could have an air intake heater that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.950 
you could have an air intake heater that
comes<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.460> your<00:00:44.610> glow<00:00:44.879> plugs<00:00:45.210> come<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
comes on or your glow plugs come on and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.979 
comes on or your glow plugs come on and
that<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.460> starting<00:00:48.420> fluid<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that was like the starting fluid and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.410 
that was like the starting fluid and
I've<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.860> explosions<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.670> air<00:00:50.789> filters<00:00:51.180> come

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I've had explosions and air filters come

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.049 
I've had explosions and air filters come
back<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:51.809> face<00:00:52.050> air<00:00:52.440> filters<00:00:52.890> housings<00:00:53.340> so

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
back in my face air filters housings so

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.560 
back in my face air filters housings so
what<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> try<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> tell<00:00:55.469> people<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
what I like to try to tell people is

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.510 
what I like to try to tell people is
well<00:00:57.570> again<00:00:57.690> don't<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.250> know

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
well again don't use it but we all know

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.540 
well again don't use it but we all know
that<00:00:59.850> people<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.649> warnings<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.160> give<00:01:02.370> is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that people do so the warnings I give is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.070 
that people do so the warnings I give is
it's<00:01:02.730> turn<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> key<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.840> least<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
it's turn the key on for at least a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.050 
it's turn the key on for at least a
minute<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.470> two<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.640> way<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.909> know<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
minute or two so that way we know the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.840 
minute or two so that way we know the
glow<00:01:06.360> plugs<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.400> heater<00:01:08.400> should<00:01:08.670> be

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
glow plugs and the heater should be

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.929 
glow plugs and the heater should be
already<00:01:09.600> got<00:01:09.990> hot<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.530> cooled<00:01:11.430> down<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> little

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
already got hot and cooled down a little

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.219 
already got hot and cooled down a little
bit<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.299> doesn't<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.630> night<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.930> soon<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
bit so it doesn't a night as soon as you

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.100 
bit so it doesn't a night as soon as you
spray<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.729> reason<00:01:15.060> why<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.689> use<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.020> on

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
spray it and the reason why we use it on

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.170 
spray it and the reason why we use it on
this<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.950> an<00:01:17.070> O<00:01:17.220> six<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> crank

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this one this is an O six that's a crank

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
this one this is an O six that's a crank
nose<00:01:18.420> start<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.740> watch<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.220> look

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
nose start so here we watch it we look

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.520 
nose start so here we watch it we look
at<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:20.700> ICP<00:01:21.210> pressure

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.039 

won't<00:01:28.530> build<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.979> past<00:01:29.250> 300<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
won't build up past 300 and the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
won't build up past 300 and the
customers<00:01:31.530> telling<00:01:31.829> me<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.670> I'll<00:01:32.789> just

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
customers telling me that I'll just

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.510 
customers telling me that I'll just
spray<00:01:33.149> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.210> ether<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.020> start

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
spray a little ether and it will start

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.999 
spray a little ether and it will start
so<00:01:35.810> again<00:01:36.810> everybody's<00:01:37.350> doing<00:01:37.649> it<00:01:37.740> out<00:01:37.829> there

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
so again everybody's doing it out there

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.590 
so again everybody's doing it out there
so<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.220> wanted<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> show<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:39.299> least<00:01:39.420> some

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
so I wanted to show at least some

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
so I wanted to show at least some
precautions<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> way<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.310> this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
precautions on it so the way I do this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.350 
precautions on it so the way I do this
here<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.179> go<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> air<00:01:42.990> filter

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
here is I just go out to the air filter

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.520 
here is I just go out to the air filter
take<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> filter<00:01:45.929> minder<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:47.810> use<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> fluid

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
take the filter minder out use a fluid

fix it

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.350 
fix it
I'm<00:02:25.870> sure<00:02:26.080> it's<00:02:26.320> dummy<00:02:26.680> plugs<00:02:26.980> or<00:02:27.360> high
