00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.219 
spiritually and of course filming wise
it<00:01:37.860> looks<00:01:38.040> beautiful<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.520> speed<00:01:38.930> but<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.990> think

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it looks beautiful on speed but I think

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.510 
it looks beautiful on speed but I think
the<00:01:40.320> most<00:01:40.530> memorable<00:01:40.860> part<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the most memorable part of this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.219 
the most memorable part of this
filmmaking<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.240> me<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.509> least<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.930> first

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
filmmaking to me at least was the first

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.440 
filmmaking to me at least was the first
seven<00:01:43.470> eight<00:01:43.560> days<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> changed<00:01:45.149> my<00:01:45.270> look

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
seven eight days when I changed my look

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
seven eight days when I changed my look
for<00:01:46.229> Surinder<00:01:46.649> Sahni<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.759> would<00:01:47.909> be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
for Surinder Sahni and I would be

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.950 
for Surinder Sahni and I would be
walking<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> sets

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
walking on the sets

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.710 
walking on the sets
nobody<00:01:49.740> recognizing<00:01:50.310> me<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.610> got<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> taste<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
nobody recognizing me I got a taste of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.370 
nobody recognizing me I got a taste of
things<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.079> come

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
things to come

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.600 
things to come
thirty<00:01:52.710> years<00:01:52.799> later<00:01:53.130> when<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:53.460> no<00:01:53.579> longer

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
thirty years later when I'm no longer

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.359 
thirty years later when I'm no longer
esta<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.780> nobody<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.409> recognize<00:01:55.560> me<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
esta and nobody would recognize me and I

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.289 
esta and nobody would recognize me and I
we<00:01:56.549> miss<00:01:56.729> it

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
we miss it

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.389 
we miss it
I<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.590> most<00:01:59.040> memorable

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
I I think that is the most memorable

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.980 
I I think that is the most memorable
moment<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> hope<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.329> never<00:02:00.360> happens<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.960> me

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
moment and I hope it never happens to me

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.350 
moment and I hope it never happens to me
again<00:02:01.320> ever<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.909> recognised

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
again ever because not to be recognised

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 
again ever because not to be recognised
after<00:02:03.689> 20<00:02:03.990> years<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.259> such<00:02:04.799> high<00:02:05.009> recognition

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
after 20 years of such high recognition

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.210 
after 20 years of such high recognition
is<00:02:06.090> something<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.689> wasn't<00:02:06.869> ready<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.560> not
