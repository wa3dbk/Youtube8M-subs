happened to have a yamaha r6 between the
years<00:00:29.279> 99<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.269> 2001<00:00:31.340> um<00:00:32.480> I<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.170> bike<00:00:34.320> for

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
years 99 in 2001 um I had this bike for

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 
years 99 in 2001 um I had this bike for
about<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.710> year<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.520> mm<00:00:36.180> yeah<00:00:36.360> maja<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.840> sick

about a year the mm yeah maja are sick

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.650 
about a year the mm yeah maja are sick
and<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:41.300> one<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> problems

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and you can see and one of the problems

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.729 
and you can see and one of the problems
I<00:00:42.930> had<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.550> electrical<00:00:45.030> system<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
I had is the electrical system the

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.910 
I had is the electrical system the
charging<00:00:46.739> system<00:00:46.860> kept<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.920 

battery<00:00:52.920> died<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.340> stranded<00:00:54.120> several<00:00:54.660> times

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
battery died got stranded several times

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.330 
battery died got stranded several times
I<00:00:55.910> change<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> stator<00:00:58.129> one<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.850> three<00:01:00.480> times

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
I change the stator one to three times

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.609 
I change the stator one to three times
one<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> times<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.989> melted<00:01:04.470> right

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
one of the times they get melted right

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
one of the times they get melted right
there<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.489> sometimes<00:01:05.970> when<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:06.869> bad

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
there but sometimes when they go bad

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.429 
there but sometimes when they go bad
they<00:01:07.320> don't<00:01:07.380> even<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.830> melted<00:01:08.310> um<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
they don't even get melted um and you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.320 
they don't even get melted um and you
know<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.280> test<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.790> you'll<00:01:12.030> see

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
know you just have to test it you'll see

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.940 
know you just have to test it you'll see
with<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> multimeter<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.790> it's<00:01:14.790> either

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
with the multimeter that it's either

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.539 
with the multimeter that it's either
it's<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.220> limiting<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.470> voltage<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it's not limiting the voltage so the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.510 
it's not limiting the voltage so the
voltage<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.000> too<00:01:21.299> high<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.520> burn

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
voltage is going too high it will burn

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.590 
voltage is going too high it will burn
out<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:24.170> your<00:01:25.170> main<00:01:25.790> computer<00:01:26.790> box<00:01:27.150> or

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
out your your main computer box or

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
out your your main computer box or
exhaust<00:01:28.380> I'll<00:01:28.560> burn<00:01:28.740> out

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
exhaust I'll burn out

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
exhaust I'll burn out
or<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.000> burn<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:30.570> own<00:01:31.369> head<00:01:32.369> uh<00:01:32.960> your

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
or it can burn your own head uh your

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.249 
or it can burn your own head uh your
gauge<00:01:34.259> lights<00:01:34.619> or<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:36.810> caused<00:01:37.049> other

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
gauge lights or this caused other

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
gauge lights or this caused other
problems<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.009> actually<00:01:38.280> messed<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.090> my

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
problems so I actually messed up my

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.160 
problems so I actually messed up my
coils<00:01:39.600> also<00:01:41.119> but<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> went<00:01:42.360> through<00:01:42.540> three

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
coils also but I went through three

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.249 
coils also but I went through three
stators<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:46.799> got<00:01:47.220> tired<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:48.079> dealing<00:01:49.079> with

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
stators and I got tired of dealing with

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.600 
stators and I got tired of dealing with
this<00:01:49.380> problem<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> show<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.579> how

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this problem I want to show you all how

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.600 
this problem I want to show you all how
you<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.210> fix<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.930> problem<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.610> I've

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
you can fix this problem because I've

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
you can fix this problem because I've
now<00:01:53.850> gone<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.390> seven<00:01:55.350> months<00:01:55.500> without

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
now gone about seven months without

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.789 
now gone about seven months without
having<00:01:55.890> electrical<00:01:56.610> problems<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.770> use<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
having electrical problems and I use a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
having electrical problems and I use a
heated<00:02:00.020> heated<00:02:01.250> jacket<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.540> from<00:02:03.540> gurbin

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
heated heated jacket and from gurbin

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.109 
heated heated jacket and from gurbin
which<00:02:04.500> also<00:02:04.920> put<00:02:05.130> some<00:02:05.159> more<00:02:05.430> electrical

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
which also put some more electrical

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.869 
which also put some more electrical
drain<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.719> system<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.429> working<00:02:08.729> fine

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
drain on the system so it's working fine

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.390 
drain on the system so it's working fine
now<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.810> finally<00:02:10.069> fixed

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
now so I think I finally fixed

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.809 
now so I think I finally fixed
and<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.099> got<00:02:14.310> tired<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.670> wasting

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and you know I got tired of wasting

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.649 
and you know I got tired of wasting
money<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.360> these<00:02:15.480> things<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.379> decided<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.430> do

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
money on these things so I decided to do

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.479 
money on these things so I decided to do
use<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.690> different<00:02:19.049> stator<00:02:19.440> without<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> state

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
use a different stator without a state

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.229 
use a different stator without a state
or<00:02:20.610> different<00:02:21.000> rectifier<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.970> what<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.000> found

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
or different rectifier and what I found

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.270 
or different rectifier and what I found
is<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.629> this<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:24.989> off<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.290> zx6<00:02:25.920> actually

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
is that this one off the zx6 actually

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.330 
is that this one off the zx6 actually
worked<00:02:26.580> pretty<00:02:26.909> good<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.739> has<00:02:28.980> too<00:02:29.220> many

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
worked pretty good but this has too many

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:39.080 
worked pretty good but this has too many
wires<00:02:29.730> as<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.730> has<00:02:34.549> c4<00:02:35.989> black<00:02:36.989> wires<00:02:38.090> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
wires as this one has c4 black wires and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.289 
wires as this one has c4 black wires and
as<00:02:39.659> on<00:02:40.049> an<00:02:40.200> extra<00:02:40.530> green<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.549> brown<00:02:41.879> remote

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
as on an extra green and brown remote

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.990 
as on an extra green and brown remote
wire<00:02:42.540> which<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.769> did<00:02:43.980> work<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.579> wouldn't

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
wire which it did work but it wouldn't

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.150 
wire which it did work but it wouldn't
the<00:02:45.750> electrical<00:02:46.440> current<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:46.799> being<00:02:46.980> too

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the electrical current was being too

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.059 
the electrical current was being too
high<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.849> couldn't<00:02:48.359> use<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.599> but<00:02:49.079> I<00:02:49.290> notice

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
high so I couldn't use that but I notice

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.009 
high so I couldn't use that but I notice
it<00:02:50.190> didn't<00:02:50.459> go<00:02:50.519> out<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.319> finally<00:02:52.319> um<00:02:52.790> got<00:02:53.790> a

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
it didn't go out so I finally um got a

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:03.470 
it didn't go out so I finally um got a
one<00:02:55.019> off<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.349> a<00:02:56.780> GSXR<00:02:57.950> mm<00:03:00.109> and<00:03:01.909> this<00:03:02.909> one<00:03:03.239> has

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
one off of a GSXR mm and this one has

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.330 
one off of a GSXR mm and this one has
the<00:03:03.599> same<00:03:03.629> amount<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.200> wire<00:03:04.560> ease<00:03:04.829> as<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.489> um

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
the same amount of wire ease as a um

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.559 
the same amount of wire ease as a um
this<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> way<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.940> looks<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.420> lot

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
this is the way it looks it's a lot

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.849 
this is the way it looks it's a lot
bigger<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.879> this<00:03:11.879> actually<00:03:12.480> has<00:03:13.290> not<00:03:13.530> caused

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
bigger but this actually has not caused

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.979 
bigger but this actually has not caused
me<00:03:14.010> any<00:03:14.040> probably<00:03:14.640> charges<00:03:15.120> perfectly<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.900> it

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
me any probably charges perfectly and it

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.530 
me any probably charges perfectly and it
gives<00:03:16.169> you<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.470> much<00:03:16.620> voltage<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.239> doesn't

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
gives you so much voltage but it doesn't

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.270 
gives you so much voltage but it doesn't
charge<00:03:18.750> too<00:03:19.049> much<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.500> notice<00:03:19.769> has<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.069> same

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
charge too much you notice has the same

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.330 
charge too much you notice has the same
amount<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.579> wires<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.120> has<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:22.099> three<00:03:23.099> black

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
amount of wires it has a three black

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.909 
amount of wires it has a three black
wires<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:23.940> then<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.180> has<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.690> red<00:03:25.349> which<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.829> the

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
wires and then it has a red which is the

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.789 
wires and then it has a red which is the
positive<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.700> black<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.450> white<00:03:27.680> which<00:03:28.680> is

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
positive and a black and white which is

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.599 
positive and a black and white which is
the<00:03:28.829> negative<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.650> one<00:03:31.889> that

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
the negative and this is the one that

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.800 
the negative and this is the one that
has<00:03:33.120> really<00:03:34.370> um<00:03:35.959> fixed<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.620> problem<00:03:38.040> without

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
has really um fixed the problem without

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.909 
has really um fixed the problem without
having<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.930> ever<00:03:40.049> deal<00:03:40.319> with<00:03:40.349> it<00:03:40.590> again<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:42.090> far

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
having to ever deal with it again so far

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.830 
having to ever deal with it again so far
this<00:03:43.919> is<00:03:43.980> off<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.459> 2002<00:03:45.329> they<00:03:45.449> tell<00:03:45.660> you're

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
not supposed to use a different

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.470 
not supposed to use a different
regulator<00:03:47.879> because<00:03:48.090> they<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.299> different

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
regulator because they have different

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.319 
regulator because they have different
specs<00:03:48.870> but<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.489> got<00:03:50.489> tired<00:03:50.699> of<00:03:50.879> wasting<00:03:51.060> money

on the on the same heart and it kept

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.539 
on the on the same heart and it kept
going<00:03:55.139> out<00:03:56.150> over<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.299> over<00:03:57.510> again<00:03:58.519> let<00:03:59.519> me

and I think I only paid about 25 I got
my<00:04:38.830> used<00:04:39.220> maybe<00:04:39.670> 30<00:04:39.940> 30<00:04:40.210> bucks<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:41.680> all<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.400> its

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
my used maybe 30 30 bucks and all of its

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.710 
my used maybe 30 30 bucks and all of its
worth<00:04:42.700> grading<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.770> that's<00:04:45.150> how<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.180> fixed<00:04:46.630> it

worth grading so that's how I fixed it

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.340 
worth grading so that's how I fixed it
and<00:04:47.310> hopefully<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.730> know<00:04:49.330> you'll<00:04:50.110> have<00:04:50.200> the
