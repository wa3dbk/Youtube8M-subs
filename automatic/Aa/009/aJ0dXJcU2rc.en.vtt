00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 the plan 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:11.280
 nothing when there were indeed 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.719
 however it crushed here but here it is necessary 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.210
 give light strokes light touches 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.509
 so see 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.109

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:28.669
 was enough for today go is heard seen 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:37.579
 which is no longer the beautiful one has me 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:39.320
 left him thanks no is that in my opinion 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.329
 they weren't not the right man for you 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.260
 just a person interesting thing 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.839
 you need someone more 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.420
 sensitive remember that was out a 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.750
 brown mom but who do you know you have 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.370
 saw a picture still true sitting 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.059
 Brown 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.850
 maybe next time you think about it first 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.160
 because you, like fools, men indeed 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.950
 how can you not choose aspects that fall to you 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.740
 wearing it like rotten fruit and boccaccio 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.909
 that you heard my age oria 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.490
 tranquility and are happy you feel must 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.800
 ask for something that I know a mother 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.950
 he shouldn't ask his daughter though 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.110
 I lend myself the house for a dinner 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.909
 then you know my grandmother is at home 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.649
 I would like to invite him to dinner but I would like to 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.750
 I know you like cooking so much 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.090
 I can't invite him to dinner with his grandmother 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.829
 no, in short, but don't worry about me 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.719
 I leave for three days with a friend there 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.000
 home is all yours 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:44.810
 but I don't want to know anything yet 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.060
 enough but you're a woman you're not 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.969
 no longer a child I 'm a child myself 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.670
 I'm a little girl and a little girl who goes 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.680
 rather fast with the boys and if 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.270
 it is already tried to 1 with which to go away 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.619
 let's say a certain advantage 40 a 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:09.369
 found an appointment no 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:11.870
 an app you see the bienne be booked from 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.330
 control my movements immediately 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.400
 account already that there are 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:26.860
 reloading your cell phone is because you don't know 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.860
 never on vacation and eyes 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.290
 what is a buy
