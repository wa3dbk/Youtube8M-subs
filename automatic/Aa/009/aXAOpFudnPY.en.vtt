00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
go down to permissions here we are now a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
go down to permissions here we are now a
lot<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> people<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> problem<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
lot of people have a problem because you

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
lot of people have a problem because you
can't<00:00:53.460> access<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> permissions<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.110> you're

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
can't access the permissions if you're

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.670 
can't access the permissions if you're
looking<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:56.300> an<00:00:57.300> Apple<00:00:57.690> device<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.260> iPhone

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
looking on an Apple device on an iPhone

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.430 
looking on an Apple device on an iPhone
and<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.629> why<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> lot<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.050> people<00:01:01.320> don't

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and so this is why a lot of people don't

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.020 
and so this is why a lot of people don't
even<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.800> about<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.760> can't

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
even know about it because they can't

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
even know about it because they can't
see<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> permissions<00:01:03.960> even<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.500> choose

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
see the permissions even if they choose

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.170 
see the permissions even if they choose
to

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
to

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.080 
to
but<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> permissions<00:01:06.689> are<00:01:07.430> this<00:01:08.430> application

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
