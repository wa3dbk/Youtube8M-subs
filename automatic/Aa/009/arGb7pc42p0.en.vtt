so this is what I've been working on
here<00:00:08.139> as<00:00:08.260> the<00:00:08.410> beef<00:00:08.650> space<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:10.240> I<00:00:10.269> found<00:00:10.629> is

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839 
here as the beef space that I found is

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.940 
here as the beef space that I found is
that<00:00:10.870> it's<00:00:11.530> one<00:00:11.769> in<00:00:11.799> three<00:00:11.950> eighths<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:13.950> what

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
that it's one in three eighths was what

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.520 
that it's one in three eighths was what
they<00:00:15.070> tended<00:00:15.759> to<00:00:15.879> keep<00:00:16.200> for<00:00:17.200> their<00:00:17.320> breed

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.050 
they tended to keep for their breed
mashed<00:00:17.830> and<00:00:18.250> then<00:00:18.400> they<00:00:18.519> started<00:00:18.760> going<00:00:18.849> to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
mashed and then they started going to

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.929 
mashed and then they started going to
one<00:00:19.240> two<00:00:19.359> five<00:00:19.630> eight<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.260> for<00:00:20.859> their<00:00:21.070> honey<00:00:21.580> I

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
one two five eight and for their honey I

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.429 
one two five eight and for their honey I
thought<00:00:22.449> well<00:00:22.599> that's<00:00:22.689> interesting<00:00:22.960> and

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
thought well that's interesting and

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.870 
thought well that's interesting and
that's<00:00:23.679> how<00:00:23.920> that<00:00:23.980> where<00:00:24.250> they<00:00:24.310> start<00:00:24.609> to<00:00:24.670> get

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
that's how that where they start to get

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.929 
that's how that where they start to get
off<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.810> top<00:00:26.019> part<00:00:26.199> so<00:00:27.009> what<00:00:27.490> I'm<00:00:27.580> doing<00:00:27.609> on

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
off the top part so what I'm doing on

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.359 
off the top part so what I'm doing on
this<00:00:28.029> was<00:00:28.240> I<00:00:28.419> put<00:00:28.720> in<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:28.900> little<00:00:29.080> spacer<00:00:29.679> again

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
this was I put in a little spacer again

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.960 
this was I put in a little spacer again
where<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.330> hunting<00:00:31.599> at<00:00:31.749> what<00:00:31.960> is<00:00:32.850> because<00:00:33.850> the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
where the hunting at what is because the

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.150 
where the hunting at what is because the
honey<00:00:34.180> but<00:00:34.390> it<00:00:34.539> made<00:00:34.719> the<00:00:34.750> honey<00:00:35.140> comb<00:00:35.950> to<00:00:36.129> make

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
honey but it made the honey comb to make

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.340 
honey but it made the honey comb to make
drama<00:00:36.460> out<00:00:36.610> there<00:00:36.760> fatter<00:00:37.059> and<00:00:37.780> then<00:00:38.230> what

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
drama out there fatter and then what

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.900 
drama out there fatter and then what
happens<00:00:38.680> is<00:00:38.829> if<00:00:38.920> it's<00:00:39.100> all<00:00:39.190> equal<00:00:39.579> they<00:00:39.700> start

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
happens is if it's all equal they start

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.060 
happens is if it's all equal they start
to<00:00:39.969> get<00:00:40.090> off<00:00:40.329> on<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.140> top<00:00:41.590> much

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
to get off on the top much

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.229 
to get off on the top much
so<00:00:42.309> this<00:00:42.399> is<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.579> experiment<00:00:43.059> that's<00:00:43.180> been

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
so this is the experiment that's been

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.600 
so this is the experiment that's been
working<00:00:43.629> out<00:00:43.750> fairly<00:00:43.989> well<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.309> again<00:00:45.489> I'm

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
working out fairly well so again I'm

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.069 
working out fairly well so again I'm
gonna<00:00:45.730> look<00:00:45.910> in<00:00:46.120> here<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.510> just<00:00:46.780> see<00:00:46.930> what<00:00:47.050> I

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.550 

I<00:00:56.170> see<00:00:56.770> everything<00:00:56.980> is<00:00:57.160> on<00:00:57.250> purpose<00:00:57.760> together

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
I see everything is on purpose together

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.350 
I see everything is on purpose together
rather<00:00:59.560> alright<00:01:00.070> in<00:01:00.190> there<00:01:00.340> now<00:01:00.850> together

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
rather alright in there now together

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
and so you don't breathe on them because

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.060 
and so you don't breathe on them because
of<00:01:11.940> carbon<00:01:12.940> dioxide<00:01:14.070> stimulate<00:01:15.070> something

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
of carbon dioxide stimulate something

what<00:03:26.409> I'm<00:03:26.469> gonna<00:03:26.590> do<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:26.920> I'm<00:03:27.069> kind<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.790> pull<00:03:28.000> it

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
what I'm gonna do is I'm kind of pull it

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.270 
what I'm gonna do is I'm kind of pull it
towards<00:03:28.480> me<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.959> look<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.709> see<00:03:29.889> whether<00:03:30.040> the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
towards me I look to see whether the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.300 
towards me I look to see whether the
comb<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.760> doing<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.620> okay<00:03:32.620> because<00:03:32.709> if<00:03:33.129> it's

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
comb is doing that okay because if it's

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.009 
comb is doing that okay because if it's
a<00:03:33.430> task<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:34.299> could<00:03:34.450> be<00:03:34.540> attached<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.900> the
