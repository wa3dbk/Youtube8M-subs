that's<00:01:39.990> good<00:01:40.259> info<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:41.700> general<00:01:42.060> opinion

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that's good info but my general opinion

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.780 
that's good info but my general opinion
about<00:01:42.750> lipos<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.130> difficult<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
about lipos is that it's so difficult to

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.240 
about lipos is that it's so difficult to
look<00:01:47.790> at<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> single<00:01:48.420> lipo<00:01:48.810> okay<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.770> put

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
look at a single lipo okay and and put

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.969 
look at a single lipo okay and and put
it<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.430> against<00:01:50.729> another<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.439> when<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.829> could

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it up against another one when you could

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
it up against another one when you could
order<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.430> exactly<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> same<00:01:54.240> I've<00:01:54.420> ordered

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
which I think we're like a hundred see I

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.309 
which I think we're like a hundred see I
want<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.670> say<00:02:29.849> hundreds<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:30.269> maybe<00:02:30.599> 90<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.110> I

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
want to say hundreds here maybe 90 see I

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.170 
want to say hundreds here maybe 90 see I
still<00:02:32.220> use<00:02:32.400> them<00:02:32.519> all<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.700> time<00:02:32.819> they're

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
still use them all the time they're

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.350 
still use them all the time they're
great<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.660> also<00:02:34.470> picked<00:02:34.830> up<00:02:35.239> one<00:02:36.239> of<00:02:36.269> these

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
great I also picked up one of these

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.990 
great I also picked up one of these
little<00:02:36.660> package<00:02:37.530> are<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> crawler<00:02:38.160> this

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
little package are like a crawler this

volt comes with the deans connector what

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.430 
volt comes with the deans connector what
I'll<00:02:45.060> do<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.390> I'll<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.660> put<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> link<00:02:46.140> down<00:02:46.260> in

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
I'll do is I'll just put a link down in

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.430 
I'll do is I'll just put a link down in
the<00:02:46.620> description<00:02:46.709> below<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:49.080> guys<00:02:49.230> can

the description below so you guys can

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.860 
the description below so you guys can
figure<00:02:49.620> out<00:02:49.739> like<00:02:49.980> what<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> prices<00:02:50.640> isn't<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
figure out like what the prices isn't of

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.330 
figure out like what the prices isn't of
everything<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.590> point<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:52.950> video<00:02:53.250> is

there<00:03:04.620> for<00:03:04.799> budget<00:03:05.640> lipos<00:03:05.970> from<00:03:06.180> maybe<00:03:06.360> a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
there for budget lipos from maybe a

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.640 
there for budget lipos from maybe a
place<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.900> might<00:03:07.049> be<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> little<00:03:07.319> bit<00:03:07.530> more

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
place that might be a little bit more

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.970 
place that might be a little bit more
reliable<00:03:08.299> stuff<00:03:09.299> stays<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.840> stock<00:03:10.319> at<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.739> main

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.480 
helis you don't have to take a break to
charge<00:04:38.260> because<00:04:38.680> one<00:04:38.860> thing<00:04:39.070> about<00:04:39.280> these<00:04:39.430> is

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
charge because one thing about these is

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.870 
charge because one thing about these is
they<00:04:39.790> take<00:04:40.000> quite<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.300> bit<00:04:40.480> long<00:04:40.750> time<00:04:41.020> charge

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
they take quite a bit long time charge

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.070

Halley's<00:04:47.410> that's<00:04:47.650> two<00:04:47.920> of<00:04:47.950> these<00:04:48.220> in<00:04:48.280> use<00:04:48.610> at

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
Halley's that's two of these in use at

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.330 
Halley's that's two of these in use at
one<00:04:48.970> time<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:50.470> can<00:04:50.680> only<00:04:50.770> really<00:04:51.040> charge

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
one time and you can only really charge

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.310 
one time and you can only really charge
one<00:04:51.670> at<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.910> time<00:04:52.150> on<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.420> docks<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:53.050> they<00:04:53.140> just

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
one at a time on the docks and they just

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.290 
one at a time on the docks and they just
take<00:04:53.500> forever<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.520> it's<00:04:54.550> great<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:55.000> have<00:04:55.120> these

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
take forever so it's great to have these

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.680 
take forever so it's great to have these
around<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.930> they're<00:04:56.080> very<00:04:56.260> very<00:04:56.740> cheap<00:04:57.130> I

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
around and they're very very cheap I

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.060
