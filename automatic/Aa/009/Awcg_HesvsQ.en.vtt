00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
gumbo I use a boat to approach the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
gumbo I use a boat to approach the
target<00:00:43.770> because<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.250> knew<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> gun

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660

there's no guards on the boat so I used

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
there's no guards on the boat so I used
that<00:00:50.340> tactic<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.149> could<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.390> used<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
we're showing today as like big shoulder

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.920 
we're showing today as like big shoulder
pads<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> big<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.460> chest<00:01:38.460> plate<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.270> then

pads and a big like chest plate and then

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
pads and a big like chest plate and then
that<00:01:40.140> changed<00:01:40.500> visual<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:41.280> gives<00:01:41.610> you

more<00:01:41.880> health<00:01:42.119> points<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.040> another

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
more health points and so that's another

more health points and so that's another
example<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> customization<00:01:46.079> factor<00:01:46.530> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
example of the customization factor that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.480 
example of the customization factor that
we<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.850> AC<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.799> AC<00:01:49.799> one<00:01:50.220> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
we have that we have in AC to AC one is

we have that we have in AC to AC one is
a<00:01:50.759> c1<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.540> done<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.229> know<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.250> is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
a c1 it was done you know and it's it is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.340 
a c1 it was done you know and it's it is
what<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.600> sure<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.930> had<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
what it is for sure we had a lot of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
what it is for sure we had a lot of
ideas<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.009> couldn't<00:01:56.310> put<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> first

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
ideas that we couldn't put in the first

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.840 
ideas that we couldn't put in the first
game<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.540> c2<00:01:58.020> is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
game a c2 is

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
click close to what we wanted to do it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.100 
click close to what we wanted to do it
at<00:02:00.950> first<00:02:01.220> we<00:02:01.880> took<00:02:02.119> some<00:02:02.299> ideas<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.869> first

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
at first we took some ideas of the first

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.990 
at first we took some ideas of the first
game<00:02:03.290> integrated<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.100> second<00:02:04.430> one<00:02:04.520> but

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
game integrated in the second one but

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.630 
game integrated in the second one but
ideas<00:02:05.450> also<00:02:05.630> came<00:02:05.990> from<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:07.130> settings<00:02:07.549> for

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
ideas also came from the settings for

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.850 
ideas also came from the settings for
example<00:02:08.270> from<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.509> characters<00:02:09.080> from<00:02:09.619> what

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
example from the characters from what

example from the characters from what
assassin's<00:02:10.310> creed<00:02:10.520> two<00:02:10.700> became<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.360> know<00:02:11.390> so

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
assassin's creed two became you know so

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.809 
assassin's creed two became you know so
while<00:02:12.080> we're<00:02:12.260> doing<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:12.890> come<00:02:13.100> with<00:02:13.250> ideas

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
while we're doing it we come with ideas

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.229 
while we're doing it we come with ideas
we<00:02:14.270> integrated<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.410> economic<00:02:16.310> system<00:02:16.700> we

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
we integrated a economic system we

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.000 
we integrated a economic system we
wanted<00:02:17.630> we<00:02:17.900> needed<00:02:18.290> something<00:02:18.590> like

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
wanted we needed something like

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.420 
wanted we needed something like
consumable<00:02:19.940> say<00:02:20.780> oh<00:02:20.810> those<00:02:21.260> Alpers<00:02:21.860> could<00:02:22.250> be

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
consumable say oh those Alpers could be

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.309 
consumable say oh those Alpers could be
the<00:02:22.580> one<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.060> could<00:02:23.209> hire<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.810> use<00:02:24.140> the

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
the one that you could hire and use the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.850 
the one that you could hire and use the
money<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.709> easy<00:02:27.709> to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
money that you that you have and easy to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.110 
money that you that you have and easy to
is<00:02:28.010> pretty<00:02:28.459> close<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.180> first<00:02:29.390> vision<00:02:30.350> of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
is pretty close to the first vision of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.470 
is pretty close to the first vision of
what<00:02:32.120> an<00:02:32.239> assassin's<00:02:32.720> creed<00:02:32.959> game<00:02:34.030> has<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.330> be

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
what an assassin's creed game has to be

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.440 
what an assassin's creed game has to be
so<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.590> idea<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.040> like<00:02:37.220> being<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.910> CEO<00:02:38.180> being

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
so this idea of like being a CEO being

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
so this idea of like being a CEO being
assassin<00:02:38.989> it's<00:02:39.110> much<00:02:39.319> more<00:02:39.530> well<00:02:39.739> integrated

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
assassin it's much more well integrated

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.400 
assassin it's much more well integrated
than<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.120> wasn't<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.510> first<00:02:41.750> game<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.019> for<00:02:42.230> me

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
than it wasn't the first game so for me

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.740 
than it wasn't the first game so for me
it's<00:02:42.709> really<00:02:43.190> narrative<00:02:43.970> it's<00:02:44.180> two<00:02:44.390> point<00:02:44.660> oh

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's really narrative it's two point oh

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.020 
it's really narrative it's two point oh
then<00:02:45.290> it's<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.620> many<00:02:45.800> yes<00:02:46.069> it's<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.610> lot<00:02:47.000> more

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
then it's so many yes it's a lot more

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.170 
then it's so many yes it's a lot more
diversity<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:48.080> lot<00:02:48.470> more<00:02:48.739> you<00:02:49.430> know<00:02:49.459> day<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
diversity a lot more you know day and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.870 
diversity a lot more you know day and
night<00:02:50.209> cycle<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:51.080> example<00:02:51.500> italy<00:02:52.220> italy<00:02:52.580> is

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
night cycle for example italy italy is

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.530 
night cycle for example italy italy is
like<00:02:53.360> it's<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.470> beautiful<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.150> design

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
like it's so beautiful it's a the design

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.009 
like it's so beautiful it's a the design
of<00:02:57.190> having<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.700> recognize<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.450> landmarks

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
of having to recognize the landmarks

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.640 
of having to recognize the landmarks
much<00:03:00.290> more<00:03:00.739> than<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.190> first<00:03:01.459> game<00:03:02.650> sasson

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
much more than the first game sasson
