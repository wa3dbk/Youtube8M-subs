00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.510
 the small varese against fly for 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.869
 example or madrid 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.340
 tel aviv which are great metropolises and 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.460
 I think the people of varese remember 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.610
 these these games also because of 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.970
 fact that we won against big 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.970
 city 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.730
 in those seventies we won 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.250
 luckily the Italian championship 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.030
 or the champion cup if not 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.360
 both 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.850
 and so this has always allowed us to 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.590
 continue to make the cup of champions 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.590
 and to make those 10 efficiency endings 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.550
 I had the chance to play in 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.850
 America 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:31.520
 the buffalo cruises of nba 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:34.400
 I was a third choice, however, the offer 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 doner so good and then the idea of ​​coming 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.580
 in Europe 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.530
 and then to play for the champion team 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.040
 d europe that had won the cup of 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.130
 champions and turn Italy and stuff 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.240
 learn a new language and it was 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.020
 tempting 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.640
 so it wasn't a big decision 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.130
 hard 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.010
 ines offered me a good contract e 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.010
 so the rest is history 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.590
 they made me an offer that was 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.340
 difficult not to accept 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.860
 so at that moment we can say that I have 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.880
 decided to be a professional of 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.970
 low before was more we say an activity 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.790
 that he earned money but for 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.900
 set them apart because continue 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.850
 do you study 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.450
 so that was perhaps the time 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.170
 I decided more my life than I did 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.310
 decision to arrive in Italy in 72 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.310
 first time 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.360
 car ossola was able to read well 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.769
 the games 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.120
 so then he personally did me 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.299
 get the ball at the right time 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.390
 right in the right position that me 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.030
 could easily mark clearly 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.930
 I had to get rid of the blocks of mine 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.209
 companions of ivan di intino blocks 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.569
 shorts gone etc. 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.120
 and then, if necessary, for example 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:28.430
 against haas in order I believe perhaps the year 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.430
 after 78 they believed that he didn't 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.790
 he scored from outside and instead he did 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.739
 a 5 out of 5 at the beginning of the game and then 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.739
 he had a ritual of 30 or so 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.670
 for me it was the one great thing I could do 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:56.080
 play with a player like that 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.080
 so much talent, determination and desire to win 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.780
 I remember she became marine 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:12.299
 mania to tear the shirts into 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.909
 training and so did everyone at 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.489
 times workouts especially cones 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.560
 as there were quite heavy from a 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.630
 physical point of view 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:28.949
 and so to these jokes year brings some 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.250
 of tension and tried to relax 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:35.060
 a bit the team is in a way however of 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.380
 always work well I decided to 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.100
 spend the best years of mine 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:45.600
 career 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:48.919
 in varese and in doing so we say 21 to 30 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.479
 This year and every year with 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.720
 more or less the same group of players 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.720
 we have achieved strong results 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.840
 I have marked motion and maybe this 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.699
 point of view as impact on basketball 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.400
 Italian 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:09.889
 I'm definitely one of the players who 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.889
 has left the biggest mark 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:27.569
 Giovanni Polli was the owner of 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:33.470
 this initiative the lines of sport 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:36.780
 and this must be recognized 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:41.960
 this his intervention in favor of 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.960
 sport in favor of country speed
