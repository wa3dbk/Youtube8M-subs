tutorial for you I'm wearing going to go
through<00:00:12.630> creating<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.440> UI<00:00:13.679> dialog<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.969> was<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
through creating a UI dialog it was a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.050 
through creating a UI dialog it was a
request<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.900> threshold<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.560> my<00:00:16.800> map<00:00:17.070> which<00:00:17.940> i

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
request a threshold of my map which i

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.670 
request a threshold of my map which i
have<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.570> i'm<00:00:18.750> too<00:00:19.109> lazy<00:00:19.260> today<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:21.680> actually

have here i'm too lazy today to actually
practice<00:00:23.430> everything<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
practice everything so I'm just going to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240 
practice everything so I'm just going to
run<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.710> window<00:00:26.070> will<00:00:26.220> appear

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
run it like this the window will appear

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.150 
run it like this the window will appear
a<00:00:26.580> bit<00:00:26.640> laggy<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.260> threat<00:00:28.470> this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
a bit laggy for you but the threat this

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.730 
a bit laggy for you but the threat this
list<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> left<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.470> I'm<00:00:31.590> going

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
list here on the left is what I'm going

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.020 
list here on the left is what I'm going
to<00:00:31.800> create<00:00:33.440> something<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.340> scrolling

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to create something like this scrolling

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
to create something like this scrolling
list<00:00:36.149> I'm<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.350> part

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
list I'm not going to do this part

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260 
list I'm not going to do this part
because<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.160> exactly<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> same

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
because it's exactly the same

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.080 
because it's exactly the same
essentially<00:00:40.280> it's<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> part<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.760> lists<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
essentially it's all a part of lists and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.729 
essentially it's all a part of lists and
in<00:00:45.090> addition<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.559> go

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
in addition to that we're going to go

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
in addition to that we're going to go
through<00:00:46.770> priest<00:00:47.579> written<00:00:47.850> records<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
through priest written records because I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.779 
through priest written records because I
also<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> request<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:50.870> about<00:00:51.870> how<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> can

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
also got a request on about how you can

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.360 
also got a request on about how you can
use<00:00:53.789> those<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.020> real<00:00:55.469> example<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.129> using

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
use those or a real example and using

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.340 
use those or a real example and using
those<00:00:56.520> we're<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.719> through<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> bit<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
those we're going to go through a bit of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.160 
those we're going to go through a bit of
code<00:00:58.680> planning<00:00:59.660> because<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.020> could

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
code planning because I think that could

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.779 
code planning because I think that could
be<00:01:01.230> important<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:01.859> people<00:01:02.219> who<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.640> have

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
be important for people who don't have

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.530 
be important for people who don't have
programming<00:01:03.449> experience<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:05.360> then<00:01:06.360> I'm

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
programming experience and then I'm

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.640 
programming experience and then I'm
going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.900> through<00:01:07.110> some<00:01:07.290> other

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
going to go through some other

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.460 
going to go through some other
variations<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.760> show<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.240> how<00:01:09.390> easy<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.350> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
variations and show you how easy it is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.399 
variations and show you how easy it is
to<00:01:10.530> extend<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> list<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.820> create<00:01:12.119> other<00:01:12.840> kinds

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
to extend the list to create other kinds

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
to extend the list to create other kinds
of<00:01:13.470> lists<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.979> least<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.850> very

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
of lists at least this is very very

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
of lists at least this is very very
basic<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> create<00:01:16.880> but<00:01:17.880> before<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.330> start<00:01:18.390> I'm

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
basic to create but before we start I'm

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
basic to create but before we start I'm
going<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.320> rant<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.680> something<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.369> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
going to rant about something that I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
going to rant about something that I
found<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.790> today<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:21.810> today<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.080> created<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
found out today right today I created a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
found out today right today I created a
list<00:01:22.799> box<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.340> map<00:01:24.320> here<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:27.330> box<00:01:27.630> are

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
list box in my map here and this box are

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.859 
list box in my map here and this box are
 annoying<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.880> first<00:01:30.150> item<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.720> add

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
 annoying the first item you add

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.410 
 annoying the first item you add
to<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> list<00:01:31.320> box<00:01:31.909> appears<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> first

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to a list box appears in the first

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
to a list box appears in the first
position<00:01:34.189> but<00:01:35.189> after<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:36.409> pull<00:01:37.409> down<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
position but after that or pull down is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
position but after that or pull down is
what<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.340> called<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> list<00:01:38.939> boxes

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
what this is called the list boxes

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.929 
what this is called the list boxes
unless<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> fool<00:01:40.920> down<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> st

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
unless this is the fool down in the st

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
unless this is the fool down in the st
to<00:01:42.060> adore<00:01:42.360> anyway<00:01:42.689> first<00:01:43.380> item<00:01:43.560> appears<00:01:44.100> in

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to adore anyway first item appears in

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.719 
to adore anyway first item appears in
the<00:01:44.340> first<00:01:44.549> position<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.720> remaining<00:01:46.049> items

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
the first position the remaining items

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.950 
the first position the remaining items
will<00:01:47.729> appear<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.240> reverse<00:01:48.810> order<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.040> list

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
will appear in reverse order in the list

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.359 
will appear in reverse order in the list
so<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:51.990> means<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.439> we've<00:01:52.829> got<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.130> first

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
so that means that we've got the first

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.740 
so that means that we've got the first
item<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> new<00:01:54.030> need<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> add<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.540> other

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
item in the new need to add all other

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
item in the new need to add all other
items<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.350> want<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:55.979> list<00:01:56.430> in

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
items that you want in your list in

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.090 
items that you want in your list in
reverse<00:01:56.939> order<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.530> simply<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
reverse order so if you simply want to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.850 
reverse order so if you simply want to
put<00:01:59.310> an<00:01:59.460> array<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.969> here<00:02:00.409> at<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.619> first

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
put an array in here at the first

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.709 
put an array in here at the first
element<00:02:02.070> them<00:02:02.579> through<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> rest<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
element them through the rest of the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.210 
element them through the rest of the
array<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.110> yeah<00:02:04.829> as<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.219> said<00:02:05.490> reverse<00:02:06.240> order

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
array in yeah as I said reverse order

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.140 
array in yeah as I said reverse order
anyway<00:02:09.020> enough<00:02:10.020> about<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.649> map<00:02:10.890> let<00:02:11.670> me<00:02:11.910> just

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
anyway enough about this map let me just

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.950 
anyway enough about this map let me just
pause<00:02:12.569> this

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
pause this

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.480 
pause this
there<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.340> we'll<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.490> up<00:02:14.610> there<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:17.190> let's

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
there and we'll go up there so let's

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.360 
there and we'll go up there so let's
start<00:02:17.760> planning<00:02:18.030> your<00:02:18.300> code<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:20.100> my

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
start planning your code I have my

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.080 
start planning your code I have my
folder<00:02:21.120> for<00:02:21.330> my<00:02:21.450> map<00:02:21.630> here<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:23.520> obviously

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
folder for my map here you obviously

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.650 
folder for my map here you obviously
don't<00:02:24.270> need<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.510> make<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> folder<00:02:25.290> for<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:25.500> map

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
don't need to make a folder for your map

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.720 
don't need to make a folder for your map
but<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.840> found<00:02:28.140> useful<00:02:28.410> when<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.950> wanted<00:02:29.640> to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
but I found useful when I wanted to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.610 
but I found useful when I wanted to
create<00:02:29.880> my<00:02:30.090> map<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.600> first<00:02:30.900> thing<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.230> did<00:02:31.440> when

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
create my map the first thing I did when

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.710 
create my map the first thing I did when
I<00:02:31.680> started<00:02:31.980> thinking<00:02:32.460> about<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:34.550> sign<00:02:35.720> was

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
I started thinking about the sign was

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.870 
I started thinking about the sign was
that<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.050> made<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> sketch<00:02:37.770> about<00:02:38.040> how<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.400> want<00:02:38.640> my

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
that I made a sketch about how I want my

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.340 
that I made a sketch about how I want my
menu<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.300> appear<00:02:39.710> it's<00:02:40.710> not<00:02:40.890> pretty<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.870> not

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
menu to appear it's not pretty it's not

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.540 
menu to appear it's not pretty it's not
very<00:02:45.170> high-tech<00:02:46.170> sketched<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:46.740> anything<00:02:47.100> but

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
very high-tech sketched or anything but

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.710 
very high-tech sketched or anything but
it's<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.630> basics<00:02:49.110> are<00:02:49.320> there<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.540> i<00:02:51.540> will

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
it's the basics are there and i will

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.390 
it's the basics are there and i will
recommend<00:02:51.870> anyone<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.710> planning<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.070> defining

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
recommend anyone is planning on defining

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.150 
recommend anyone is planning on defining
a<00:02:53.580> UI<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.990> do<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> same<00:02:55.440> thing<00:02:55.680> i<00:02:55.800> also<00:02:55.950> have

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
a UI to do the same thing i also have

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.360 
a UI to do the same thing i also have
sketched<00:02:56.520> above<00:02:56.910> other<00:02:57.480> things<00:02:57.870> for<00:02:58.800> my<00:02:59.070> UI

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
sketched above other things for my UI

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.600 
sketched above other things for my UI
and<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:01.500> sketch<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.920> up<00:03:02.070> because<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.460> gives

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
and just sketch it up because it gives

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.860 
and just sketch it up because it gives
you<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.820> nice<00:03:02.910> day<00:03:03.150> about<00:03:03.480> what<00:03:03.720> you're

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
you a nice day about what you're

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.950 
you a nice day about what you're
supposed<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:06.860> I'll<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.070> sketch<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.490> up

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
supposed to do I'll do you sketch it up

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.650 
supposed to do I'll do you sketch it up
it<00:03:09.960> could<00:03:10.440> be<00:03:10.680> good<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:11.880> what<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> did<00:03:12.420> here

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
it could be good to do what I did here

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.500 
it could be good to do what I did here
when<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.870> create<00:03:13.140> my<00:03:13.170> initial<00:03:13.620> shock<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.950> find<00:03:14.100> I

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
when I create my initial shock to find I

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.210 
when I create my initial shock to find I
sat<00:03:15.510> down<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:16.050> thought<00:03:16.290> about<00:03:16.560> okay<00:03:17.040> how<00:03:17.190> am

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
sat down and I thought about okay how am

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.210 
sat down and I thought about okay how am
I<00:03:17.430> going<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.700> store<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.210> memory<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:20.130> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
I going to store this memory and I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.890 
I going to store this memory and I
started<00:03:20.520> planning<00:03:20.670> out<00:03:20.940> how<00:03:21.210> to<00:03:21.270> store<00:03:21.810> it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
started planning out how to store it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.710 
started planning out how to store it
what<00:03:22.380> variable<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.950> create<00:03:23.270> let<00:03:24.270> us<00:03:24.390> out<00:03:24.540> okay

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
what variable to create let us out okay

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.810 
what variable to create let us out okay
then<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.260> need<00:03:25.290> get<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.070> set<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.520> every

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
then I need get and set for every

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.310 
then I need get and set for every
variable<00:03:27.210> so<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.570> created<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:30.000> little<00:03:30.450> list

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
variable so I created this little list

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.600 
variable so I created this little list
for<00:03:31.560> myself<00:03:32.450> with<00:03:33.450> what<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.660> needed<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.610> stuff

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
for myself with what I needed and stuff

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.190 
for myself with what I needed and stuff
like<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.420> planned<00:03:36.720> out<00:03:36.870> how<00:03:37.020> it's

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
like that and I planned out how it's

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.870 
like that and I planned out how it's
gonna<00:03:37.320> hook<00:03:37.530> together<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:38.070> other<00:03:38.190> windows<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
gonna hook together to other windows and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.410 
gonna hook together to other windows and
so<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:41.390> yeah<00:03:42.390> try<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.460> if<00:03:44.460> you<00:03:44.520> don't<00:03:45.240> learn

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
so on yeah try it if you don't learn

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.120 
so on yeah try it if you don't learn
programming<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:46.440> well<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.860> can<00:03:47.040> be

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
programming so well this can be

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.500 
programming so well this can be
difficult<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.940> course<00:03:48.980> but<00:03:49.980> usually<00:03:50.700> if<00:03:51.120> we

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
difficult of course but usually if we

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.120 
difficult of course but usually if we
put<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> little<00:03:52.020> bit<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.290> planning<00:03:52.650> into<00:03:52.860> your

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
put a little bit of planning into your

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.370 
put a little bit of planning into your
code<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.550> becomes<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.420> lot<00:03:54.540> easier<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.260> actually

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
code it becomes a lot easier to actually

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.070 
code it becomes a lot easier to actually
make<00:03:55.710> your<00:03:55.920> code<00:03:56.300> other<00:03:57.300> things<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.900> should

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
make your code other things you should

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.270 
make your code other things you should
think<00:03:58.200> about<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.590> your<00:03:58.650> planning<00:03:58.890> stage<00:03:59.250> is

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
think about in your planning stage is

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.280 
think about in your planning stage is
what<00:04:02.280> systems<00:04:03.210> can<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.450> separate<00:04:03.960> for

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
what systems can I separate for

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.790 
what systems can I separate for
insignificant<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:05.100> my<00:04:05.250> part<00:04:05.940> trader<00:04:06.240> here

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
insignificant to my part trader here

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.230 
insignificant to my part trader here
some<00:04:07.800> people<00:04:08.160> might<00:04:08.280> end<00:04:08.520> up<00:04:08.580> holding<00:04:08.850> this

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
some people might end up holding this

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.340 
some people might end up holding this
whole<00:04:09.600> screen<00:04:10.530> as<00:04:10.830> one<00:04:11.190> big<00:04:11.960> gigantic<00:04:12.960> piece

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
whole screen as one big gigantic piece

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.030 
whole screen as one big gigantic piece
of<00:04:13.380> code<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:15.290> basically<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:16.560> one's<00:04:16.770> become

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
of code and basically that one's become

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.090 
of code and basically that one's become
unmanageable<00:04:18.200> because<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.320> becomes<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:19.710> huge

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
unmanageable because it becomes so huge

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.590 
unmanageable because it becomes so huge
and<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.460> becomes<00:04:20.700> hard<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.030> change<00:04:21.390> the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
and it becomes hard to change the

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.590 
and it becomes hard to change the
hardware<00:04:21.750> update<00:04:22.820> what<00:04:23.820> I've<00:04:23.970> done<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.240> time

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
hardware update what I've done this time

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.290 
hardware update what I've done this time
coded<00:04:25.380> this

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
coded this

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.909 
coded this
dialogue<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.199> see<00:04:27.379> on<00:04:27.470> screen<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.889> a

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
dialogue that you see on screen is a

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.969 
dialogue that you see on screen is a
separate<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:29.169> treat<00:04:30.169> that<00:04:30.199> is<00:04:30.530> a<00:04:30.560> separate

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
separate a treat that is a separate

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.040 
separate a treat that is a separate
piece<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.669> I<00:04:31.729> just<00:04:31.909> past<00:04:32.240> messages<00:04:32.509> between

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
piece and I just past messages between

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.540 
piece and I just past messages between
them<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:35.360> way<00:04:35.599> I<00:04:35.840> can<00:04:36.110> reuse<00:04:36.590> just<00:04:37.340> with

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
them that way I can reuse just with

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.550 
them that way I can reuse just with
altering<00:04:37.940> a<00:04:38.000> little<00:04:38.270> bit<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.509> code<00:04:38.720> I<00:04:38.990> can

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
altering a little bit of code I can

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.469 
altering a little bit of code I can
reuse<00:04:39.949> the<00:04:40.099> same<00:04:40.129> dialogues<00:04:40.789> over<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.389> over

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
reuse the same dialogues over and over

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:42.999 
reuse the same dialogues over and over
you'll<00:04:41.810> see<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.020> have<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.319> same<00:04:42.530> dialogues

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
you'll see I have the same dialogues

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.820 
you'll see I have the same dialogues
these<00:04:44.000> three<00:04:44.360> dialogues<00:04:44.780> in<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.229> bottom<00:04:45.620> left

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
these three dialogues in the bottom left

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.020 
these three dialogues in the bottom left
are<00:04:46.009> the<00:04:46.069> same<00:04:46.310> there's<00:04:46.669> a<00:04:46.729> different

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
are the same there's a different

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.270 
are the same there's a different
dialogue<00:04:47.330> here<00:04:47.569> on<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.780> right<00:04:47.930> side<00:04:48.259> but<00:04:49.190> the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
dialogue here on the right side but the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.909 
dialogue here on the right side but the
dialogues<00:04:49.639> on<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:49.819> top<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.449> also<00:04:51.169> exactly<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
dialogues on the top is also exactly the

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.140 
dialogues on the top is also exactly the
same<00:04:53.830> so<00:04:54.830> just<00:04:55.310> with<00:04:55.400> a<00:04:55.460> little<00:04:55.550> bit<00:04:56.090> of

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
same so just with a little bit of

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.089 
same so just with a little bit of
planning<00:04:56.690> I'm<00:04:57.680> able<00:04:57.889> to<00:04:59.500> save<00:05:00.500> myself<00:05:00.680> a<00:05:00.979> lot

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
planning I'm able to save myself a lot

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.700 
planning I'm able to save myself a lot
of<00:05:01.219> time<00:05:01.460> later<00:05:01.729> on<00:05:02.139> because<00:05:03.139> I<00:05:03.199> know<00:05:03.319> what<00:05:03.620> I'm

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
of time later on because I know what I'm

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.450 
of time later on because I know what I'm
supposed<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.099> do<00:05:05.530> so<00:05:06.530> I<00:05:06.590> think<00:05:06.949> that<00:05:07.159> pretty

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
online about planning code and so on you

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.649 
online about planning code and so on you
don't<00:05:22.190> need<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.460> go<00:05:22.580> in<00:05:22.669> so<00:05:22.849> much<00:05:23.000> detail<00:05:23.240> for

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.149 
don't need to go in so much detail for
maps<00:05:23.870> usually<00:05:24.349> because<00:05:24.560> they're<00:05:24.680> not<00:05:24.800> huge

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
maps usually because they're not huge

maps usually because they're not huge
projects<00:05:26.889> anyway<00:05:27.889> what<00:05:28.370> we're<00:05:28.520> going<00:05:28.639> to

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
projects anyway what we're going to

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.999 
projects anyway what we're going to
create<00:05:28.909> now<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.360> this<00:05:29.930> list<00:05:30.289> here<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:30.919> you

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
create now is this list here that you

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.379 
create now is this list here that you
can<00:05:31.099> see<00:05:31.250> on<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.490> left<00:05:31.699> side<00:05:32.000> we're<00:05:32.210> going<00:05:32.330> to

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
can see on the left side we're going to

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.980 
can see on the left side we're going to
do<00:05:32.509> the<00:05:32.599> left<00:05:32.870> left<00:05:33.560> list<00:05:34.630> just<00:05:35.630> scroll

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
do the left left list just scroll

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.870 
do the left left list just scroll
buttons<00:05:36.380> up<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.740> down<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:36.889> then<00:05:37.190> list<00:05:37.550> items

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
buttons up and down and then list items

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.219 
buttons up and down and then list items
in<00:05:38.000> between<00:05:38.830> I'm<00:05:39.830> also<00:05:40.069> going<00:05:40.279> to<00:05:40.340> create

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
in between I'm also going to create

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.100 
in between I'm also going to create
multiple<00:05:42.229> menus<00:05:43.190> using<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.639> same<00:05:43.849> list<00:05:44.110> so

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
multiple menus using the same list so

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.390 
multiple menus using the same list so
I'm<00:05:45.529> just<00:05:45.889> going<00:05:46.039> to<00:05:46.099> create<00:05:46.370> something

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
I'm just going to create something

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.260 
I'm just going to create something
simple<00:05:47.180> like<00:05:47.210> that<00:05:47.719> you<00:05:47.840> can<00:05:47.990> sell<00:05:48.199> like<00:05:49.270> one

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
simple like that you can sell like one

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.570 
simple like that you can sell like one
unit<00:05:50.750> from<00:05:51.650> one<00:05:51.860> list<00:05:52.099> and<00:05:52.250> then<00:05:52.340> you<00:05:52.430> can

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
unit from one list and then you can

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.309 
unit from one list and then you can
select<00:05:52.699> a<00:05:53.060> few<00:05:53.120> select<00:05:53.630> that<00:05:53.870> you<00:05:54.020> can<00:05:54.169> select

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
select a few select that you can select

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.399 
select a few select that you can select
another<00:05:54.680> unit<00:05:55.129> from<00:05:55.250> another<00:05:55.550> list<00:05:55.849> and<00:05:56.409> we

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
another unit from another list and we

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.769 
another unit from another list and we
will<00:05:57.529> use<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.710> exactly<00:05:58.219> same<00:05:58.580> dialogue<00:05:59.449> for

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779 
will use the exactly same dialogue for

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:06.490 
will use the exactly same dialogue for
both<00:05:59.960> lists<00:06:02.590> so<00:06:04.870> yeah<00:06:05.870> I<00:06:05.900> think<00:06:06.020> I'm<00:06:06.289> going<00:06:06.409> to

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
both lists so yeah I think I'm going to

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.930 
both lists so yeah I think I'm going to
split<00:06:06.740> this<00:06:06.889> tutorial<00:06:07.430> up<00:06:07.550> into<00:06:07.819> multiple

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
split this tutorial up into multiple

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.219 
split this tutorial up into multiple
parts<00:06:08.419> so<00:06:08.659> I'll<00:06:08.930> end<00:06:08.960> part<00:06:09.529> 1<00:06:09.710> here<00:06:09.949> and<00:06:11.229> I'll

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
parts so I'll end part 1 here and I'll

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.219 
parts so I'll end part 1 here and I'll
continue<00:06:12.590> in<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.830> next<00:06:12.860> part
