00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.960 

first<00:00:17.730> game<00:00:18.500> after<00:00:19.500> some<00:00:19.949> training<00:00:20.580> sessions

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
first game after some training sessions

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.750 
first game after some training sessions
so<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.050> most<00:00:22.410> important<00:00:22.830> thing<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.279> we

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
so the most important thing that we we

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.670 
so the most important thing that we we
give<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.150> playing<00:00:24.330> time<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:25.260> most<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
give some playing time to do most of the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.080 
give some playing time to do most of the
players<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.010> equal<00:00:26.460> that's<00:00:26.609> why<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.939> are

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
players and equal that's why we are

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.410 
players and equal that's why we are
asking<00:00:27.210> me<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> play<00:00:28.080> three<00:00:28.470> times<00:00:28.740> 25<00:00:29.580> minutes

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
asking me to play three times 25 minutes

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.280 
asking me to play three times 25 minutes
so<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.800> respect<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.290> good

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
so I think in that respect it was a good

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.220 
so I think in that respect it was a good
thing<00:00:34.790> again<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.540> had<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.899> window<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
thing again like you had this window you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
thing again like you had this window you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
have a lot of young players up with

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.810 
have a lot of young players up with

the<00:00:41.940> game<00:00:42.120> how<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.629> they're

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
