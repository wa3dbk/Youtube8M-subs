let's<00:00:02.379> talk<00:00:02.679> tension<00:00:03.219> for<00:00:03.429> just<00:00:03.610> a<00:00:03.730> second

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.270 
let's talk tension for just a second

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.030 
let's talk tension for just a second
tensions<00:00:04.930> probably<00:00:05.229> the<00:00:05.319> one<00:00:05.500> thing<00:00:05.740> soy

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.040 
tensions probably the one thing soy

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.980 
tensions probably the one thing soy
machines<00:00:06.399> get<00:00:06.609> blamed<00:00:06.940> for<00:00:07.299> the<00:00:07.509> most<00:00:07.750> have

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990 
machines get blamed for the most have

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.660 
machines get blamed for the most have
you<00:00:08.080> ever<00:00:08.200> done<00:00:08.379> it<00:00:08.559> all<00:00:08.770> the<00:00:09.040> tensions<00:00:09.490> off

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
you ever done it all the tensions off

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.339 
you ever done it all the tensions off
when<00:00:09.940> you've<00:00:10.059> been<00:00:10.179> sewing<00:00:10.480> along<00:00:10.599> and<00:00:10.780> you

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349 
when you've been sewing along and you

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.440 
when you've been sewing along and you
probably<00:00:11.559> see<00:00:11.860> something<00:00:12.130> like<00:00:12.460> this<00:00:13.000> isn't

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
probably see something like this isn't

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.209 
probably see something like this isn't
that<00:00:13.480> awful<00:00:13.750> that's<00:00:14.110> usually<00:00:14.530> on<00:00:14.620> the<00:00:14.740> back<00:00:14.980> of

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
that awful that's usually on the back of

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.190 
that awful that's usually on the back of
your<00:00:15.339> fabric<00:00:15.580> and<00:00:16.150> you<00:00:16.240> get<00:00:16.360> that<00:00:16.540> big<00:00:16.840> hairy

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
your fabric and you get that big hairy

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.040 
your fabric and you get that big hairy
nest<00:00:18.070> of<00:00:18.340> threads<00:00:18.730> and<00:00:18.939> it<00:00:19.060> sounded<00:00:19.480> awful<00:00:19.720> but

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
nest of threads and it sounded awful but

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.929 
nest of threads and it sounded awful but
it<00:00:20.169> let's<00:00:20.349> find<00:00:20.619> on<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:20.890> front<00:00:21.130> side<00:00:21.399> it

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
it let's find on the front side it

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.150 
it let's find on the front side it
really<00:00:22.270> just<00:00:22.450> doesn't<00:00:22.869> work<00:00:22.989> well<00:00:23.259> first<00:00:23.890> off

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
really just doesn't work well first off

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.950 
really just doesn't work well first off
tension<00:00:24.790> when<00:00:25.029> you<00:00:25.119> open<00:00:25.419> the<00:00:25.480> Machine<00:00:25.779> it's

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
tension when you open the Machine it's

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.170 
tension when you open the Machine it's
gonna<00:00:26.050> be<00:00:26.230> set<00:00:26.500> at<00:00:26.710> four<00:00:27.099> now<00:00:27.640> how<00:00:27.849> many<00:00:27.910> of<00:00:28.059> you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
gonna be set at four now how many of you

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.769 
gonna be set at four now how many of you
are<00:00:28.210> told

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
are told

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.900 
are told
don't<00:00:29.079> touch<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.619> tension<00:00:30.040> on<00:00:30.220> older

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
don't touch the tension on older

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.389 
don't touch the tension on older
machines<00:00:31.059> from<00:00:31.689> Grandma's<00:00:32.169> age<00:00:32.349> or<00:00:32.590> so<00:00:32.739> what

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
machines from Grandma's age or so what

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.790 
machines from Grandma's age or so what
we<00:00:33.700> find<00:00:33.940> is<00:00:34.180> that<00:00:34.210> it<00:00:34.660> is<00:00:34.840> actually<00:00:35.050> okay<00:00:35.740> to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
we find is that it is actually okay to

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.740 
we find is that it is actually okay to
touch<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.370> tension<00:00:36.790> we<00:00:36.970> actually<00:00:37.330> have<00:00:37.510> from

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
touch the tension we actually have from

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.690 
touch the tension we actually have from
time<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.110> time<00:00:38.140> little<00:00:38.920> fingers<00:00:39.340> that<00:00:39.370> come

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
time to time little fingers that come

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.970 
time to time little fingers that come
visit<00:00:40.060> our<00:00:40.180> store<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.720> they<00:00:40.900> love<00:00:41.140> dials<00:00:41.620> and

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
visit our store and they love dials and

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.160 
visit our store and they love dials and
buttons<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.300> they<00:00:43.390> push<00:00:43.600> them<00:00:43.810> and<00:00:43.990> turn<00:00:44.140> them

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
buttons and they push them and turn them

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.380 
buttons and they push them and turn them
and<00:00:44.500> guess<00:00:44.920> what<00:00:45.130> all<00:00:45.340> we<00:00:45.550> do<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:45.910> we<00:00:46.090> roll<00:00:46.270> it

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
and guess what all we do is we roll it

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.090 
and guess what all we do is we roll it
back<00:00:46.540> to<00:00:46.690> for<00:00:46.930> how<00:00:47.140> easy<00:00:47.410> is<00:00:47.650> that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
back to for how easy is that

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.190 
back to for how easy is that
so<00:00:48.460> when<00:00:48.850> you're<00:00:49.030> working<00:00:49.180> with<00:00:49.420> threads<00:00:49.930> if

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
so when you're working with threads if

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.540 
so when you're working with threads if
you<00:00:50.350> will<00:00:50.500> have<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.740> same<00:00:51.070> thread<00:00:51.370> in<00:00:51.520> your

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
you will have the same thread in your

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.060 
you will have the same thread in your
needle<00:00:51.670> as<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:52.329> do<00:00:52.480> in<00:00:52.630> your<00:00:52.750> bobbin<00:00:53.070> you

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
needle as you do in your bobbin you

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.770 
needle as you do in your bobbin you
really<00:00:54.430> should<00:00:54.850> not<00:00:55.000> have<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.420> alter<00:00:55.750> your

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
really should not have to alter your

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.780 
really should not have to alter your
tension<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:56.710> should<00:00:57.070> be<00:00:57.220> if<00:00:57.400> something's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
tension that should be if something's

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.160 
tension that should be if something's
not<00:00:57.880> looking<00:00:58.329> right<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:58.540> either<00:00:58.810> don't<00:00:59.079> have

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
not looking right you either don't have

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.380 
not looking right you either don't have
it<00:00:59.380> threaded<00:00:59.739> correctly<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.790> needles<00:01:01.210> not

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
it threaded correctly the needles not

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.930 
it threaded correctly the needles not
the<00:01:01.570> right<00:01:01.860> size<00:01:02.860> for<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.370> thread<00:01:03.700> you've

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
the right size for the thread you've

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.300 
the right size for the thread you've
selected<00:01:04.180> or<00:01:04.780> your<00:01:05.320> bobbins<00:01:05.740> in<00:01:05.860> backwards

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
selected or your bobbins in backwards

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.380 
selected or your bobbins in backwards
there's<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.520> lot<00:01:06.700> of<00:01:06.850> things<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:07.360> should

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
there's a lot of things that you should

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.110 
there's a lot of things that you should
check<00:01:07.780> first<00:01:08.260> before<00:01:08.620> you<00:01:09.010> start<00:01:09.040> turning<00:01:09.970> the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
check first before you start turning the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.510 
check first before you start turning the
tension<00:01:10.570> dial<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.650> time<00:01:11.890> I'm<00:01:12.100> turning<00:01:12.430> the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
tension dial the time I'm turning the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.399 
tension dial the time I'm turning the
tension<00:01:12.880> dial<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.270> when<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.510> have<00:01:13.870> thread<00:01:14.170> that

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
tension dial is when I have thread that

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.140 
tension dial is when I have thread that
maybe<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.800> have<00:01:15.130> a<00:01:15.159> different<00:01:15.640> way<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.790> thread

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
maybe I have a different way to thread

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.539 
maybe I have a different way to thread
in<00:01:16.270> my<00:01:16.300> needle<00:01:16.720> than<00:01:17.620> I<00:01:17.650> have<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.040> my<00:01:18.159> bobbin

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
in my needle than I have in my bobbin

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.890 
in my needle than I have in my bobbin
that's<00:01:18.760> usually<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.150> case<00:01:19.270> when<00:01:19.600> I'm<00:01:19.750> using

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
that's usually the case when I'm using

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.690 
that's usually the case when I'm using
say<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.260> decorative<00:01:20.830> thread<00:01:21.220> usually

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
say a decorative thread usually

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.520 
say a decorative thread usually
sometimes<00:01:22.090> these<00:01:22.240> are<00:01:22.390> thicker<00:01:22.720> and<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.500> I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
sometimes these are thicker and so I

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.350 
sometimes these are thicker and so I
don't<00:01:23.740> have<00:01:23.890> something<00:01:24.400> as<00:01:24.670> thick<00:01:25.090> in<00:01:25.240> my

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
don't have something as thick in my

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.390 
don't have something as thick in my
bobbin<00:01:25.780> if<00:01:26.049> I<00:01:26.380> find<00:01:26.650> that<00:01:26.770> my<00:01:26.920> threads<00:01:27.220> are

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
bobbin if I find that my threads are

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.700 
bobbin if I find that my threads are
pulling<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:28.150> one<00:01:28.180> side<00:01:28.750> like<00:01:29.049> maybe<00:01:29.500> they're

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
pulling to one side like maybe they're

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.200 
pulling to one side like maybe they're
pulling<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.190> back<00:01:30.490> side<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.180> don't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
pulling to the back side and I don't

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.789 
pulling to the back side and I don't
want<00:01:31.659> them<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.990> be<00:01:32.140> back<00:01:32.350> there<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.680> can

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
want them to be back there you can

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.380 
want them to be back there you can
almost<00:01:32.950> see<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.369> color<00:01:33.760> from<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.150> top

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
almost see the color from the top

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.539 
almost see the color from the top
showing<00:01:35.020> on<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.229> back<00:01:35.409> side<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:36.159> means<00:01:36.400> the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
showing on the back side that means the

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.000 
showing on the back side that means the
bobbin<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.180> too<00:01:37.420> tight<00:01:37.780> now<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.350> bobbin<00:01:38.830> does

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
bobbin is too tight now the bobbin does

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.130 
bobbin is too tight now the bobbin does
not<00:01:39.250> actually<00:01:39.580> have<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:40.240> tension<00:01:40.720> dial<00:01:40.900> we

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
not actually have a tension dial we

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.530 
not actually have a tension dial we
change<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:41.680> is<00:01:41.890> kind<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.250> set<00:01:42.549> number<00:01:42.820> the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
change that is kind of a set number the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.880 
change that is kind of a set number the
only<00:01:43.750> change<00:01:44.049> we<00:01:44.170> would<00:01:44.320> do<00:01:44.470> is<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.710> we'd

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
only change we would do is that we'd

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.280 
only change we would do is that we'd
actually<00:01:44.979> tighten<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.970> top<00:01:46.180> tension<00:01:46.720> now

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
actually tighten the top tension now

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.260 
actually tighten the top tension now
tightening<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.010> means<00:01:48.220> more<00:01:48.700> than<00:01:48.939> just<00:01:49.180> a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
tightening it means more than just a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.570 
tightening it means more than just a
little<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.320> dial<00:01:50.560> you're<00:01:51.070> definitely

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
little of the dial you're definitely

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.640 
little of the dial you're definitely
wanting<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.060> actually<00:01:52.540> turn<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:53.049> whole

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
wanting to actually turn it a whole

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.920 
wanting to actually turn it a whole
number<00:01:54.040> or<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.310> one<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.970> half<00:01:55.000> numbers<00:01:55.659> worth

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
number or a one and a half numbers worth

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.630 
number or a one and a half numbers worth
just<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.740> see<00:01:56.920> if<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.159> you're<00:01:57.460> actually

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
just to see if that you're actually

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.130 
just to see if that you're actually
going<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.060> right<00:01:58.180> way<00:01:58.240> it's<00:01:58.810> either<00:01:58.960> gonna

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
going the right way it's either gonna

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.450 
going the right way it's either gonna
make<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.409> worse<00:01:59.650> or<00:01:59.979> it's<00:02:00.130> gonna<00:02:00.250> make<00:02:00.430> it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
make it worse or it's gonna make it

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.190 
make it worse or it's gonna make it
better<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:01.270> cool<00:02:01.450> thing<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.930> if<00:02:02.049> it's

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
better the cool thing is is if it's

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.590 
better the cool thing is is if it's
making<00:02:02.500> it<00:02:02.619> better<00:02:02.860> you're<00:02:03.580> gonna<00:02:03.700> find<00:02:04.119> that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
making it better you're gonna find that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.149 
making it better you're gonna find that
you're<00:02:04.659> going<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.500> right<00:02:05.590> direction<00:02:05.799> maybe

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
you're going the right direction maybe

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.800 
you're going the right direction maybe
can<00:02:06.369> turn<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:06.820> little<00:02:07.060> bit<00:02:07.180> more<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.540> really

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
can turn it a little bit more and really

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.139 
can turn it a little bit more and really
get<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.110> eye<00:02:08.399> everything<00:02:09.399> fixed<00:02:09.909> the<00:02:09.999> way<00:02:10.090> you

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
get the eye everything fixed the way you

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.059 
get the eye everything fixed the way you
want<00:02:10.389> it<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.719> if<00:02:11.439> you<00:02:11.560> were<00:02:11.680> going<00:02:11.859> the<00:02:12.040> wrong

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
want it and if you were going the wrong

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.769 
want it and if you were going the wrong
way<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.639> it<00:02:12.760> need<00:02:12.909> to<00:02:12.999> go<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.239> other<00:02:13.269> way<00:02:13.450> well

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:13.779 
way and it need to go the other way well

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.330 
way and it need to go the other way well
now<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.230> know

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
now you know

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.040 
now you know
turn<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.700> other<00:02:15.730> way<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:16.900> not

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
turn it the other way so it's really not

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.890 
turn it the other way so it's really not
a<00:02:17.110> lot<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.770> hard<00:02:18.300> understanding<00:02:19.300> here<00:02:19.540> but

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
a lot of hard understanding here but

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.570 
a lot of hard understanding here but
let's<00:02:20.080> talk<00:02:20.230> about<00:02:20.290> what<00:02:20.709> gave<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.190> nest

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
let's talk about what gave you this nest

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.949 
let's talk about what gave you this nest
because<00:02:21.849> that's<00:02:22.030> probably<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.360> most<00:02:22.510> common

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
because that's probably the most common

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.630 
because that's probably the most common
thing<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.200> we<00:02:23.349> have<00:02:23.709> whether<00:02:24.400> you've

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
thing that we have whether you've

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.550 
thing that we have whether you've
threaded<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.209> with<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.780> presser<00:02:26.140> foot<00:02:26.349> down

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
threaded it with the presser foot down

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.760 
threaded it with the presser foot down
oh<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:28.239> means<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.900> inside<00:02:29.260> here<00:02:29.530> there<00:02:29.680> are

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
oh that means that inside here there are

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.190 
oh that means that inside here there are
two<00:02:29.980> tension<00:02:30.430> disks<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.000> they<00:02:31.480> were<00:02:31.540> closed

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
two tension disks and they were closed

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.259 
two tension disks and they were closed
when<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.160> threaded<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.030> thread

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
when you threaded it so the thread

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.030 
when you threaded it so the thread
didn't<00:02:34.540> get<00:02:34.690> down<00:02:34.959> where<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.590> needed<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.950> be

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
didn't get down where it needed to be

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.400 
didn't get down where it needed to be
when<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.819> presser<00:02:37.120> foot<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.330> up<00:02:37.450> when<00:02:38.290> you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
when the presser foot is up when you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.050 
when the presser foot is up when you
thread<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.769> machine<00:02:39.099> that's<00:02:39.370> read<00:02:39.610> will<00:02:39.790> sink

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
thread the machine that's read will sink

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.240 
thread the machine that's read will sink
all<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.300> way<00:02:40.540> down<00:02:40.810> then<00:02:41.500> when<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.769> lower<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
all the way down then when you lower the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.490 
all the way down then when you lower the
presser<00:02:42.489> foot<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.269> thread<00:02:43.569> will<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:43.900> proper

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
presser foot the thread will have proper

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.430 
presser foot the thread will have proper
tension<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.970> thread<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.599> will<00:02:47.140> be<00:02:47.260> ready

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
tension on the thread and will be ready

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.860 
tension on the thread and will be ready
to<00:02:47.680> use<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.459> this<00:02:48.760> means<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.269> there<00:02:49.480> was<00:02:49.600> no

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
to use so this means that there was no

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.050 
to use so this means that there was no
tension<00:02:50.319> whatsoever<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:51.069> that<00:02:51.100> thread<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.760> it

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
tension whatsoever on that thread and it

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.280 
tension whatsoever on that thread and it
grabbed<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.569> pulled<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.930> all<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.080> way<00:02:53.260> down

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
grabbed it pulled it all the way down

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.559 
grabbed it pulled it all the way down
the<00:02:54.010> thing<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.519> most<00:02:54.730> people<00:02:55.120> will<00:02:55.269> look<00:02:55.390> at

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
the thing is is most people will look at

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.059 
the thing is is most people will look at
this<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.930> because<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.470> was<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.890> back

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
this and because that was on the back

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.890 
this and because that was on the back
side<00:02:57.310> don't<00:02:57.850> think<00:02:58.030> it's<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.269> bobbins<00:02:58.750> a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
side don't think it's the bobbins a

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.420 
side don't think it's the bobbins a
problem<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.530> guess<00:03:00.040> what

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
problem and guess what

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
rethread the top with the foot up and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.880 
rethread the top with the foot up and
once<00:03:06.790> again<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.510> little<00:03:07.690> test<00:03:08.140> remember<00:03:08.680> if

once again that little test remember if

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.830 
once again that little test remember if
you<00:03:08.980> take<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.340> thread<00:03:09.640> out<00:03:09.880> from<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> needle

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
you take the thread out from the needle

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.270 
you take the thread out from the needle
and<00:03:10.959> you're<00:03:11.140> pulling<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.620> when<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.069> foot<00:03:12.250> is

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
and you're pulling it when the foot is

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.910 
and you're pulling it when the foot is
up<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.670> should<00:03:12.819> be<00:03:12.880> fairly<00:03:13.239> easy<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.110> pull<00:03:14.410> but

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
up it should be fairly easy to pull but

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.500 
up it should be fairly easy to pull but
as<00:03:14.980> soon<00:03:15.130> as<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.430> lower<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.940> down<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.150> that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
as soon as you lower it down and that

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.479 
as soon as you lower it down and that
needle<00:03:16.930> bends<00:03:17.260> when<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.709> pull<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.069> this<00:03:18.250> red

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
needle bends when you pull it this red

needle bends when you pull it this red
doesn't<00:03:18.670> come<00:03:19.000> through<00:03:19.150> any<00:03:19.420> further<00:03:19.660> that's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
doesn't come through any further that's

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.289 
doesn't come through any further that's
when<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.769> know<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.010> have<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.489> properly

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
when you know you have it properly

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.599 
when you know you have it properly
threaded<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.410> thread<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.829> down<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.400> those

threaded and the thread is down in those
tension<00:03:25.120> disks<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:25.890> that's<00:03:26.890> pretty<00:03:27.160> much<00:03:27.310> all

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489

you<00:03:27.640> need<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.940> know<00:03:28.030> about<00:03:28.150> tension<00:03:28.720> and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
you need to know about tension and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.259 
you need to know about tension and
really<00:03:29.709> leave<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.280> where<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.519> is<00:03:30.549> use<00:03:30.970> good

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
really leave it where it is use good
