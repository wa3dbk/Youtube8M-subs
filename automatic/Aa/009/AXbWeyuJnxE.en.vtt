odd let's watch the process again adding

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.060 
odd let's watch the process again adding
product<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.780> tips<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.350> massaging<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
starting too close to the scalp so it

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.890 
starting too close to the scalp so it
won't<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.280> too<00:01:59.550> tight<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.880> your<00:02:00.210> hair<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.720> then
