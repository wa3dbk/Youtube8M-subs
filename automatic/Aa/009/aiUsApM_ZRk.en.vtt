live stage audio enhancement even though

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.330 
live stage audio enhancement even though

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
it does make it sound like you're at a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.640 
it does make it sound like you're at a
concert<00:03:16.549> but<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.180> also<00:03:17.419> lowers<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.169> volume<00:03:18.319> a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
concert but it also lowers the volume a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.559 
concert but it also lowers the volume a
bit<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.549> just<00:03:19.760> don't<00:03:19.940> like<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.269> way<00:03:20.419> it

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
bit and I just don't like the way it

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.849

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.649 
sounds so you'll have to listen to it
for<00:03:21.889> yourself<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.849> see<00:03:22.879> if<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.269> like<00:03:23.449> it<00:03:23.599> or

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.569 
for yourself to see if you like it or
not<00:03:23.780> now<00:03:24.199> what's<00:03:24.530> more<00:03:24.799> impressive<00:03:25.129> is

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
not now what's more impressive is

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.089 
not now what's more impressive is
actually<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.269> clarify<00:03:26.840> feature<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.440> found

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
actually the clarify feature I found

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.069 
actually the clarify feature I found
while<00:03:28.310> having<00:03:28.699> it<00:03:28.819> enabled<00:03:29.329> I<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:29.870> definitely

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
while having it enabled I can definitely

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.210 
while having it enabled I can definitely
tell<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.680> difference

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
tell the difference

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.789 
tell the difference
all<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.609> this<00:03:31.729> songs<00:03:32.030> sounded<00:03:32.479> fuller<00:03:32.870> sounded

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
all of this songs sounded fuller sounded

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.520 
all of this songs sounded fuller sounded
crispier<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:35.239> mids<00:03:35.569> were<00:03:35.750> nicer<00:03:36.199> and<00:03:36.470> I

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
crispier and the mids were nicer and I

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.589 
crispier and the mids were nicer and I
also<00:03:36.620> found<00:03:37.069> that<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.489> bass<00:03:37.729> was<00:03:37.970> nice<00:03:38.239> but<00:03:38.569> it

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
also found that the bass was nice but it

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.409 
also found that the bass was nice but it
wasn't<00:03:39.139> overkill<00:03:39.859> either<00:03:40.099> so<00:03:40.669> I<00:03:40.699> definitely

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
wasn't overkill either so I definitely

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.110 
wasn't overkill either so I definitely
like<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.870> experience<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.590> clarify<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.519> the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
like the experience of clarify and the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.670 
like the experience of clarify and the
actual<00:03:44.569> mixture<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.109> that<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
actual mixture of that and the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.080 
actual mixture of that and the
headphones<00:03:46.129> it<00:03:46.340> was<00:03:46.430> one<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.729> best

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
headphones it was one of the best

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.780 
headphones it was one of the best
smartphone<00:03:47.840> audio<00:03:48.409> experiences<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.639> I've

think that this is your choice

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.620 
think that this is your choice
hands-down<00:06:08.139> no-brainer<00:06:09.039> I<00:06:09.340> say<00:06:10.210> maybe<00:06:10.449> the

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
hands-down no-brainer I say maybe the

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.839 
hands-down no-brainer I say maybe the
only<00:06:10.780> bad<00:06:11.080> thing<00:06:11.110> is<00:06:11.650> maybe<00:06:12.069> the<00:06:12.310> color<00:06:12.550> choice

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
only bad thing is maybe the color choice

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.450 
only bad thing is maybe the color choice
and<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.479> fingerprint<00:06:14.139> magnet<00:06:14.349> of<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:15.099> actual

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
and the fingerprint magnet of the actual

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.279 
and the fingerprint magnet of the actual
black<00:06:15.669> finish<00:06:16.060> and<00:06:16.240> some<00:06:16.690> people<00:06:16.960> may<00:06:17.110> not

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
black finish and some people may not

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.680 
black finish and some people may not
like<00:06:17.349> the<00:06:17.740> gold<00:06:17.949> finish<00:06:18.310> on<00:06:18.490> there<00:06:18.669> at<00:06:18.789> all<00:06:18.909> but

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
like the gold finish on there at all but

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.960 
like the gold finish on there at all but
I<00:06:19.960> think<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.470> m8<00:06:20.770> still<00:06:21.070> is<00:06:21.280> one<00:06:21.460> of<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:21.639> best

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
I think the m8 still is one of the best

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.969 
I think the m8 still is one of the best
