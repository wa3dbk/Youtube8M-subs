00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.160

 Pictures of the construction progress 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.219
 when you started to build ships 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.289
 Since you put already the keel and 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.690
 there was always a coin under the kiel 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.269
 and that brought the one with the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.670
 The ship was commissioned later than that 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.440
 Ship from the pile ran this coin 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.570
 to those who built the ship 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.159
