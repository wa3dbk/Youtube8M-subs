what you can do in order to get better

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.930 
what you can do in order to get better
at<00:00:36.719> designing<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.590> also<00:00:38.040> better<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.640> being

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
at designing and also better at being

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.080 
at designing and also better at being
able<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.239> recognize<00:00:40.100> little<00:00:41.100> bits<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.820> color

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
able to recognize little bits of color

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
able to recognize little bits of color
and<00:00:42.510> also<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.950> patterns<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:45.440> my<00:00:46.440> sketchbook

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and also with patterns now my sketchbook

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.450 
and also with patterns now my sketchbook
is<00:00:47.579> such<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.090> when<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:48.809> drawing<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> can

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
is such that when I'm drawing so you can

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
is such that when I'm drawing so you can
see<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.030> I've<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.210> some<00:00:51.719> some<00:00:52.649> characters

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
see here I've got some some characters

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.910 
see here I've got some some characters
that<00:00:53.460> I've<00:00:53.640> included<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.840> my<00:00:54.989> sketchbook<00:00:55.350> here

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that I've included in my sketchbook here

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.910 
that I've included in my sketchbook here
I've<00:00:56.129> got<00:00:56.390> there<00:00:57.390> were<00:00:57.480> some<00:00:57.750> characters<00:00:58.710> that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
I've got there were some characters that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.729 
I've got there were some characters that
I<00:00:59.010> had<00:00:59.190> seen<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> they<00:01:00.359> were<00:01:01.170> getting<00:01:01.530> ready

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
I had seen and they were getting ready

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.920 
I had seen and they were getting ready
to<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> film<00:01:03.000> shoot<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> guess<00:01:03.809> they

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to for a film shoot and I guess they

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.950 
to for a film shoot and I guess they
were<00:01:04.019> dressed<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> nineteen<00:01:05.519> late<00:01:06.210> 1920s

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
were dressed in the nineteen late 1920s

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.010 
were dressed in the nineteen late 1920s
early<00:01:07.159> 1930s<00:01:08.159> costume<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.720> quickly

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
early 1930s costume and so I quickly

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.890 
early 1930s costume and so I quickly
jotted<00:01:10.590> them<00:01:10.619> down<00:01:10.799> there's<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.479> here

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
jotted them down there's this one here

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
jotted them down there's this one here
that<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.110> had<00:01:13.260> posted<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.890> my<00:01:14.040> tumblr<00:01:14.340> page<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
that I had posted on my tumblr page and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570 
that I had posted on my tumblr page and
so<00:01:15.990> all<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.170> these<00:01:16.409> characters<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.189> people

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so all of these characters are people

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.700 
so all of these characters are people
that<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.470> sometimes<00:01:19.470> they

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that I see and sometimes they

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
that I see and sometimes they
necessitate<00:01:20.000> drawing<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
necessitate drawing them with a bit of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
necessitate drawing them with a bit of
texture<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.470> pattern<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:23.189> something<00:01:23.670> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
texture or pattern or something that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270 
texture or pattern or something that
they<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.570> their<00:01:24.840> clothing<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.530> realized

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
they have on their clothing I realized

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
they have on their clothing I realized
that<00:01:26.369> was<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> bit<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.119> weakness<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.780> me

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
that was a bit of a weakness for me

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840 
that was a bit of a weakness for me
because<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.350> could<00:01:28.560> identify<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.280> particular

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
because I could identify a particular

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.270 
because I could identify a particular
pattern<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.079> could<00:01:31.259> draw<00:01:31.439> my<00:01:31.650> impression

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
pattern and I could draw my impression

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640 
pattern and I could draw my impression
of<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.579> which<00:01:32.970> i<00:01:33.119> think<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.420> still<00:01:33.689> valid<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of it which i think is still valid but I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.560 
of it which i think is still valid but I
wasn't<00:01:34.950> necessarily<00:01:35.520> sure<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> was<00:01:36.390> able

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
wasn't necessarily sure that I was able

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.109 
wasn't necessarily sure that I was able
to<00:01:36.810> identify<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.710> pattern<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.820> way<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to identify that pattern in the way that

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.690 
to identify that pattern in the way that
I<00:01:39.180> wanted<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.049> capture<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> had<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
I wanted to capture that so I had to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.090 
I wanted to capture that so I had to
come<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.090> something<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.960> most<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.950> us

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
come up with something now most of us

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.429 
come up with something now most of us
have<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.640> our<00:01:44.729> sketchbook<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.290> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
have in our sketchbook what we know is a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.410 
have in our sketchbook what we know is a
blotter<00:01:46.770> page<00:01:47.070> now<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> blotter<00:01:47.700> page<00:01:48.030> looks

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
blotter page now a blotter page looks

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
blotter page now a blotter page looks
probably<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.170> bladder<00:01:49.590> page<00:01:49.920> doesn't<00:01:50.250> look

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
probably your bladder page doesn't look

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.670 
probably your bladder page doesn't look
that<00:01:50.549> much<00:01:50.729> different<00:01:50.909> than<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.990> what

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that much different than this and what

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.429 
that much different than this and what
this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:54.060> tuck<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.840> into<00:01:55.320> my

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
this is is I actually tuck this into my

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.990 
this is is I actually tuck this into my
sketchbook<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:57.450> I'm<00:01:57.750> drawing<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
sketchbook so that when I'm drawing and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.289 
sketchbook so that when I'm drawing and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the drawing with my markers that the ink

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539 
the drawing with my markers that the ink
that<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> starts<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> absorb<00:02:04.469> into<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that as it starts to absorb into the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.119 
that as it starts to absorb into the
sheet<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.030> paper<00:02:06.299> it'll<00:02:07.020> soak<00:02:07.350> through<00:02:07.710> into

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
sheet of paper it'll soak through into

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.059 
sheet of paper it'll soak through into
the<00:02:08.250> other<00:02:08.429> sheet<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.000> paper<00:02:09.349> behind<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the other sheet of paper behind it and

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.600 
the other sheet of paper behind it and
it'll<00:02:11.580> ruin<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.000> image<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.810> or<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.200> paper

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it'll ruin the image the or the paper

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.940 
it'll ruin the image the or the paper
that<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.420> behind<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.290> thought<00:02:15.500> what<00:02:15.890> I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
that is behind it so I thought what I

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.980 
that is behind it so I thought what I
need<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.490> need<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.670> blotter<00:02:17.030> page<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.720> put

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
need is I need a blotter page so I put

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.020 
need is I need a blotter page so I put
this<00:02:18.110> piece<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.500> paper<00:02:18.620> here<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:19.760> pace<00:02:20.000> a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
piece of paper stops the ink from going

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
serves as a pattern page now what I did

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.770 
serves as a pattern page now what I did
was<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.260> went<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.800> internet<00:02:34.210> and<00:02:35.210> I<00:02:35.360> grabbed

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
was I went to the internet and I grabbed

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.820 
was I went to the internet and I grabbed
a<00:02:36.760> series<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.940> textures<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.260> found<00:02:39.620> that

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
a series of textures that I found that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.410 
a series of textures that I found that
some<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.130> these<00:02:40.190> textures<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.940> had<00:02:41.120> grabbed

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
some of these textures I had grabbed

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.140 
some of these textures I had grabbed
from<00:02:41.930> different<00:02:42.740> textiles<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.700> things<00:02:43.910> as

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
from different textiles and things as

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.449 
from different textiles and things as
such<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.930> i<00:02:45.170> went<00:02:45.350> ahead<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.590> i<00:02:45.740> made<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.160> big

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
such and i went ahead and i made a big

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.120 
such and i went ahead and i made a big
sheet<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.450> had<00:02:47.900> all<00:02:48.620> these<00:02:48.860> various

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
sheet that had all these various

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.150 
sheet that had all these various
textures<00:02:49.700> because<00:02:50.330> i<00:02:50.570> found<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.140> when<00:02:51.800> i<00:02:51.830> was

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
textures because i found that when i was

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.280 
textures because i found that when i was
looking<00:02:52.459> at<00:02:52.550> individual<00:02:53.030> patterns<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.660> was

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
looking at individual patterns I was

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.380 
looking at individual patterns I was
seeing<00:02:54.560> patterns<00:02:54.980> within<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.730> patterns<00:02:56.150> in

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
seeing patterns within the patterns in

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.810 
seeing patterns within the patterns in
the<00:02:56.570> sense<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.260> plaid<00:02:57.860> pattern<00:02:58.370> was<00:02:58.580> very

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
the sense that a plaid pattern was very

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.600 
the sense that a plaid pattern was very
similar<00:02:59.209> in<00:02:59.390> terms<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.959> its<00:03:00.110> scale<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.770> there

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
similar in terms of its scale and there

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.550 
similar in terms of its scale and there
would<00:03:01.700> be<00:03:01.730> different<00:03:02.150> colors<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.260> plaid

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
would be different colors of this plaid

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.340 
would be different colors of this plaid
pattern<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.160> plan<00:03:04.880> was<00:03:05.209> organized<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:06.020> one

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
pattern but plan was organized in one

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.240 
pattern but plan was organized in one
particular<00:03:06.590> way<00:03:07.250> also<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.330> same<00:03:08.510> thing<00:03:08.900> with

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
particular way also the same thing with

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.190 
particular way also the same thing with
individual<00:03:10.250> individual<00:03:11.060> elements<00:03:11.600> such<00:03:11.959> as<00:03:11.989> a

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
individual individual elements such as a

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.470 
individual individual elements such as a
polka<00:03:12.530> dots<00:03:12.830> or<00:03:13.100> colors<00:03:13.459> or<00:03:13.700> triangles<00:03:14.300> I

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
polka dots or colors or triangles I

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.050 
polka dots or colors or triangles I
thought<00:03:15.050> if<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.350> can<00:03:15.530> come<00:03:15.739> up<00:03:15.770> with<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.100> system<00:03:16.580> a

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
thought if I can come up with a system a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.300 
thought if I can come up with a system a
system<00:03:17.480> by<00:03:18.080> which<00:03:18.110> i<00:03:18.820> can<00:03:19.820> record<00:03:20.720> just<00:03:21.500> be<00:03:22.100> a

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
system by which i can record just be a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.789 
system by which i can record just be a
basic<00:03:22.820> template<00:03:23.390> for<00:03:24.200> some<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.650> these

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
basic template for some of these

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.670 
basic template for some of these
patterns<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.790> i<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.120> go<00:03:26.269> ahead<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.750> use

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
patterns that i can go ahead and use

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.070 
patterns that i can go ahead and use
some<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.459> this<00:03:28.670> in<00:03:28.910> order<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.750> get<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.989> better

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
some of this in order to get a better

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.170 
some of this in order to get a better
idea<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.769> what<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.640> i'm<00:03:31.730> looking<00:03:32.090> at

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
idea of what it is that i'm looking at

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.750 
idea of what it is that i'm looking at
so<00:03:32.390> i<00:03:32.660> can<00:03:32.900> simply<00:03:33.590> look<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.040> say<00:03:34.220> okay<00:03:34.400> well

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
so i can simply look and say okay well

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.479 
so i can simply look and say okay well
that<00:03:35.269> dress<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:35.930> similar<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:37.070> this<00:03:37.220> but

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
that dress is similar to this but

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.390 
that dress is similar to this but
instead<00:03:37.820> of<00:03:38.000> being<00:03:38.269> brown<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.500> blue<00:03:39.980> and

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
instead of being brown and blue and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.920 
instead of being brown and blue and
yellow<00:03:40.790> perhaps<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:42.049> orange<00:03:42.650> green<00:03:43.220> and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
yellow perhaps it is orange green and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.860 
yellow perhaps it is orange green and
purple<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.700> i<00:03:46.730> use<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.060> system<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.750> would

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
purple and so i use a system that would

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.900 
purple and so i use a system that would
be<00:03:48.019> similar<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.440> this<00:03:48.709> but<00:03:48.920> i<00:03:48.980> simply<00:03:49.400> swap<00:03:49.700> out

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
be similar to this but i simply swap out

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.150 
be similar to this but i simply swap out
the<00:03:50.060> colors<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.570> make<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.900> more<00:03:51.080> accurate<00:03:51.650> to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
the colors to make it more accurate to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.960 
the colors to make it more accurate to
what<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:53.060> i'm<00:03:53.330> going<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.540> be<00:03:53.630> drawing

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
what it is that i'm going to be drawing

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.310 
what it is that i'm going to be drawing
because<00:03:55.970> it's<00:03:56.239> a<00:03:56.360> mobile<00:03:56.660> studio<00:03:56.840> because<00:03:57.080> i

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
because it's a mobile studio because i

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.229 
because it's a mobile studio because i
have<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:57.680> mobile<00:03:57.950> studio<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.760> then<00:03:58.850> this<00:03:59.060> would

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239
