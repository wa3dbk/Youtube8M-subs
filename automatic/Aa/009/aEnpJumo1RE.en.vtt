00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 every garden video point is coming 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.690
 markus planks behind the camera in front of the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.740
 camera robert maierhofer and before the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.139
 camera also a shrub of like texmex 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.520
 robert what exactly is monk and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.080
 why is his name at least a small one ? 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.920
 shrub one meter fifty to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.350
 eighty high will be blue with us 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.990
 flowers in summer and late summer 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.779
 the name comes because he supposedly 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.189
 formerly in monasteries near Munich 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 has been used 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.700
 the capsules of it around the bodily ones 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.460
 to prevent cravings 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.440
 yes we are just mature 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.880
 discovered capsules but there are yes 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.410
 not necessarily in the situation that 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.150
 we just crave our bodily needs 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.660
 have to suppress now for the video 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.640
 Of course they are okay and so 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.840
 So that's the name and why is that 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.180
 Plant a bit more up to date 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.330
 become in the last years so the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.670
 Last years was the most widespread 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.520
 butterfly lilac buttlar strong im 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.590
 disco in discussion 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.280
 because of the spread in nature him 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.900
 is said to be in the Pacific 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.160
 That's why we looked for an alternative 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.170
 and came to the monk pepper 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.540
 also has nice steps rispes there 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.970
 different varieties of white over pink 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.820
 up to blue not so wide and so 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.729
 the colors pop again butterfly 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.460
 lilac from the winter actually should have 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.410
 similarly I would say adequate 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.780
 frost times can sometimes look in 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.750
 winter as it is here for example 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.750
 the shoots are freezing back here are the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.179
 Frozen top 20 centimeters back 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.539
 but if you cut deeper, that is 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.429
 wood still founder nothing happens 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.490
 but does not play such a big one either 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.619
 Role because we recommend the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.060
 The text is complete until the end of each year 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.430
 to cut back the ground 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.990
 okay how is that going to be so difficult 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.890
 that it may not be difficult indeed times 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.890
 show again a simple plant 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.970
 the simple magnifying glass radical cut 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.720
 Just cut everything to 10 to 20 cm 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.720
 back 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.770
 a little bit the deadwood out that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.370
 I can also finish later 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.080
 and so the cut would be done now 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.760
 I would be a time so if I 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.980
 horticulture in my garden and the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.140
 garden shrubs are cut in this way today 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.790
 because it would not make me happy 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.180
 say, now I have nothing more 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.820
 he is developing again so one has 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.340
 in the summer again in the bus and the size 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.330
 up to two meters round and beautiful 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.680
 full of flowers 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.560
 now you said that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.940
 Main one becomes 1 50 to 2 meters 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.340
 but now i have in england 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.730
 much bigger weeks seen what is the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.160
 reason 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.500
 that has just to do with winter hardiness 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.860
 In England there is milder winter 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.680
 here 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.600
 you have the frost damage to the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.970
 Tips from bitrix not and also that 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.960
 bigger budgets build on that 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.510
 they probably have there too 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.220
 cut differently and therefore also at 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.470
 us so flexi all the way down to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.380
 cut because you were from year to year 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.650
 reckon with back-free shootings 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.650
 got to 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.130
 ok , I believe you, I'll say the word 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.340
 taken the mouth but maybe 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.900
 what is the garden worth of such a 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.850
 would you recommend that when 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.490
 the flowering starts what could the 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.230
 problems are 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.280
 I would say recommendable device 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.340
 for every garden 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.140
 the flowering starts late, it starts in the middle 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.070
 until the end of august and it will be finished 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.580
 September 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.170
 In this area there is little heard 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.770
 they still flourish with us in the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.200
 Whatever is an issue in the apply 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.210
 is it blue flowers there is general 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.140
 she does not get enough with blue flowers and 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.400
 that it is a nice enrichment 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.460
 ok so thanks for the tips 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.870
 not only with the monster 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.870
 had to do with the plant
