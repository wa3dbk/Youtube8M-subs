00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.450
 Hi there, this is my turn for the future 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.270
 ranking bookmakers roman db i 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.850
 I will probably be one of many who 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.430
 disappointed with the second part of the house and who 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.869
 expected from the Roma and much more he 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.460
 end up really these transrotor 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.949
 really this pause either 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.449
 really but something inside 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.809
 psychologically the team overstrained 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.860
 but they could not compete 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.410
 as regards to go, then the final with 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.079
 Juventus thought that the team 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.420
 a little bit crush no not squeeze no 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.340
 confide in your own strength but it 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 Roman holes you are here at all all decomposed 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.449
 go out author pan for here everything 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.520
 any possible form variations 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.910
 players tactical schemes also goes away 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.020
 on 2 here psychology solves a lot 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.070
 This season's first match is quite 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.050
 proved himself 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.149
 and we can probably count on 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.119
 something scary again sparkling in 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.299
 independence fight for some high 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.479
 matter points and cup teams or 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.630
 there is now important to finish the season beating 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.369
 evil competitor but me all the same 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 seen as seen last time 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.170
 favorite exactly in this meeting due 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 perhaps more rapid movements for 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.100
 an account of the faster course of the ball 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.579
 more variable attacks where all the same there 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.070
 choice well and definitely like me again 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.850
 it seems all the same lessons and the coach 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 potential 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.119
 page if she is bigger and more interesting 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.600
 so my bet is a rum win for 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.780
 and I think that also in the first half 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.409
 will score a quick goal a to 25 minutes and 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.590
 but this 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.929
 my house and its this season for rating 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.200
 Travelers rushed something may not 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.880
 bright but sometimes the folders were lucky too 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.159
