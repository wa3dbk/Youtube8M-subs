00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello to all welcome to my video of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.810
 finder split 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.110
 so here is today I'm going to you 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.179
 show the basics of the future skateboard so 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.429
 that is, some easy tricks 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.220
 had to perform to show the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.609
 ice cream so already the placement of the fingers 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.000
 a single detail 1 in front of the nail in front 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.060
 life that in seven screws that is to say that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.189
 ask here it's necessarily me that's a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.630
 aprilia thing that prefers to put more 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.870
 more men behind me 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:41.280
 then there are several things already for 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:46.469
 start we have the cars the kingdoms 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.620
 it's the effect of doing that kla I touch 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.760
 not the ground but I can throw then 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:06.380
 and the yardstick of cassava is the but 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:11.990
 in front of that so that's it then I'm going 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.460
 you learn from piopolis olic and the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.009
 compliant base seal and relay 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.550
 then the other tricks so that's it 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.680
 so here we place the front fingers by 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.660
 against there for the holy his before the screw 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.800
 because you're going to have to be in the air 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.800
 you're going to have to free peace like that 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.880
 here is here I have a bad 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.000
 habit it's after my finger in 3d 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.490
 but must there is always happening 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.009
 but what's needed too and it's like 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.100
 keep that two fingers disappointed actually there 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:54.860
 had as who you know you like that 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.660
 age with me so here then he 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.220
 there's plenty of stuff to do it's after 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.860
 you can make the fall of others 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.319
 then we have the choice quickly so the 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.899
 sheriff it's a tricks and that consists of 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.729
 take his plank finally a ride on the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.770
 board and managed to turn it 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.220
 like this so to do the show quickly 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.310
 we put a back to the front and a finger to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.910
 the back in place and yes it must be done 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.180
 a movement of thought it sucks that you 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.180
 is offered 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 now if after we can 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.049
 imagine this is to jump there I 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.049
 mens what is moving 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:58.750
 and here you are, so here I have 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.659
 decided to take something so 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:13.209
 that's what I take to put away my 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:17.799
 wheels all that yes that's after that I 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.239
 come here I did that so if you are 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.790
 good you sometimes see Lyon who have 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.269
 trend by doing with three fingers to 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:31.420
 on the front jump then tackle 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:32.829
 what to enrich then that is if you 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.940
 if you do not know yet do you 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.049
 need drawing of a kind a 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.180
 rating in audio especially do not keep the 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.150
 flat board of 1 you have you 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.650
 feared word c was you will lose from 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.980
 speed so what he wants to do 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.690
 it's the vc waking up to progress 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.260
 has passed and there you will see you 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.139
 have kept your speed thanks to you for 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.099
