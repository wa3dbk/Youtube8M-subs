okay<00:00:00.450> booting<00:00:00.840> up<00:00:01.669> EPC<00:00:02.810> 900<00:00:03.950> don't<00:00:04.950> mind<00:00:05.279> about

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
okay booting up EPC 900 don't mind about

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.309 
okay booting up EPC 900 don't mind about
black<00:00:05.970> bass<00:00:06.210> battery<00:00:06.690> because<00:00:07.049> that's

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
black bass battery because that's

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.620 
black bass battery because that's
actually<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:07.859> battery<00:00:08.429> from<00:00:08.880> mine<00:00:09.120> with<00:00:09.360> my

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
actually my battery from mine with my

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:26.380 
actually my battery from mine with my
EPC<00:00:22.250> totally<00:00:23.250> identical<00:00:23.869> but<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.130> see

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
EPC totally identical but as you can see

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.439 
EPC totally identical but as you can see
mouth<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.050> little<00:00:28.410> bit<00:00:28.529> bigger<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
mouth is a little bit bigger and the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.799 
mouth is a little bit bigger and the
screen<00:00:30.779> size<00:00:31.309> is<00:00:32.309> little<00:00:33.149> bit<00:00:33.360> bigger<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
screen size is little bit bigger so

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.720 
screen size is little bit bigger so
actually<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.890> centimeter<00:00:35.399> wider

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
actually it's like one centimeter wider

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.119 
actually it's like one centimeter wider
and<00:00:36.450> about<00:00:36.690> two<00:00:36.899> centimeters<00:00:38.180> more<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> but

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and about two centimeters more so but

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:55.479 
and about two centimeters more so but
looking<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.329> phone<00:00:49.010> not<00:00:50.270> much<00:00:51.270> difference

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.279 

across<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.699> biggest<00:00:57.030> difference<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
across the biggest difference now is the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.610 
across the biggest difference now is the
screens<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.340> easily<00:00:59.670> see<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
screens we can you can easily see that

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:09.380 
screens we can you can easily see that
there<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.770> huge<00:01:02.280> difference

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.490 

lay<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.050> beat<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.570> screen<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> mouse

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
lay a beat with the screen and a mouse

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.840 
lay a beat with the screen and a mouse
and<00:01:13.620> as<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> mouse<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> now<00:01:14.370> bigger<00:01:14.610> it's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and as the mouse is now bigger it's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.050 
and as the mouse is now bigger it's
actually<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.510> easy<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:17.400> use<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> bigger

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
actually really easy to use the bigger

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.290 
actually really easy to use the bigger
screen<00:01:18.270> too<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.790> easily<00:01:20.790> access<00:01:20.940> all

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
screen too so I can easily access all

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.190 
screen too so I can easily access all
the<00:01:21.479> corners<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.369> finger<00:01:23.369> move<00:01:23.790> not

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
the corners with one finger move not

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.410 
the corners with one finger move not
need<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.940> take<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.000> finger<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.660> of<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:28.020> touch

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
need to take the finger out of the touch

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.560 
need to take the finger out of the touch
the<00:01:30.420> resolution<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:32.330> 1020<00:01:33.330> by<00:01:33.479> 600<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.729> as

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the resolution is 1020 by 600 and and as

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560 
the resolution is 1020 by 600 and and as
you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.409> quality<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.240> screen<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
you can see the quality of the screen is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.160 
you can see the quality of the screen is
is<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.800> check<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
is really not that's check if this is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.749 
is really not that's check if this is
yes<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.590> bright<00:01:43.830> as<00:01:44.009> possible<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.610> let's

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
yes it's as bright as possible and let's

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.180 
yes it's as bright as possible and let's
go<00:01:44.940> as<00:01:45.119> low<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.420> possible<00:01:45.690> yes<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.740> really

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
go as low as possible yes it was really

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.910 
go as low as possible yes it was really
low<00:01:51.140> battery<00:01:52.460> battery<00:01:53.460> life<00:01:53.810> seems<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
low battery battery life seems to be is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.900 
low battery battery life seems to be is
said<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.940> be<00:01:57.090> similar<00:01:57.509> than<00:01:58.080> than<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.789> the

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
said to be similar than than on on the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.650 
said to be similar than than on on the
older<00:02:00.240> one

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
older one

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.160 
older one
so<00:02:01.700> actually<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.060> showing<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.869> battery

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
so actually it's not showing the battery

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.320 
so actually it's not showing the battery
life<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.590> shows<00:02:04.830> only<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> process<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
life it shows only the process like the

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.109 
life it shows only the process like the
old<00:02:06.509> ones<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.550> something<00:02:08.550> they're<00:02:08.670> saying<00:02:08.700> is

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
old ones so something they're saying is

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.740 
old ones so something they're saying is
3.5<00:02:09.929> hours<00:02:10.320> with<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.709> battery<00:02:11.269> we<00:02:12.269> will<00:02:12.450> we

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
3.5 hours with this battery we will we

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.949 
3.5 hours with this battery we will we
will<00:02:12.780> see<00:02:13.010> more<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:14.610> future<00:02:17.959> yes

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
will see more of that in the future yes

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.700 
will see more of that in the future yes
so<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:20.160> speakers<00:02:20.670> must<00:02:20.940> must<00:02:21.390> be

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
so the speakers must must be

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.120 
so the speakers must must be
ya<00:02:23.030> know<00:02:24.030> isn't<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> micro<00:02:25.110> plan<00:02:25.350> yeah

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
ya know isn't that the micro plan yeah

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.410 
ya know isn't that the micro plan yeah
I'll<00:02:27.030> speak<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.950> speakers<00:02:28.950> over<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.610> okay

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
I'll speak on speakers over here okay

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.780 
I'll speak on speakers over here okay
so<00:02:31.020> against<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> speakers<00:02:31.860> over<00:02:32.100> there<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
so against the speakers over there and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:48.740 
so against the speakers over there and
we<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.630> also<00:02:33.810> see<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.560> slot<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:40.550> module<00:02:47.750> it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
we can also see the slot for module it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.590 
we can also see the slot for module it's
pretty<00:02:49.560> much<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.490> same<00:02:50.760> size<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.410> door

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
pretty much the same size of the door

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.520 
pretty much the same size of the door
from<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.750> only<00:02:54.900> one<00:02:55.080> but<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.320> guess<00:03:00.140> so

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
from the only one but I guess so

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.270 
from the only one but I guess so
a<00:03:02.930> CPC<00:03:04.070> 900<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.370> would<00:03:06.090> say<00:03:06.300> this<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.320> one<00:03:08.010> nice

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
a CPC 900 I would say this is a one nice

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.420
