00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.910
 hello girls here is the max and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.030
 train stations toilets are the same anyway 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
 a thing in itself but that it was 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.000
 just simply the madness i thought 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.689
 I have to do that now I have to go here now 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 Let's get rid of it 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.189
 2 i'm last i think last 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 Wednesday was that I have to after the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.489
 work where to go and me again 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.599
 has to change in Hanau was already one 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.250
 hanauer is likely to be 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.290
 in hemmoor there is no loo 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.450
 Hannah is a relatively large train station 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.750
 but there is no loo there is only one way 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.149
 funny so funny is cottage directly 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.290
 from the station what no sow I find 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.329
 I have not found it either and that 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.699
 boarded the train in frankfurt and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.210
 now all well and somehow as in train 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:52.079
 starts out of shit you have to evil 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.489
 I did not want to go to the toilet 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.070
 more so hey you have to hammer 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 then change somehow to two 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.519
 drive and then you are 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.320
 Actually already there to comply 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.839
 I realized then somehow 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.769
 but still hanno slow 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.350
 alighted 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.850
 Run to the circle where I had to go and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.890
 thought hey come the keep still 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.380
 out and then somehow I stand 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.369
 a shit on the clock shit train 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.250
 comes only in the 5th 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.500
 that goes off suddenly so so 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.860
 let's go look where are 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.600
 signs where it goes to the loo and found 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.770
 has run after and suddenly 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 I stand in the forecourt 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 Schiller has nothing on no clo 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.990
 Otherwise, I think hey you little 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990

 forecourt the shit one is not here 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.920

 a small house is the biggest 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.320
 cottage the director man comes out 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.399

 there is such a real little one 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.409
 automatic cleaning, so to speak 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.210
 fucking house yes you do not recognize something 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.280
 that just looks like it already 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.550
 outside so broken that you think oh 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.410
 No, you can design now or 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.020
 thinking hard the trends matter entirely 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.620
 So I'm going to this lucky 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.530

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.900

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.520
 that is he i have never been in mine 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.390
 live a shit like that 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.110
 this part 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.200
 you stand for before tools to hate first 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.520
 an instruction then 85 languages â€‹â€‹and 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.810
 Do you think shit what I'm doing now 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.580
 nokia is a slot where money pure 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.670
 because the joke is natural 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.290
 if there can be because you can press 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.420
 first now somehow 30 pages 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.310
 Read instructions how to use the loo 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.030
 normal normal is it logical and grabs 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.010
 Pour 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.720
 this is not so easy apparently 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.640
 it looks like and I have it too 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.810
 whether the station hanau maybe 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.760
 a twitter account has on this 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.530
 surfaces but you can not have the mv 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.269
 but perhaps still has the rmv 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.120
 a little bit seen money slot day 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.610
 here bag on the 15th 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.170
 Ok, de facto, it is already quite big 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.120
 There is no refund 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.500
 also cool the use so shameless 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.239
 that people are pushing people 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.660
 if they are right there, there is 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.480
 I did not throw in any money 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.280
 nothing happens nothing no idea door goes 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.019
 not on I thought maybe one 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.450
 photocell the nastiest total before 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.950
 nothing happens to the door shit man 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.780
 I have to go up and down now 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.980
 a small screen on it 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.650
 have been on the small screen 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.120
 Look what do you think is on it 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.459
 voting 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.560
 the covered the shit has bled 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.200
 after I have thrown the money purely 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.690
 butting or running down countdown 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.880
 10,918 and he starts all over again 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.060
 to the people who fuck you right up 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.930
 this cup place before that nothing happened 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.470
 all of a sudden, the money is back 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.299
 fell out again money 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.910
 chucked then again in 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.530
 picture and then at least it went on so 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.079
 who invents these tracks 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.890
 I did not know if I thought 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.239
 backpack in there throwing out thinking okay 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.850
 it is not clean but clean enough 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.980
 day on the toilet and in the moment 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.930
 I noticed 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.030
 shit man there is a big one 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.979
 group is a clause in a blog 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.590
 big klopapier olaf is not a klopapier 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:29.570
 that's it's the dirtiest one 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.270
 fucking shit what I ever 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.419
 seen from Hanover so if any 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.969
 somebody just does it 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.229
 is responsible in hanau here 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.179
 somehow to see if anyone knows 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.729
 then always flames i have never been like this 

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:45.109
 a casting seen that there is yes 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.179
 really there is frankfurt 

00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:49.219
 main station the absolute luxury the 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:52.009
 last scuttled train station is 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:56.089
 absolutely luxury against this exploding there 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.549
 a hanau at least stated it 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:00.349
 Do not hang a loo paper because you can now 

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:00.679
 Do not go down here that works 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.409
 Not 

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:04.489
 that does not work okay okay we say 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.279
 now have their shadow until then 

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:08.689
 Do you think about what you do I have 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:13.129
 looked so stupid has noticed. look 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.869
 there is an emergency button and I have me 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.849
 then you think, sir, you press now 

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:18.649
 just the emergency button and saks people 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.059
 if you do not bring klopapier then 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:23.989
 I shit you in the middle of the house 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:25.519
 pure and I have already thought 

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:29.989
 I should not just take my shirt 

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:34.219
 or the stallion in the corner 

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:35.269
 throw then what are you doing am 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.469
 I am fortunate enough to have that 

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.299
 glorious idea come 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.949
 I still have a pack pace 

00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:42.019
 handkerchiefs in backpack that went then 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.139
 but also people it is not normal 

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:46.779
 this thing who thinks so 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.399
 tracks and very apathetic 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.769
 Now I have great fun here again 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.899
 story is decorated with you so is 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:55.069
 by the way, youtube does one right now 

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:58.279
 thing occurs to me just so on the edge 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.719
 one has absolutely nothing at all 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.069
 So you can of course at the time 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.360
 Watch a ritual if you 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.599
 looking for cheap pc play 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.919
 his 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.099
 I have that all right now 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.289
 forgot to say something else 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.039
 do you know this games the things 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.389
 but do not translate 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.209
 standard compliant somehow I have that 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.409
 microphone bit job is just me 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:22.610
 for example, they noticed 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:25.159
 all serious in all serious the final 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.969
 Fantasy 14 online have the experience 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:31.849
 So what really every one really 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.269
 game with experience translates into 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.329
 German 

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:36.979
 Translated with routine and you sit then 

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:40.099
 first there and somehow you think 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.110
 your routine has gone up yes and 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.989
 continue until you always check it out 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.550
 is expo that you just understand 

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:47.100
 I mean other things quite funny 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.200
 about that though 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.610
 that's just how you can do it 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.110
 theoretically already in several ways 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.000
 translate but there is just such a 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.830
 such an unwritten law as that 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.600
 because everybody translates 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.070
 imagine the right one underneath and 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.200
 accordingly translated experience 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.730
 also with not with routine but with 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.000
 or with coffee and 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.740
 There are several examples of cake for 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.780
 hottest I still find when she 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.180
 translated into your face in halo 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.480
 and gears in front of your face in your 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.580
 facebook 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.600
 so i know i know that drifts 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.170
 that is already a direct one 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.550
 translation but somehow you have 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.810
 you really seriously 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.040
 outside because it's so English 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:29.250
 hearty in your face 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.530
 because guy ritchie on his mouth or something 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.650
 what did not say if yes 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.280
 no matter how we look at our face, 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.380
 the job is over 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.790
 You can have a look at hook experience on 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.520
 hanauer klo report was already there 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.410
 has been or might in other 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.490
 maybe there is worse 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.910
 it can not give me the best sake 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.990
 but that was real one 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.520
 I do not have to do that again 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.050
 do 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.500
 It was good to finish 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.500
 next shot
