create<00:01:53.810> chairs<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.440> exhibits

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
create chairs and exhibits

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.800 
create chairs and exhibits
plus<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:55.640> added<00:01:55.790> some<00:01:56.120> of<00:01:56.150> what<00:01:56.420> I've<00:01:56.540> learned

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
plus I added some of what I've learned

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
to designing origami toys what was

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.440 
to designing origami toys what was
needed<00:02:00.170> was<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.470> bar<00:02:00.830> table<00:02:01.550> with<00:02:01.880> integrated

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
needed was a bar table with integrated

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.570 
needed was a bar table with integrated
stools<00:02:02.840> they<00:02:03.500> could<00:02:03.710> fold<00:02:04.040> out<00:02:04.250> when<00:02:04.460> you

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
stools they could fold out when you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.760 
stools they could fold out when you
needed<00:02:04.880> them<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.330> could<00:02:05.720> easily<00:02:05.960> be<00:02:06.320> put<00:02:06.530> away

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
needed them and could easily be put away

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.109 
needed them and could easily be put away
when<00:02:07.040> you<00:02:07.160> were<00:02:07.310> done

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
when you were done

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.969 
when you were done
this<00:02:08.360> approach<00:02:08.720> offered<00:02:09.229> many<00:02:09.560> advantages
