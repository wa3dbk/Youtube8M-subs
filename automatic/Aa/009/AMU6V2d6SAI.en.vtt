00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 this tutorial let's see how to make it 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.220
 a tile with a central flower a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.220
 relief 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.900
 we need to believe them 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.040
 four different colors to work with 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.040
 crochet number 3 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.430
 let's start with the pistil 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.430
 take the thread and make 4 chains 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.739
 back in the first and we finished the 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.900
 first round 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.360
 Now let's do the second tour, let's go 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.699
 in the middle and make a low shirt 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.730
 let's go back to the center and do another 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:53.440
 low knit and keep it up to 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.440
 get 9 fouls and low 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.970
 the ninth is over 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:15.280
 we close the loop we love the thread we pull 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.280
 crochet and we finished the pistil 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.940
 let's start with the petals we insert 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.820
 crochet in one of the low loops 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.070
 of the pistil and make a chain e 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.340
 then another 3 chains 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 skip 2 low sweaters and slip in 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.240
 crochet 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.530
 let's cut it in half and leave again 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.800
 with 3 chains 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.450
 skip 2 low meshes 3 thread 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.460
 in the next 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.310
 we make a half shirt and then we do 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.700
 another 3 chains we are forming 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.700
 arches 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.100
 let 's start the second round then there 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.970
 we slip under the 3 chains and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.350
 let's do a low shirt first then a 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.810
 half high knit 2 high and then high knits 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.360
 we have to go back down because the petal is 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.610
 a semicircle then we do one again 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.640
 half high knit is a low knit 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.530
 so we put ourselves in the 3 chains 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.370
 subsequent and do the same again 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.380
 thing 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.840
 then low knit half high jersey 2 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.050
 high sweaters we go down with the half 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.790
 high jersey is a low jersey and so 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.790
 also for the last 3 chains 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.489
 estimated the third theta we close it 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.489
 this second round with a half shirt 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.000
 third round we do 3 chains let's go 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.330
 on the back of the petal we meet e 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.970
 we hook on to the high half knit that 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.760
 we find immediately and we do a half 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.280
 knit then 3 chains we go into the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.239
 next half high knit 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.550
 we make a half shirt and 3 chains 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.610
 next half high knit we do 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.340
 a half mesh 3 chains let's go 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:21.340
 in the next this high and e shirt 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.340
 we do a half shirt and 3 chains 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.170
 then we go to the next half 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.610
 high jersey 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.739
 we do the half-knit and 3 chains and 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.170
 we arrived in the last half-shirt 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.690
 high where we slip in and we have 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.470
 finished the third round so we have 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.970
 got six bows composed of 3 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.970
 chains each 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.500
 let's start the port ride that like the 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:57.159
 according to which we make the knit petal 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.079
 just half a high knit 2 high links 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.590
 a half low knit is a sweater 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:06.859
 low and then you think of another petal then 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.470
 to the next 3 chains and then yes 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:13.430
 a half jersey starts again 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:18.229
 high jersey 2 half high jerseys 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.600
 high jersey is a low jersey then 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.620
 let's move on to the next 3 chains 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:29.120
 so but the half high knit approaches 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:33.590
 2 high tops, half high knit and knit 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.349
 low so it continues for all 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.479
 3 chain arts that have remained e 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.940
 then we build the semicircles that 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.930
 forman italy as we had done in 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.930
 second round 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.550
 the end of the fourth round and then 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.550
 close it with half a shirt 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.470
 now we're going to do six more petals 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.990
 exactly below those we already have 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.090
 done 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.580
 we do 3 chains and we thread the 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.400
 behind between two petals first two that 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.440
 meetings amount to the end knit paste 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.330
 of one is the lowered mesh start 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.710
 of the other we make a shit and knit 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.720
 then 3 chains 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.980
 let's go to the conjunction of the others 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.340
 two petals for which half monica and then 3 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.340
 chains 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.400
 we slip between the two successive half 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.400
 shirt and 3 chains 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.599
 here we are at the end of the tour e 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.330
 so we have to start the sixth 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.159
 we have 3 chains that form an arc 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.360
 so we make them the semicircle for 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.729
 will form the petal 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.849
 and so we will have to do for all six 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.120
 marks as we have already done in the fourth 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.120
 round 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.580
 no 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.410
 we also believe the sixth round with the 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.410
