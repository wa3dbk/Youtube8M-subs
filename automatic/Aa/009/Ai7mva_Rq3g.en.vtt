 theater as is the music theater the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.910
 an orchestra of a big band

 interpreting great songs and good 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.320

 in the metropolitan theater two winners 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.930
 of the most important realities in a 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.550
 television to years of having won them 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.399
 I wonder if they feel or have felt 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.539
 wasted because they did not get the 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.539
 prize or why not 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.410
 are all this 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.940
 you have to love a lot this profession 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.330
 this race you have to have a lot of desire 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.550
 to do what you do to love what 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.400
 you do 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.960
 a prize or not a prize is not going to do 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.780
 let her stop singing 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 yes you can not do that while god does not 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.670
 allow it and for this life I'm going to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.909
 keep singing where you can and he said 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.290
 at some point you felt 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.870
 rejected waste 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.570
 Well, I think you look at both of us 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.330
 we come from two single musical realities 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.830
 most important in mexico we are both 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.320
 winners of two of the most realities 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.180
 important in mexico but I think that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 we are also winners of these 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.720
 projects we are winners of life 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.510
 because you are career this race is a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.490
 career that is not only about talent 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.979
 but of many reinforcements of much 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.330
 hard work and 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.130
 Fortunately, well, they are already 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.930
 a few years now better but that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270
 we have within this medium in which 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 we want to continue and then while we are 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.410
 keep giving the opportunity and above all 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.160
 that the public continue to give us their love 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.759
 and your support 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.410
 what happens in Mexico we see in others 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.600
 countries that do support them 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.030
 Dialysis winners here in mexico 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.980
 suddenly we see that two are here 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.390
 made us feel to the companies that is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.150
 what really happens so that you 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.709
 that have the great voices do not blunt 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.250
 as in other countries go through the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.050
 winners 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.720
 Well, I think we would be winners 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.300
 all if that continuity were given 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.550
 I think high talent is important 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.740
 nothing else is needed to support it and give it 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.819
 continuity I believe that talent does not 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.310
 have to 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.989
 has to give support has to be given 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.389
 in the back on all the space 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.599
 so that we can reach the public 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:48.760
 you are really the means of 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.459
 communication are super important are 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.530
 our contact with people and then 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.319
 I think the talent should be from 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.299
 support assess and thus give you the 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.159
 opportunity your relationship but where 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.780
 relationship with about that instant 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.489
 because we do not see companions of them 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.169
 covering this event one and the other 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.310
 side then there are other partners as I go 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.370
 to go with the majority that you are doing 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.400
 the same ones look at the invitation 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.090
 extends to power the truth is that the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.090
 distance 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.450
 in the case of us it is not
