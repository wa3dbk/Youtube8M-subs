material I'm winding my thread back to
where<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:52.550> think<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.940> hackle<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.360> going<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.600> end

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
where I think the hackle is going to end

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.190 
where I think the hackle is going to end
now<00:02:54.620> again<00:02:55.070> I'm<00:02:55.670> starting<00:02:56.209> this<00:02:56.390> as<00:02:56.750> far

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
now again I'm starting this as far

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.320 
now again I'm starting this as far
forward<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.950> can<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.430> by<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.640> way<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:58.850> did<00:02:59.180> do

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
forward as I can and by the way I did do

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.190 
forward as I can and by the way I did do
a<00:02:59.360> whip<00:02:59.630> finish<00:03:00.019> there<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:02.480> think<00:03:02.900> I've<00:03:03.019> put

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
a whip finish there and I think I've put

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.310 
a whip finish there and I think I've put
