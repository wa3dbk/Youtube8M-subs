00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.950
 he gets new halo film and dvd fan 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.580
 dvd ripper today job determines the way 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.310
 probably virtual massacre before is the first 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.470
 foreign production 2009 emerged 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.259
 and the title can be just the way to measure 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.480
 luggage phenomena karen especially the 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.339
 original stuff like to hold her too 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.830
 has a role due to his 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.539
 Icelandic roots are well 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.200
 offered and he fits well in the 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.390
 Familys 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.090
 in the movie thumb goes that a group 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.789
 colorful dice tourists to japan 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.219
 america germany and france has 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.610
 but make bulwark in the gate in Iceland 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.340
 want 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.969
 So whales out to sea 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.100
 tie 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.199
 I was the entrepreneur wants to look 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.899
 However, there is a bit in the 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.629
 trousers of this drunk franzose worries 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.760
 for more totally weirdly absurd accident around 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.579
 Short time later , I wore alone 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.860
 on the cutter there without sailor and also 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.870
 without captain so fortunately in fisherman in 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.790
 on so they can be rescued 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.130
 ship of projecting 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.900
 run-down whaler that should 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.540
 However, the current case turns out to be 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.520
 because the other two members and 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.040
 Have friends of mother and his brother 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.040
 an insane kohldampf on yes 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.680
 tourists and do not make any out 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.730
 and a short time later it starts 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.940
 big ones die 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.220
 and the title really fits too little 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.960
 is a nice place and the massacre 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.150
 not really done and I did 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.190
 ironically say and needed 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.979
 were perfect for me because of the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.450
 eu 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.040
 also in relation to the vaal drive up 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.450
 the situation and so on and so forth 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.450
 is almost incidentally mentioned and that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.479
 japanese for having on board will still 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.060
 times the tip of the iceberg so that 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.850
 really some good scenes where you look 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.130
 can either laugh dead or a child 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.330
 including the film is I have to 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.920
 then gorgeous politically and correctly and 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.909
 especially on this little one 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.759
 Horror movie 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.950
 especially since he also the bag the same thing 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.140
 not being here in the woods 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.560
 is cloaked noticed but also to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.760
 open lake rundown 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.090
 whaling ship and this petting that must 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.310
 I will say and refreshing 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.400
 handcrafted the film over the top 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.380
 The leaves are coming to you, too 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.000
 cost where at 3 to 14 just 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.980
 the violence is really printed too 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.470
 but want to protect but would be good 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.150
 distributed over the film and that I end 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.549
 would be really really nice bitter the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.769
 commitment of guarantors I have to then 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.980
 was also quite well defended the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.810
 Icelandic words and pastor at 53 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.940
 however, he does not bring much to the goal 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.940
 to say some of the actors 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.350
 act very bumbling times some 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.530
 topics and then a little stupid 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.120
 fancy your classic but that 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.430
 one does not have the five for that one 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.920
 really very well done and solid 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.390
 and you really can not do that anymore 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.739
 That's where you can get your money's worth 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.850
 because some moments with mountains 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.670
 surprisingly noticed 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.079
 Therefore, I give the film 7.5 out of 10 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.709
 Score that was really one 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.740
 Surprise and the dvd of teleport 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.410
 I also have to'll say good enough 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.940
 the solid comes in one really 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.310
 beautiful embossed and from slipcase the gentleman 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.100
 the classical artwork which of course 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.330
 shows what's up this waiting ash 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.560
 by graf and who not really because 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.410
 as a player four times on the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.480
 party ship extras are not much there 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.580
 gives a make -of so see comes 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.230
 however without German subtitles 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.100
 but not as bad as one goes 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.840
 quarter of an hour 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.580
 if you still have the trailer in English 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.650
 and German and before you get a dvd 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.890
 einlag comes still falls itself expire 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.430
 MÃ©trailler to other titles from the 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.840
 program of tele cures technical picture 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.230
 and ton are on a very good 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.820
 level 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.520
 a logical production one can 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.310
 really do not complain I have to say 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.680
 I can friends of horror films 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.140
 the but absolutely absurd humor and 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.570
 irony really stand this movie 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.100
 while annoyed while he succeeded 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.030
 i was very surprised i did so 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.520
 not not much expected yet one 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.460
 Recommendation worth in any case this 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.600
 whale watching marica of course I am 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.580
 sometimes a trick 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.110
 in the comments whether he is the main 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.270
 We already know this movie 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.830
