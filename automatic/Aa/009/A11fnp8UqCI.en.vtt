being savior and any time beating cal
and<00:00:14.670> any<00:00:15.240> time<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.630> white<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> men

and any time in white I have the men
clock<00:00:16.740> position<00:00:16.890> Cal<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.640> yellow<00:00:18.240> at<00:00:18.750> the

theory<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.300> looks<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.539> any<00:00:21.689> time<00:00:21.869> supporting

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
theory it looks like any time supporting

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.660 
theory it looks like any time supporting
the<00:00:22.680> white<00:00:22.830> again<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.369> he<00:00:23.430> was<00:00:23.519> victorious

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
last time so maybe he once again be

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.759 
last time so maybe he once again be
victorious<00:00:27.050> honestly<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.260> straight<00:00:28.680> on

usually<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.740> want<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.189> try<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
usually what they want to do is try to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
usually what they want to do is try to
stay<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.970> base<00:01:33.270> ahead<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> think<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
stay one base ahead but I think in the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.410 
stay one base ahead but I think in the
early<00:01:34.320> game<00:01:34.770> leaning<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.729> until<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
early game leaning up until about the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.850 
early game leaning up until about the
mid<00:01:36.540> game<00:01:36.689> mid<00:01:36.930> game<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.320> big<00:01:37.500> difference

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
mid game mid game it's a big difference

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.890 
mid game mid game it's a big difference
when<00:01:38.040> Terran<00:01:38.490> has<00:01:38.909> an<00:01:39.299> equivalent<00:01:39.780> mount

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
when Terran has an equivalent mount

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
when Terran has an equivalent mount
bases<00:01:40.290> mid<00:01:40.500> game<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.009> they're<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.310> pumping

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
bases mid game and they're just pumping

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.249 
bases mid game and they're just pumping
from<00:01:41.820> factories<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.509> disastrous<00:01:42.840> for

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
from factories it's disastrous for

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.810 
from factories it's disastrous for
potage<00:01:43.590> players<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.610> your<00:01:44.729> ending

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
potage players because then your ending

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.580 
potage players because then your ending
facing<00:01:45.390> kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.630> an<00:01:45.750> enormous<00:01:46.320> amount<00:01:46.560> of

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
basically tanks and it's just too much

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.849 
basically tanks and it's just too much
for<00:01:51.420> Protoss<00:01:51.689> players<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.049> handle<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.799> i

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
for Protoss players to handle but i

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.800 
for Protoss players to handle but i
think<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.130> early<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> mid<00:01:54.420> game<00:01:54.539> while<00:01:54.689> you're

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
think the early to mid game while you're

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.209 
think the early to mid game while you're
only<00:01:54.960> dealing<00:01:55.140> with<00:01:55.319> a<00:01:55.439> couple<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.799> factories

only dealing with a couple of factories
the<00:01:57.000> two<00:01:57.179> expansions<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:58.259> basically<00:01:58.710> more

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the two expansions is basically more

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.380 
the two expansions is basically more
powerful<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.399> protoss<00:01:59.640> people<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.210> debate

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
powerful for protoss people can debate

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.959 
powerful for protoss people can debate

an interesting blockade instead of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.880 
an interesting blockade instead of
putting<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.700> barracks<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.299> front

putting that barracks up to the front
he's<00:02:31.890> body<00:02:32.160> kind<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.670> staggered<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.209> back<00:02:33.450> and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
he's body kind of staggered it back and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.740 
he's body kind of staggered it back and
built<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.349> supply<00:02:35.040> depot<00:02:35.069> along<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.299> edge<00:02:36.450> and

built a supply depot along the edge and

built a supply depot along the edge and
that's<00:02:37.170> an<00:02:37.530> odd<00:02:37.799> formation<00:02:38.099> that<00:02:38.400> looks<00:02:38.459> like

that's an odd formation that looks like

that's an odd formation that looks like

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
straight south disk out as soon as he

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.159 
straight south disk out as soon as he
hits<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.150> choke<00:03:06.450> he's<00:03:06.630> probably<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.989> turn

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
hits that choke he's probably in turn

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.539 
hits that choke he's probably in turn
around<00:03:07.410> looks<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.769> scout<00:03:08.069> just<00:03:08.280> waiting

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549

outside and wow any time might be up to
a<00:03:10.169> little<00:03:10.380> bit<00:03:10.500> cheesy<00:03:10.769> just<00:03:11.069> hanging<00:03:11.700> back

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
a little bit cheesy just hanging back

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.900 
a little bit cheesy just hanging back
with<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.269> probe<00:03:13.459> cybernetics<00:03:14.459> core<00:03:14.639> going

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
with that probe cybernetics core going

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.509 
with that probe cybernetics core going
up<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.209> any<00:03:15.329> time<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.720> meantime<00:03:16.519> he's

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
up for any time in the meantime he's

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.589 
up for any time in the meantime he's
kind<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.760> setting<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.209> though<00:03:18.269> he's<00:03:18.450> going

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
kind of setting up as though he's going

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.089 
kind of setting up as though he's going
to<00:03:18.660> block<00:03:18.780> his<00:03:18.959> front<00:03:19.169> door<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:19.470> not<00:03:19.680> really

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
to block his front door but not really

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.620 
to block his front door but not really
and<00:03:20.220> we'll<00:03:20.370> see<00:03:20.579> looks<00:03:21.389> like<00:03:21.480> that

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
and we'll see looks like that

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.909 
and we'll see looks like that
secondaries<00:03:22.109> up<00:03:22.230> for<00:03:22.410> him<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.709> he's<00:03:22.799> starting

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
secondaries up for him and he's starting

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.699 
secondaries up for him and he's starting
to<00:03:23.099> pushed<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.060> few<00:03:24.239> couple<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> few<00:03:25.230> probes<00:03:25.470> down

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
to pushed a few couple a few probes down

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.400 
to pushed a few couple a few probes down
there<00:03:26.010> still<00:03:26.579> hasn't<00:03:26.790> produced<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.299> zealot<00:03:27.569> so

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
there still hasn't produced a zealot so

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.360 
there still hasn't produced a zealot so
it<00:03:28.470> looks<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.650> he's<00:03:28.829> not<00:03:28.919> even<00:03:28.980> gonna<00:03:29.190> bother

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
it looks like he's not even gonna bother

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.559 
it looks like he's not even gonna bother
just<00:03:29.669> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.849> go<00:03:29.910> straight<00:03:29.940> for<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.329> right

see<00:04:00.440> ruby<00:04:01.440> has<00:04:01.470> gone<00:04:01.860> for<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.160> machine<00:04:02.340> shop

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
see ruby has gone for that machine shop

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.360 
see ruby has gone for that machine shop
and<00:04:03.330> has<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:03.930> now<00:04:04.110> started<00:04:04.560> as<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.680> cat<00:04:04.920> or<00:04:04.950> his

and has just now started as a cat or his

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.010 
and has just now started as a cat or his
command<00:04:06.090> center<00:04:06.360> he<00:04:06.450> looks<00:04:06.630> like<00:04:06.720> he<00:04:06.870> has

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
command center he looks like he has

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.230 
command center he looks like he has

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
base boy as any time went straight went

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.699 
base boy as any time went straight went
straight<00:04:12.030> into<00:04:12.209> taking<00:04:12.480> his<00:04:12.750> secondary<00:04:13.170> so

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
straight into taking his secondary so

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.860 
straight into taking his secondary so
he's<00:04:13.890> going<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.100> be<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> way<00:04:15.090> an<00:04:15.209> economically

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
he's going to be a way an economically

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.479 
he's going to be a way an economically
ahead<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:16.350> obviously<00:04:16.739> in<00:04:16.919> about<00:04:17.190> three

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
ahead and obviously in about three

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.699 
ahead and obviously in about three
minutes<00:04:17.700> after<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.209> get<00:04:19.079> your<00:04:19.169> gateways<00:04:19.530> down

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
minutes after you get your gateways down

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.170 
minutes after you get your gateways down
to<00:04:19.799> kind<00:04:19.890> of<00:04:19.980> match<00:04:20.160> production<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.790> equates

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
to kind of match production that equates

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.390 
to kind of match production that equates
into<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.419> production<00:04:21.630> advantage<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:23.130> we'll<00:04:23.250> see

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
into a production advantage so we'll see

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.070 
into a production advantage so we'll see
if<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.550> front<00:04:23.880> door<00:04:24.030> seal<00:04:24.330> plus<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.810> seats

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
if that front door seal plus that seats

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.409 
if that front door seal plus that seats
check<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.380> enough<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.770> protect<00:04:26.100> Ruby<00:04:26.430> against

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419

any times vary yeah honestly it was a
very<00:04:30.120> aggressive<00:04:30.540> build<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.200> going<00:04:31.710> for<00:04:31.830> that

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
very aggressive build I going for that

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.470 
very aggressive build I going for that
first<00:04:32.130> not<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:32.790> necessarily<00:04:33.300> very

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
first not not necessarily very

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.850 
first not not necessarily very
vulnerable<00:04:33.720> because<00:04:33.960> again<00:04:34.410> he<00:04:34.530> was<00:04:34.650> kind<00:04:34.800> of

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
vulnerable because again he was kind of

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.950 
vulnerable because again he was kind of
relying<00:04:35.130> on<00:04:35.340> Ruby<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.240> not<00:04:36.390> do<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.660> scout<00:04:36.870> and

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
relying on Ruby to not do the scout and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.180 
relying on Ruby to not do the scout and
I<00:04:37.050> was<00:04:37.140> very<00:04:37.260> clever<00:04:37.440> on<00:04:37.650> his<00:04:37.830> part<00:04:38.010> basically

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
I was very clever on his part basically

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.430 
I was very clever on his part basically
he<00:04:38.550> was<00:04:38.640> understanding<00:04:39.180> kind<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.140> the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
he was understanding kind of the the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.280 
he was understanding kind of the the
general<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:42.030> layout<00:04:42.419> of<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:42.660> map<00:04:42.900> he<00:04:43.110> knows

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
general the layout of this map he knows

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.260 
general the layout of this map he knows
that<00:04:43.470> Terran<00:04:43.800> tend<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.700> block<00:04:44.880> their<00:04:45.060> front

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
that Terran tend to block their front

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.909 
that Terran tend to block their front
doors<00:04:45.450> who<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.720> going<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.930> rely<00:04:46.200> on<00:04:46.229> Ruby<00:04:46.740> being

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
doors who is going to rely on Ruby being

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.230 
doors who is going to rely on Ruby being
passive<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.460> taking<00:04:47.790> that<00:04:47.910> natural

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
passive and taking that natural

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.180 
passive and taking that natural
expansion<00:04:48.450> he's<00:04:48.840> just<00:04:48.990> going<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.200> beat<00:04:49.890> him<00:04:50.010> to

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
expansion he's just going to beat him to

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.950 
expansion he's just going to beat him to
it<00:04:50.220> basically<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.790> single<00:04:51.390> vulture<00:04:51.630> pushing

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
it basically a single vulture pushing

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.659 
it basically a single vulture pushing
out<00:04:52.080> with<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.350> because<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:53.070> any<00:04:53.190> times<00:04:53.430> front

out with that because of any times front
door<00:04:53.910> though<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.120> don't<00:04:54.450> think<00:04:54.600> that's

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
door though I don't think that's

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.969 
door though I don't think that's
necessarily<00:04:55.260> going<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.530> be<00:04:55.680> all<00:04:55.860> that

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
necessarily going to be all that

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.050 
necessarily going to be all that
effective<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.490> looks<00:04:56.610> like<00:04:56.729> he's<00:04:56.880> going<00:04:57.000> to

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
effective it looks like he's going to

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.880 
effective it looks like he's going to
start<00:04:57.270> producing<00:04:57.450> mines<00:04:57.720> first<00:04:58.020> did<00:04:58.620> manage

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
start producing mines first did manage

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.010 
start producing mines first did manage
to<00:04:59.070> take<00:04:59.220> down<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.460> pro<00:04:59.820> but<00:05:00.120> really<00:05:00.390> deny

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
to take down that pro but really deny

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.870 
to take down that pro but really deny
any<00:05:01.229> sort<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.530> information<00:05:01.740> as<00:05:02.490> you<00:05:02.550> can<00:05:02.640> see<00:05:02.850> I

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
any sort of information as you can see I

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.190 
any sort of information as you can see I
don't<00:05:03.120> see<00:05:03.210> any<00:05:03.419> vultures<00:05:03.750> getting<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.080> that

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
don't see any vultures getting to that

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.830 
don't see any vultures getting to that
crack<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.680> looks<00:05:04.830> like<00:05:04.890> a<00:05:05.850> couple<00:05:06.690> mines

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
crack and it looks like a couple mines

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.570 
crack and it looks like a couple mines
going<00:05:07.020> down<00:05:07.200> for<00:05:07.380> Ruby<00:05:07.680> along<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.130> side<00:05:08.340> ramp

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
going down for Ruby along the side ramp

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.060 
going down for Ruby along the side ramp
that's<00:05:09.000> an<00:05:09.120> interesting<00:05:09.240> place<00:05:09.690> for<00:05:09.930> them<00:05:10.080> and

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
that's an interesting place for them and

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.860 
that's an interesting place for them and
one<00:05:11.490> I<00:05:12.000> guess<00:05:12.180> that's<00:05:12.360> just<00:05:12.419> for<00:05:12.660> scouting

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
one I guess that's just for scouting

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.200 
one I guess that's just for scouting
purposes<00:05:13.380> we'll<00:05:13.530> see<00:05:13.740> but<00:05:14.340> honestly<00:05:14.669> it

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
purposes we'll see but honestly it

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.270 
purposes we'll see but honestly it
should<00:05:15.390> be<00:05:15.510> just<00:05:15.540> momentarily<00:05:16.290> before<00:05:16.530> any

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
should be just momentarily before any

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.219 
should be just momentarily before any
time<00:05:17.520> can<00:05:17.669> basically<00:05:18.150> at<00:05:18.450> an<00:05:18.570> observatory<00:05:18.930> up

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
time can basically at an observatory up

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.590 
time can basically at an observatory up
I<00:05:19.380> wouldn't<00:05:19.560> be<00:05:19.680> surprised<00:05:20.040> if<00:05:20.700> that's<00:05:21.450> his

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
I wouldn't be surprised if that's his

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.710 
I wouldn't be surprised if that's his
next<00:05:21.720> building<00:05:22.160> I'm<00:05:23.160> sorry<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:23.720> basically

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
next building I'm sorry that basically

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.840 
next building I'm sorry that basically
yeah<00:05:25.080> if<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:25.620> would<00:05:25.770> be<00:05:25.890> his<00:05:26.130> get<00:05:26.820> the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
yeah if that would be his get the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.490 
yeah if that would be his get the
robotics<00:05:27.270> facility<00:05:27.390> and<00:05:28.050> then<00:05:28.229> the

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
robotics facility and then the

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.830 
robotics facility and then the
observatory<00:05:29.010> since<00:05:29.910> really<00:05:30.330> has<00:05:30.540> in<00:05:30.690> fact

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
observatory since really has in fact

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.380 
observatory since really has in fact
gone<00:05:31.200> vultures<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.310> mines<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.760> but<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.180> third

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
gone vultures of mines and but a third

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.820 
gone vultures of mines and but a third
gay<00:05:33.540> we<00:05:33.660> going<00:05:33.840> down<00:05:33.990> just<00:05:34.320> starting<00:05:34.560> produce

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.290 
gay we going down just starting produce
dragons<00:05:35.220> at<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.340> moment<00:05:35.669> maybe<00:05:35.970> he's<00:05:36.210> just

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
dragons at the moment maybe he's just

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.820 
dragons at the moment maybe he's just
going<00:05:36.479> to<00:05:36.570> rely<00:05:36.750> on<00:05:36.810> his<00:05:37.020> micromanagement<00:05:37.590> to

going to rely on his micromanagement to

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.200 
going to rely on his micromanagement to
get<00:05:37.950> past<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.310> mines<00:05:38.490> it<00:05:38.610> looks<00:05:38.790> like<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:38.940> third

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
get past the mines it looks like a third

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.030 
get past the mines it looks like a third
