they<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:37.710> definitely<00:00:38.129> some<00:00:38.460> breaks<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
they are definitely some breaks in the

in the fuselage but nothing nothing that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.060 
in the fuselage but nothing nothing that
would<00:00:42.420> indicate<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.170> has<00:00:43.350> broken<00:00:43.770> apart

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
would indicate that it has broken apart

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.150 
would indicate that it has broken apart
but<00:00:44.940> based<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.200> fact<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.770> did<00:00:46.950> over

on the air the runway and actually go

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
number of rocks and of course that may

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
number of rocks and of course that may
have<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.280> course<00:01:02.520> some<00:01:03.180> major<00:01:03.480> damage<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:03.989> the

have of course some major damage to the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.320 
have of course some major damage to the
aircraft<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.860> no<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.339> has<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.729> broken

completely<00:01:09.439> we<00:01:10.439> also<00:01:10.590> spoke<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:10.920> an

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
completely we also spoke with an

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
completely we also spoke with an
american<00:01:11.549> airlines<00:01:11.850> official<00:01:12.330> who<00:01:12.450> gave<00:01:12.630> us<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
american airlines official who gave us a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.570 
american airlines official who gave us a
very<00:01:12.840> similar<00:01:13.229> assessment<00:01:13.890> concerning<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
very similar assessment concerning the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.050 
very similar assessment concerning the
plane's<00:01:14.909> condition<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:16.640> believe<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
plane's condition I believe the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.700 
plane's condition I believe the
description<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.590> when

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
description that you know that when

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.590 
description that you know that when
people<00:01:19.890> say<00:01:20.159> broken<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.420> mean<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
people say broken up but that can mean a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
people say broken up but that can mean a
lot<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.869> different<00:01:22.350> things<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.400> there's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
lot of different things we know there's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.560 
lot of different things we know there's
damage<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> fuselage<00:01:25.220> but<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.369> us<00:01:26.820> broken

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
damage to the fuselage but to us broken

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
damage to the fuselage but to us broken
up<00:01:27.689> kind<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> conveys<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.680> thought<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
up kind of conveys the thought that it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.330 
up kind of conveys the thought that it
might<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:30.170> quite<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> distance<00:01:31.799> apart

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
might be quite a bit of distance apart

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.780 
might be quite a bit of distance apart
between

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
between

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
between
any<00:01:33.119> pieces<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.829> don't<00:01:35.009> believe<00:01:35.130> that's

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
any pieces and we don't believe that's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
any pieces and we don't believe that's
the<00:01:35.700> case<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.329> certainly<00:01:36.479> know<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.110> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the case we certainly know there is

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.690 
the case we certainly know there is
damage<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.829> fuselage<00:01:39.140> one<00:01:40.140> engine<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
damage to the fuselage one engine on the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.300 
damage to the fuselage one engine on the
right<00:01:41.880> side<00:01:42.150> came<00:01:42.540> off<00:01:42.780> after<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.560> had<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
right side came off after it was had to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.359 
right side came off after it was had to
had<00:01:44.549> gotten<00:01:44.970> past<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> runway<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
had gotten past the runway and

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
had gotten past the runway and
ultimately<00:01:47.369> stopped<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:48.570> landing<00:01:49.140> gear

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
ultimately stopped with one landing gear

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.340 
ultimately stopped with one landing gear
on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.979> left-hand<00:01:50.640> side<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.899> main<00:01:52.079> the

on the left-hand side of the main the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.560 
on the left-hand side of the main the
main<00:01:52.380> gear<00:01:52.799> had<00:01:53.130> collapsed<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> left<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
main gear had collapsed on the left so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300 
main gear had collapsed on the left so
all<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.229> fairly<00:01:55.470> consistent<00:01:55.770> with

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
all of that is fairly consistent with

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.550 
all of that is fairly consistent with
the<00:01:56.520> engine

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
the engine
