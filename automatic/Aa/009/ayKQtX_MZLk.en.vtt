00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
simple mitered corner and so this is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.800 
simple mitered corner and so this is
specifically<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.519> miters<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.269> aren't<00:00:24.570> right

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
specifically on miters that aren't right

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.490 
specifically on miters that aren't right
angles

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
angles

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.589 
angles
so<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:26.010> I've<00:00:26.189> cut<00:00:26.519> something<00:00:26.970> I've<00:00:27.090> even<00:00:27.390> put

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
so here I've cut something I've even put

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.570 
so here I've cut something I've even put
a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.869> curve<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> very

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
a little curve in and this is a very

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.889 
a little curve in and this is a very
soft<00:00:29.910> knit<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.730> would<00:00:32.730> press<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.300> hems<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
soft knit so I would press my hems in

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:49.729 
soft knit so I would press my hems in
you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:36.590> press<00:00:38.030> press<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.270> hem<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.440> it's

you can get press press the hem and it's
flat<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.980> then<00:00:55.980> oh<00:00:56.250> these<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.760> curved<00:00:57.030> too

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
flat and then oh these are curved too

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.670 
flat and then oh these are curved too
and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.710> iced<00:00:59.309> nip<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.059> small<00:01:00.420> snip<00:01:00.809> right

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and then I iced nip a small snip right

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.859 
and then I iced nip a small snip right
where<00:01:02.250> those<00:01:02.579> come<00:01:03.480> together<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
where those come together and so now I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.160 
where those come together and so now I
have<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.380> notches<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.720> I<00:01:09.720> put<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.260> pin

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
have two little notches and I put a pin

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.520 
have two little notches and I put a pin
exactly<00:01:14.060> at<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.509> end<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.909> take<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.780> look

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
notches and I take right sides together

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.950 
notches and I take right sides together
and<00:01:58.610> line<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.880> notches<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> notches

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and line up the notches and the notches

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.859 
and line up the notches and the notches
are<00:02:01.469> pointing<00:02:02.369> toward<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> pin<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.570> that

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
are pointing toward the pin and that

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.530 
are pointing toward the pin and that
gives<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.439> your<00:02:04.469> line<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.189> stitching<00:02:05.729> come<00:02:06.390> in

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
smart so it's over another table then

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.339 
smart so it's over another table then
you<00:03:28.199> could<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:28.889> you<00:03:29.129> wanted<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.900> could<00:03:31.109> do

you could if you wanted to you could do

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.530 
you could if you wanted to you could do
this<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.799> would<00:03:32.069> help<00:03:32.280> but<00:03:32.549> not<00:03:32.729> be<00:03:32.909> quite<00:03:33.239> so

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
this it would help but not be quite so

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.770 
this it would help but not be quite so
scary<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:36.260> even<00:03:37.260> though<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.949> the<00:03:38.540> sides<00:03:39.540> and
