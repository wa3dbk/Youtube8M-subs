00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello people my name is jan oncology 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.009
 called 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.390
 and as you can see, I mean today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.099
 you in blackops gameplay on the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.719
 background it is not really something 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.639
 special I play know your knife on the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.160
 mat stage of the ex to me 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 did you get it from place or i think 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.369
 really a super chill him and bit 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.630
 with that, of course, is always fun 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.480
 I'm called by ticking the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.160
 coded franc 555 and if i have the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 get what i really get a tax 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 find annoying thing as flushing through 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.080
 because it turns yellow four or five times 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.460
 by that franc 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.630
 so I have to continue flushing 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.759
 is just a good game can good 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.130
 final score and of course I will be first 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.110
 so 10 euros bet or ten coupons 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.270
 betting between is also not very good 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.040
 people and all the good people that sit too 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.469
 on a different call of duty because morpher 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.530
 3 out is only today I want it 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.760
 have two about blackops because know 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.440
 your knife will of course come back and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.600
 black on cities 2 vols but everyone wants 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.460
 before I got this game Fluffy 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.500
 comical sharp city game place to be one 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.750
 normal blackops I'm not sure yet 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.390
 whether the weather with money is going to be black 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.340
 or two I liked the idea of the place as 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 one I really liked super I liked 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.540
 that you reached a certain level then 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 had to earn money to get to the water 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.070
 and only then with the weapon could 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 play now you have 3 tomorrow 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.140
 you walk around your level you get up 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.759
 nothing further if you have a medicine that you 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.530
 you get xp but you don't get any further 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.420
 really something special 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.979
 to level up on blackops and up 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.390
 lured him alone and you had to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.640
 once have the money to use the weapon 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.310
 found and play with that idea found 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.990
 i new it was fun it was fun before 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.189
 on black us but a look at 2 I think 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.500
 that it is not so nice anymore because it 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.150
 nist again old-fashioned and sometimes it was already 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.189
 annoying sometimes get some le 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.509
 before you just don't have enough money to 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.240
 buying weapons is that was sometimes 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.070
 irritating think you can arm book patient 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.970
 I only have ten head you can now 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.229
 do not buy 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.149
 That was our only I can do it 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.710
 I also liked the idea for that 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.110
 a call of duty I hope it 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.000
 a place like two comes it will in itself 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.070
 on the one hand nice in my 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.290
 hands on the other hand really annoying 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.670
 but we will see that again 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.500
 be it, it will come again of course 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.600
 back in black the two of us I think it's real 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.579
 super fun fact you play with him 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.020
 is just when you don't feel like it anymore 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.530
 if you just don't feel like it anymore 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.390
 multiplay because sometimes to multiplay then 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.190
 pretty frustrated and you don't have any 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.530
 serious 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.900
 that yesterday I also had no call of duty 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.340
 mombarg 3 player and after a while 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.890
 i was so grumpy that i just got mine 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.860
 had finished the game in one go and 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.360
 because your knife knows if you are silly 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.710
 becomes or something here I am going to be whole 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.060
 often kill that svend 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.100
 I therefore really flushed it 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.550
 stupid ballistec girls because i had it 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.200
 thing really 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.090
 here i have a new stuff that 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.500
 the python only have that thing that and 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.570
 reload is please then you must buy it 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.510
 put it in separately it is quite one then 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.610
 also and moles but was sure I have 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.060
 again am subject matter front that is 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.190
 very nice to do but i'm playing 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.020
 a bullbar sadness and yes to drink 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.120
 locks play just a force it up 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.320
 blackops you'll sometimes it than 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.180
 just get frustrated 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.380
 for example because you and quenches 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.700
 third beds 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.410
 Only then can you just switch 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.420
 towards being with you put your team god angry 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.710
 is what does not matter if you do 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.840
 that in sitting you lose further 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.980
 nothing with it or they a thousand in that is also possible 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.360
 yet 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.880
 and then you can just play normally 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.010
 people ran with your coal friends 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.390
 and then you don't have to moan like 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.970
 you die and that doesn't matter at all 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.680
 I really like them from that idea 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.970
 made it into it 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.040
 I hope one took off in black 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.390
 new game modes come out because now in the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.570
 of course you have normal blackops 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.430
 sharpshooter housing chamber whatever you like 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.610
 tomorrow three 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.170
 what else do you have game and the 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.690
 The last one here has all your sticks and stones 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.730
 x and set was kind super nice if you 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.170
 if you feel annoyed or something 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.000
 like that you just go sticks and 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.920
 make stones then you have all those people 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.959
 just tomahawk goes and then they go like that 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.970
 you drove fast that is just too much fun 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.160
 if you get frustrated here sometime 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.280
 feels lack or just grab sticks and 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.450
 stones they go Tommen had run and then 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.790
 You just have to disagree about your 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.620
 hear this microphone that is so real 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.269
 just a fun and then I jump 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.239
 again in the multiplayer you have something again 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.780
 but yes I just hope they get in 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.489
 blackops two are going to go really well 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.070
 think about how they can do it well 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.110
 make for new burg 3 the game 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.620
 of course not really quite as she had 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.970
 the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.260
 she always had it in November 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.060
 cast every call of duty comes 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.980
 of course in November but sometimes it is 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.600
 that deadline is just too fast and they can 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.979
 it doesn't work out well you have that too 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.660
 with call of duty edition that is 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.190
 of course new this year 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.750
 only that just doesn't work for us 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.130
 well i think it's best 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.510
 a pity as it is just the time 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.550
 had not taken it to the 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.170
 released and was pieces according to me 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.290
 I think it works better now 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.910
 good on the computer sometimes log on one 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.950
 low point call or duty point com work 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.870
 of course not always good because 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.700
 sometimes it flip him a little silly too 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.200
 playstation on your mobile 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.310
 he does it good to me but I 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.320
 daimler are looking like him again 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.510
 I could go on for a long time 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.040
 walk through place or two but give one 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.900
