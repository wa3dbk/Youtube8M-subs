00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.880 
just it is it just like food from heaven
because<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.400> both<00:01:38.579> filling<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.320> not<00:01:40.320> quite

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890

because it is both filling and not quite
super<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:42.570> nutritious<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.530> can't<00:01:43.920> venture<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
super not nutritious I can't venture to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.210 
super not nutritious I can't venture to
say<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> nutritious<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
say that it is nutritious because I the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.620 
say that it is nutritious because I the
broccoli<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.970> probably<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.390> even

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
broccoli and it is probably not even

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.710 
broccoli and it is probably not even
more<00:01:48.780> broccoli<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:51.030> such<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> quick

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
more broccoli but it's it's such a quick

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.660 
more broccoli but it's it's such a quick
meal<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.380> easy<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> only<00:01:53.280> way<00:01:53.430> that

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
meal it's so easy in the only way that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.800 
meal it's so easy in the only way that
you<00:01:53.729> could<00:01:53.850> possibly<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.420> tuna<00:01:54.630> helper

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you could possibly make tuna helper

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.480 
you could possibly make tuna helper
better<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.649> they<00:01:55.770> made<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> microwave

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
better is if they made a microwave

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
better is if they made a microwave
