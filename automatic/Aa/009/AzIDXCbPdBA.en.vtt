the battlefield 4 map that got shown at

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.930 
the battlefield 4 map that got shown at
I<00:02:58.390> think<00:02:58.660> it's<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> Chinese<00:02:59.260> map<00:02:59.560> at<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.700> e3

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
I think it's the Chinese map at the e3

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.720 
I think it's the Chinese map at the e3
