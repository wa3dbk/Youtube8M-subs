00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
it is about it I guess I thought going

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.720 
it is about it I guess I thought going
into<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.530> was<00:02:18.620> going<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.800> be<00:02:19.010> more

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
into this that it was going to be more

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.880 
into this that it was going to be more
of<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.910> stunt<00:02:20.300> team<00:02:20.450> type<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.870> bike<00:02:21.020> but<00:02:21.740> it's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
of a stunt team type of bike but it's

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.780 
of a stunt team type of bike but it's
actually<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.430> more<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
actually not it's more of like a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.630 
actually not it's more of like a
cruising<00:02:23.209> bike<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.810> speed<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:25.340> know<00:02:25.430> isn't

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
cruising bike the speed you know isn't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.580 
cruising bike the speed you know isn't
the<00:02:25.850> greatest<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.570> some<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.140> stuff<00:02:27.380> you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
the greatest and some of the stuff you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
the greatest and some of the stuff you
can<00:02:27.620> put<00:02:27.890> on<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> doesn't<00:02:28.580> look<00:02:28.850> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
can put on it like it doesn't look the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.090 
can put on it like it doesn't look the
greatest<00:02:29.390> either<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.840> like<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.470> can<00:02:30.590> put<00:02:30.830> bags

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100

on it um you can put different things on
the<00:02:34.459> side<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.050> think<00:02:36.320> it's<00:02:36.470> something<00:02:36.770> with

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
the side but I think it's something with

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.340 
the side but I think it's something with
the<00:02:37.190> front<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.760> just<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.239> just<00:02:38.300> it's<00:02:38.750> too<00:02:38.840> big

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
the front it just it just it's too big

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.340 
the front it just it just it's too big
of<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.650> bike<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.100> think<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.820> me<00:02:40.850> personally<00:02:41.350> uh

that this unless you want a cruising
bike<00:02:53.390> yes<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.530> should<00:02:54.739> just<00:02:54.860> pass<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.400> because

for seventy five thousand dollars i

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.050 
for seventy five thousand dollars i

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
think no I may be wrong this but I think

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.720 
think no I may be wrong this but I think
the<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.380> Akuma<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.160> only<00:03:01.280> like<00:03:01.459> thirty

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
the the Akuma is only like thirty

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.850 
the the Akuma is only like thirty
thousand<00:03:02.180> dollars<00:03:02.420> or<00:03:02.570> something<00:03:02.900> or<00:03:03.050> one<00:03:03.830> of

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
thousand dollars or something or one of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.310 
thousand dollars or something or one of
the<00:03:04.040> bikes<00:03:04.190> are<00:03:04.400> only<00:03:04.550> like<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.090> much<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.110> I

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
the bikes are only like that much so I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.259 
the bikes are only like that much so I

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
would definitely go with one of the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.789 
would definitely go with one of the
cheaper<00:03:08.660> bikes<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.110> will<00:03:09.590> definitely
