maybe<00:02:11.110> three<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.470> these<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.650> day<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:12.850> these<00:02:13.000> are

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
maybe three of these a day so these are

the<00:02:13.180> ones<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.570> recommend<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.410> people

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
the ones that I recommend for people

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.880 
the ones that I recommend for people
just<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:15.310> know<00:02:15.400> basics<00:02:15.940> trying<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.830> get<00:02:17.830> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
just you know basics trying to get a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.170 
just you know basics trying to get a
little<00:02:18.130> bit<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.280> lean<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.700> leaves<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.060> little

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
little bit of lean that leaves a little

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.470 
little bit of lean that leaves a little
bit<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.540> weight<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:22.000> going<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> be

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
bit of weight and this is going to be

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.280 
bit of weight and this is going to be
doubling<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.470> size<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.010> next
