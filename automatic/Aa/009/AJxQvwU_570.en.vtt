00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
that is that I'm noticing what looks

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.780 
that is that I'm noticing what looks
like<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.319> medical<00:03:47.530> monitor<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.430> look<00:03:48.609> at<00:03:48.730> how

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
like a medical monitor and look at how

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.479 
like a medical monitor and look at how
slowly<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.599> erratic<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.319> heartbeat<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.829> the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
slowly and erratic the heartbeat is the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.750 
slowly and erratic the heartbeat is the
heartbeat<00:03:51.819> is<00:03:52.000> literally<00:03:52.329> one<00:03:53.139> two<00:03:53.639> it's<00:03:54.639> very

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
heartbeat is literally one two it's very

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.490 
heartbeat is literally one two it's very
very<00:03:55.209> erratic<00:03:55.629> and<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.840> looks<00:03:55.989> as<00:03:56.109> though<00:03:56.139> the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
very erratic and it looks as though the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.229 
very erratic and it looks as though the
the<00:03:56.859> heartbeat<00:03:57.190> being<00:03:57.400> as<00:03:57.489> Radek<00:03:57.790> as<00:03:57.879> it<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.090> is

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
the heartbeat being as Radek as it is is

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.869 
the heartbeat being as Radek as it is is
only<00:03:58.419> about<00:03:59.069> mmm<00:04:00.069> from<00:04:00.280> counting<00:04:00.609> that<00:04:00.699> it

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
only about mmm from counting that it

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.009 
only about mmm from counting that it
looks<00:04:01.000> like<00:04:01.120> it's<00:04:01.629> about<00:04:01.870> 30<00:04:02.199> a<00:04:02.290> minute<00:04:02.919> or<00:04:03.040> so

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
looks like it's about 30 a minute or so

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.390 
looks like it's about 30 a minute or so
