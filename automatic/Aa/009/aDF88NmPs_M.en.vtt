00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.700
 creatine is one of the most popular dietary supplements among 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.990
 practitioners in a study done two years ago, uribe had already 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.269
 finished product effectiveness 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.599
 for reducing body fat and increasing muscle 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 now researchers have found that creatine is also useful for athletes 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.210
 elite 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.340
 I practice basically aerobic sports 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.300
 the mantle united on this subject now talk accounts by the wheel 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.210
 researcher of the leader in bolívar bolivia and bahia 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.040
 and why nothing so intimate so low 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.710
 we did not choose this mode in the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 difficulty that is the modality itself 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.130
 the athlete has demonstrated is that he has several physical qualities 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.230
 being that the proof of him is going through obstacles 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.620
 large distances on uneven ground so he is a complete athlete 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.070
 let's say like this 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.380
 now and no one who leaves who is creative in the neighborhood help neighborhood 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.360
 athlete to develop - with Mayoress creatine as you well put a 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.980
 report about the increase in muscle mass 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.280
 force 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.970
 is the motto goes that it can benefit because creatine is a renewal right? 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.130
 and when we ingest it stay focused on the muscle and it joins one with the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 phosphate 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.220
 that generates energy that is immediate and an athlete here ishida to cross obstacles 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.040
 at all times he could benefit from our research which showed that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.330
 really there was benefit comparing the group claims the group that used crack 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.160
 China had an average increase of 20% of tolerance the spurs reduced fatigue in 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.770
 7% so I'm very surprised since the searches are all on the patio 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.960
 cyan of force 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.970
 and it was not necessary was already obsessed tornado secret features already 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.130
 on the island nor what will be the relationship of unilever with anvisa because we do not 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.700
 we try to use these little angels and creatine is in love with the national agency of 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.080
 sanitary surveillance 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.490
 and how do they get lighted relation to the network did a survey found the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.740
 benefit as it was perfect for what alice the situation is possible 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.090
 of people without the health ministry people with restrictions 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.650
 first by the research that is developed in the list of brasília 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.170
 submitted to the ethics committee 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.960
 analyze if there is a projection is that we can put with a 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.589
 voluntary 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.340
 been recently published the study 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.449
 last year 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:25.769
 black showing the 25 years of creatine use and in those 25 years only had two 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.269
 problem reports 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.809
 and these two reports are linked to patients with renal problems 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.189
 so actually the anvisa question I believe she should be worried 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.719
 with the control of the marketing of supplements once 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.609
 question is that he learns something tells me that the concern for agility 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:44.329
 performance 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.919
 only the United States and moves 3 million dollars a year with the 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.389
 supplement market 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.819
 then I believe them to be concerned about marketing and 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.709
 guidance once here 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.230
 that the very vows the use of creatine 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.230
 where referring to areas that are not necessary little 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.159
 Thank you, delegate adriana shirley.
