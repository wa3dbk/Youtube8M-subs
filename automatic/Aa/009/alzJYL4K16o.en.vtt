00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
here and I do another filtering system

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.980 
here and I do another filtering system
just<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.940> case<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> nugget<00:01:06.510> slips<00:01:06.750> through

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
just in case the nugget slips through

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.020 
just in case the nugget slips through
and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.800> water<00:01:08.010> pumps<00:01:08.370> right<00:01:08.580> back<00:01:08.790> up

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and then the water pumps right back up

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.420 
and then the water pumps right back up
through<00:01:09.870> there

in and in this case since I can't shake

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.510 
in and in this case since I can't shake
it<00:02:07.900> down<00:02:08.170> very<00:02:08.440> well<00:02:08.740> keep<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.010> material

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
it down very well keep the material

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.460 
it down very well keep the material
material<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> little<00:02:10.570> wet<00:02:10.899> I'm<00:02:11.200> going<00:02:11.410> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
material is a little wet I'm going to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.260 
material is a little wet I'm going to
help<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.860> with<00:02:11.890> some<00:02:12.190> with<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.000> hose

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.830 

okay<00:02:19.110> now<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.740> see<00:02:19.980> all<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:21.060> smaller

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
okay now as you can see all the smaller

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.290 
okay now as you can see all the smaller
materials<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:23.250> half<00:02:23.490> an<00:02:23.610> inch<00:02:23.760> fell<00:02:24.090> into

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
materials then half an inch fell into

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.390 
materials then half an inch fell into
this<00:02:24.540> screen<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.620> material<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.190> as<00:02:26.280> you

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
this screen so this material and as you

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.250 
this screen so this material and as you
can<00:02:26.520> see<00:02:26.700> there's<00:02:26.940> some<00:02:27.090> real<00:02:27.690> big<00:02:27.870> pieces<00:02:28.110> of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
can see there's some real big pieces of

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.840 
can see there's some real big pieces of
quartz<00:02:28.620> here<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> take<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> look<00:02:29.670> at

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
quartz here and I want to take a look at

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.270 
quartz here and I want to take a look at
each<00:02:30.210> one<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.570> these<00:02:30.780> because<00:02:31.280> they're

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
each one of these because they're

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.370 
each one of these because they're
definitely<00:02:32.640> might<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.940> some<00:02:33.210> some<00:02:33.870> gold<00:02:34.110> beans

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
definitely might be some some gold beans

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380 
definitely might be some some gold beans
in<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:34.830> I'm<00:02:34.920> going<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.190> dump<00:02:35.370> these<00:02:35.610> into

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
in this so I'm going to dump these into

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.930 
in this so I'm going to dump these into
a<00:02:36.540> separate<00:02:36.990> bucket<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.430> look<00:02:38.670> at<00:02:38.790> I'll

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
a separate bucket and I look at I'll

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.790 
a separate bucket and I look at I'll
look<00:02:39.120> at<00:02:39.210> all<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.480> stuff<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.840> little<00:02:40.560> bit

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
look at all of that stuff a little bit

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.460 
look at all of that stuff a little bit
later<00:02:41.180> okay<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.210> get<00:02:42.420> those<00:02:42.840> cleaned<00:02:43.170> out<00:02:43.290> real

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
later okay I get those cleaned out real

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.770 
later okay I get those cleaned out real
well<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.160> then<00:02:44.370> my<00:02:44.490> second<00:02:44.910> screen<00:02:45.210> right

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
well and then my second screen right

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.180 
well and then my second screen right
here<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.260> now<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.620> water<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.550> just

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.220 

do<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.220> right<00:02:53.550> there<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.360> -<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:54.990> you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
do that right there and I - and as you

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.370 
do that right there and I - and as you
can<00:02:55.380> see<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:57.420> by<00:02:57.740> poops<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:59.180> lost<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.630> saw<00:03:01.350> a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
can see just by poops I lost it I saw a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.320 
can see just by poops I lost it I saw a
small<00:03:01.680> piece<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.920> quartz<00:03:02.340> with<00:03:02.550> with<00:03:02.940> gold<00:03:03.210> on

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
small piece of quartz with with gold on

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.910 
small piece of quartz with with gold on
it<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.780> I'm<00:03:03.900> going<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.080> keep<00:03:04.320> all<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.620> these

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
it so I'm going to keep all of these

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.990 
it so I'm going to keep all of these
pieces<00:03:05.190> as<00:03:05.490> well<00:03:06.050> -<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.560> where<00:03:08.490> barrel<00:03:08.850> that

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
pieces as well - a a where barrel that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.400 
pieces as well - a a where barrel that
I'm<00:03:09.090> going<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.300> run<00:03:09.450> through<00:03:09.630> my<00:03:09.660> sluice<00:03:10.020> box<00:03:10.290> a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
I'm going to run through my sluice box a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.780 
I'm going to run through my sluice box a
little<00:03:10.560> bit<00:03:10.680> later<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.460> I'm<00:03:11.580> going<00:03:11.730> to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
little bit later so I'm going to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.330 
little bit later so I'm going to
continue<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.360> process<00:03:12.690> until<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.890> bucket

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
continue this process until this bucket

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.040 
continue this process until this bucket
is<00:03:14.460> filled<00:03:14.820> with<00:03:15.180> material<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.870> goes

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
is filled with material that goes

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.950 
is filled with material that goes
through<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.440> quarter<00:03:16.740> inch<00:03:16.920> screen<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.000> then

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
through the quarter inch screen and then

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.660 
through the quarter inch screen and then
once<00:03:19.230> that's<00:03:19.440> once<00:03:19.950> these<00:03:20.160> buckets<00:03:20.490> are

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
once that's once these buckets are

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.100 
once that's once these buckets are
filled<00:03:20.880> we're<00:03:21.390> going<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.570> run<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.870> through<00:03:21.900> our

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
filled we're going to run it through our

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.990 
filled we're going to run it through our
sluice<00:03:22.440> box<00:03:22.710> because<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.580> smaller<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
sluice box because the smaller the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.420 
sluice box because the smaller the
material<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.530> easier<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> go

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
material you have the easier it is to go

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:52.140 
material you have the easier it is to go
through<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.670> sluice<00:03:26.910> box

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.000 

okay<00:03:52.930> we<00:03:53.170> run<00:03:53.470> one<00:03:54.069> full<00:03:54.340> bucket<00:03:55.830> through<00:03:56.830> the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
okay we run one full bucket through the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.729 
okay we run one full bucket through the
sluice<00:03:57.459> now<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.849> only<00:03:58.409> drawback<00:03:59.409> of<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
sluice now the only drawback of a

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.190 
sluice now the only drawback of a
recirculating<00:04:00.489> sluice<00:04:00.970> rather<00:04:01.690> than<00:04:01.959> doing

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
recirculating sluice rather than doing

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.470 
recirculating sluice rather than doing
something<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.890> creek<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:04.090> fact<00:04:04.330> that

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
something in a creek is the fact that

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.020 
something in a creek is the fact that
you<00:04:04.690> got<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.989> dirty<00:04:05.200> water<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.909> when<00:04:06.909> you've

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
you got the dirty water and when you've

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.539 
you got the dirty water and when you've
got<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.330> dirty<00:04:07.540> water<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:08.170> can't<00:04:08.440> see<00:04:08.799> the

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
got the dirty water you can't see the

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.149 
got the dirty water you can't see the
gold<00:04:09.849> on<00:04:10.120> your<00:04:10.269> mat<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:11.379> don't<00:04:11.409> know<00:04:11.769> how

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
gold on your mat so you don't know how

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.640 
gold on your mat so you don't know how
well<00:04:12.400> you're<00:04:12.579> doing<00:04:12.610> or<00:04:13.150> anything<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:14.140> that's

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
well you're doing or anything so that's

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.500 
well you're doing or anything so that's
probably<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.280> only<00:04:15.519> one<00:04:15.819> drawback<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.419> I'm

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
probably the only one drawback so I'm

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.270 
probably the only one drawback so I'm
going<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.720> do<00:04:16.780> one<00:04:16.989> more<00:04:17.199> bucket<00:04:17.440> which<00:04:18.070> means

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
going to do one more bucket which means

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.090 
going to do one more bucket which means
we'll<00:04:18.459> have<00:04:18.639> two<00:04:18.940> two<00:04:19.810> buckets<00:04:20.229> used<00:04:20.530> thus<00:04:20.859> far

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
we'll have two two buckets used thus far

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.310 
we'll have two two buckets used thus far
and<00:04:21.370> then<00:04:22.300> we're<00:04:22.419> going<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.630> do<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.780> clean<00:04:23.110> up
