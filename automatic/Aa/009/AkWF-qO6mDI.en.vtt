00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello dear subscribers of my channel 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.040
 today we will again parse the song 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.620
 as you can see on the guitar which I call 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.219
 which I call you like 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.920
 the war 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.199
 as always today will be the first part 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.400
 which I will talk about how 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 play fight how to play music next 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.939
 lesson in the second part will be about 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.439
 how to still buy under this music and so 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:34.050
 let's start of course collecting this song all 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.260
 plays itself but there are two kinds of battle first 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260
 view 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:52.269
 but I'm a low-end simpleton 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.269
 another kind of battle you are so 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.500
 these two fights 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.200
 quite different and so 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.170
 Now the first battle is the first battle is easier and I 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.920
 I advise for beginners to play on you 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.630
 as in war 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:28.340
 By this fight, what do you imagine? 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.880
 this fight is played with your thumb 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.580
 and wire all the strings 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.810
 index finger spend rub instead 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.450
 then indicate on the base of spending on all 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:47.149
 strings up and mute with all fingers 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.979
 on the strings, that is, here on these strings 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:02:06.649
 by if managed to pass from by last 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:02:08.690
 no two so train and then how 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:15.400
 inside you just on one chord 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.400
 something like they put the card and 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.830
 let's say just faster faster and then 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.830
 already trying to change 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:33.920
 in this song chords once chords on 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:40.450
 one chord we play two times the board 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.450
 Look here well and ray 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.340
 who switch and so all the chords here 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.200
 everywhere here it is two times 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.019
 there is also writing which bout uses 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.909
 once 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:02.909
 for example in a song I donâ€™t remember exactly 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.909
 last 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.000
 that is, there is played of God 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.510
 once and in this song I'm on you as on 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.960
 the war 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.470
 play two times again consider 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.470
 this fight 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:53.510
 no lower bout 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.360
 play faster slower from the sea motive 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.790
 songs and speed see if the songs 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.360
 play fast I kicked you alone 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.520
 is played 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.520
 not fast enough - game hour 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:49.180
 I played the chorus and the old fight he 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:54.539
 played so down then i come myself to 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.539
 this post immediately down too then 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:17.800
 have a mute up and down down and with 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.050
 i don't 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:34.060
 I eat only train it turns out 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:35.950
 so this fight is a little more difficult with 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.740
 him play that is you notice that she 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.770
 there are mistakes because of this fight 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.510
 sometimes you like in the compartment but of course 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.720
 you need to bring everything to the mechanism so that 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:50.350
 This is the choice clearly and the song is then 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:55.020
 will be with another fight let's come 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.020
 some video is already lasting longer 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.210
 Occult he put it like this 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.740
 accord I speak alternately that is how 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.070
 they will i sing the whole of what the court will be 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.070
 or d 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.520
 cucumbers 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.650
 so will 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.030
 chord e 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.710
 i kurt and motret 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:52.150
 first when you learned these chords you 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:07:00.880
 must quickly have them switch then 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:07:03.960
 there is just so fast switch a 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.250
 then play these chords fail i mean 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:27.000
 what more could like here with 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:31.780
 this or here with this when you finally 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.240
 learned this melody 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.820
 very well you passed this part wait 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:41.020
