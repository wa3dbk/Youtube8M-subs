all of the world is the crowd see we

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.690 
all of the world is the crowd see we
know<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.650> as<00:02:37.890> like<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.280> don't<00:02:38.489> like

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
this so we tried to invented something

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.330 
this so we tried to invented something
better<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.959> find<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.319> solution<00:02:43.769> our

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
better and we find the solution our

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.110 
better and we find the solution our
crotch<00:02:44.850> part<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.600> made<00:02:46.319> in<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:47.340> one<00:02:47.550> piece<00:02:47.880> of

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.660 
the fabric from back to front
without<00:02:50.550> proxy<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:52.130> because<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.430> we

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
without proxy and because of this we

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.300 
without proxy and because of this we
avoid<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.480> most<00:02:54.780> sensitive<00:02:55.200> part<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.130> dry
