Satsuki and her mother ravio get in this
massive<00:01:46.799> hot<00:01:47.009> tub<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> lack<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> better

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
massive hot tub and for a lack of better

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
massive hot tub and for a lack of better
term<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.770> essentially<00:01:50.159> fondle<00:01:50.820> each<00:01:50.939> other

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
term they essentially fondle each other

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
term they essentially fondle each other
and<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:52.170> sort<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> uncomfortable<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.399> first

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and it's sort of uncomfortable at first

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
and it's sort of uncomfortable at first
but<00:01:54.180> I'm<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.509> gonna<00:01:54.659> lie<00:01:54.899> by<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.229> time<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
but I'm not gonna lie by the time the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.440 
but I'm not gonna lie by the time the
scene<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.189> done<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.670> felt<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.420> really

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
scene was done I felt like I really

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.260 
scene was done I felt like I really
needed<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.649> cold<00:01:58.890> shower<00:01:59.189> hot<00:01:59.939> steamy

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
needed a cold shower hot steamy

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
needed a cold shower hot steamy
fanservice<00:02:00.869> aside<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.799> actually<00:02:02.130> an

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
fanservice aside this is actually an

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.649 
fanservice aside this is actually an
important<00:02:02.640> scene<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:03.119> apparently<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
important scene because apparently the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.240 
important scene because apparently the
stuff<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> they're<00:02:04.170> bathing<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.979> going

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
stuff that they're bathing in is going

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.920 
stuff that they're bathing in is going
to<00:02:05.340> give<00:02:05.460> them<00:02:05.579> much<00:02:05.969> more<00:02:06.119> affinity<00:02:06.600> with

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to give them much more affinity with

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
to give them much more affinity with
life<00:02:07.140> fibers<00:02:07.409> thus<00:02:08.220> they'll<00:02:08.429> become<00:02:08.550> more

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
life fibers thus they'll become more

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.880 
life fibers thus they'll become more
powerful<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.599> right<00:02:10.349> after<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.709> were

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
powerful and right after this were

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.890 
powerful and right after this were
introduced<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> secret<00:02:12.060> room<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
introduced to the secret room that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.289 
introduced to the secret room that
he<00:02:13.019> has<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.409> like<00:02:13.560> giant<00:02:14.220> massive<00:02:14.610> ball<00:02:15.120> of

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
he has this like giant massive ball of

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.080 
he has this like giant massive ball of
yarn<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.379> the<00:02:16.560> original<00:02:17.090> life

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
yarn in it and this is the original life

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.460 
yarn in it and this is the original life
fiber<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.629> this<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> where<00:02:18.989> we<00:02:19.110> start<00:02:19.379> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
fiber and this is where we start to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.220 
fiber and this is where we start to
learn<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.010> life<00:02:20.190> fibers<00:02:20.640> are<00:02:20.879> actually

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
learn that the life fibers are actually

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.690 
learn that the life fibers are actually
aliens<00:02:22.230> they're<00:02:22.519> extraterrestrials<00:02:23.519> that

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
aliens they're extraterrestrials that

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.550 
aliens they're extraterrestrials that
came<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.150> earth<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.659> they're<00:02:25.140> actually

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
came to earth and they're actually

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.949 
came to earth and they're actually
responsible<00:02:26.280> for<00:02:26.459> forcing<00:02:27.180> mankind<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
responsible for forcing mankind to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.680 
responsible for forcing mankind to
evolve<00:02:28.349> that's<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.459> lot<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.970> take<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.540> this

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
evolve that's a lot to take in in this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.990 
evolve that's a lot to take in in this
episode<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.799> they<00:02:31.950> managed<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.340> explain<00:02:32.790> it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
episode but they managed to explain it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.690 
episode but they managed to explain it
in<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.209> way<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.140> essentially<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:35.280> life

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
in a way so that essentially the life

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.520 
in a way so that essentially the life
fiber<00:02:36.000> clothing<00:02:36.629> is<00:02:36.840> sort<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.349> a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
fiber clothing is sort of like a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.130 
fiber clothing is sort of like a
parasitic<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.400> life<00:02:38.670> form<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.209> can't<00:02:39.840> live

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
parasitic like life form it can't live

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.080 
parasitic like life form it can't live
on<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.409> inside<00:02:40.829> of<00:02:41.010> people<00:02:41.280> but<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.549> can<00:02:41.700> take

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
on the inside of people but it can take

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.520 
on the inside of people but it can take
over<00:02:42.269> them<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.720> wears<00:02:42.900> them<00:02:43.079> like<00:02:43.260> clothes

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
over them if it wears them like clothes

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.750 
over them if it wears them like clothes
hence<00:02:43.860> why<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.250> start<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.579> look<00:02:44.700> like

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
hence why they start to look like

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.640 
hence why they start to look like
clothes<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.390> apparently<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.530> what

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
clothes and apparently this is what

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.860 
clothes and apparently this is what
ravio<00:02:47.010> has<00:02:47.190> been<00:02:47.310> trying<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:47.640> do<00:02:47.940> over<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
ravio has been trying to do over the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.589 
ravio has been trying to do over the
course<00:02:49.079> of<00:02:49.319> time<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:50.190> calm<00:02:50.640> we<00:02:50.819> existed<00:02:51.359> and

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
course of time the calm we existed and

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.089 
course of time the calm we existed and
then<00:02:51.720> they<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.019> sort<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.230> disappeared<00:02:52.859> and

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
then they just sort of disappeared and

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.550 
then they just sort of disappeared and
rockeo<00:02:53.760> found<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.390> original<00:02:54.780> life<00:02:54.959> fiber<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
rockeo found the original life fiber and

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.710 
rockeo found the original life fiber and
she's<00:02:56.220> been<00:02:56.609> making<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.090> clothing<00:02:57.420> line<00:02:57.569> for

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
she's been making this clothing line for

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.119 
she's been making this clothing line for
the<00:02:57.989> last<00:02:58.109> like<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.379> couple<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.739> years<00:02:58.890> which

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
the last like a couple of years which

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.619 
the last like a couple of years which
has<00:02:59.250> become<00:02:59.370> really<00:02:59.700> popular<00:02:59.819> over<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> world

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629
