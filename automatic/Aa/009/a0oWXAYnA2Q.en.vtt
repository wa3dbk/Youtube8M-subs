00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.019
 Michoacán 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.019
 the soul of mexico 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.310
 the monarch butterfly is a two-centimeter insect with only half a gram 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.179
 of weight 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.980
 despite appearing so fragile 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.750
 the monarch butterfly flew more than 100 kilometers a day from Canada and 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.199
 united states to fulfill your winter appointment in our country 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.560
 through more than four thousand kilometers 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.080
 went through cold and rainy, dry and warm environments and endured some 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.080
 storms in the north before arriving this temperate region 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.770
 today is here with us like every year 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.320
 faithful to his hibernation house to find the forests that left the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040
 last year its predecessors 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.649
 every year millions of monarch butterflies 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.220
 come to spend the winter the highest mountains that divides the states of 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.010
 Michoacán and Mexico 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.070
 after two months of crossing 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.950
 They arrive by groups to settle in the high places right where they are 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.320
 the forests of oyamel 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.869
 you do not know how many 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.520
 but it is estimated that this region can reach more than 150 million 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.290
 you know that you are in the largest sanctuary of the monarch butterfly that exists 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.360
 on this planet 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.440
 Here you will see one of the most extraordinary natural spectacles in the world 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.469
 for the people of this region 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.540
 the monarch butterfly is part of their culture 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.000
 His arrival during the first days of November is related to the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.140
 Day of the Dead festivities 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.610
 According to the Purepecha beliefs, butterflies were the soul of children 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.080
 dead that returned to their land 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.640
 for the inhabitants of the region the monarch is part of their own identity 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.590
 it's a relationship that nature set to express the splendor of 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.280
 life 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.290
 the butterflies have to go through several inconveniences in the time lapse in 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.369
 that were absent after reproduction in the months of February and 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:02.960
 March 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.670
 the butterflies returned to the north on their return trip the monarch butterflies 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.650
 they leave in their wake millions of eggs the places where they put their 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.730
 eggs are related to the distribution of the only plant that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.259
 used for this purpose 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.919
 the cotton if I guash you ask 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.959
 the already fertilized female examines the plants carefully and through 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.810
 of the smell 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.959
 find the one that can feed your progeny there they have the most leaf 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.119
 tender and deposit a new one on the underside of it 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.809
 this does it again and again in different plants up to four hundred 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:35.699
 times 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.699
 with this vital that their offspring compete with each other 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.540
 after seven days a larva comes out that will first feed on the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.360
 same shell as contained 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.100
 and then eat the leaf that served as shelter and protection 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.520
 feed on the cotton leaves if I in addition to providing food 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.290
 necessary 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.480
 and it was one of the most important defenses since this plant is 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.629
 poisonous is poisonous 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.629
 these substances protect the monarch from predators 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.790
 when the larva matures 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.560
 it is more than four centimeters long and has a background color 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.740
 white with thin stripes of black and yellow orange color will now be dedicated to 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.940
 eat all the time 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.900
 because it is no longer worried about hiding its coloration indicates that it is poisonous and 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.299
 unpleasant taste for predators 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.329
 his stage as long as it lasts about three weeks until he reaches his 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.550
 maximum growth after I look for a branch to hang on 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.909
 to be your chrysalis cocoon 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.549
 shortly before I left it the sector heals us but it is already observed in its 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.149
 interior the classic orange color of the wings of the monarch 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.400
 after two weeks of apparent inactivity 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.220
 comes one of the most amazing moments the cocoon breaks and emerges 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.220
 with its wrinkled and wet wings the monarch butterfly 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.339
 then extend your wings and let some minutes pass, you are ready to 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:54.829
 his first flight 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.859
 all this happens in a period of between five and seven weeks approximately 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.559
 and it repeats 2 o3b ces 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:06.859
 until in August and September are born the butterflies that will make the long journey 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.679
 to our country how it is possible for a butterfly to return to the same place without 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.229
 he has never been there 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.569
 how it is oriented to recognize the place where three generations ago and 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:22.430
 bernardo his predecessors because he chooses his sites in the forest all these are 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.379
 unanswered questions that encompasses the mystery of the migratory cycle of 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:27.800
 monarch butterfly 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.409
 For its survival the monarch requires a search for those that 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.809
 provide the ideal temperature and humidity conditions 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:38.909
 get to this place to spend the winter in a state of semi-stress 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.639
 it feeds very occasionally and the energy what they have from the fat that 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.639
 they accumulated during their autumnal feeding period 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.180
 at present 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.620
 more than 50% of the forests in the region have been lost 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.199
 That is why the local farmers join in the effort that the government of the 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.190
 state of michoacán in coordination with the federal government perform to 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:15.089
 preserve the home of the monarch butterfly 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:17.620
 the sanctuary the rosary welcomes you 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.650
 we ask your help to preserve the hibernation sites of the butterfly 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.110
 monarch 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.000
 Follow the directions you will find on your route and the ones that remain 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.240
 days 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.130
 remember 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.030
 that any excessive activity of the monarch butterfly is to spend the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.760
 energy you need to reproduce and for your return to canada and states 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.639
 United 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.820
 the behavior inside a sanctuary should be like when you visit your museum by 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.729
 what we ask you not to make the butterflies fly unnecessarily 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.039
 cell phone do not make noise in the colonies and do not use the flash or your 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:52.759
 camera 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.550
 do not leave the trails do not take butterflies 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.080
 If you remove the area, you will be contributing to your children and grandchildren 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.199
 continue enjoying one of the 10 natural wonders of the world 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:07.330
