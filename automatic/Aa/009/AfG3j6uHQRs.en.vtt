00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.819
 brewing company I met 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.309

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.840
 chief brewer Moscow brewery 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.840
 companies Mikhail ruff 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.939
 the very first ingredient to create 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.910
 beer is solo 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.529
 it is first necessary to grind on 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.170
 special crushers here we are laying 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.720
 returned robbed him here is the cooking 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.659
 installation which stands here on 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.390
 Moscow brewery company here we are 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.110
 we fall asleep our crushed malt for 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.269
 in order to 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.269
 adding water to start fearing the conditional 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.090
 It smells very appetizing smell of wort 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.090
 smells like something sweet 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.560
 from the water samper ground malt at 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.490
 a certain temperature we got 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.380
 Wort further it on special pipes 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.780
 so you stuck out perry swayed everywhere 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.970
 now filtered here through your 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 own living through the husks and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.860
 this is not the same filtering that we 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.840
 we mean when talking about 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 filtered beer and unfiltered 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.700
 beer i'm first because 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.580
 unfiltered beer is piwo 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 which is filtered from residues 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.360
 yeast on the table and a dozen look 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.860
 japanese and czech and just not 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.869
 very fresh hop smell with nothing 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.429
 compare those intimate just take in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.619
 Basically, see, I used a banil 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.460
 then gave up pepper and try 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.770
 do rose on citrus tones 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.810
 I will say that it is a little bit to me of course 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.649
 raise from the original concept to me 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.100
 wanted saw more aggressive god yes 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.020
 it is also the so-called odor 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.790
 feline so yes he also smell it 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.550
 supervisor can any of you have friends 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.940
 card nodes that tag out the essence of sneakers 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.470
 then you probably are fans 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.020
 offers or type 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.550
 but i like i like him that is 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.000
 he can work along with this 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.550
 you get a vanilla smell and everything 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.980
 these hops that we have now selected 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.200
 they give of course fucking aggression too 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.420
 there is something ass but i don't know what's there 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.180
 will happen with this vanilla probably on 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.800
 the record is you give so aggression but we 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.650
 Weak to do the implementation of someone 100 I do not need 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.269
 knew 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.239
 what miniature is shown 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.299
 the amount of gel is required in order to 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.819
 brew almost 100 liters of beer and yet 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.870
 speak mile drink or there for example 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.959
 got drunk 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.689
 But in fact, invented hops 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.150
 add to beer first as the strongest 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.069
 natural natural preservative 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.409
 and then it turned out that he was already there 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.409
 it smells cool and gives a clear taste 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:17.139
 hops will boil with beer 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.870
 Exactly an hour in half an hour we will ask 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.950
 secondary hop and still under the most 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.709
 end of cooking to heighten the flavor we go there 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.170
 same give with the final final stranded 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:35.500
 after which this is the beer we cool it 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.739
 poured into the chunk exercise will 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.599
 added yeast and after a long three 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.889
 four maybe five weeks 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:49.680
 beer property wanders mature and we 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.680
