 hello everyone I'm videogames 3 and they 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.390
 I bring a dead fighting saga that is 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.389
 but hey here's the second part of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.719
 500 curiosities of pokemon here we will say 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.700
 another 60 let's start there are two girls that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.859
 I have confused with estranged men 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.740
 jiangling and curiously the two have 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.810
 in love with ace there is no attack of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.539
 psychic type of hardness contest type 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.400
 and plows always keeps his mouth 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.710
 open while in the game pokémon 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.840
 snap when using the hydro bomb attack on the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.180
 penultimate world closes its mouth and then 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.790
 launches the attack in which it never 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.770
 closes the latest evolution of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.719
 pokemon that are obtained at the beginning of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.340
 the infernal adventure on pole on it 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.140
 tacky eliminates the advantages and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
 disadvantages that it has over the others 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.440
 because they acquire a kind 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.480
 secondary that gives them an advantage or 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.390
 resistance on the type to which before 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.190
 they were disadvantaged telescope has 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.739
 an error in its description in pokémon 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.840
 pearl and platinum diamond since it mentions 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.750
 that increases the critical hit rate 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.820
 but the only thing that increases the accuracy 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.650
 in pokémon gold silver and crystal if 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.720

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.580
 hill and bud microphone could be opened and 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.640

 they are very similar to the point of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.700
 seem to be one the evolution of the other 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.560

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.159
