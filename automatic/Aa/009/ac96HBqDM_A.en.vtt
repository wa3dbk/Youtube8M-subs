00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
very difficult but I knew that in the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.370 
very difficult but I knew that in the
inner<00:02:19.240> race<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.540> could<00:02:19.720> make<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> difference

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
inner race it could make a difference

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.620 
inner race it could make a difference
and<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.680> did<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:22.090> first<00:02:22.270> two<00:02:22.480> laps

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
and it did and the first two laps

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.089 
and it did and the first two laps
weren't<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.110> great<00:02:23.260> on<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.560> barriers<00:02:23.890> but

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
weren't that great on the barriers but
