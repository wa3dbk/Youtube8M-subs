speaker air I'm a speaker in the ear

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.420 
speaker air I'm a speaker in the ear
which<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.540> just<00:03:27.439> it's<00:03:27.769> better<00:03:27.949> for<00:03:28.129> your<00:03:28.220> ear

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
and it's better for music quality

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.509 
and it's better for music quality
because<00:03:30.199> it<00:03:30.290> has<00:03:30.409> distance<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:31.010> get<00:03:31.129> your<00:03:31.340> ear

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
