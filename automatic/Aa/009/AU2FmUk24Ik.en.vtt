got<00:01:48.420> two<00:01:48.539> pistols<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.319> stores<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.859> here

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
got two pistols one which stores up here

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.190 
got two pistols one which stores up here
in<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.189> trailer<00:01:50.399> hitch<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> other<00:01:52.020> ones

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
in the trailer hitch and the other ones

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.630 
in the trailer hitch and the other ones
stores<00:01:52.469> there's<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> couple<00:01:52.920> tabs<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.399> between

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
stores there's a couple tabs in between

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
stores there's a couple tabs in between
the<00:01:53.729> legs<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.210> store<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.509> under<00:01:54.810> here

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the legs so you can store it under here

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.190 
the legs so you can store it under here
I<00:01:55.229> would<00:01:55.770> probably<00:01:56.659> just<00:01:57.659> personal<00:01:58.020> choice

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
I would probably just personal choice

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.510 
I would probably just personal choice
since<00:01:58.350> these<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.770> combine<00:01:59.069> with<00:01:59.249> the<00:01:59.340> gun

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
since these can combine with the gun

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.059 
since these can combine with the gun
just<00:02:00.179> store<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.630> underneath<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
just store the one underneath and the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.980 
just store the one underneath and the
other<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.609> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.729> box<00:02:02.990> especially

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
other one up here in the box especially

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
other one up here in the box especially
since<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.439> can't<00:02:04.710> keep<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.069> just<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.579> keep

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
since I can't keep it just I keep

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.550 
since I can't keep it just I keep
popping<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.479> loose<00:02:08.240> but<00:02:09.240> but<00:02:09.630> yeah<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.810> store

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
popping on loose but but yeah you store

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.280 
popping on loose but but yeah you store
both<00:02:10.710> of<00:02:10.800> his<00:02:10.920> guns<00:02:11.130> on<00:02:11.280> him<00:02:11.930> go<00:02:12.930> ahead<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.200> pop

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
both of his guns on him go ahead and pop

both of his guns on him go ahead and pop
that<00:02:13.470> off

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599

I'm<00:02:14.689> just<00:02:14.840> go<00:02:14.930> ahead<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.140> pop<00:02:15.200> them<00:02:15.349> both<00:02:15.469> off

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
I'm just go ahead and pop them both off

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.130 
I'm just go ahead and pop them both off
since<00:02:17.689> we're<00:02:17.810> there

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
since we're there

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.569 
since we're there
so<00:02:18.560> yeah<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.889> crank<00:02:19.099> it's<00:02:19.219> tax<00:02:19.400> mode

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
so yeah it's the crank it's tax mode

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.949 
so yeah it's the crank it's tax mode
have<00:02:19.939> you<00:02:20.060> seen<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.299> transformation<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
have you seen the transformation you

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.649 
have you seen the transformation you
know<00:02:20.989> what<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.409> expect<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:22.510> aside<00:02:23.510> from

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
know what to expect it's aside from

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.569 
know what to expect it's aside from
colors<00:02:23.989> it's<00:02:24.170> not<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.409> huge<00:02:24.980> difference<00:02:25.159> so

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
colors it's not a huge difference so

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.979 
colors it's not a huge difference so
we'll<00:02:25.730> get<00:02:25.849> right<00:02:25.969> to<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.180> let<00:02:26.780> me<00:02:26.810> go<00:02:26.930> ahead

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
we'll get right to it let me go ahead

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.360 
we'll get right to it let me go ahead
and<00:02:27.139> pop<00:02:27.260> these<00:02:27.469> off<00:02:27.530> right<00:02:27.950> here<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.219> back

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and pop these off right here the back

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.440 
and pop these off right here the back
you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.579> leave<00:02:28.730> them<00:02:28.879> on<00:02:28.969> the<00:02:29.120> back<00:02:29.269> if<00:02:29.420> we

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
you can leave them on the back if we

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.539 
you can leave them on the back if we
don't<00:02:29.659> want<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:30.889> you<00:02:31.010> don't<00:02:31.129> want<00:02:31.250> to

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
don't want to if you don't want to

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.190 
don't want to if you don't want to
combine<00:02:32.030> them<00:02:32.269> with<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.450> gun<00:02:32.689> or<00:02:32.900> put<00:02:33.019> them<00:02:33.139> on

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
combine them with the gun or put them on

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.970 
combine them with the gun or put them on
his<00:02:33.290> forearms<00:02:33.739> but<00:02:33.950> these<00:02:34.700> do<00:02:34.849> come<00:02:35.000> off<00:02:38.980> come

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
his forearms but these do come off come

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.869 
his forearms but these do come off come
off<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:41.629> transform<00:02:42.349> him<00:02:42.859> so<00:02:43.609> you<00:02:43.669> split

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
off and then transform him so you split

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.619 
off and then transform him so you split
the<00:02:44.030> legs<00:02:44.209> down<00:02:44.389> here<00:02:44.659> he<00:02:44.749> extend<00:02:45.079> them<00:02:46.629> all

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
the legs down here he extend them all

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.899 
the legs down here he extend them all
the<00:02:47.750> way<00:02:47.810> down<00:02:48.049> past<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.469> knee<00:02:48.650> I'll<00:02:49.639> rotate

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
the way down past the knee I'll rotate

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:56.259 
the way down past the knee I'll rotate
the<00:02:50.000> foot<00:02:50.150> around<00:02:50.419> flip<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.900> heel<00:02:51.079> out<00:02:55.269> the

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.189 
the foot around flip the heel out the
wheels<00:02:56.449> rotate<00:02:57.049> around<00:02:58.719> don't<00:02:59.719> they<00:02:59.840> slid<00:03:00.169> a

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:00.199 
wheels rotate around don't they slid a

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.539 
wheels rotate around don't they slid a
little<00:03:00.290> bit<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:00.919> apparently<00:03:01.280> they<00:03:01.370> didn't
