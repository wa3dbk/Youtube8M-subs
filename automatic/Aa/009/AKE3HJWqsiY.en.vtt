00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
working with a wand and having to be

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760 
working with a wand and having to be
taught<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> particular<00:01:45.630> technique<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.500> how<00:01:46.710> you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.760 
you cast a spell and you know that's
more<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.320> choreography<00:01:52.320> than<00:01:52.530> anything

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
more like a choreography than anything
