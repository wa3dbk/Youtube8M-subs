00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 several other things we start with the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.329
 first thing that I bring to you is that they are going to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.190
 come the mangas to mexico in 2014 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.809
 they were more or less for the months of 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 March and April with the death of the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.379
 editorial beat mexico and latin america 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.329
 he lost one of the editorials that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.610
 weight was done in sleeve licensing in 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.190
 america latin however this market 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.379
 it was not unattended for a long time already 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.019
 that editorial cam and you announced that 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.300
 I would avoid some sleeves and this one was 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.700
 sum now panini comics the bible 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.470
 the Italian group recently announced 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 that would enter the manga market in 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.550
 Mexico with acquisitions of the likes of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 fairytale naruto was invented in 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.190
 resident evil and wampis the first three 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.840
 will begin to be published in March 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.900
 next year while the last 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.340
 will be released the following month or in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 April, it should be noted that all 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.690
 Japanese editions in tank format or 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.150
 bones and translations will be made 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.890
 by Mexicans with domains in Japanese the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.870
 distribution will be through local 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.760
 closed union of shoppers stores 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.810
 specialized throughout the republic 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.280
 mexicana and online sale in active shop 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.020
 The truth is that this leaves us with 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.550
 very good hope all Latinos 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.930
 because they had us quite forgotten in 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.420
 the manga market and we had to 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.490
 bring the sleeves of USA or Spain 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.290
 I think they finally realized that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.780
 this market is too unattended 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.700
 and it's pretty good for them and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.070
 for us I also hope that they bring 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 even more sleeves and there's more competition 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.090
 so that there is more market for all 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 He was making us study 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.750
 a new anime and the truth is that it has 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.350
 a pretty good pint I leave you 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.000

 where we see a video accompanied by the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.290
 phrase this man without home or work 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.730
 he calls himself god remembering what 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.350
 they had already revealed all the details 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.480
 with respect to anime production 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.400
 a few months ago several 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.410
 details are augurating a great project 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.630
 quality and only the expectation remains 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.940

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.040

 famous studio action scenes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.940
 or what we miss from now makes a 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.350
 time I told them at the beginning of the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.060

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.400
 bones and I look forward to this anime 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.320

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.510
 Japanese animation the primes that 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.790

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.860
 animation etcetera and well this is great 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.390
 and zinc in what today swept away 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.860
 these front in this year we saw a great 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.540
 change in the anime industry with 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.980
 regarding what it brought us in the 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.870
 last years japan 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.909
 reference to the typical mode that the truth 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.860
 that is filling us up a bit but that 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.110
 however we still see a few 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.450

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.489
 under a little bit its crest and bet on

 for the light novels with their romance 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.280
 Funny and unusual and clear I could not 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.950
 missing a good number of video games 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.720

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.980
 what they hear won in better anime better 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.440
 opening better against the best character 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.780
 the best female character that was my 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.790

 that chingue that not that today was 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.160
 too good for the Japanese I think 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.709
 they were already a little tired as 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.720
 us of the animes moment though 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.250
 They keep coming not only know where 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.079
 otherwise you will not have a new movie on 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.519
 next year if they are followers of the 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.690
 franchise are to us and mono 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.130
 will fill with joy to know that 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.330

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.660
 suc and this film will reunite everything 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.490
 the team responsible for the first 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.800
 anime season and you're expected to see 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.930
 the light in the Japanese cinemas in 2014 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.090
 as some will remember at the beginning of 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.140
 2012 was revealed a news that excited 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.700
 much to the followers of this 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.350
 franchise this was that there would be a 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.450
 third season for the anime since 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.250
 had green light for its production now 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.080
 thanks to this announcement it has started to 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.550
 speculate that this new movie will be 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.490
 launched at the same time will launch the 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.200
 third season just wait for 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.720
 news is enough for me double so 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.550
 will complement or replace the expected 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.260
 sequel the original manga been being 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.230
 published in the action in 6 from the 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.270
 2007 now this work has been adapted to 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.160
 two anime series for television and 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.050
 a movie I really hope that gives light 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.150
 green for this third season because 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.710

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.210
 followers to this franchise and always 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.070

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.900
 see a new season now only 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.550
 we have a little hope left 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.780
 this new movie I hope it has 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.240
 a third season for the next 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.310
