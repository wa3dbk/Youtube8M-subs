00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.750 
find out a new spark plug but that's
only<00:07:30.550> if<00:07:30.790> it<00:07:30.970> doesn't<00:07:31.180> handle<00:07:31.870> real<00:07:32.080> well<00:07:32.760> but

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760 
only if it doesn't handle real well but

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.970 
only if it doesn't handle real well but
