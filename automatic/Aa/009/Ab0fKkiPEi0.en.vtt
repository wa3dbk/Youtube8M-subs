00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
picture of course you have your you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.350 
picture of course you have your you
measure<00:00:13.889> from<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.490> point<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.000> string

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
measure from the point of the string

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.180 
measure from the point of the string
here<00:00:15.389> because<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.590> actually<00:00:16.710> will<00:00:17.039> be

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
here because this is actually will be

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.240 
here because this is actually will be
holding<00:00:17.460> off<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.000> about<00:00:18.180> four<00:00:19.020> inches

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
holding off so it's about four inches

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.660 
holding off so it's about four inches
basically<00:00:20.250> from<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.890> top<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.130> frame<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
basically from the top of the frame I

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.220 
basically from the top of the frame I
know<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:27.230> want<00:00:28.230> my<00:00:28.320> picture<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:30.000> well<00:00:30.990> I

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
know that I want my picture to be well I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.209 
know that I want my picture to be well I
would<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> frame<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:33.860> maybe<00:00:34.860> about

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
would like the frame to be maybe about

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.889 
would like the frame to be maybe about
six<00:00:35.760> inches<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.899> ceiling<00:00:37.469> here<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.899> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
six inches from the ceiling here and I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.040 
six inches from the ceiling here and I
know<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:41.250> string<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.270> about<00:00:42.690> four

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
know that the string is about four

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.660 
know that the string is about four
inches<00:00:43.079> down<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:46.250> bracket<00:00:47.250> my

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
inches down so I know that my bracket my

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.600 
inches down so I know that my bracket my
break<00:00:48.239> my<00:00:48.620> banker<00:00:49.620> has<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.129> about<00:00:50.340> ten

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
break my banker has to be about ten

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.170 
break my banker has to be about ten
inches<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.710> pretty<00:00:52.949> much

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
inches there so this is pretty much

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.110 
inches there so this is pretty much
where<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.390> picture<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.840> gonna<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
where my picture is gonna be so just a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
where my picture is gonna be so just a
common<00:00:57.510> way<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> picture<00:00:59.550> weighs<00:00:59.730> about<00:01:00.739> 15

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
common way the picture weighs about 15

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.920 
common way the picture weighs about 15
pounds<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> use<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> 30<00:01:03.719> pound

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
pounds so I'm going to use a 30 pound

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
pounds so I'm going to use a 30 pound
