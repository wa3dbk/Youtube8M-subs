00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
time another angle from this is this is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800 
time another angle from this is this is
from<00:01:28.380> probably<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> second<00:01:29.220> set<00:01:29.460> i<00:01:29.720> did<00:01:30.720> i

trying<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:41.479> initial

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
trying to do so you see that my initial

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.530 
trying to do so you see that my initial
action<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.189> hips<00:01:44.399> back<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.329> drop

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540

action is the hips back and then drop
down<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.220> then<00:01:47.220> fire<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.939> hips<00:01:48.119> up<00:01:48.329> and

down and then fire the hips up and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.639 
down and then fire the hips up and
through<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.259> an<00:01:49.350> up-and-down

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
through it's not really an up-and-down

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.870 
through it's not really an up-and-down
movement<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.220> most<00:01:50.399> people<00:01:50.640> think<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
fifth set I got some spotters and told
him<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.060> to

him that I was going to I was going to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.780 
him that I was going to I was going to
pause<00:01:57.329> these<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.990> maybe<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.070> an<00:01:59.219> extra<00:01:59.490> rep<00:01:59.670> or

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
pause these and maybe do an extra rep or

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.670 
pause these and maybe do an extra rep or
two<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.180> felt<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.229> depending<00:02:01.590> on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
two if I felt like it and depending on

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.260 
two if I felt like it and depending on
how<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> felt

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
how I felt

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.380 
how I felt
and<00:02:04.179> this<00:02:05.179> said<00:02:05.420> actually<00:02:05.899> probably<00:02:06.409> felt<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
and this said actually probably felt the

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.479 
and this said actually probably felt the
strongest<00:02:08.629> out<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.319> five<00:02:09.500> just<00:02:10.069> because<00:02:10.399> I

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
strongest out of the five just because I

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.220 
strongest out of the five just because I
knew<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.670> was<00:02:10.759> my<00:02:10.879> last<00:02:11.030> one<00:02:11.330> that's<00:02:11.690> one<00:02:12.140> of

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
to get over the fact that I'm on these

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
on to the accessory movements and this

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.550 
on to the accessory movements and this
right<00:02:49.849> here<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.060> probably<00:02:50.329> in<00:02:50.630> my<00:02:50.750> favorite

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
right here is probably in my favorite

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.180 
right here is probably in my favorite
squat<00:02:52.180> /<00:02:53.180> least<00:02:53.810> favorite<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.500> do<00:02:54.799> squat

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
squat / least favorite to do squat

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.610 
squat / least favorite to do squat
accessory<00:02:55.640> because<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.120> just<00:02:56.209> they<00:02:56.660> suck<00:02:57.319> so

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
accessory because it's just they suck so

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.080 
accessory because it's just they suck so
much<00:02:58.030> these<00:02:59.030> are<00:02:59.150> pin<00:02:59.329> squats<00:02:59.660> or<00:03:00.730> stop<00:03:01.730> bottom

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
much these are pin squats or stop bottom

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.190 
much these are pin squats or stop bottom
squats<00:03:02.360> or<00:03:02.540> whatever<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.840> want<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.019> call<00:03:03.140> them

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
squats or whatever you want to call them

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.150 
squats or whatever you want to call them
basically<00:03:03.799> set<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.310> pins<00:03:04.519> down<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.209> your

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
basically set the pins down so that your

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.309 
basically set the pins down so that your
can<00:03:07.160> sit<00:03:07.430> down<00:03:07.639> to<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.840> parallel<00:03:08.840> or<00:03:09.049> below

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
can sit down to a parallel or below

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.979 
can sit down to a parallel or below
parallel<00:03:09.620> squat<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:11.209> weight<00:03:11.389> stops<00:03:11.810> at

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
parallel squat and the weight stops at

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.120 
parallel squat and the weight stops at
the<00:03:12.019> bottom<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.859> pick<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.069> up

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
the bottom and you have to pick it up

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.210 
the bottom and you have to pick it up
again<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.639> you<00:03:14.480> can't<00:03:14.690> use<00:03:14.959> momentum<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:16.010> just

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
again and you can't use momentum it just

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.390 
again and you can't use momentum it just
takes<00:03:16.400> any<00:03:16.880> kind<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.690> stretch<00:03:18.500> reflex<00:03:18.950> out<00:03:19.190> of

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
takes any kind of stretch reflex out of

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.160 
takes any kind of stretch reflex out of
its<00:03:19.910> like<00:03:20.030> pausing<00:03:20.420> your<00:03:20.540> bench<00:03:20.690> presses<00:03:21.049> it

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
its like pausing your bench presses it

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.319 
its like pausing your bench presses it
just<00:03:21.350> makes<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:21.650> much<00:03:21.889> harder<00:03:22.010> than<00:03:22.489> then

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
just makes it so much harder than then

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.420 
just makes it so much harder than then
going<00:03:24.170> down<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.650> using<00:03:24.799> any<00:03:25.040> kind<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.280> stretch

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
going down and using any kind of stretch

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.690 
going down and using any kind of stretch
reflex<00:03:25.790> at<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:25.970> bottom<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:27.069> headed<00:03:28.069> for<00:03:28.400> sets

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
reflex at the bottom so headed for sets

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.690 
reflex at the bottom so headed for sets
of<00:03:28.910> 3<00:03:29.090> 15<00:03:29.480> at<00:03:30.079> this<00:03:30.440> at<00:03:30.829> this<00:03:31.010> bar<00:03:31.190> height<00:03:31.430> and

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
of 3 15 at this at this bar height and

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.460 
of 3 15 at this at this bar height and
then<00:03:31.880> I<00:03:32.030> threw<00:03:32.269> on<00:03:32.329> another<00:03:32.660> plate<00:03:33.730> put<00:03:34.730> on<00:03:34.880> 405

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
then I threw on another plate put on 405

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.170 
then I threw on another plate put on 405
