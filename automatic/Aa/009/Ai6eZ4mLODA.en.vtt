which especially on a black dial is a
very<00:00:34.110> important<00:00:34.680> feature<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
very important feature to have as you

very important feature to have as you
can<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.750> when<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.559> twist<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> around

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
can see when I kind of twist it around

can see when I kind of twist it around
here<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> bit<00:00:38.700> does<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> pretty<00:00:39.420> good<00:00:39.510> job<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
here a bit does a pretty good job of

even with the bright light overhead we
have<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> 120<00:00:48.450> click<00:00:49.100> unidirectional<00:00:50.100> bezel<00:00:51.110> at

have a 120 click unidirectional bezel at
all<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.149> action<00:00:54.149> smooth<00:00:55.100> it's<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
all the action smooth it's kind of the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.389 
all the action smooth it's kind of the
sound<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.440> plastic<00:00:58.949> side<00:00:59.160> for

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
sound is a little on a plastic side for

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.900 
sound is a little on a plastic side for
me<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.899> that<00:01:00.899> lines<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.320> well<00:01:01.649> very<00:01:02.640> little

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
me but that lines up well very little

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.539 
me but that lines up well very little
play<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:05.060> I<00:01:06.060> really<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:07.040> dig<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> look<00:01:08.340> of

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
play and I really just dig the look of

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.130 
play and I really just dig the look of
it<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:09.000> quite<00:01:09.240> honest<00:01:09.600> everybody<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.750> being<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it be quite honest everybody and being a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
it be quite honest everybody and being a
dive<00:01:13.350> watch<00:01:14.689> 500<00:01:15.689> meters<00:01:15.900> resistance<00:01:17.030> which

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
dive watch 500 meters resistance which

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.760 
dive watch 500 meters resistance which
is<00:01:18.299> probably<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.110> believe<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> Hoss

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
is probably the I believe the Hoss

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.300 
is probably the I believe the Hoss
resistant<00:01:20.460> watch<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.509> our<00:01:21.630> own<00:01:22.189> not<00:01:23.189> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
resistant watch out of our own not that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
resistant watch out of our own not that
I'll<00:01:23.400> ever<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.820> more<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> few<00:01:24.390> feet<00:01:24.540> below

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
I'll ever go more in a few feet below

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.520 
I'll ever go more in a few feet below
the<00:01:24.750> water<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.090> guess<00:01:27.450> being<00:01:27.689> American

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the water that I guess being American

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.020 
the water that I guess being American
that<00:01:28.770> bigger<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.640> always<00:01:29.729> better

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.600 

and<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> course<00:01:33.450> we've<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.470> screw<00:01:35.460> down

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and of course we've got the screw down

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.920 
and of course we've got the screw down
crown<00:01:37.579> which<00:01:38.579> operates<00:01:38.970> very<00:01:39.210> smoothly<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
crown which operates very smoothly and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.920 
crown which operates very smoothly and
takes<00:01:40.200> almost<00:01:40.770> 10<00:01:41.400> turns<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> come

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
takes almost 10 turns to get it to come

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.749 
takes almost 10 turns to get it to come
out<00:01:43.909> yeah

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
out yeah

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
out yeah
and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> tube<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.079> quite<00:01:49.409> long<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and then the tube here is quite long and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.069 
and then the tube here is quite long and
actually<00:01:50.490> recesses<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.119> into<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> case<00:01:51.780> there

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
actually recesses on into the case there

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.210 
actually recesses on into the case there
touch<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.450> pull<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> crown<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
touch you know pull out the crown to the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.760 
touch you know pull out the crown to the
file<00:01:56.430> position<00:01:56.939> here<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.439> setting<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> time

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
file position here and setting the time

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.779 
file position here and setting the time
easy

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
easy

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.980 
easy
very<00:02:00.360> very<00:02:00.720> smooth<00:02:02.479> get<00:02:03.479> done<00:02:03.630> setting<00:02:03.929> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
very very smooth get done setting the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.089 
very very smooth get done setting the
time<00:02:04.670> push<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:07.860> again<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:10.099> there

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
time push it in again and it there

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.479 
time push it in again and it there
we<00:02:11.190> go

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
we go

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.270 
we go
threads<00:02:12.060> right<00:02:12.209> back<00:02:12.450> up<00:02:13.519> smooth<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:14.700> better

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
threads right back up smooth is better

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.539 
threads right back up smooth is better
probably<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.640> Crown's<00:02:18.980> probably<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.130> smooth

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
probably the Crown's probably as smooth

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.640 
probably the Crown's probably as smooth
as<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.569> as<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.380> aqua<00:02:22.890> racer<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.700> had<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.840> I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
as the as the aqua racer I had so I

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.259 
as the as the aqua racer I had so I
believe<00:02:26.250> that's<00:02:26.340> saying<00:02:26.670> quite<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.910> bit<00:02:27.150> a

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
believe that's saying quite a bit a

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.020 
believe that's saying quite a bit a
couple<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:30.480> comments<00:02:30.750> about<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.260> watch<00:02:32.030> it's

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
couple of comments about the watch it's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.800 
couple of comments about the watch it's
a<00:02:33.120> pretty<00:02:33.480> good<00:02:33.720> size<00:02:34.400> even<00:02:35.400> though<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.810> width

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
a pretty good size even though the width

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.630 
a pretty good size even though the width
wise<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.709> too<00:02:38.190> large

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
wise it's not too large

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.490 
wise it's not too large
I<00:02:38.790> believe<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.209> 43<00:02:39.630> millimeters<00:02:39.989> wide

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
I believe it's 43 millimeters wide

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.850 
I believe it's 43 millimeters wide
without<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.220> crown<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.760> 45<00:02:42.269> width<00:02:42.860> but

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860

it<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:02.280> sapphire<00:03:02.790> crystal<00:03:03.420> sets<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.810> a

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
it the sapphire crystal sets just a

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.410 
it the sapphire crystal sets just a
little<00:03:04.350> bit<00:03:04.500> below<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.769> bezel<00:03:05.310> which<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.209> nice

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
little bit below the bezel which is nice

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.809 
little bit below the bezel which is nice
but<00:03:07.549> it's<00:03:08.549> not<00:03:08.639> protected<00:03:09.120> real<00:03:09.510> well<00:03:09.750> but

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
but it's not protected real well but

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.280 
but it's not protected real well but
being<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:12.030> sapphire<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:14.160> should<00:03:14.790> stay

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
being that sapphire it should stay

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.830 
being that sapphire it should stay
pretty<00:03:16.290> clear

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.360

Brian you know I would throw out a guess

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.260 
Brian you know I would throw out a guess
through<00:03:29.760> using<00:03:29.970> super-luminova<00:03:30.540> on<00:03:31.080> this<00:03:32.270> you

nice<00:03:36.180> triangle<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.990> grows<00:03:37.220> probably

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
nice triangle that grows probably

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.410 
nice triangle that grows probably
brighter<00:03:38.460> than<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.820> rest<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> watch

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
it's not gonna be confused for

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.860 
it's not gonna be confused for
Submariner<00:03:51.150> which<00:03:52.050> so<00:03:52.650> many<00:03:52.709> dog<00:03:53.010> watches

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
Submariner which so many dog watches

Submariner which so many dog watches
kind<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.959> do<00:03:55.140> or<00:03:55.440> they<00:03:55.560> draw<00:03:55.830> heavily<00:03:56.250> from<00:03:58.610> one

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
kind of do or they draw heavily from one

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.370 
kind of do or they draw heavily from one
thing<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.880> found<00:04:00.060> really<00:04:00.330> neat<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.140> think

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
thing I found really neat that I think

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.000 
thing I found really neat that I think
rocks<00:04:01.709> could<00:04:01.890> actually<00:04:02.040> learn<00:04:02.670> from<00:04:04.010> Victor

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
rocks could actually learn from Victor

rocks could actually learn from Victor
Knox's<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:06.420> Cyclops<00:04:07.080> that's<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.250> dial

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
Knox's the Cyclops that's on the dial

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.960 
Knox's the Cyclops that's on the dial
versus<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.450> crystal<00:04:10.430> very<00:04:11.430> neat<00:04:11.670> feature

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
versus the crystal very neat feature

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.660 
versus the crystal very neat feature
here<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:13.140> didn't<00:04:13.920> even<00:04:13.980> notice<00:04:14.250> until<00:04:14.459> I

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
here that I didn't even notice until I

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.300 
here that I didn't even notice until I
owned<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.000> watch<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.890> until<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:16.919> had<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.190> in<00:04:17.250> my

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
owned the watch and until I had it in my

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.659 
owned the watch and until I had it in my
hands<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.930> magnifies<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.680> little<00:04:19.829> bit<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:20.459> I

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
hands it magnifies it a little bit but I

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.340 
hands it magnifies it a little bit but I
think<00:04:21.090> it's<00:04:21.239> just<00:04:21.359> neat<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.750> they<00:04:21.870> placed<00:04:22.169> it

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
think it's just neat that they placed it

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.370 
think it's just neat that they placed it
on<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.470> dial<00:04:22.800> versus<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.550> crystal<00:04:24.390> that's

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
on the dial versus the crystal that's

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.550 
on the dial versus the crystal that's
not<00:04:25.620> adding<00:04:25.950> any<00:04:26.130> more<00:04:26.220> depth<00:04:27.050> which<00:04:28.050> was<00:04:28.290> kind

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
not adding any more depth which was kind

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.080 
not adding any more depth which was kind
of<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.680> original<00:04:29.130> reason<00:04:29.460> they<00:04:29.610> didn't<00:04:29.970> add

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
of the original reason they didn't add

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.219 
of the original reason they didn't add
