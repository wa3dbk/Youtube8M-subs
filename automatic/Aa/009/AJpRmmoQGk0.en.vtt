00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
switching into his Latios and like I

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.719 
switching into his Latios and like I
said<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.320> thing<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> problem

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
said this thing is going to be a problem

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
said this thing is going to be a problem
so<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.630> first<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> my

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so what I do first is I going to my

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.990 
so what I do first is I going to my
Tentacruel<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.280> feel<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.850> this

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
things can really take pretty much all

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.130 
things can really take pretty much all
the<00:01:32.159> special<00:01:32.700> moves<00:01:32.939> except<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.110> course

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the special moves except for of course

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.819 
the special moves except for of course
psych<00:01:34.650> shock<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:36.060> feel<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.869> know<00:01:37.020> if

stuff<00:02:46.600> later<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:46.990> with<00:02:47.110> Tentacruel<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.920> then

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
stuff later on with Tentacruel and then

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.920 
stuff later on with Tentacruel and then
I<00:02:48.340> should<00:02:48.550> be<00:02:48.670> fine<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.120> he's<00:02:49.270> gonna<00:02:49.360> go<00:02:49.570> for

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
I should be fine so he's gonna go for

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.110 
I should be fine so he's gonna go for
you<00:02:50.110> know<00:02:50.140> his<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.860> know<00:02:50.980> his<00:02:51.340> layers<00:02:51.610> spikes

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
you know his you know his layers spikes

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.030 
you know his you know his layers spikes
I<00:02:52.360> really<00:02:52.660> don't<00:02:52.840> care<00:02:52.900> I'm<00:02:53.500> gonna<00:02:53.680> go<00:02:53.770> for<00:02:53.950> an

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
I really don't care I'm gonna go for an

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.710 
I really don't care I'm gonna go for an
earthquake<00:02:54.190> here<00:02:54.640> that's<00:02:55.000> doing<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.390> decent

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
earthquake here that's doing a decent

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.150 
earthquake here that's doing a decent
meta<00:02:55.870> damage<00:02:56.230> which<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.650> know<00:02:56.770> not<00:02:56.980> bad

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
meta damage which is you know not bad

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.740 
meta damage which is you know not bad
and<00:02:57.430> plus<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.790> poison<00:02:58.180> damage<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.510> know<00:02:58.600> it's

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and plus the poison damage you know it's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.540 
and plus the poison damage you know it's
all<00:02:58.900> racking<00:02:59.380> up<00:02:59.500> to<00:03:00.070> where<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.220> should<00:03:00.280> be<00:03:00.460> able

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
all racking up to where I should be able

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.650 
all racking up to where I should be able
to<00:03:00.670> knock<00:03:00.820> out<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.060> thing<00:03:01.240> pretty<00:03:01.420> quickly

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
to knock out this thing pretty quickly

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.570 
to knock out this thing pretty quickly
so<00:03:01.840> he<00:03:02.440> actually<00:03:02.680> ends<00:03:02.860> up<00:03:02.950> going<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.250> seismic

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
so he actually ends up going for seismic

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.310 
so he actually ends up going for seismic
Dawson<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.060> guess<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.390> haven't<00:03:04.600> seen<00:03:04.840> seismic

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
Dawson I guess I haven't seen seismic

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.960 
Dawson I guess I haven't seen seismic
toss<00:03:05.530> at<00:03:05.710> all<00:03:05.830> on<00:03:05.980> x<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.340> y<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:06.460> it<00:03:06.760> looks

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
toss at all on x and y but it looks

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.770 
toss at all on x and y but it looks
absolutely<00:03:07.240> epic<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.700> don't<00:03:10.090> know<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.510> guess

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
absolutely epic I I don't know I guess

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.300 
absolutely epic I I don't know I guess
I've<00:03:10.900> never<00:03:11.080> seen<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.890> looks<00:03:12.130> awesome
