stratifying<00:01:47.200> like<00:01:47.440> this<00:01:47.709> after<00:01:48.640> you've<00:01:48.759> let

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
stratifying like this after you've let

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.880 
stratifying like this after you've let
it<00:01:49.119> wash<00:01:49.300> off<00:01:49.599> some<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.020> lighter<00:01:50.410> gravel

it wash off some of the lighter gravel

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.949 
it wash off some of the lighter gravel
make<00:01:51.489> sure<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:51.759> keep<00:01:51.940> going<00:01:52.149> back<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.630> forth

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
make sure you keep going back and forth

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.339 
make sure you keep going back and forth
and<00:01:53.910> Reese<00:01:54.910> travefy<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.599> the<00:01:55.660> material<00:01:56.140> every

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
and Reese travefy in the material every

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.109 
and Reese travefy in the material every
so<00:01:56.530> often<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.459> you<00:01:57.489> can<00:01:57.700> kind<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:57.970> tell

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
so often and you can kind of tell

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.460 
so often and you can kind of tell
because<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.569> sand<00:01:59.020> will<00:01:59.140> start<00:01:59.319> getting

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
because the sand will start getting

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.100 
because the sand will start getting
darker<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.459> can<00:02:00.580> kind<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:00.789> see<00:02:00.940> that<00:02:01.149> there<00:02:01.360> as

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
darker you can kind of see that there as

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.080 
darker you can kind of see that there as
you<00:02:02.289> get<00:02:02.410> down<00:02:02.590> further<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.220> sand<00:02:03.789> starts

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
you get down further the sand starts

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.940 
you get down further the sand starts
getting<00:02:04.330> darker<00:02:04.599> that's<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.470> point<00:02:05.649> when<00:02:05.920> you

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
getting darker that's the point when you

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.870 
getting darker that's the point when you
start<00:02:06.069> to<00:02:06.550> restore<00:02:07.179> a<00:02:07.239> fine

back and forth back and forth so you see

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.040 
back and forth back and forth so you see
this<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.000> sand<00:02:17.240> started<00:02:17.540> getting<00:02:17.690> darker<00:02:17.990> and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
panning and if you can recover the fine

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.840 
panning and if you can recover the fine
gold<00:03:06.319> like<00:03:06.560> this<00:03:06.830> then<00:03:07.069> you<00:03:07.160> can<00:03:07.280> recover<00:03:07.550> any

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
gold like this then you can recover any

just<00:03:35.299> pulling<00:03:35.540> stuff<00:03:35.780> off<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.079> surface<00:03:36.440> like

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
just pulling stuff off the surface like

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.199 
just pulling stuff off the surface like
that<00:03:36.620> that's<00:03:37.070> that's<00:03:37.489> all<00:03:37.670> that's<00:03:37.820> in<00:03:38.030> there

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
that that's that's all that's in there

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.830 
that that's that's all that's in there
so<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:39.380> can<00:03:39.500> see<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.769> or<00:03:39.980> no<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.840> anyway

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
so you can see it or no but anyway

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.470 
so you can see it or no but anyway
that's<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.680> basics<00:03:43.070> of<00:03:43.130> panning<00:03:43.549> like<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.329> said

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
that's the basics of panning like I said

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.819 
that's the basics of panning like I said
if<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.660> can<00:03:44.780> get<00:03:44.900> good<00:03:45.049> at<00:03:45.200> doing<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
if you can get good at doing that the

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.250 
if you can get good at doing that the
whole<00:03:46.250> key<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.549> panning<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.810> make<00:03:47.959> sure<00:03:47.989> you

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
whole key to panning is to make sure you

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.110 
whole key to panning is to make sure you
just<00:03:48.290> Reece<00:03:48.650> TRADD<00:03:48.920> if<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.190> every<00:03:49.519> so<00:03:49.700> off<00:03:49.910> and

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
wipe all the get all that top layer off

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.819 
wipe all the get all that top layer off
till<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.239> starting<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.510> turn<00:03:53.630> in<00:03:53.780> dark<00:03:54.019> and

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
till it's starting to turn in dark and

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.560 
till it's starting to turn in dark and
bring<00:03:55.160> your<00:03:55.250> pan<00:03:55.459> back<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.910> restore<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.239> defy
