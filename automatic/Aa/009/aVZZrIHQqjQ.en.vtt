00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:28.460
 pizza with the pan with a new one 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:31.610
 the lid among the believers is the pasta 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.570
 already smoothed for peeled tomato pizza 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:40.210
 a little cheese with salt pepper 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.210
 ham and mozzarella and a little to make them 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
 yes to mortar for 5 minutes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:52.660
 I put the trade is 20 and 9 minutes 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:54.900
 at 20 and 15 the check is 20 and 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.900
 16 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:08.619
 lower the gas to the flame and you are already 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.190
 raising 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.760
 and it is also a little bit golden with fruits 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.890
 the other five minutes and will be ready 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.590
 in the meantime I always put on high heat 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:27.250
 another track this is more a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.890
 vegetarian with carrots onion tomato 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:37.680
 1 gold always puts it five minutes a 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.680
 55 minutes high flame so off 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.239
 another four minutes have passed 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.230
 in the end a nice in the field so me 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.760
 quietly the star as well 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.470
 because if already cooked in 9 minutes in ten 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.500
 meters we already have a pizza 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.740
 ready at the table with the minimum of del 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.680
 consumption because making it abuse a flame 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.170
 it is almost completely off is not it 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.860
 same that turn on for 20 minutes in 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.260
 oven 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.260
 in the meantime we check this as well 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.000
 even here the flame is flying low 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.000
 almost choice 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.030
 so almost sprint calls must be for 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:57.859
 85 minutes the same procedure as 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:04:01.730
 this pizza is ready the beautiful 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.519
 the pan was also crispy and remained 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.120
 completely clean so I don't even have to 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.870
 go and consume water and detergent for 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.870
