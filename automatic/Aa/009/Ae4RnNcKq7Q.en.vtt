00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
make it a bright color so you know where

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.000 
make it a bright color so you know where
you're<00:01:20.530> going<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.800> put<00:01:20.980> it<00:01:21.100> make<00:01:21.610> it<00:01:21.900> why<00:01:23.010> put

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.789 

then<00:01:37.820> which<00:01:37.940> one<00:01:37.970> do<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.630> guess<00:01:39.260> since<00:01:39.650> you

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
then which one do is guess since you

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.860 
then which one do is guess since you
have<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.130> can<00:01:40.369> make<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.640> black

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.310 

and<00:01:46.080> duplicate<00:01:46.500> this

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
and duplicate this

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.710 
and duplicate this
rotate<00:01:49.010> all<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.190> way

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.660 

meet<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.470> corner<00:01:53.800> touch<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.160> top<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:54.580> it

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
meet the corner touch the top so it

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.430 
meet the corner touch the top so it
almost<00:01:54.790> looks<00:01:55.090> like<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.270> like<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.020> dot<00:01:56.230> a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
almost looks like a like the dot a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.820 
almost looks like a like the dot a
diamond<00:01:56.940> but<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:59.050> left<00:01:59.290> side<00:01:59.470> in<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.680> right

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
diamond but the left side in the right

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.190 
diamond but the left side in the right
side<00:02:00.100> tip<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.430> diamond<00:02:00.820> barely<00:02:01.570> meet

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.569 

so<00:02:05.710> what<00:02:05.829> you<00:02:05.920> want<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.130> do<00:02:06.219> and<00:02:06.430> then

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
so what you want to do and then

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.529 
so what you want to do and then

make sure you put it right in the middle

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.550 
make sure you put it right in the middle
because<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:56.930> don't<00:02:57.080> put<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.260> right<00:02:57.350> in<00:02:57.470> the

because we don't put it right in the
middle<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:58.370> know<00:02:58.490> it's<00:02:58.910> not<00:02:59.060> gonna<00:02:59.300> look

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
middle you know it's not gonna look

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.500 
middle you know it's not gonna look
right<00:02:59.570> you<00:03:00.290> know<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.590> put<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:00.830> right<00:03:00.920> here

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
right you know if you put it right here

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.850 
right you know if you put it right here
right<00:03:02.510> here<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:03.020> know<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.200> have<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.530> put<00:03:03.740> it

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.220 

then<00:03:14.829> you<00:03:14.980> go<00:03:15.129> over<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.599> zero<00:03:16.810> digital

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
then you go over just a zero digital

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:28.120 
then you go over just a zero digital
again

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:39.990 

and<00:03:28.490> basically

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.950 

you<00:03:40.300> are<00:03:40.510> right<00:03:40.660> here

you are right here

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.700 
you are right here
you<00:03:43.470> make<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.040> same<00:03:44.280> color

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:04:00.040 

almost<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.370> where<00:03:49.520> you<00:03:49.640> have<00:03:49.820> like<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.030> little

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.580 

how<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.320> has

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.530 

that's<00:04:03.129> really<00:04:03.340> three<00:04:03.879> starting<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.300> form

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
that's really three starting to form

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.360 
that's really three starting to form
then<00:04:05.379> what<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.620> want<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.769> do<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.069> want<00:04:06.160> to

take this one

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.950 
take this one
duplicate<00:04:10.080> 20<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.430> duplicate<00:04:12.240> 20<00:04:12.570> move<00:04:12.870> it

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
duplicate 20 so you duplicate 20 move it

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.070 
duplicate 20 so you duplicate 20 move it
all<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.080> way<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.260> front<00:04:13.650> see<00:04:14.400> there's<00:04:14.640> zero

it's going
this<00:05:59.470> might<00:05:59.650> be<00:05:59.680> confusing<00:06:00.220> to<00:06:00.340> some<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:00.730> you

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
this might be confusing to some of you

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.760 
this might be confusing to some of you
but<00:06:01.920> this<00:06:02.920> is<00:06:03.100> what<00:06:03.220> I<00:06:03.250> found<00:06:03.520> out<00:06:03.790> just<00:06:04.590> if<00:06:05.590> you

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
but this is what I found out just if you

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.770 
but this is what I found out just if you
if<00:06:06.460> you<00:06:06.580> take<00:06:06.730> the<00:06:06.850> private<00:06:07.210> on<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.360> top<00:06:07.570> and

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
if you take the private on the top and

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.090 
if you take the private on the top and
you<00:06:07.900> scale<00:06:08.230> it<00:06:08.260> to<00:06:08.470> make<00:06:08.740> a<00:06:08.770> little<00:06:08.980> bit

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
you scale it to make a little bit

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.680 
you scale it to make a little bit
smaller<00:06:10.020> it<00:06:11.020> you<00:06:11.830> can<00:06:11.980> kind<00:06:12.190> of<00:06:12.250> see<00:06:12.310> a<00:06:12.690> light

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
smaller it you can kind of see a light

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.240 
smaller it you can kind of see a light
it<00:06:13.810> just<00:06:13.990> looks<00:06:14.200> more<00:06:14.380> better<00:06:14.560> much<00:06:14.890> looks

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
it just looks more better much looks

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.010 
it just looks more better much looks
more<00:06:15.460> even<00:06:15.790> and<00:06:16.380> then<00:06:17.380> you<00:06:17.530> do<00:06:17.680> to<00:06:18.070> the<00:06:19.020> bottom

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
more even and then you do to the bottom

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.410 
more even and then you do to the bottom
private<00:06:20.620> the<00:06:21.610> other<00:06:21.790> here<00:06:22.150> and<00:06:22.420> you

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.540 

scale<00:06:26.110> it<00:06:26.140> mainland<00:06:26.740> would<00:06:26.860> smaller<00:06:27.160> remove

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
scale it mainland would smaller remove

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.580 
scale it mainland would smaller remove
it

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
it

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:44.430
