like say you have a heavy dense cover of
vegetation<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.670> apply<00:00:47.879> roundup<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.600> some

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
vegetation you apply roundup that some

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
vegetation you apply roundup that some
of<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.620> roundup<00:00:50.070> gets<00:00:50.340> translocated<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.930> the

of that roundup gets translocated to the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
of that roundup gets translocated to the
roots<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.070> tree<00:00:53.550> that's<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.180> there

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
roots of the tree that's in there

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.990 
roots of the tree that's in there
because<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.930> shares<00:00:55.500> some<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.520> roundup

no vegetation Wow what happened ten
years<00:01:55.770> later

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
years later

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.490 
years later
well<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:57.030> showed<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.630> learned<00:01:57.930> about<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.320> on

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
well that showed I learned about that on

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.889 
well that showed I learned about that on
60<00:01:58.890> minutes<00:01:58.920> where<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.149> government<00:02:00.780> was

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
60 minutes where this government was

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.889 
60 minutes where this government was
using<00:02:00.960> roundup<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> kill<00:02:02.159> poppies<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.270> they

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
using roundup to kill poppies and they

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.709 
using roundup to kill poppies and they
use<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> surfactant<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:05.460> different<00:02:06.090> surfactant

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
use a surfactant a different surfactant

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.089 
use a surfactant a different surfactant
before<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> roundup<00:02:07.500> included<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
before a roundup included the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.010 
before a roundup included the
surfactants<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:09.599> came<00:02:09.899> up

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
surfactants and if they they came up

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.720 
surfactants and if they they came up
their<00:02:10.170> own<00:02:10.259> formula<00:02:10.679> there's<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.039> fact<00:02:11.340> that's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
their own formula there's a fact that's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.309 
their own formula there's a fact that's
so<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.209> sticks<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.900> rain

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
so it sticks and it's rain

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.989 
so it sticks and it's rain
fast<00:02:13.560> okay<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.430> turned<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:14.999 
fast okay and it turned out that the

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.539 
fast okay and it turned out that the
rain<00:02:15.209> fast<00:02:15.769> surfactants<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.859> some<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.219> them

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
rain fast surfactants and some of them

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.360 
rain fast surfactants and some of them
that's<00:02:18.359> according<00:02:18.749> to<00:02:18.930> Monsanto<00:02:19.379> who<00:02:20.010> wasn't

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
that's according to Monsanto who wasn't

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.819 
that's according to Monsanto who wasn't
their<00:02:20.489> fault<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:21.629> think<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:21.989> was<00:02:22.200> would

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
their fault but I think it was would

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.520 
their fault but I think it was would
actually<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:24.060> only<00:02:24.269> accentuate<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.319> growth

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
actually not only accentuate the growth

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.410 
actually not only accentuate the growth
around<00:02:25.709> up<00:02:26.069> but<00:02:26.430> make<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:26.609> so<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:26.969> soil<00:02:27.239> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
around up but make it so the soil is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.030 
around up but make it so the soil is
sterile<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.989> they<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.739> some<00:02:28.889> of<00:02:28.980> these

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
sterile and they have some of these

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.920 
sterile and they have some of these
places<00:02:29.310> they<00:02:29.549> couldn't<00:02:29.879> thing<00:02:30.030> five<00:02:30.599> years

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
places they couldn't thing five years

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.240 
places they couldn't thing five years
ten<00:02:31.200> years<00:02:31.230> they<00:02:31.590> said<00:02:31.769> they<00:02:31.889> couldn't<00:02:32.099> grow

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
ten years they said they couldn't grow

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.009 
ten years they said they couldn't grow
anything<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:32.879> brought<00:02:33.389> suit<00:02:33.689> against

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
anything and they brought suit against

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.780 
anything and they brought suit against
them<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.980> don't<00:02:35.040> know<00:02:35.219> how<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.400> ended<00:02:35.730> up

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
them and I don't know how that ended up

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.160 
them and I don't know how that ended up
in<00:02:35.939> court<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.299> I've<00:02:36.420> got<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.599> couple<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.930> spots

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
in court but I've got a couple of spots

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.300 
in court but I've got a couple of spots
over<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.609> that<00:02:38.780> where<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.099> ten<00:02:41.099> years

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
over here like that where it's ten years

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.369 
over here like that where it's ten years
later<00:02:41.489> no<00:02:42.030> grass<00:02:42.299> why<00:02:42.659> is<00:02:42.719> there<00:02:42.989> no<00:02:43.109> grass

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
later no grass why is there no grass

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.319 
later no grass why is there no grass
here<00:02:43.409> there's<00:02:43.980> some<00:02:44.189> Moss<00:02:44.459> Moss<00:02:44.909> started

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
here there's some Moss Moss started

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.420 
here there's some Moss Moss started
growing<00:02:45.480> two<00:02:45.719> years<00:02:45.959> ago<00:02:46.139> there<00:02:46.409> and<00:02:47.099> I'm<00:02:47.250> like
