pipes it plays eight tunes and it's a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.730 
pipes it plays eight tunes and it's a
pretty<00:01:06.330> good<00:01:06.570> shape<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.110> plays<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.560> about

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
pretty good shape it plays at about

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.950 
pretty good shape it plays at about
eighty<00:01:07.950> percent<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.939> know<00:01:09.420> all<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> air

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
eighty percent you know all the air

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.719 
eighty percent you know all the air
pressure<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.530> good<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> valves<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.369> good<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
pressure is good the valves are good the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
pressure is good the valves are good the
only<00:01:11.880> issue<00:01:12.240> there's<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.439> four<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:13.920> five

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
only issue there's about four or five

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.690 
only issue there's about four or five
pipes<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.760> aren't<00:01:15.140> sounding<00:01:16.140> correctly

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
pipes that aren't sounding correctly

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.280 
pipes that aren't sounding correctly
about<00:01:17.700> three<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.330> don't<00:01:18.630> sound<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.140> all

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
about three of them don't sound at all

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.630 
about three of them don't sound at all
so<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> has<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.490> its<00:01:20.610> original<00:01:20.759> pipes<00:01:21.360> but

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
so it has all its original pipes but

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.219 
so it has all its original pipes but
just<00:01:23.640> needs<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.119> TLC<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.930> they'd<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.140> at

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
just needs a little TLC and they'd be at

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.640 
just needs a little TLC and they'd be at
a<00:01:25.259> hundred<00:01:25.470> percent<00:01:26.780> one<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> Tunes<00:01:28.409> is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
a hundred percent one of the a Tunes is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.609 
a hundred percent one of the a Tunes is
Yankee<00:01:29.040> Doodle<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.350> some<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> other

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
tunes we're not sure quite what they are

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.700

but<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.350> play<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> little

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
but I'm just gonna play a little

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
but I'm just gonna play a little
sampling<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.030> hear<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> in

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.460 

okay<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.280> over<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:11.810> manually<00:02:12.810> change<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
okay so over here manually change the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:25.370 
okay so over here manually change the
tune<00:02:22.880> okay<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.239> Yankee<00:02:24.420> Doodle<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
tune okay this is a Yankee Doodle on the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.229 
tune okay this is a Yankee Doodle on the
beginning<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.890> sounds<00:02:26.340> great<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.940> middle

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
beginning it sounds great in the middle

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.850 
beginning it sounds great in the middle
it<00:02:27.420> gets<00:02:27.569> up<00:02:27.810> into<00:02:28.080> some<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.440> pipes<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
it gets up into some of the pipes that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.280 
it gets up into some of the pipes that
aren't<00:02:29.069> playing<00:02:29.450> very<00:02:30.450> well<00:02:30.540> kind<00:02:31.200> of

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
aren't playing very well kind of

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.020 
aren't playing very well kind of
disappears<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.130> comes<00:02:32.310> back<00:02:32.520> again<00:02:32.760> but

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
disappears and it comes back again but

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:58.509 
disappears and it comes back again but
you<00:02:33.120> could<00:02:33.239> definitely<00:02:33.390> hear<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> tune<00:02:34.110> so

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.979 

anyway<00:02:59.519> there<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.760> go<00:02:59.970> gets<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.390> an<00:03:00.569> idea<00:03:00.930> of

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
anyway there you go gets you an idea of

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.780 
anyway there you go gets you an idea of
the<00:03:01.110> clock<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.680> needs<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.010> little<00:03:02.190> bit<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.459> TLC

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the clock that needs a little bit of TLC

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.360 
the clock that needs a little bit of TLC
it<00:03:03.150> could<00:03:03.299> be<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> hundred<00:03:03.630> percent<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:05.130> does

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it could be a hundred percent it does

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.539 
it could be a hundred percent it does
have<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> case<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:07.100> which<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.280> a

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
have a case with it which is just a

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.900 
have a case with it which is just a
pretty<00:03:08.760> typical<00:03:09.000> case<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> organ<00:03:10.079> clocks

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
pretty typical case for the organ clocks

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.400 
pretty typical case for the organ clocks
this<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> small<00:03:12.480> enough<00:03:12.630> example<00:03:13.230> where<00:03:13.380> a

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
this is a small enough example where a

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.819 
this is a small enough example where a
bracket<00:03:14.010> can<00:03:14.130> easily<00:03:14.549> be<00:03:14.670> fabricated<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.829> can

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
bracket can easily be fabricated and can

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.289 
bracket can easily be fabricated and can
be<00:03:16.920> hung<00:03:17.100> on<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.280> wall<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.030> would<00:03:18.180> be<00:03:18.269> a

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
be hung on the wall so this would be a

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.259 
be hung on the wall so this would be a
great<00:03:18.540> example<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.140> hang<00:03:19.350> on<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> wall<00:03:20.090> or<00:03:21.090> it

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
great example to hang on the wall or it

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.780 
great example to hang on the wall or it
can<00:03:21.390> be<00:03:21.480> kept<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:22.079> on<00:03:22.769> its<00:03:23.130> case<00:03:23.370> as<00:03:23.579> well

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
can be kept on on its case as well

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.940 
can be kept on on its case as well
