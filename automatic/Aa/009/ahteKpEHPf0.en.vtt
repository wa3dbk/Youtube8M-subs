00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.610
 the procedure in detail 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.580
 In therapeutic cloning, oocytes must first be taken from a woman 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.479
 become 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:13.259
 The genetic material of the woman in the nucleus is then removed from these eggs 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.259
 now speaks of a band Carinthia egg 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.339
 In the next step, the genome of a patient is from any 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.300
 Body cell taken for example from one of his skin cells and into the 

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:31.460
 pitted egg cell transferred 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 and fused by means of an electrical voltage 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.810
 By this method also the claw sheep Dolly was born 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 These old cases now contain the genetic material of the patient 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.080
 From the thus manipulated egg cell an embryo has arisen because now begins 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.580
 to share 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.090
 This embryo is a clone of the patient because you would get those recommendations 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.980
 A woman's uterus would become a genetic copy of a plant 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 Patients develop escaped so 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.350
 however, in a therapeutic cloning, the embryo does not become one 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.750
 Uterus used but it grows in a Petri dish a few days 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 until you can remove the embryonic stem cells 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 These all-rounders are then cultivated in the laboratory 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.109
 the embryonic stem cells are treated with suitable growth factors 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.219
 with the goal that they become the desired body cells 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.040
 develop 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.880
 the embryonic stem cells have the potential 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 in almost all of the 210 known human body cells 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.970
 differentiate 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.179
 and so Hoffmann 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.530
 that they are under suitable conditions 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.439
 for example to the heart muscle 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.439
 or developing nerve cells 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.620
 The genetic material of these cells is identical to that of his donor 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.820
 the dreaded rejection reaction would not take place 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.669
 how meaningful will these stem cells be? 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.909
 There are alternatives to embryo research 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.109
 clear yes 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.499
 because epically completely harmless is the research with adult cells there 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.769
 no embryos need to be destroyed and because each one of us has these 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.369
 Has stem cells in the body 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:29.679
 these so-called adult adult stem cells are probably taking over 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.679
 For a lifetime repairing tasks in the organism 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:39.809
 At about 8 o'clock, muscles got fat in the bone marrow and started talking 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.809
 So far you have already found these clock cells 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:48.829
 Even these cells are said to have Cameleon imprisonment potential in a whole 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.469
 Transform palette of cell types 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.849
 the hopes are that you take a patient DB Rent and in the 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.849
 Laboratory isolated from it some of its most recent stem cells 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.790
 By appropriate measures could then count this clock to the desired 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.409
 Cell types are further developed 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.469
 The great advantage of the genetic material of these new cells would be genetic 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.379
 identical to that of the patient
