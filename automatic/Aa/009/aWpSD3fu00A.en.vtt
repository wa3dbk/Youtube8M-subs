well<00:00:11.030> this<00:00:11.450> is<00:00:11.630> where<00:00:11.840> I'm<00:00:11.990> up<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.290> with<00:00:12.500> my

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
well this is where I'm up to with my

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.740 
well this is where I'm up to with my
entry<00:00:13.010> for<00:00:13.190> the<00:00:13.310> sail<00:00:13.940> across<00:00:14.180> the<00:00:14.300> technique

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
entry for the sail across the technique

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.320 
entry for the sail across the technique
see<00:00:15.020> I<00:00:15.550> don't<00:00:16.550> know<00:00:16.700> if<00:00:16.790> I'm<00:00:16.880> gonna<00:00:17.030> get<00:00:17.180> it

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
see I don't know if I'm gonna get it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.210 
see I don't know if I'm gonna get it
finished<00:00:17.690> in<00:00:17.810> time<00:00:18.110> I've<00:00:18.680> got<00:00:18.920> a<00:00:18.950> lack<00:00:19.189> of

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
finished in time I've got a lack of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.019 
finished in time I've got a lack of
Parts<00:00:19.760> I<00:00:19.880> need<00:00:19.910> more<00:00:20.330> of<00:00:20.570> these<00:00:20.750> frames<00:00:22.029> go

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
Parts I need more of these frames go

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.540 
Parts I need more of these frames go
into<00:00:23.420> it<00:00:23.570> for<00:00:24.290> me<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.560> create<00:00:24.770> what<00:00:25.099> I'm<00:00:25.250> doing

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
into it for me to create what I'm doing

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.400 
into it for me to create what I'm doing
it's<00:00:25.670> very<00:00:26.000> complicated<00:00:26.810> very<00:00:27.230> technically

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
it's very complicated very technically

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.850 
it's very complicated very technically
challenging<00:00:30.410> for<00:00:30.739> me<00:00:31.810> hopefully<00:00:32.810> I'll<00:00:33.470> get<00:00:33.680> it

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
challenging for me hopefully I'll get it

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.700 
challenging for me hopefully I'll get it
done<00:00:34.070> but<00:00:34.310> it<00:00:34.610> doesn't<00:00:34.940> matter<00:00:35.000> if<00:00:35.180> I<00:00:35.360> don't

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
done but it doesn't matter if I don't

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.380 
done but it doesn't matter if I don't
I'll<00:00:36.710> still<00:00:37.100> be<00:00:37.250> working<00:00:37.399> on<00:00:37.700> this<00:00:37.910> oh<00:00:39.220> yeah

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
I'll still be working on this oh yeah

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.610 
I'll still be working on this oh yeah
I've<00:00:41.390> got<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.630> lack<00:00:41.840> of<00:00:41.870> parts<00:00:42.290> because<00:00:42.530> I've

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
I've got a lack of parts because I've

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.740 
I've got a lack of parts because I've
not<00:00:42.739> been<00:00:42.890> into<00:00:43.190> lego<00:00:43.609> technic<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.210> long<00:00:44.449> but

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
not been into lego technic that long but

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.619 
not been into lego technic that long but
what<00:00:45.649> of<00:00:45.859> trying<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.640> achieve<00:00:47.000> here<00:00:47.269> is<00:00:47.510> an

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
what of trying to achieve here is an

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.150 
what of trying to achieve here is an
amphibious<00:00:48.940> vehicle<00:00:50.079> which<00:00:51.079> will<00:00:51.440> be<00:00:51.739> able<00:00:51.890> to

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
amphibious vehicle which will be able to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.759 
amphibious vehicle which will be able to
go<00:00:52.789> into<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.179> water<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.750> fold<00:00:54.079> its<00:00:54.260> wheels<00:00:54.500> or

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
go into the water and fold its wheels or

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.369 
go into the water and fold its wheels or
completely<00:00:55.609> at<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.420> right<00:00:56.600> angle<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:57.109> what<00:00:57.260> they

completely at a right angle to what they

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.279 
completely at a right angle to what they
are<00:00:57.410> at<00:00:57.710> present<00:00:58.120> I'm<00:00:59.120> just<00:00:59.660> showing<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.109> this

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
are at present I'm just showing you this

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.900 
are at present I'm just showing you this
now<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.589> give<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:00.920> an<00:01:01.039> idea<00:01:01.100> of<00:01:01.339> where<00:01:01.640> I'm<00:01:01.789> up

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
now to give you an idea of where I'm up

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.180 
now to give you an idea of where I'm up
to<00:01:02.120> on<00:01:02.269> it<00:01:02.559> I've<00:01:03.559> been<00:01:03.679> working<00:01:04.010> on<00:01:04.070> the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
to on it I've been working on the

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.220 
to on it I've been working on the
mechanics<00:01:04.580> as<00:01:04.879> you<00:01:05.000> can<00:01:05.150> see<00:01:05.330> I've<00:01:05.420> got<00:01:05.449> full

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
mechanics as you can see I've got full

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.890 
mechanics as you can see I've got full
steering<00:01:06.740> on<00:01:06.890> this<00:01:06.920> thing<00:01:07.659> works<00:01:08.659> fine<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
steering on this thing works fine and

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.340 
steering on this thing works fine and
it's<00:01:11.900> actually<00:01:12.050> got<00:01:12.380> suspension<00:01:13.930> now<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
it's actually got suspension now the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.090 
it's actually got suspension now the
suspension<00:01:15.980> is<00:01:16.160> created<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.450> very

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
suspension is created in it a very

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.230 
suspension is created in it a very
interesting<00:01:19.100> way<00:01:20.110> these<00:01:21.520> these<00:01:22.520> shafts<00:01:22.910> here

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
interesting way these these shafts here

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.320 
interesting way these these shafts here
are<00:01:23.510> what<00:01:23.720> actually<00:01:24.140> turned<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.560> wheels<00:01:24.740> up

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
are what actually turned the wheels up

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.900 
are what actually turned the wheels up
so<00:01:26.800> they<00:01:27.800> are<00:01:27.980> connected<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.550> they've<00:01:28.760> got

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
so they are connected and they've got

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.210 
so they are connected and they've got
some<00:01:29.120> lateral<00:01:29.510> giving<00:01:29.990> them<00:01:30.230> with<00:01:30.860> them<00:01:31.040> being

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
some lateral giving them with them being

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.100 
some lateral giving them with them being
plastic<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:31.970> actually<00:01:32.150> gives<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.660> vehicle

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
plastic so it actually gives the vehicle

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.900 
plastic so it actually gives the vehicle
some<00:01:34.010> suspension<00:01:34.550> on<00:01:35.300> each<00:01:35.660> corner<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:37.280> it's

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
some suspension on each corner so it's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.700 
some suspension on each corner so it's
just<00:01:38.030> an<00:01:38.180> interesting<00:01:38.720> byproduct<00:01:39.440> of<00:01:39.530> what

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
just an interesting byproduct of what

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.440 
just an interesting byproduct of what
I've<00:01:39.830> created<00:01:40.010> that<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:40.970> um<00:01:41.120> strange

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
I've created that it's um strange

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.660 
I've created that it's um strange
suspension<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.890> it's<00:01:43.010> given<00:01:43.250> me<00:01:43.280> some<00:01:43.520> ideas

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
suspension and it's given me some ideas

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.700 
suspension and it's given me some ideas
for<00:01:44.240> putting<00:01:44.660> suspension<00:01:45.170> new<00:01:45.260> vehicles

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
for putting suspension new vehicles

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.850 
for putting suspension new vehicles
where<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:45.950> couldn't<00:01:46.160> normally<00:01:46.490> get<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.030> in

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
where you couldn't normally get it in

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.470 
where you couldn't normally get it in
you<00:01:48.860> could<00:01:49.010> have<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.160> very<00:01:49.400> flat<00:01:49.670> vehicle<00:01:50.120> using

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
you could have a very flat vehicle using

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.890 
you could have a very flat vehicle using
the<00:01:51.520> Flex<00:01:52.520> in<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.820> plastic<00:01:53.210> as<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> suspension

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
the Flex in the plastic as a suspension

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.980 
the Flex in the plastic as a suspension
you<00:01:54.200> need<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:54.560> give<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.740> some<00:01:55.360> suspension<00:01:56.360> but

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
you need to give it some suspension but

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.830 
you need to give it some suspension but
just<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.530> thought<00:01:57.680> anyway<00:01:58.060> i'll<00:01:59.060> show<00:01:59.300> you<00:01:59.360> ten

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
just a thought anyway i'll show you ten

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.450 
just a thought anyway i'll show you ten
wheels<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.230> is<00:02:00.350> just<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.680> rig<00:02:01.100> up<00:02:01.250> at<00:02:01.370> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
wheels this is just a rig up at the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.520 
wheels this is just a rig up at the

moment sock and show you how it works

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.800 
moment sock and show you how it works
this<00:02:03.800> won't<00:02:04.040> be<00:02:04.190> as<00:02:04.550> per<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.510> finished

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810

coughing but once this is running it
will<00:02:11.300> fold<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.720> wheels<00:02:12.050> or<00:02:12.349> as<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:13.099> can<00:02:13.250> see

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
will fold the wheels or as you can see

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.210 
will fold the wheels or as you can see
the<00:02:14.569> wheels<00:02:14.720> will<00:02:15.050> fall<00:02:15.230> right<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.830> into<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
the wheels will fall right up into the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.650 
the wheels will fall right up into the
vehicle<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.700> bonnet<00:02:17.000> will<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.209> across<00:02:17.420> here

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
vehicle the bonnet will be across here

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.350 
vehicle the bonnet will be across here
the<00:02:17.780> back<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.170> vehicle<00:02:18.349> over<00:02:18.740> here<00:02:18.890> and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the back of the vehicle over here and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.990 
the back of the vehicle over here and
hopefully<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.780> will<00:02:21.620> then<00:02:22.130> enable<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.760> be

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
hopefully that will then enable it to be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.800 
hopefully that will then enable it to be
a<00:02:23.210> water
