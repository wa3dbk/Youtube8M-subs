hybrid<00:01:05.760> picking<00:01:05.909> which<00:01:06.210> we've<00:01:06.360> talked<00:01:06.570> about

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
hybrid picking which we've talked about

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600 
hybrid picking which we've talked about
quite<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> bit<00:01:07.110> where<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> pick<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> g<00:01:08.310> string

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
quite a bit where you pick the g string

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.820 
quite a bit where you pick the g string
notes<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.390> pick<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.229> pluck<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.799> e

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
notes with your pick and you pluck the e

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.730 
notes with your pick and you pluck the e
string<00:01:11.189> notes<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:12.080> middle<00:01:13.080> finger<00:01:13.170> or

string notes with your middle finger or
anything<00:01:14.189> where<00:01:14.460> suppose<00:01:14.930> or<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.350> just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
anything where suppose or you can just

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.140 
anything where suppose or you can just
pick<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.160> I<00:01:17.190> think<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> example

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
pick them and I think in the example

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.850 
pick them and I think in the example
earlier<00:01:18.300> when<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.080> played<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.410> actually
