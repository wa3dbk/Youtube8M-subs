00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello I have nautas if you are looking for a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.990
 easy to carry laptop with 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.970
 a lot of autonomy or even a very 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.530
 full maybe this is the video that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.870
 have to see today let's talk about the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.870
 microsoft surface pro 3 we start 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.930
 back in 2012 microsoft was about 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.450
 to present a laptop that was going to be 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.700
 the host something very similar to a tablet 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.410
 with keyboard and everything and the truth is that 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.689
 we were all waiting very anxious 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.730
 for you is going to be our next tablet 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.830
 portable or whatever you want to call it good 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.360
 it turns out that it was presented and the 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.870
 truth is that it was a huge disappointment 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.860
 since it was a limited cut windows 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.350
 to the rc version and I also had a lot 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.420
 thickness a quite loose autonomy and 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.640
 other things that made it not anything 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.559
 appetizing in addition to its good price 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.300
 it turns out that now in its third 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.070
 version we find something 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.839
 truly drinkable and that makes us 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.610
 recover those good feelings 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.870
 that we had at that time we are going to 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.970
 talk about the features 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.100
 this device improves the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.409
 surface pro 2 the previous model by 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.500
 example on the screen since of the 10 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.390
 6 inches we jump at 12 also what 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.060
 does it in resolution since we are 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 exceeding the full hd more specifically 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.210
 We are talking about 2,160 x 1440 pixels 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.370
 the proportion of the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.080
 more panorama format screen 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.560
 we jump even a little more square and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.320
 successful to my liking which is 32 by the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.780
 side of the weight and size there are novelties 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.090
 important and relevant as 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.760
 example that lowers 100 grams with respect 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.340
 to the previous model staying at 800 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.350
 grams and that the thickness is something 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.360
 very important because until now the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.450
 surface were a billet a brick 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.240
 truly fat and unsightly low 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.120
 of the centimeter and we would stay in 91 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.430
 millimeters also something important is 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.260
 talk about support the support that goes 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.480
 just in the back that 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.670
 it improves quite a lot in the previous one we had 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.250
 few positions to put it and now 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.260
 we will be able to put on what many 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.030
 that will allow us a more comfortable use as 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.210
 for example when we use it on top of 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.440
 our legs also wanted to talk 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.300
 of the camera that improves quite 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.630
 because we are talking about that before 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.910
 you had a measly 12 megapixels 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.370
 now we jump to 5 so much from the side 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.680
 front as the rear what is not 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.570
 nothing bad on the other hand something also 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.570
 very important and is that it has 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.480
 usb port 3.0 what brings us 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.130
 rather more to what is a laptop and 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.540
 it also moves away from the tablets that 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.690
 usually not the inclusion and that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.370
 it really is a differentiating point 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.950
 will also have micro sd card 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.590
 to be able to expand memory what is not 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.210
 It's not bad and a mini display port 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.950
 that will help us to connect 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.500
 the tablet to any other device 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.380
 of image or basically a television 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.140
 a monitor or good can expand a little 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.730
 the display of the device 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.280
 if we talk about configurations here 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.920
 we also talked a little about the point 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.440
 differentiating this from this tablet's 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.630
 this laptop because it's going to be once 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.240
 that truly separates as it can 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.670
 have an intel processor and 3 or 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.170
 you can also count on a and 7 the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.220
 truth is that in so few dimensions 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.560
 it's surprising that between 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.210
 this type of processor and apparently 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.460
 they changed a bit of the system 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.790
 ventilation and so on and they did it a lot 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.910
 more efficient and they say not to heat 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.760
 So much that has to be seen in terms of 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.200
 prices and good and a little 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.090
 configurations that we could have 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.580
 we have to talk about what is the most 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.400
 cheap would be a and three with four 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.300
 gigabytes of ram and 64 gigabytes of 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.080
 internal memory 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.770
 ss of what is not bad by 799 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.690
 dollars would really be fine maybe a 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.850
 little cheaper but good is understood 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.280
 also that there are many is a lot 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.350
 machine inside devices so 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.930
 small for the more expensive side we have 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.070
 to talk about that we can have a 7 with 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.940
 8 gigabytes of ram and 512 gb of memory 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.010
 of storage ssd per thousand 949 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.410
 dollars there it does sting a bit the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.540
 pocket and you have to see how good so 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.609
 you can buy it not in my case 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.049
 particular I would really still prefer 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.130
 a tablet because I could add it for 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.110
 example a proprietary bony graphics card 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.210
 not the same included within the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.460
 processor what is happening in this 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.170
 case but anyway I imagine that 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.200
 this type of device will go very well 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.080
 for professionals who need a lot or 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.010
 be many possibilities to work 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.230
 to be able to edit images to work 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.390
 good with office and others without any kind 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.760
 of limitation and that can truly 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.340
 be truly positive if we speak 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.710
 also from others of another characteristic 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.810
 Differentiating the surface pro 3 and good 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.940
 of all the surface is to talk about your 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.770
 keyboard that in this case will not come 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.790
 built-in series but we have it 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.170
 to buy separately paying $ 129 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.260
 approximately what seems a bit 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.110
 expensive but good is a keyboard cover 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.140
 at the same time because it protects the screen 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.420
 It really is very good but I do not know 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.820
 if it is still the best option 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.240
 but it really is what is most 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.150
 about also going to have a 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.250
 and a stylus to use it 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.440
 and write about the one that will come included 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.150
 but if you want to buy it separately 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.660
 will leave approximately 49 with 99 dollars 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.340
 good one cent plus one cent less 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.770
 This comes included and improves a lot 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.840
 with respect to the previous models and 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.940
 that will have more definition so that 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.190
 when we press it is going to have a lot 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.620
 more sensitivity and it will also come with 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.360
 some options like a real pen 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.979
 of all life that when we squeeze 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.550
 directly it will turn on the 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.440
 device screen otherwise yes 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.479
 we have to talk about this this 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.220
 tablet more than anything what will be that 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.830
 to do is to try it to give our 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.409
 opinion and see what if there is something that I 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.270
 interest is very much what is the autonomy and 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.729
 is that we are going to have an autonomy 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.620
 truly important we are 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.530
 talking about about 89 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.930
 hours with a net difference of 6 o'clock 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.849
 7 that had the previous model and 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.130
 it's really going to be that the element 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.849
 differentiator does not make you really 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.259
 we can use a full windows 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:32.379
 without having to be running to 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.909
 Plug it in every two minutes just for 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.860
 the moment if you liked this video 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:37.869
 I like it if you did not know them 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.369
 subscribe to our channel more 

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:41.409
 information about this device and 

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:43.749
 others more on our techno nauta website 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.789
 puntocom I would also like to tell you about 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:48.129
 I wanted to know what is what 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.860
 You do not think if you would buy it this 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.819
 this or what other type of devices that 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.279
 comply with some characteristics 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:57.330
 similar would you buy now if we 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:57.330
 we see in the next video
