00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
they need to do seven strides if there's
four<00:01:40.770> strides<00:01:41.010> they<00:01:41.130> need<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.700> stride

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
four strides they need to do for stride

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
four strides they need to do for stride
so<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.660> have<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.900> have<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.080> knowledge<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
so they have to have the knowledge of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.990 
so they have to have the knowledge of
walking<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.190> ring<00:01:44.400> knowing<00:01:44.670> their

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
walking in that ring knowing their

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
walking in that ring knowing their
course<00:01:45.300> how<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> put<00:01:46.260> it<00:01:46.290> together<00:01:46.440> smoothly

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
course how to put it together smoothly

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.150 
course how to put it together smoothly
and<00:01:47.690> executing<00:01:48.690> that<00:01:48.750> round<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.260> way<00:01:49.290> they

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
and executing that round that way they

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.520 
and executing that round that way they
have<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.880> understand<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.050> ring<00:01:52.230> and<00:01:52.350> how<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
have to understand the ring and how to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.310 
have to understand the ring and how to
use<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.980> ring<00:01:53.130> by<00:01:53.280> using<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.700> whole<00:01:53.909> ring

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
use the ring by using the whole ring

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.510 
use the ring by using the whole ring
picking<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.500> good<00:01:55.680> canter<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> candidate

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
picking up a good canter the candidate

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.830 
picking up a good canter the candidate
fits<00:01:56.700> their<00:01:56.909> horse<00:01:57.120> whether<00:01:57.330> their<00:01:57.480> horse<00:01:57.659> has

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
fits their horse whether their horse has

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.240 
fits their horse whether their horse has

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to gallop a little bit if it's a little

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
to gallop a little bit if it's a little
bit<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.700> short<00:01:59.970> strata<00:02:00.390> doors<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.900> where

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
bit of a short strata doors or where

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.600 
bit of a short strata doors or where
there's<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> horse<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.830> could<00:02:02.010> can<00:02:02.220> or<00:02:02.340> slowly

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
there's a horse that could can or slowly

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.850 
there's a horse that could can or slowly
around<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.480> big<00:02:03.780> tall<00:02:04.020> horse<00:02:04.260> so
