00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
really last long in this game and this

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.449 
really last long in this game and this
map<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.930> mean<00:02:51.110> generally<00:02:51.650> because<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.280> lot<00:02:52.430> of

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
map I mean generally because a lot of

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.580 
map I mean generally because a lot of
people<00:02:52.550> use<00:02:52.880> LMG<00:02:53.420> than<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:53.690> map<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.170> they

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
people use LMG than this map and they

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.020 
people use LMG than this map and they
take<00:02:54.830> him<00:02:54.950> down<00:02:55.160> within<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:55.970> matter<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.300> seconds

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
take him down within a matter of seconds

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.190 
take him down within a matter of seconds
but<00:02:59.030> apparently<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.450> decided<00:02:59.750> not<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.019> do<00:03:00.110> with

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
but apparently I decided not to do with

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.430 
but apparently I decided not to do with
this<00:03:00.470> game<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.630> guy<00:03:02.780> right<00:03:02.900> there<00:03:02.959> who

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
this game and that guy right there who

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.140
