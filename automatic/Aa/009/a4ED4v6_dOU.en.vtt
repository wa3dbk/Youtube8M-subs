00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.150
 what's up guys 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.820
 we are here again in the fitch club 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:15.760
 making videos and there for you 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.540
 As our friend, nothing happened there. I said nothing. 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:26.430
 do not show that this valuable wine year 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.430
 2000 making the small injection review 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.260
 the light was just coming on 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.530
 we are in maintenance and are 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.670
 Radiator Completion 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.400
 and we found that sinking soon was not 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.230
 Working 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.230
 was replaced and the probe 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.480
 however 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.540
 a little result the module is with 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.240
 problem and showed that it is happening 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.240
 on here 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.640
 the tool actually two times a 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.520
 store adoption 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.520
 we have here in our philosophy 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.860
 and if in addition to the two pilots speaking this 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.250
 tool is connected directly to the waves 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.930
 proving there what the soy is in 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.910
 perfect state 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:32.820
 there is zero km and here in our 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.820
 history is getting connected too 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.930
 and the waves 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.520
 is practically locked in Kenya 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.990
 maurice cana 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:49.220
 that means in the counterpart 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.880
 Let's make your paper read. 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.880
 broadband 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.719
 This little device is a lot and 15 devices 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.880
 the planan you turn on and on the battery 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.709
 he has the positive and negative 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.270
 Do you have a godmother? 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.420
 would be able to respond quickly to the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.420
 construction 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 we take a quick and still spare 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.180
 there you have how to read the lambda probe 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.180
 independent of scandal 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.170
 the appliance will never 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.310
 the girl low cost 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:38.989
 devices and it comes even to 150 reais in 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:41.330
 market in italy 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.050
 OK 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.380
 and this is it people 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.260
 the ball show paralysis so he 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.040
 will have to be replaced or make a 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.040
 repair in the middle 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.220
 It's been a long time since Mr. 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.080
 it's not enough just to have you have a scanner 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.610
 you have to have too 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.610
 the band sound simulator 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:26.620
 the lambda probe is wired to 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:30.520
 probe in the case is that probe 0 and 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 there is also how you can simulate a mixture 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:40.120
 rich people push there walking in a 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.440
 side and making the mixture rich mixture 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.760
 rich 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.420
 that sign the galley is not going the way 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.790
 is not processing sign 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.790
 this way it's not processing national 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.610
 and have as you stand less cro cop 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.610
 that does not yet debuted in the cup 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.920
 This signal is not coming in the module. 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.040
 jn 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.910
 there it 's normal now 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.890
 the lambda probe professes a band for 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.290
 module 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.520
 however the mode is not calculating the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.520
 ideal mix 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:41.889
 the module is doing its part that is 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.349
 adjusting the mix came in 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.830
 any situation and in any 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.830
 temperature 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.770
 and thats it guys another video without leaving 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:02.990
 from the fitch globe 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.050
 Direct Friends of cuf you and 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:10.539
 youtube 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.539
 earned guys a hug even more
