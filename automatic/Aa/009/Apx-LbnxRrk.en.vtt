 divided into two or three portions 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 Let's start right away 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.430
 with your lean quark or 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.930

 it tastes best or gives fruit 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 I would definitely recommend it 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.539
 in addition to give a banana 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.160
 it just suits the sweet ones alone 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.510
 perfection to the recipe otherwise can 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.219
 then a little nuts or 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.590
 For example, almonds or admit 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.329
 pasanen cinnamon I have a few more 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.980
 raisins after that comes the ball brought the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.290
 Tengelmann as normal or here too 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 instructions here towards wrote the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 Whole gives to your remaining 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.890
 In addition, ingredients mix well that way 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.070
 Look what happens then I would still 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.600
 give a little cinnamon to something 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.490
 Lemon juice and then he could still for 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.360
 the look and taste with a few 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.920
 other fruits 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.479
 For example, I have a grape here 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.869
 and add a little pipi 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.220
 in addition also a few nuts at the top 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.229
 just a little bit for the quandts 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.360
 It seemed natural to me at the end 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.450
 the ball sprinkles are not missing 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.030
 and that's how awesome the whole thing is 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.009

 delicious breakfast recipe for me 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.380

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.630
 meal a day 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.250
 I think it's extremely important that you 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 for example there is a lot of variation 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.909
 so for example here different 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.829
 plant species one in his 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.030
 Breakfast can bring different 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.250
 things that you can get to know again 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.870
