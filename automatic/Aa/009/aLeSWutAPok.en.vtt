 hand 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.760
 the deborah colker dance company that was in great pitch this week 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.840
 presented in the municipal theater his new show 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.490
 with 16 dancers on the other scene deals with human relations with the lyricism that 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.930
 a technique that is already a reference in Brazil and abroad 'but to reach 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.960
 this level of quality the dancers of deborah colker dance companies 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.329
 eight hours a day whether or not they are in season the producer of the group 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.260
 gleison teixeira opened one of the essays for the duty to see closely how 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.120
 the daily life of this group that is internationally respected are 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.600
 how many bandarin 12 technical professionals currently working 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 are 16 shock dancers 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.940
 bombarded two producers and five technicians of two tester 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.460
 I felt choreography 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.380
 in the specific case of cruel 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.740
 this is the same amount or varies according to the dispute 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.539
 wrong 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.329
 it was not exactly with the show inmates of the moment of laboring today 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.530
 in the day we were working known format in which 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.270
 we will do for example route next month the same number 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.160
 she works with the same name 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.070
 it's yours to work for how long to put on a show as cruel with the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.850
 others the companion in the document in the two years I left the conception helped me 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.270
 first time to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.829
 this relationship today works eight hours a day and its dancers 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.420
 work eight hours a day technique varies at times until death 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.659
 is a target but if not without weight no show unprecedented as we have 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.479
 nine repertoire shows if you have to make several names in the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.430
 At the moment we're going to leave a little bit of a little bit of another 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.260
 and this same program is already rehearsing the route that we are going 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.150
 to introduce next month 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.939
 generally with the dancers have to train 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.829
 when you echelon works in the quite varied canopy of abra likes them 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.630
 there were people there are circus people there are 20 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.189
 a lot of people nowadays came from the classic 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.199
 of the modern dance he already had dengue 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:17.859
 rumor or lisbela she likes to vary but everyone studied a classic 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.379
 all 31 was an action case too 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.310
 now 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.880
 the paranaense do treatment that did what they are preparing 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.310

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.510
 all that was that the rehearser I think yesterday did not go very well in the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.490
 Show 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.780

 they are doing they are getting ready with tonight's show you 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.729
 traveled with how many tons of equipment 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:57.849
 depends on the spectacle this is one of the lowest lvs order 7% sales of 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:58.880
 equipment 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.090
 now is the new for example are very on the 14th 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:12.549
 oo 4x4 also the route is already a little smaller and like this more or less 7 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.599
 ranges from seven to 14 years 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.039
 may reveal that the next goal project accompanies delay colker 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:22.169
 looking a bit because we too tired and that debut of the program there was 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.019
 It consumed us a lot 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.900
 much happened thanks to god the dell is very involved now consepe 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.070
 solemn 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.900
 and is that she's directed the show first woman and the first 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.550
 the show that the cirque de soleil 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.580
 2009 so until then she does not have new projects with the company the people 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.180
 goes on tour and continues to perform with the shows that have already 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.730
 there are when she comes back 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.279
 dulci person law and in 2009 and May 2009 that is when debuts there 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:58.279
 then she will start thinking about the new project I believe to debut in 2010 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.449
 or 2011 when there is usually the idea 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.979
 she comes out of it she shares the creation with the dancers or 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:09.109
 young man more or less sketched out of her mind as she wants the show 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.619
 It started as ugly as here works this process the two things she 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.819
 at the moment i have 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.650
 aligning that I want 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.330
 talk of this as she wanted to talk about 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.050
 relationships between people like me 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.090
 It's a lot about it and it says it's a deep show about love. 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.069
 because it's her are those people involves a lot of love 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.139
 and it's cruel to watch over a crowell about love 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.040
 berna to be a supporter of the tracks only in the hour jorginho of oak 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.840
 lighting 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.059
 year 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.059
 anyway costumes she used to change 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.960
 vary depending on the spectacle that made the film of reef samuel cirnansck there 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.849
 from Sao Paulo 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.939
 and that's when she starts talking to those partners who are bringing 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:03.770
 ideas 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.720
 and when this really starts it turns dancing there the dancers also 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.949
 It helps a lot 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.060
 and the two assistants carina mÃ©ndez since they eliminate attacked contribute a lot 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:17.259
 we also took a short break during the trial and were able to speak 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.270
 also with the dancers about their work as it is the routine of a 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.659
 ballet dancer 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.799
 we start with a ballet class every day at 10:30 a.m. 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.699
 so the ballet is our all over the world recipe here 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.870
 then we have another wing kim are also contemporary with mta 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.740
 bad allied people 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.710
 to predominate works because there is also much that hangs in 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.280
 walls fashion then you also have to have a support let's jump from here up 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.080
 nÃ© and then we have to leave until 6 and 15 in the interval we try 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.280
 give the name of the jihad and 45 minutes dalmo sena in the background the show that most 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.589
 marked in those 13 years 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:01.249
 it was not one of the last north 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.009
 the show we work with over 90 lambs 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.189
 are several more beautiful character settlings of the company also 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.979
 it's a great privilege 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.310
 It is an immense satisfaction. 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.599
 the fact 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.909
 because we know that the Brazilian dance scene there are very few 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.729
 professional companies, which is the dance company 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.249
 deborah colker then within a contingent of many talented boys 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.089
 whereas in Brazil 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:34.409
 rest assured that being here is a privilege
