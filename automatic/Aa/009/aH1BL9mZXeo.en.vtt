00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Let's resume a series of reports 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.240
 that we started some programs ago 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.880
 correct the driver's posture and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.050
 passengers to minimize risks in the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.240
 accident case 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.059
 and today we will talk about our most 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.390
 precious children 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.400
 save our children when you go 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.830
 transporting someone under the age of 8 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.539
 do the right thing 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.000
 some people do not take care 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 necessary and think that taking the child 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.969
 in the neck only the stroke is a way 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.730
 insurance in a collision with the adult will not 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.160
 to be able to hold on and he looks 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.710
 accommodate her and her son at the same feel 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.079
 on a beat he'll crush the kid 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.649
 are some more examples of recklessness 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.590
 which unfortunately still runs around like 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.989
 show the tests if the unforeseen event arises 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.300
 on the way the result can be tragic 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.969
 a child sitting without a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.370
 Rear-seat safety 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.050
 would be thrown against the panel 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.829
 imagine a little baby lying on the bench 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.559
 front 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.090
 In this simulation the damme suffered a strong 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.640
 blow on the head 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.350
 just look at an example of how dangerous it is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.720
 carrying a child in the bank 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.750
 forward on her lap she was also 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.729
 hit by the adult doll chair 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.250
 accommodated next to the driver in a 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 car that has air bag equipment 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.799
 designed the little dame against the accent 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.080
 to close check the test that shows the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.170
 effectiveness of the chair when it is well 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.360
 Used in traffic, you can not play 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.549
 with the safety of the children I will 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.479
 show you the correct way to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.759
 carry an emporium children only 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.430
 on the back seat clear board 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.229
 national transit system has established 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.710
 that the size of the seat should be 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.020
 according to the weight height age the baby 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.479
 comfort should be used by children of 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.369
 up to one year when they were weighing 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.979
 10 and 13 pounds 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.689
 the chair should be used from a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.820
 four years 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.399
 the lifting seat serves to 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.710
 children usually from four to seven 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.879
 years and a half 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.410
 Did you see how it should be done? 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.270
 children's transportation 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.430
 any other way of accommodation can 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.770
 jeopardize the safety of all 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.380
 inside the vehicle the driver who does not 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.890
 comply with the rule accumulates seven 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.380
 driver's license pay fine of 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.530
 $ 191 and still runs out of the car and goes 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.300
 learned and without that of joining four 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.610
 children who do not need the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.800
 seat in the back seat or leave 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.800
 two prey to the same equipment
