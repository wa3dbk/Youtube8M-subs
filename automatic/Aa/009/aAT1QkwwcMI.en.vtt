 walkie talkers hide noise in shabby 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.650
 scenery 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.990
 the walls 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.220
 one 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.970
 ready 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.970
 with the text checked 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.580
 friend 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:16.830
 rather for the text and because 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.319
 I am not the kind of people who would like stains 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.659
 on such a feat 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:39.400
 clothes as far as you can address on 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:39.400
 who can always play in the sun 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.580
 scenes of jealousy scenes of separation 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.580
 we are ready with the text checked 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.590
 Artificial tears are enough but like 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.260
 we must not cry 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.180
 can catch these roles 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:21.370
 we are not suitable and you are a taxi 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:27.200
 we try to honestly cry before I ask 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:32.050
 wrote to promise that our hero 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.050
 left at the end right now 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.800
 is ready 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.750
 as well as 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.750
 suddenly 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.750
 but 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.560
 me and us 3 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.990
 so 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.730
 the chords in these songs are very light therefore 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.989
 show them was not only survive 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.610
 our discussion here I want only 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.030
 explain how to play 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:32.210
 began their couplets here is the first chord and 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:36.620
 In general, all because the whole battle begins with 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.750
 bass strings saved you first 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.620
 jerk it depends on each chord 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.670
 but I will write it and then the battle 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.840
 here am 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.570
 we play it turns out four times to 4 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:55.160
 times different then first pull 5 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:58.220
 string you and fight and the next one is about 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:02.860
 what that is you play you on 6 country 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:06.890
 little finger clamp 4 your sixth string 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.520
 you pinch her little finger once 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.830
 jerking 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.070
 and then drew it again you can immediately 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.790
 same next time pinch on 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.570
 third fret 6 string 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:24.310
 and further gratia can also remove a 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:27.250
 the fourth time the second finger you lift 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.940
 from 4 strings to sixth 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:36.360
 play this same 6 base here the rest is all 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.360
 same usual chords thats all
