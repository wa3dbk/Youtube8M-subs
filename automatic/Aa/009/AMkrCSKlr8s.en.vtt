whilst<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.250> was<00:03:02.280> fasted<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:03.000> was<00:03:03.150> finding<00:03:03.360> that

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
whilst I was fasted I was finding that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.620 
whilst I was fasted I was finding that
the<00:03:03.780> energy<00:03:04.140> levels<00:03:04.790> were<00:03:05.790> very<00:03:05.970> smooth<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
the energy levels were very smooth and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.360 
the energy levels were very smooth and
constant<00:03:07.170> there<00:03:07.320> was<00:03:07.410> never<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.860> feelings

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
constant there was never like feelings

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.000 
constant there was never like feelings

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
of their feet and Talia da drilling that

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.640 
of their feet and Talia da drilling that
just<00:03:11.220> felt<00:03:11.430> constant<00:03:11.970> energy<00:03:12.170> always<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
just felt constant energy always in the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.199 
just felt constant energy always in the
fasted<00:03:14.010> period<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.610> wasn't<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.060> problem

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
fasted period so that wasn't a problem

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.600 
fasted period so that wasn't a problem
that's<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:16.020> really<00:03:16.320> good<00:03:16.440> thing<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.010> i<00:03:17.370> found

not
finally<00:06:14.030> as<00:06:14.150> well<00:06:14.330> i<00:06:14.360> found<00:06:14.600> that<00:06:15.520> another<00:06:16.520> one

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
finally as well i found that another one

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.190 
finally as well i found that another one
of<00:06:16.730> the<00:06:16.910> probably<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.390> wires<00:06:17.600> parchment<00:06:18.140> and
