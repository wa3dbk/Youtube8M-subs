00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to the video on the topic 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.160
 Inheritance of the blood group and the rieses 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.280
 Factors we first discuss the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 genetic bases the blood systems 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.680
 Then we clarify the terms domination 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 and multiplayer ali 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.189
 After the genetic basics 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 we have created one 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.439
 inheritance diagram here we go to the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 two cases with honesty and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:34.920
 cleanliness we come first 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.450
 blood groups of the abi 0 system the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.790
 blood groups depend on the severity 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.550
 or from the lack of certain structures 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 the so-called antigenic on the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.100
 surface of the red blood corpuscles so 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.340
 erythrocytes become antigenic 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 through different channels so 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 gene variants coded so it exists 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.789
 the alleles off and 0 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.920
 It should be noted that at 0 0 even 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.119
 no antigens on the surface 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.250
 are made basic to ask 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.920
 the blood groups have the look before the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 posted videos 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.530
 this video builds on these foundations 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.689
 videos on an important term in the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 related to the abi 0 blood groups 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.000
 system is the multiple ali 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 that means for a feature 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.880
 There are more than two variants in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.979
 in this case, and 0 and thus more than 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 two adele the blood group system abi 0 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.140
 will govern according to Mendelian 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.509
 inherited but there are accouterment the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.110
 alleles a and b are both dominant 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.820
 to whom it means when 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.210
 one or both of these alene present 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.909
 are 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.140
 then an antigen becomes a structure 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.790
 on which trained their troops 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.680
 therefore, a and b are 0 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.020
 dominant alleles 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.410
 the full movie and many more 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.450
 you can find on sofatutor.com about 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.260
 7,000 videos tell you what you are up to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.410
 Good grades need to know about testing 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.900
 your knowledge after every video real 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.900
 Teachers help you in daily live chat 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.760
 immediately with your problem

 You can also attend private lessons 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.380
 book your personal online tutor 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.590
 to dive deeper into a topic 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.470
 So we help you with your censorship without 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.080
 great effort to improve
