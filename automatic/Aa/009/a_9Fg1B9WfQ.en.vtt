00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
let's try out the TNT over here see how

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.499 
let's try out the TNT over here see how
the<00:01:50.570> thing<00:01:51.570> works<00:01:51.810> out<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.240> let's<00:01:54.240> just

see where is the flint and steel here

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
see where is the flint and steel here
does<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.540> give<00:01:57.719> any<00:01:57.869> animation<00:01:58.770> that's

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
does it give any animation that's
