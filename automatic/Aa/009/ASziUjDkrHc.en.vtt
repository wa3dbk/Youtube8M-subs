00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.809

 to the doctors of the chinese clinic was delivered 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.340
 the guy complained of persistent pain in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 stomach and itchy skin 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.770

 patient's body was captured by tape 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.390
 worms from the feet are heads everywhere 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.670
 the larvae of the parasite were swarming 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 as it turned out the Chinese ate every day 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 sashimi of and most likely it is 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.949
 the dish was soiled about the tapeworm eggs 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.439
 tapeworm is a tapeworm parasite 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.670
 these are long flat worms like 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.710
 white ribbon 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.619
 do not usually live in the human intestines 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.600
 get there from beef or pork 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.119
 they cause a person to be excessive 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.909
 appetite and indigestion pain 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.430
 there is little blood in the stomach sometimes insomnia and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.619
 nervous diseases tapeworms can 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.869
 wade and into the rest of the human body 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.380
 eventually get to the brain that

 amazon is considered among the locals 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.229
 the most dangerous fish irony is that it 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.390
 no more than 15 centimeters from most often 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.700
 just the size of a match of this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.490
 he is not interested in a bloodsucker 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 feeds on the blood of fish making their way into their bodies 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.210
 through the holes 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.729
 but the fish can confuse people in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.250
 urinating odor 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.799
 ammonia and the fish swims into the body 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.170
 thinking that this is another fish man 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.320
 naturally presence in him kandiru 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.049
 cause terrible pains in the end extract 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.319
 Candira is possible only with the operation 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.359
 if the operation is not 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.499
 will be produced during man time 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:18.829
 bullish pork chop will die 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:21.499
 tapeworm and cysticercosis most often tapeworm 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.700
 get into the brain less skeletal 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.920
 muscles and eyes 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.489
 longevity of the parasite in the brain 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.459
 from 5 to 30 years on our brain this parasite 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.609
 has a toxic effect causes 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.950
 inflammation and swelling at the time of the death of the worm 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.159
 begins to rot, which is also not good 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.299
 all this results in a deterioration of the psyche 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:46.010
 human depression neuroses begin 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.409
 hallucinations brain swelling and death 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.439

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.439
 catch swine or bull chains 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:56.780
 just swallowing the larvae of these parasites 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:59.780
 which are already contained in meat 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.730
 their pets 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.609
 see in a piece of meat in small 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.099
 whitish bubbles 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:09.079
 in China very often find creatures in 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.989
 human organisms there is such 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.599
 acne bath procedure is very popular 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.819
 in the celestial Khan need to remove 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.549
 layers of dead skin and rejuvenate 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.590
 often some nimble coal 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.949
 can creep into your bladder 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.319
 slippery through urethra 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.509
 narrow body of eel allows absolutely 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.030
 free to enter our bodies 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:34.729
 and very lucky if you can do 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.939
 operation quickly otherwise after a few 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:40.459
 o'clock there will be a terrible pain in the groin 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.340
 it is very important to know just like eel in us 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.269
 not useful he encroach on our bodies 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.599
 only if you urinate in water is there such 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.209
 ameba no galleria fowler is a creature 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.969
 lives in water and getting in the nose while bathing 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.909
 gets to the brain where breeds 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.259
 feeding on our brains almost always 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.299
 leads to death 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:05.629
 fortunately this contagion may exist 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.269
 only in very warm water more than 30 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.699
 degrees most interesting that amoeba is not 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.230
 dangerous if by mouth it turns out 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.260
 live 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.200
 acid kills her however enough 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.019
 one literally one in the nose to die 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.419
 after a couple of weeks without looking fuller 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.240
 causes rare but almost always 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.510
 mortal infection for 50 years in the usa 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.090
 only 132 people were infected from 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.550
 only three of them survived due to the high 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.210
 mortality no proven drugs for 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.910
 contagion 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.910
 I ask you to be careful on this all
