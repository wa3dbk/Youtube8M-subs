but Hebrew was actually a Phoenician
language<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:15.100> many<00:01:16.100> of<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.399> concepts<00:01:17.179> and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
language and many of the concepts and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.719 
language and many of the concepts and
ideas<00:01:17.509> which<00:01:18.140> are<00:01:18.289> expressed<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.340> Old

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
Testament are not original to the Old

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.469 
Testament are not original to the Old
Testament<00:01:24.799> they<00:01:24.950> were<00:01:25.009> it<00:01:25.580> goes<00:01:25.759> back<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.270> of

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
Testament they were it goes back to of

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.590 
Testament they were it goes back to of
even<00:01:26.930> further<00:01:27.350> back<00:01:27.710> into<00:01:27.950> ancient<00:01:28.220> history

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
even further back into ancient history

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.569 
even further back into ancient history
so<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.630> many<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.470> concepts<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.310> belief

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
so that many of the concepts and belief

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.060 
so that many of the concepts and belief
systems<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.270> Judaism<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.079> Christianity<00:01:33.350> are

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
systems and Judaism and Christianity are

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.679 
systems and Judaism and Christianity are
very<00:01:34.400> very<00:01:34.729> ancient<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:37.390> believe<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
very very ancient and I believe that the

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.420 
very very ancient and I believe that the
Bible<00:01:39.049> is<00:01:39.140> one<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.560> most<00:01:39.710> important<00:01:40.220> books

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
Bible is one of the most important books

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.819 
Bible is one of the most important books
on<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.790> earth<00:01:41.140> because<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.320> really<00:01:42.530> telling

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
on the earth because it's really telling

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.920 
on the earth because it's really telling
you<00:01:43.070> some<00:01:43.280> really<00:01:43.549> interesting<00:01:44.030> things<00:01:44.570> but

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
you some really interesting things but

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.260 
you some really interesting things but
if<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:45.950> don't<00:01:46.189> understand<00:01:46.670> how<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.880> read<00:01:47.119> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
if you don't understand how to read the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.819 
if you don't understand how to read the
symbols<00:01:47.659> that's<00:01:47.840> never<00:01:48.140> going<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.470> dawn<00:01:48.799> on

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
symbols that's never going to dawn on

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.429 
symbols that's never going to dawn on
you<00:01:49.159> how<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:49.549> stuff<00:01:49.820> works

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
you how this stuff works

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.770 
you how this stuff works
I<00:01:51.470> think<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.369> New<00:01:52.520> Testament<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.270> probably

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
I think the New Testament is probably

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.389 
I think the New Testament is probably
the<00:01:53.990> most<00:01:54.110> important<00:01:54.680> story<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.250> whole

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
the most important story in the whole

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.139 
the most important story in the whole
world<00:01:56.799> but<00:01:57.799> not<00:01:57.979> as<00:01:58.189> history<00:01:58.610> but<00:01:58.969> as<00:01:59.119> a

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
world but not as history but as a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.490 
world but not as history but as a
metaphor<00:01:59.840> as<00:02:00.110> an<00:02:00.439> encoded<00:02:01.310> message<00:02:02.320> but<00:02:03.320> let

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
metaphor as an encoded message but let

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.219 
metaphor as an encoded message but let
me<00:02:03.619> go<00:02:03.799> back<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:05.060> one<00:02:05.119> subject<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:06.079> I'm

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
the time and it was very well done

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.330 
the time and it was very well done
however<00:02:47.420> they<00:02:48.290> know<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:48.799> about<00:02:49.129> the
