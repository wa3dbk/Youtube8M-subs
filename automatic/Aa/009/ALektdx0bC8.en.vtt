00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
even little appetizer sizes first we

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.530 
even little appetizer sizes first we
start<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:37.890> ground<00:00:38.520> chuck<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.390> good

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
start with some ground chuck it's a good

start with some ground chuck it's a good
tip<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.379> you're<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.710> you're<00:00:40.860> making

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
tip to know when you're if you're making

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.530 
tip to know when you're if you're making
because<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> fat<00:00:41.670> content<00:00:41.940> I'd<00:00:42.270> say<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
because the fat content I'd say it's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.560 
because the fat content I'd say it's
about<00:00:42.600> 35%<00:00:43.230> fat<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.370> meat<00:00:44.579> ratio<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:45.390> put

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
about 35% fat to meat ratio we put

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.119 
about 35% fat to meat ratio we put
chopped<00:00:45.809> parsley<00:00:46.110> inside

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
chopped parsley inside

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.709 
chopped parsley inside
I<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> chopped<00:00:48.000> parsley<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.480> it'd<00:00:48.600> be

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
I like the chopped parsley and it'd be

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.360 
I like the chopped parsley and it'd be
very<00:00:48.750> very<00:00:49.260> rough<00:00:49.590> chop<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
very very rough chop because you get a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.639 
very very rough chop because you get a
lot<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.610> flavor<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.930> chlorophyll<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
lot more flavor of the chlorophyll the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.920 
lot more flavor of the chlorophyll the
parsley<00:00:53.219> flavor<00:00:53.520> spread<00:00:54.390> throughout<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
parsley flavor spread throughout the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
parsley flavor spread throughout the
meatball<00:00:55.320> rather<00:00:55.590> than<00:00:55.890> being<00:00:56.100> very<00:00:56.370> fine

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
meatball rather than being very fine

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
meatball rather than being very fine
chopped<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.449> kind<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.780> gets<00:00:57.899> lost<00:00:57.989> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
chopped and just kind of gets lost in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.119 
chopped and just kind of gets lost in
flavor<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.340> trick<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> meatball<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
flavor the trick to the meatball is

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.490 
flavor the trick to the meatball is
roasted<00:01:02.129> garlic<00:01:02.460> oil<00:01:02.940> gives<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> perfume<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
roasted garlic oil gives you perfume to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.719 
roasted garlic oil gives you perfume to
the<00:01:04.589> meatball<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> flavor<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.580> garlic

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the meatball with the flavor of garlic

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.510 
the meatball with the flavor of garlic
and<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:07.020> also<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.560> oil<00:01:07.770> while<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.250> cooking

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and then also the oil while I'm cooking

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
and then also the oil while I'm cooking
basically<00:01:09.210> pastes<00:01:09.600> inside<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.290> when<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> bite

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
basically pastes inside so when you bite

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.370 
basically pastes inside so when you bite
it<00:01:10.799> into<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.310> nice<00:01:11.549> nice<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.240> juicy<00:01:12.420> make<00:01:13.200> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it into it's nice nice and juicy make it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.890 
it into it's nice nice and juicy make it
you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.130> take<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> peeled<00:01:14.909> garlic<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:15.840> a

you can take you the peeled garlic or a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600 
you can take you the peeled garlic or a
whole<00:01:16.409> clove<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> garlic<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.250> probably<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
whole clove of garlic is probably the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
whole clove of garlic is probably the
easiest<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.270> home<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> neutral<00:01:20.009> oil<00:01:20.369> like

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
easiest at home I use a neutral oil like

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429 
easiest at home I use a neutral oil like
a<00:01:20.670> canola<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:21.360> vegetable<00:01:21.659> oil<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.320> an

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.110 
cold roasted whipped eggplant it is a
style<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:30.380> learned<00:03:30.650> being<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.550> Istanbul

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
style that I learned being in Istanbul

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.180 
style that I learned being in Istanbul
what<00:03:32.390> we're<00:03:32.540> doing<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:32.870> basically<00:03:33.320> roasting

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
what we're doing is basically roasting

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.460 
what we're doing is basically roasting
the<00:03:34.340> whole<00:03:34.520> eggplant<00:03:35.330> on<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.050> grill<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the whole eggplant on on the grill the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.090 
the whole eggplant on on the grill the
idea<00:03:36.800> is<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.040> get<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.220> very<00:03:37.520> tender<00:03:37.850> inside

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
idea is to get a very tender inside

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.350 
idea is to get a very tender inside
charring<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.250> outside<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.970> give<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> little

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
charring the outside to give a little

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.930 
charring the outside to give a little
bit<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.600> smoky<00:03:42.110> essence<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.190> eggplant<00:03:43.730> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
bit of smoky essence to the eggplant and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.170 
bit of smoky essence to the eggplant and
a<00:03:44.480> key<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.260> dish<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:46.220> think<00:03:46.550> is<00:03:46.640> trying<00:03:47.000> to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
a key to the dish I think is trying to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.270 
a key to the dish I think is trying to
find<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.570> smallest<00:03:48.230> egg<00:03:48.530> plan<00:03:48.830> you<00:03:49.070> can

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
find the smallest egg plan you can

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.100 
find the smallest egg plan you can
smaller<00:03:49.970> ones<00:03:50.270> have<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.540> little<00:03:50.840> bit<00:03:50.930> less

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
smaller ones have a little bit less

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.220 
smaller ones have a little bit less
seeds<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.890> do<00:03:52.850> better<00:03:53.120> for<00:03:53.510> have<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.780> smoother

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
seeds and do better for have a smoother

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.350

experience<00:03:54.920> how<00:03:55.670> long<00:03:55.880> do<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.060> think<00:03:56.180> it

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
experience how long do you think it

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.990 
experience how long do you think it
takes<00:03:56.510> probably<00:03:57.020> half<00:03:57.950> hour<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.550> skin<00:03:58.850> will

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
takes probably half hour the skin will

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.420 
takes probably half hour the skin will
start<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.510> blister<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.560> can<00:04:00.950> peel<00:04:01.190> right

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430
