when I get involved in project it tends
to<00:00:12.120> get<00:00:12.330> rather<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.490> messy<00:00:14.490> those<00:00:15.360> are<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.509> two

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
to get rather a messy those are the two

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.300 
to get rather a messy those are the two
parts<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> case<00:00:16.470> still<00:00:16.770> got<00:00:16.920> lots<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.250> work

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
parts of the case still got lots of work

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.099 
parts of the case still got lots of work
to<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.820> those<00:00:17.970> don't<00:00:18.600> look<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:18.750> much<00:00:19.050> at

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
to do on those don't look like much at

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.410 
to do on those don't look like much at
the<00:00:19.320> moment<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.740> hey<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.189> will<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.490> there's

there's<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.460> TI<00:01:29.729> card<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
there's a little TI card for all so

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.170 
there's a little TI card for all so
that's<00:01:31.680> three<00:01:32.070> point<00:01:32.340> two<00:01:32.520> volts<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that's three point two volts I think it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.810 
that's three point two volts I think it
gives<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.049> moment<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.610> say<00:01:35.790> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
gives out the moment and just to say it
