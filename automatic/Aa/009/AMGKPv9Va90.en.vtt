what up guys johnathan here with TLD and

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.940 
what up guys johnathan here with TLD and
I<00:00:03.149> got<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> setup<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.899> demonstration<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
I got a setup and demonstration of the

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.099 
I got a setup and demonstration of the
Apple<00:00:05.370> Thunderbolt<00:00:05.520> Display<00:00:06.000> alongside<00:00:06.720> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
Apple Thunderbolt Display alongside the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.290 
Apple Thunderbolt Display alongside the
2011<00:00:07.770> 13-inch<00:00:08.309> MacBook<00:00:08.550> Air

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
2011 13-inch MacBook Air

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.030 
2011 13-inch MacBook Air
now<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.780> backside<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.469> guy<00:00:10.650> there's<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
now the backside of this guy there's the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.860 
now the backside of this guy there's the
power<00:00:11.219> source<00:00:11.580> which<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.000> detachable<00:00:12.540> that's

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
power source which is detachable that's

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.419 
power source which is detachable that's
going<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> go<00:00:13.200> into<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.590> wall<00:00:13.799> there's

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
going to go into the wall there's

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.039 
going to go into the wall there's
actually<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> little<00:00:15.120> breakout<00:00:15.599> cable<00:00:15.929> which

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
actually a little breakout cable which

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.599 
actually a little breakout cable which
extends<00:00:16.529> into<00:00:16.710> two<00:00:16.890> ends<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.400> have<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
extends into two ends so you have the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.519 
extends into two ends so you have the
Thunderbolt<00:00:18.000> cable<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.600> side<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
Thunderbolt cable on one side and the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.500 
Thunderbolt cable on one side and the
MagSafe<00:00:19.800> power<00:00:20.100> source<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.060> other<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.359> not

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
MagSafe power source on the other so not

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.939 
MagSafe power source on the other so not
only<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> connect<00:00:22.859> via

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
only is it going to connect via

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.290 
only is it going to connect via
Thunderbolt<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.670> also<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> power

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
Thunderbolt it's also going to power

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.630 
Thunderbolt it's also going to power
both<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> display<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.800> MacBook<00:00:25.980> off<00:00:26.369> one

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
both the display and the MacBook off one

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.759 
both the display and the MacBook off one
power<00:00:26.849> source<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.109> add<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.470> about

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
power source so if we add up to about

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.759 
power source so if we add up to about
this<00:00:28.920> Mac<00:00:29.060> go<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> more<00:00:30.359> info<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.470> will<00:00:31.590> see

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
this Mac go to more info you will see

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.350 
this Mac go to more info you will see
that<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.279> MacBook<00:00:32.610> Air<00:00:32.730> hooked<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
that it is the MacBook Air hooked up to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.500 
that it is the MacBook Air hooked up to
so<00:00:33.570> MacBook<00:00:33.989> Air<00:00:34.170> 13-inch<00:00:34.829> mid-2011<00:00:35.510> 1.7

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
so MacBook Air 13-inch mid-2011 1.7

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
so MacBook Air 13-inch mid-2011 1.7
gigahertz<00:00:36.780> Intel<00:00:37.649> Core<00:00:37.920> i5<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
gigahertz Intel Core i5 so that's the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
gigahertz Intel Core i5 so that's the
machine<00:00:39.030> except<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.450> tucked<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
machine except it tucked up to the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
machine except it tucked up to the
Thunderbolt<00:00:40.710> displays<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.730> exit<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
Thunderbolt displays so if we exit that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.290 
Thunderbolt displays so if we exit that
head<00:00:42.840> over<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> System<00:00:43.710> Preferences<00:00:44.300> you'll

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
head over to System Preferences you'll

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.490 
head over to System Preferences you'll
see<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.140> actually<00:00:46.289> have

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
see right here we actually have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590 
see right here we actually have
independent<00:00:47.250> control<00:00:47.340> I'll<00:00:48.090> drag<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.450> over

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
independent control I'll drag this over

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.389 
independent control I'll drag this over
so<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.110> I'm<00:00:49.350> also<00:00:49.530> sharing<00:00:49.920> screens

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
so you can see I'm also sharing screens

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.779 
so you can see I'm also sharing screens
over<00:00:50.809> both<00:00:51.809> displays<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
over both displays so for this one the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.729 
over both displays so for this one the
MacBook<00:00:54.120> Air<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.300> resolution<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:54.989> 1440<00:00:55.710> by

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
MacBook Air the resolution is 1440 by

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.500 
MacBook Air the resolution is 1440 by
900<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.699> independent<00:00:57.000> brightness

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
900 we have independent brightness

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.830 
900 we have independent brightness
control<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> Thunderbolt<00:00:59.309> Display

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
control and for the Thunderbolt Display

control and for the Thunderbolt Display
2560<00:01:00.840> by<00:01:00.989> 1440<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.829> again<00:01:02.100> brightness

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
2560 by 1440 and again brightness

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.250 
2560 by 1440 and again brightness
control<00:01:03.030> over<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
control over this one now if we go to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
control over this one now if we go to
the<00:01:04.470> arrangement<00:01:05.070> how<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.119> set<00:01:06.360> up

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the arrangement how I have it set up

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.910 
the arrangement how I have it set up
right<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.140> white<00:01:07.470> bar<00:01:07.710> across

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
right now this little white bar across

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 
right now this little white bar across
the<00:01:08.040> top<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.369> indicates<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.150> primary

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the top that indicates what the primary

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
the top that indicates what the primary
display<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.650> my<00:01:10.740> main<00:01:10.950> display<00:01:11.340> so

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
display is so this is my main display so

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.630 
display is so this is my main display so
for<00:01:11.760> example<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> wanted<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> open<00:01:13.200> up

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
for example if I wanted to open up

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.039 
for example if I wanted to open up
launchpad<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> show<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.900> this

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
launchpad it's going to show up on this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.560 
launchpad it's going to show up on this
display<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.549> back<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.360> set

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
display now if I go back to this is set

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
display now if I go back to this is set
up<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> right-to-left<00:01:19.560> Thunderbolts<00:01:20.130> flight

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
up to right-to-left Thunderbolts flight

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.859 
up to right-to-left Thunderbolts flight
to<00:01:20.580> MacBook<00:01:20.939> Air<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> other

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
to MacBook Air this was on the other

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.190 
to MacBook Air this was on the other
side<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.290> switch<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:22.979> example<00:01:24.200> but

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
side I can switch it for example but

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
side I can switch it for example but
since<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> left<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.460> want<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.729> on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
since this is on the left I want this on

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.679 
since this is on the left I want this on
the<00:01:26.939> left-hand<00:01:27.299> side<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:29.280> drag

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
the left-hand side that way if I drag

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
the left-hand side that way if I drag
screens<00:01:30.689> over<00:01:30.930> there<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:32.250> goes<00:01:32.490> solid<00:01:32.759> like

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
screens over there it goes solid like

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
screens over there it goes solid like
that<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.229> cool<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.770> top<00:01:35.040> of

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
examples set up so I'm gonna go and open

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.979 
examples set up so I'm gonna go and open
this<00:02:53.970> up<00:02:54.170> as<00:02:55.170> far<00:02:55.350> as<00:02:55.470> 720p<00:02:56.310> right<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.270> keep

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
this up as far as 720p right here keep

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.229 
this up as far as 720p right here keep
in<00:02:58.110> mind<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> rectangle<00:02:59.280> at<00:02:59.400> 720p<00:03:00.000> not

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
in mind this is a rectangle at 720p not

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.699 
in mind this is a rectangle at 720p not
that's<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.540> top<00:03:00.720> not<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.350> left<00:03:01.560> so

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
that's on top not this to the left so

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.610 
that's on top not this to the left so
