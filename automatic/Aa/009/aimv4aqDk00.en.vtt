front<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> back<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.360> 9<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.810> 10<00:01:34.020> grains

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
front of the back here so 9 or 10 grains

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.649 
front of the back here so 9 or 10 grains
is<00:01:34.979> another<00:01:35.250> good<00:01:35.460> piece<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> wood<00:01:35.970> different

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
is another good piece of wood different

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.090 
is another good piece of wood different
bats<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.140> different<00:01:37.409> styles<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.740> players<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
bats for different styles of players and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.319 
bats for different styles of players and
that<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.549> what's<00:01:38.700> lessons<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
that really is what's lessons are up to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
that really is what's lessons are up to
these<00:01:39.450> days<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.200> also<00:01:40.380> mentioned<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.100> pad

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
these days you also mentioned this pad

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.920 
these days you also mentioned this pad
is<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.759> being<00:01:42.090> won<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> top<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> range

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
is is being won at the top of the range

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.230 
is is being won at the top of the range
now<00:01:43.409> what's<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.890> different<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
now what's so different about it it is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.240 
now what's so different about it it is
well<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> mean<00:01:45.630> over<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> years<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.979> players

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
well I mean over the years some players

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.920 
well I mean over the years some players
you<00:01:47.399> say<00:01:47.520> pad<00:01:47.700> more<00:01:47.850> than<00:01:48.000> others<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.270> but

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you say pad more than others and but

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
you say pad more than others and but
ultimately<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> will<00:01:49.530> stop<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.950> getting<00:01:50.579> leg

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
ultimately it will stop you getting leg

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.490 
ultimately it will stop you getting leg
injuries<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.750> key<00:01:51.899> thing<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.290> one

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
injuries the key thing with this one

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
injuries the key thing with this one
that<00:01:52.829> has<00:01:53.369> injured<00:01:53.610> manage<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.570> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that has injured manage to do is to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.569 
that has injured manage to do is to
provide<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.229> impact<00:01:55.649> protection<00:01:55.799> socket

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
provide this impact protection socket

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.039 
provide this impact protection socket
which<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> middle<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
which is just at the middle here and the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.990 
which is just at the middle here and the
idea<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:58.680> knee<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.159> kneecap<00:01:59.640> fits

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
idea is that your knee your kneecap fits

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.030 
idea is that your knee your kneecap fits
right<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.350> anything<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
right in there so that anything that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.160 
right in there so that anything that
hits<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> point<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> pad<00:02:03.270> here

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
hits you on the point of the pad here

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
hits you on the point of the pad here
won't<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.920> sort<00:02:05.430> between<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.119> padding<00:02:06.479> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
won't go sort between the padding and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.050 
won't go sort between the padding and
caused<00:02:07.259> any<00:02:07.469> damage<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.129> knee<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.879> yeah

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
caused any damage on your knee but yeah

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.380 
caused any damage on your knee but yeah
good<00:02:09.209> all-round<00:02:09.539> pad<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:09.869> stairs

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
good all-round pad from stairs

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.090 
good all-round pad from stairs
again<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.840> kid<00:02:10.990> has<00:02:11.140> really<00:02:11.590> really<00:02:11.860> liked

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
again the kid has really really liked

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.400 
again the kid has really really liked
and<00:02:12.310> I'm<00:02:13.150> sure<00:02:13.330> it'll<00:02:13.510> it'll<00:02:13.810> fit<00:02:14.230> really<00:02:14.319> well

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and I'm sure it'll it'll fit really well

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.280 
and I'm sure it'll it'll fit really well
with<00:02:14.620> our<00:02:14.709> top-of-the-range<00:02:15.100> cricketers

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
with our top-of-the-range cricketers

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.050 
with our top-of-the-range cricketers
finally<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.680> move<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.130> these<00:02:18.250> graphs<00:02:18.610> with

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
finally we move on to these graphs with

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.390 
finally we move on to these graphs with
the<00:02:19.240> special<00:02:19.750> protection<00:02:19.870> now<00:02:20.290> I'm<00:02:21.010> guessing

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
the special protection now I'm guessing

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.710 
the special protection now I'm guessing
but<00:02:21.520> I'm<00:02:21.610> guessing<00:02:21.760> it's<00:02:22.000> for<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> right-hander

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
but I'm guessing it's for a right-hander

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.650 
but I'm guessing it's for a right-hander
yes<00:02:23.440> you're<00:02:23.709> right<00:02:23.860> eventually<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.670> also<00:02:25.300> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
yes you're right eventually it also the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.699 
yes you're right eventually it also the
interesting<00:02:25.810> here<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.260> this<00:02:26.470> would<00:02:26.620> be<00:02:26.680> a

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
interesting here is that this would be a

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:27.900 
interesting here is that this would be a
Glover<00:02:26.920> pulled<00:02:27.220> collar<00:02:27.400> would<00:02:27.550> work<00:02:27.760> would

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
Glover pulled collar would work would

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.000 
Glover pulled collar would work would
wear<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.300> just<00:02:29.080> Rachel<00:02:29.320> he's<00:02:29.410> had<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.530> finger

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
wear and just Rachel he's had a finger

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.340 
wear and just Rachel he's had a finger
injury<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.580> when<00:02:30.970> he's<00:02:31.180> batting<00:02:31.690> these<00:02:32.200> were

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
injury so when he's batting these were

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.860 
injury so when he's batting these were
the<00:02:32.500> fingers<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.070> are<00:02:33.160> nearest<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:34.690> bat

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
the fingers that are nearest to the bat

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.390 
the fingers that are nearest to the bat
so<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.200> he's<00:02:35.350> actually<00:02:35.530> batting<00:02:36.070> then

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
so as he's actually batting then

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.640 
so as he's actually batting then
there'll<00:02:36.880> be<00:02:36.940> extra<00:02:37.780> protection<00:02:38.170> across<00:02:38.350> here

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
there'll be extra protection across here

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.410 
there'll be extra protection across here
to<00:02:38.830> prevent<00:02:39.430> him<00:02:39.670> from<00:02:39.700> getting<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.239> worse

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
to prevent him from getting a worse

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.910 
to prevent him from getting a worse
finger<00:02:40.810> injury<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.110> lot<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.319> players<00:02:41.500> over<00:02:41.739> time

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
finger injury a lot of players over time

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.370 
finger injury a lot of players over time
have<00:02:42.069> used<00:02:42.310> extra<00:02:43.000> padding<00:02:43.390> on<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.600> area<00:02:43.959> but

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
have used extra padding on this area but

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.080 
have used extra padding on this area but
it<00:02:44.530> does<00:02:44.680> mean<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:44.920> it'll<00:02:45.220> it'll<00:02:45.670> stop<00:02:45.970> his

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
it does mean that it'll it'll stop his

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.030 
it does mean that it'll it'll stop his
fingers<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.480> I'm<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.720> bit<00:02:47.110> damaged<00:02:47.530> from
