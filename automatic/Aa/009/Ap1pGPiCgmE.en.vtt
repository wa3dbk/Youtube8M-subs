00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.859
 to make this night card bits of 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:09.460
 heart, let's see the few materials that 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.460
 we will need 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.100
 we will need water cardboard for linen or 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.220
 some material that is resistant but 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.920
 that you can fold and optional are leaves 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.940
 black and red 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.940
 a rule 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.369
 a red and black down but in this case 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.329
 it is important that the red down is more 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.329
 big that black 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 scissors or cutter 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.530
 an eraser 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.010
 pencil and optional glue on bar or 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.289
 double-sided tape 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.239
 we started by making a grid about 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.399
 the cardboard in my case I'm going to do it 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.559
 of 1 centimeter but if you want to do 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.170
 bigger the letter you just have to 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.360
 increase the measure a little bit by either 1.5 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.869
 or 2 centimeters the joke is that you have 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.729
 22 squares long and 10 wide 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.409
 after you marked 22 lines at 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.450
 long at the top we're going to 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.210
 mark also on the bottom and 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 then we will mark 10 lines as 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.450
 width 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.930
 these marks will also be made on the side 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.930
 contrary 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.049
 and now we just have to join the lines that 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.960
 we just marked having as 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.780
 result a grid of 22 squares 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.230
 long and 10 wide 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.210
 do not 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.700
 now let's do our heart 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.930
 we started leaving 2 free squares and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.930
 to the third we are going to mark 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.009
 we will cover three squares down 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.460
 and now in the second line we are going to 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.850
 leave a free square and the second 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.160
 we mark 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.550
 three squares below we're going to go back 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.550
 to mark 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.280
 in the third and fourth line we will cover 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.319
 the first two squares 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.510
 and in the third line we will cover the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.220
 seventh square that is below and in the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.220
 fourth line we will cover the eighth 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.100
 in the fifth line we will cover the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.100
 second square 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.569
 and in the sixth line we go to the third 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.569
 square to mark 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.340
 returning to the fifth row we are going to 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.200
 mark a square below and to the right 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.940
 and now you just have to invest what 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.459
 we just did to be able to form the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.200
 full heart do not worry if you do not 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.090
 the squares are so exact 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.489
 then we're going to make this 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.069
 card can I suggest you two options the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.470
 first is to paint it all with markers or 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.230
 the second is that you make the molds on 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.940
 a sheet of black or red color and then 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.459
 the cuts and hit it on your 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.440
 white card as I will do with 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.299
 down to not be so slow we go 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.660
 to start painting what we just 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.660
 mark 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.490
 and now let's reflect our heart 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.560
 doing another one the other side let's go 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.570
 to start cutting the pure contour in 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.990
 this case you have two options to use the 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.360
 scissors or the exact 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.790
 a technique that I use at the moment of 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.490
 employ the exact one is that always cuts 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.680
 from inside to outside inside 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.650
 outward like this you will not happen and not 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.750
 you will tell another thing 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.500
 we started by erasing the lines that 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.500
 we made the pencil 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.810
 then we make a line almost half 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.810
 of the heart that is on the left side 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.240
 and now comes something interesting in my 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.780
 case I will draw lines with me more 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.520
 thick vertical and horizontally since 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.530
 when painting with down it is difficult then 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.150
 everything is the same color at the end 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.010
 you will have a very father effect of 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.010
 squares that go very well with the style 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.919
 for the other heart we will do the same 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.259
 just that before we are going to mark a 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.310
 rectangle of 2 squares and the rest what 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.310
 let's paint in red 

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:36.440
 d 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.440
 in the west 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.820
 as a result we will have this I have already 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.920
 painted on the outside and the part 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.810
 back in my case I'll put it in color 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.440
 red but you can make it black or 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.440
 other color 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.870
 to make the lines for the part of 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.700
 outside is very easy since you can 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.380
 help you from the cuts that are left of 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.380
 do and so draw the lines 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.910
 to finish you just have to write in 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.950
 our letter 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.410
 at the time of writing the sentence you can 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.090
 play with the theme of the letter 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.100
 you can put the phrase that I have here or 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.380
 you can put you are the piece of heart 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.340
 what I need or some other phrase 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.340
 what comes to your mind 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.820
 and that's how we finished this tutorial 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.180
 I hope you liked me sincerely 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.130
 I loved it 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.660
 if you like to write more in the letter 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.050
 you can use the back to 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.050
 do what 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.500
 see you in the next tutorial and 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.880
 remember that we have facebook and twitter 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.680
 where you can find out about the 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.810
 next crafts that will have origin 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.810
 the staff for you goodbye
