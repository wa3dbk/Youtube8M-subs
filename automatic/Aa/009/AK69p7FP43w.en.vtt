now<00:00:02.610> all<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.090> methods<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.600> this<00:00:03.750> video<00:00:04.100> can

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
now all of the methods in this video can

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.519 
now all of the methods in this video can
be<00:00:05.130> used<00:00:05.250> for<00:00:05.640> both<00:00:05.850> plastic<00:00:06.540> bottles<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.080> for

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
be used for both plastic bottles and for

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.759 
be used for both plastic bottles and for
glass<00:00:07.710> bottles<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.900> the<00:00:09.900> detergent<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.530> use

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
glass bottles and the detergent I use

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.970 
glass bottles and the detergent I use
for<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.160> video<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:12.230> unseen<00:00:13.230> too<00:00:13.440> just

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
for this video is unseen too just

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.670 
for this video is unseen too just
watching<00:00:14.280> detergent<00:00:15.379> so<00:00:16.379> we're<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
watching detergent so we're going to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.279 
watching detergent so we're going to
heat<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> duty<00:00:17.130> bottles<00:00:17.460> here<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.270> there's<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
heat the duty bottles here and there's a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.050 
heat the duty bottles here and there's a
few<00:00:19.439> methods<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.070> can<00:00:20.100> use<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.699> clean

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
few methods that we can use to clean

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.590 
few methods that we can use to clean
them<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.710> fill<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.699> bar<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.359> water

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
them one we can fill up a bar for water

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.160 
them one we can fill up a bar for water
like<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.109> hot<00:00:25.619> water<00:00:25.920> warm<00:00:26.460> water<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.170> then

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
like this hot water warm water and then

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.650 
like this hot water warm water and then
we<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.619> um<00:00:28.830> put<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> bit<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.789> detergent<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.420> each

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
we can um put a bit of detergent in each

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330 
we can um put a bit of detergent in each
bottle<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.199> fill<00:00:31.380> them<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:31.740> warm<00:00:32.099> water

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
bottle and fill them up with warm water

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.030 
bottle and fill them up with warm water
and<00:00:32.640> let<00:00:32.669> them<00:00:32.969> sit<00:00:33.149> overnight<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.829> then<00:00:34.829> come

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
and let them sit overnight and then come

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.889 
and let them sit overnight and then come
along<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.340> next<00:00:35.520> day<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> half<00:00:36.420> empty<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
along the next day and half empty the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.900 
along the next day and half empty the
bottles<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.469> then<00:00:38.129> give<00:00:38.309> them<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.520> shake<00:00:38.700> with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
bottles and then give them a shake with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
bottles and then give them a shake with
our<00:00:39.090> thumb<00:00:39.300> over<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> end<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> bottle<00:00:40.350> cap

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
our thumb over the end or the bottle cap

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.580 
our thumb over the end or the bottle cap
at<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> end<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.750> then<00:00:42.750> empty<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
at the end and then empty it out and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.880 
at the end and then empty it out and
rinse<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.750> that<00:00:45.750> will<00:00:45.960> work<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.710> most

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
rinse it and that will work in most

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.020 
rinse it and that will work in most
situations<00:00:47.899> but<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.500> sediment<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.520> really

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
situations but if the sediment is really

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
situations but if the sediment is really
solid<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> bottom<00:00:52.039> you're<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> need

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
solid on the bottom you're going to need

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.790 
solid on the bottom you're going to need
to<00:00:53.520> use<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.940> bottle<00:00:54.329> brush

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
to use a bottle brush

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.360 
to use a bottle brush
so<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.280> idea<00:00:57.289> prevention<00:00:58.289> rather<00:00:58.770> than<00:00:58.980> cure

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
so the idea prevention rather than cure

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.360 
so the idea prevention rather than cure
is<00:00:59.730> normally<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> best<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:01.199> after<00:01:02.190> you've

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
is normally the best way after you've

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.509 
is normally the best way after you've
drunk<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.510> alcohol<00:01:04.110> either<00:01:04.589> straight<00:01:05.129> after

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
drunk your alcohol either straight after

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.429 
drunk your alcohol either straight after
or<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> next<00:01:05.939> day

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
or the next day

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.420 
or the next day
you<00:01:07.439> should<00:01:09.110> put<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.140> hot<00:01:10.740> water<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you should put some hot water in it and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.609 
you should put some hot water in it and
give<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> shake<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.170> generally

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
give it a shake and it will generally

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.190 
give it a shake and it will generally
take<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.119> yeast<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> bottom

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
take out all the yeast out of the bottom

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.760 
take out all the yeast out of the bottom
of<00:01:16.290> them<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.640> yeast<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.390> really<00:01:19.080> solid<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
of them if the yeast is really solid and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.510 
of them if the yeast is really solid and
stuck<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.630> then<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:22.680> won't<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.159> won't<00:01:23.310> get

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
stuck there then you won't you won't get

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.160 
stuck there then you won't you won't get
all<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.630> you'll<00:01:24.869> need<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
all of all of it out and you'll need to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.130 
all of all of it out and you'll need to
use<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> bottle<00:01:25.619> brush<00:01:26.210> but<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.930> really

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
use a bottle brush but it's a really

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.560 
use a bottle brush but it's a really
great<00:01:28.439> practice<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:29.729> then

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
great practice to do that because then

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.810 
great practice to do that because then
you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.900> come<00:01:31.079> along<00:01:31.290> next<00:01:31.560> time<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.700> can

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you can come along next time you can

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.149 
you can come along next time you can
just<00:01:33.000> put<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> squirt<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.960> detergent<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:34.979> there

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
just put a squirt of detergent in there

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950 
just put a squirt of detergent in there
a<00:01:35.369> little<00:01:35.909> bit<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.119> hot<00:01:36.270> water<00:01:36.450> give<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a little bit of hot water give it a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.490 
a little bit of hot water give it a
shake

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
shake

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
shake
right<00:01:37.829> before<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.250> about<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.670> sterilize<00:01:39.210> them

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
right before you about to sterilize them

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.399 
right before you about to sterilize them
and<00:01:39.659> broke<00:01:39.990> our<00:01:40.470> bottle<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.390> then<00:01:42.390> tip<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.229> out

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and broke our bottle and then tip it out

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.670 
and broke our bottle and then tip it out
rinse<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.130> away<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> go

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
rinse it and away you go

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.590 
rinse it and away you go
but<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> settlement<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.610> stronger<00:01:48.450> than

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
but if the settlement is stronger than

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.280 
but if the settlement is stronger than
that<00:01:48.710> then<00:01:49.710> you're<00:01:50.399> gonna<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
that then you're gonna have to use a

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.499 
that then you're gonna have to use a
brush<00:01:52.290> or<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.210> um<00:01:54.360> usually<00:01:55.320> show<00:01:56.509> now

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
brush or you can um usually show now

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.090 
brush or you can um usually show now
this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> traditional<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
this is the traditional way you use a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580 
this is the traditional way you use a
bottle<00:01:59.369> brush<00:01:59.899> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
bottle brush and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.179
