00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
glass at the bottom and the top um looks

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.310 
glass at the bottom and the top um looks
really<00:03:18.100> really<00:03:18.340> great<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.910> if<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.840> focus<00:03:20.230> is

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
really really great and if that focus is

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.270 
really really great and if that focus is
right<00:03:20.440> there<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.650> can<00:03:20.769> kind<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:21.010> see<00:03:21.160> the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
right there you can kind of see the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.340 
right there you can kind of see the
ridges<00:03:21.519> in<00:03:21.850> there<00:03:22.030> that's<00:03:22.900> why<00:03:23.049> it's<00:03:23.200> called

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
ridges in there that's why it's called

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.930 
ridges in there that's why it's called
the<00:03:23.470> texture<00:03:23.890> skin<00:03:24.190> because<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.700> kind<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940

that dust is going to get caught in here

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.930 
that dust is going to get caught in here
and<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.870> these<00:03:59.110> sides<00:03:59.440> right<00:03:59.709> here<00:04:00.070> very

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
and on these sides right here very

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.800 
and on these sides right here very
easily<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.720> want<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:01.989> keep<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.560> clean<00:04:03.160> um

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
about that I guess it doesn't really

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.869 
about that I guess it doesn't really
matter<00:04:07.870> but<00:04:08.230> for<00:04:08.440> people<00:04:08.590> who<00:04:08.920> are<00:04:09.159> like

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
matter but for people who are like

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.410 
matter but for people who are like
myself<00:04:10.890> that's<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.129> only<00:04:12.700> negative<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.239> this

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
myself that's the only negative to this

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.899 
myself that's the only negative to this

protection of the aluminum and if you

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.520
