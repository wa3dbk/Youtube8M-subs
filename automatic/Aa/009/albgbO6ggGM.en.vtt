00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.890
 thyme cumin pepper and cloves four 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.990
 cloves two large peppers and as a few 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.350
 six small peppers 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.860
 here I have peanuts and here I have 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.860
 nuggets 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.780
 and here I have cilantro lettuce and two 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.350
 pazo leaves happened to you mama 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.760
 I put two because it comes out bitter 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.760
 and I also put 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:57.530
 two golden corn tortillas 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.629
 today I'm going to show you how to last you're 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.050
 look here I'm going to brown the tortilla in 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.050
 hot oil 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.380
 well for a little while until you make sure 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.329
 already have coffee 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.030
 also if they do not have corn tortillas 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.070
 can put flour tortilla 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.659
 with one I believe enough an omelet 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.659
 of flour because it thickens more 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.659
 but look, I put my tomatillos with the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.439
 chilies in the blender now I'm going to 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.439

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.640
 in the cassette sheets 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.910
 for a little more broth because this 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.910
 medium 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.959
 good look, since I have I'm going to 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.109
 warming up I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.109
 oil 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.840
 ok now I'm going to strain the chili 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.480
 ah 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.700
 and 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.129
 good and here I have it now I will continue 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.830
 with the others I'm going to grind the tortillas 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.500
 and the spices other good look at me here 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.659
 in the blender and I put the pips and 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.049
 the peanuts now I'm going to put the 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.049
 two castillas 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.970
 this is going to be this is what makes 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.660
 thicken the chili so it does not look like 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.660
 sauce 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.490
 I put broth 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.689
 good since I already have a solid what 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.429
 I was going to grind 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.429
 now I'm going to strain 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.460
 here I have to move him because if he does not 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.460
 It makes me balls 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.449
 this is what makes this is the chile 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.749
 and the nugget and peanut gives very 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.749
 good taste 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.289
 or you already feel that you are expressing that 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.720
 you have to move mobile mobile so that 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.919
 do not stick and do not make balls but 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.530
 When it starts to boil they start to 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.430
 make balls starts to stick in the 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.430
 casserole seat 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.729
 good salt to taste 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.160
 well here I have my mole is already 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.949
 boiling now I'm going to put the chicken 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.180
 inside I like to put the chicken 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.449
 inside the chili so that it takes a 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.449
 bit 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.010
 and that's how it is 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.010
 this has been all for today I hope they 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.010
 I liked it
