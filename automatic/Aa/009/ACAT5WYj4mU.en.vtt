00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 head of the shoulder you are putting to work your center metabolically are 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.839
 more demanding so you'll also stimulate a lot more that metabolizes that 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.120
 Start that you are going to eat more when you leave the gym in the room 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.359
 exercise 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.899
 let's be a horizontal push 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:18.270
 like the press tilted the clive pressure on flat bench 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.920
 I would do it on the flat bench because it will attack most of the mass 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.920
 muscle of your chest also leave your shoulders and triceps 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 obviously I'm sure you've seen it 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.970
 you're on island or keep your feet on top of the bench 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.730
 If you are going to use more strength keep your feet firmly on the ground to create a 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.220
 platform there are many different types of grabs you can choose one 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.140
 large 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.830
 you can opt for one closed oviedo 1 media you can do it with your elbows 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.300
 inside 'well on the outside I'm going to choose a medium grip keeping my elbows towards 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.570
 inside to take the stress out of my shoulders and keep the filling the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.600
 pectorals you can put your thumbs above on the top below 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.970
 I repeat, focus on exploiting from the bottom 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 make sure that the dams are placed safely lift 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.320
 slowly so you do not get sick 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.909
 that is another famous one that if classic ciu to develop muscle of new 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.400
 account all of them are excellent for stimulating your metabolism so that 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.159
 they are also very good at losing fat we have four we only need 3 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.790
 classic exercise couple trample muscle in 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.960
 number 5 we're going to do an exercise that involves new vertical pulls 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.680
 mind I chose pulls with wide grip instead of side pulls 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.750
 because in this way you work more with your body weight and you can not cheat 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.590
 it is an honest exercise opposite to do it or not with respect to the milestones 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.370
 assisted you can cheat and it is not a measure that tells us where you are 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.830
 it really has many variations you can choose to grab wide surplus and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 a young inverted if you want to put more emphasis on your biceps 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.689
 I'm going to use a relatively medium grip and keep mixco two out when 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.939
 the cobos are in your biceps work a lot so if 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.459
 You really want six side dishes keep your elbows out 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.349
 stretch yourself completely and simply try to maintain that constant tension 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.489
 on the top shrinks your sides 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.319
 you really have concentrated on it 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.809
 just because you are climbing not necessarily kresic you are using your 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.119
 lateral 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.519
 so he creates that mental connection to selectively work that muscle 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.719
 number 6 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.679
 let's make some funds 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.969
 the funds are very effective they complete the list because they work with 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.049
 regarding the shoulders and triceps 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.589
 new account 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:05.269
 I like to call this an honest exercise 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.839
 you can not cheat 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.429
 you can not pretend 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:12.559
 he does that you do not do it again you can choose a broad grip 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.469
 or else tight grip keep your elbows glued that the secret here is so 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.059
 less go down to the parallel plane you really have to do it parallel to 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.089
 that are more effective 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:25.809
 and you must block it at the top otherwise you're missing the 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.809
 30% of the year 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.179
 just a little advice if you're a beginner 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.189
 if you can not do more than 6 pull-ups 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.709
 if you can not do more descend eight funds 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.879
 I recommend you to do negative 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.689
 therefore ascends low slowly rises low slowly is the same with 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:57.519
 funds 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.799
 again 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.569
 exercises to be eliminated 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.989
 If you are looking for an exercise to maximize your time you will have to 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.989
 paste that composite exercises 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.229
 you probably already know the seventh exercise 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:13.869
 and very probably 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.090
 is the one you fear the most 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.440
 however it must be done therefore let's start 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.439
 This is 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:28.740
 by far one of the most effective exercises to boost your metabolism and 

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:32.169
 develop muscle with the are the squats although isolated 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.640
 quadriceps do more than that as you probably already know 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.600
 they create a very anabolic environment 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.590
 they release hormones which are the other piece of the puzzle to develop 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.400
 muscle just because you're eating an excellent 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.930
 it does not imply that you are going to develop muscle 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.590
 you have to create the proper communal scope and the squat are friends of 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.360
 the hormones 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.730
 can show you how to properly do squats and what 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.050
 I do not have the most flexibility in my hip and my knees have probably 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.159
 I've seen people go down a lot that I'm going to talk about in the safest way 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.210
 to do them and how to get the maximum benefit before you increase your 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.270
 weight first of all if you have strong shoulders 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.659
 you're going to have to do it wider 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.079
 if you have good flexibility in your forearms pectoral shoulders 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.729
 then opt for a narrower grip 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.650
 find the fleshy part of your trapezoids so you can climb the highs 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.539
 I do not recommend that 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.559
 you can put it half or you can put it under 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.159
 I'm going to put it in the middle part of my trapezoids right where they are 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.809
 you can choose a stay before if you really are strong in your hip 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.610
 if you have a flexibility they are rudely developed from there 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.550
 you can do it narrow or you can do it doctor if your hip is 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.949
 really strong another little tip is flipping your grips 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.129
 mine is 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.770
 so I'm going to take a longer stay keep your eyes up to 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.550
 paint keep your hip transplant in your abdominals inward 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.210
 before the tight when you go down 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.210
 and turn on your fruits when you raise 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.740
 sit right in the hole 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:16.509
 when you finish 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.589
 camila and make sure you hear him on both sides 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.589
 that means you're fine 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.499
 observe what we did, we distribute the body in 6 planes of movement 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:29.059
 and we add a our 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:32.989
 we did a horizontal push a horizontal pull a vertical push a pull 

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:35.989
 vertical and we divide our quadriceps forward and backward 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.599
 if you've been studying weight training for the past few years 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.059
 probably this is not new to you 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:46.619
 but it's a good way to make sure that your program is balanced 

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:49.639
 if it's not balanced you're going to create muscle imbalances and you're going to 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.639
 end up hitting a physiotherapist 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.889
 that's all seven of the most classic exercises to build muscle 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.770
 if you want more exercises like this one wants to expose the whole package together with 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.719
 a program happened happened is really simple and it does not matter what your level 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.139
 of physical condition 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.900
 remember these drug-free bodybuilding and without fraudulent supplements 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.460
 with less training than before 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.240
 We are not spending two hours in the gym 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.490
 just check the address of the website below and you will find what 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.759
 you are looking for 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.199
 Thank you very much and we'll see again soon
