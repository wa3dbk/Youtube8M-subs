00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.830
 hello everyone the new tutorial in this 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.380
 tutorial i will explain how to make the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.630
 symbol of infinity 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.600
 this is a really big symbol 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.690
 versatile that can be used both in 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.240
 bracelets necklaces etcetera 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.899
 we will make it with wire 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.780
 metallic and you can then unleash the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.460
 your imagination and use it as more 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.860
 you like it 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.860
 I made a symbol with this 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.140
 earring or simply applying one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:53.640
 drop of purple agate and size 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.610
 my symbol of infinity and search for 5 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.950
 centimeters but today we will go to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.890
 achieve smaller then for later 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.180
 make a series of cute braccialini 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.820
 very details so nothing there 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.409
 I leave the tutorial and good vision 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.319
 to make our symbol 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.020
 of the infinite we need thread 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:19.350
 metallic I will use this aluminum 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.560
 2 mm copper but you can use 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.439
 also other types of paper wires 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.490
 abrasive or in any case sandpaper that 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.950
 say you want hammer to hammer 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.799
 just our thread to make you of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.409
 keep the shape a perfectly 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.529
 iron block on which to hammer 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.909
 our thread a cutter I will use 

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:47.999
 the flush cotter is a marker however 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.399
 any other cylindrical shape for 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:53.039
 take precisely the form of ours 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.490
 symbol of infinity 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.419
 we cut about 10 centimeters of thread 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.399
 metallic and smw we are the ends with 

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:08.789
 of abrasive paper 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:12.370
 in this way to prevent the spikes 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:19.209
 they give annoyance just once 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:22.390
 we wear our bullet markers then 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.590
 after filing the end of the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.640
 our thread 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.489
 fix your finger to the son of 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.799
 above our of our cylinder 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.540
 among which we will take the form 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:40.569
 of infinity we leave about a 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.810
 centimeter just under a centimeter 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.980
 because as we know infinity 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.410
 it is not perfectly circular but it is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.069
 however an elongated shape almost a 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.859
 drop and composed precisely of these two 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.260
 drip parts 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:02.230
 so what we have to do now is 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.579
 take the other death of another thread 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:16.900
 head of the wire and start turning 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:19.079
 around our marker in this 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.079
 way 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.409
 as you can see, the first one was created 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.510
 drop 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.790
 we have to do the same again 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.700
 operation also in the other direction therefore 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:38.319
 position the marker more or less at 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.590
 this height and we repeat the same 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.590
 operation 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.970
 here is this is the result 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.420
 as you can see here is a bit of 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.760
 excess thread that we will go to it a 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.720
 cut we go a little by eye 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.849
 to regulate and try to create the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.659
 same measure of the other 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:12.760
 of the other part of the infinite therefore 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.829
 I cut a small part so now 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:24.660
 I'm going to file these two again 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:28.930
 parts and August simply the two 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.270
 end bringing them to the center now 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.600
 we are going to hammer our form e 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.789
 give it back a consistency a little more 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:43.979
 consolidate then we take ours 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:47.289
 block and start hammering 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.660
 as you can see he hammered ours 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.470
 symbol of infinity both on one side and 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.580
 on the other 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.280
 and then I brought the two ends on 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.990
 retro in this way to give precisely the 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.660
 classic form of infinity then with 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.090
 this symbol I will go to realize 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.599
 of the bracelets I hope this tutorial 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.110
 there was help though 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:17.340
 very simple and nothing see you at 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.340
 next video bye bye
