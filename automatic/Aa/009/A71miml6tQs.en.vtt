00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 today we will talk after 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.190
 use the data not to mention the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.190
 photographers of yesteryear 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.970
 and is that I've seen in publications in 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.480
 comments from some photographers 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.419
 and that they are not very well seen 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.210
 photographers of the old guard if it is 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.040
 say that he went through his business and they see that 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.960
 The photographs are old and 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.600
 they refer to them as outdated or 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.180
 outmoded as the digits that already 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.670
 they come to you and they bring nothing new and 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.220
 they post things as good and these are 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.610
 the masters in photography 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.750
 these are the masters these photographers 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.879
 they say the name and it's very easy 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.760
 for one to criticize a photographer who 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.089
 have been established for more than 50 years and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.159
 say that it was updated but 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.380
 let's go a little further if we 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.570
 we start thinking thanks to them today 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.040
 we can be who we are now they 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.570
 They were the ones who opened the way for us 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.700
 that we can have today 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.799
 a job like the one we have the day of 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.920
 today thanks to them you can buy 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.450
 a camera 1500 dollars is nothing if 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.970
 you want you can buy yourself a camera 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.230
 of up to 800 dollars when they the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.390
 cheaper equipment 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.040
 two thousand or three thousand dollars at least 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.560
 and before there was the destination 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.230
 photographer or anything like that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.080
 they did everything in their studio they bought 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.190
 really quite expensive equipment in the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.980
 photos and immense light cameras do not 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.570
 there was an injury that could unload 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.910
 even buy in the underworld 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.500
 you have to have your dark room and 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.420
 they really know chemistry is difficult 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.740
 what and get the and you really know 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.320
 filter to complementary colors 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.330
 et cetera etcetera so let's make a 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.250
 thing specter are not the photographers in 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.590
 We respect the great masters 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.050
 our bodies even square the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.630
 before them because without them our 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.550
 business could not have been possible 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.800
 greeting for those who lived and ate 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.410
 photographs and they did not have to wait 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.780
 seconds to see the photograph in your 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.530
 monitor but they had to reveal it and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.140
 take two or three days to do that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.520
 mark that today we call photography in its 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.200
 time they also innovate go 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.830
 making SLR photographs by doing 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.190
 Photography 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.990

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.810
 sun in their time they innovated 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.620
 we are really innovating 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.190
 Beware of those who come behind 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.690

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.780
