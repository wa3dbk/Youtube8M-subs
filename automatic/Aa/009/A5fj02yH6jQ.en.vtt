00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
here so this is the the pit-boss to just

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.020 
here so this is the the pit-boss to just
came<00:00:13.710> out<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:13.860> foam<00:00:14.040> hopefully<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.880> one

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
came out with foam hopefully this one

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.540 
came out with foam hopefully this one
take<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.240> quick<00:00:15.450> look<00:00:15.630> at<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.100> see<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
take a quick look at it and see just the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.070 
take a quick look at it and see just the
details<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.420> compared<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.840> other

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
details of it and compared with other

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.349 
details of it and compared with other
classes<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.160> idea<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.880> sizing<00:00:21.270> of

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
classes so you get idea of the sizing of

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.939 
classes so you get idea of the sizing of
it<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.199> was<00:00:22.320> looking<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> some<00:00:22.920> of

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
it because I was looking at the some of

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.380 
it because I was looking at the some of
the<00:00:23.039> glasses<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.550> hard<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> determine<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the glasses it's hard to determine the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.230 
the glasses it's hard to determine the
size<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.900> when<00:00:25.050> you're<00:00:25.170> online<00:00:26.090> ok<00:00:27.090> let's

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
size of it when you're online ok let's

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.630 
size of it when you're online ok let's
take<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.510> quick<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:27.960> loop<00:00:28.109> close-up<00:00:28.830> look<00:00:28.949> here

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
lens you can tell if it is really

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.590 
lens you can tell if it is really
reflective<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:45.000> socks<00:00:45.270> went<00:00:45.480> there

and stems you have nose pieces as well
on<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> inside<00:00:49.219> adjusted<00:00:50.219> big<00:00:51.180> difference

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
on the inside adjusted big difference

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:09.510 
on the inside adjusted big difference
from<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> original<00:00:51.899> ones

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.649 

it's<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.270> really<00:01:10.600> nice<00:01:10.780> pair

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.899 

all<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.560> give<00:01:16.680> idea<00:01:16.920> here<00:01:17.189> I'll

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
all right and just give idea here I'll

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.170 
all right and just give idea here I'll
compare<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.450> other<00:01:18.979> glasses<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.030> very

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
compare with other glasses that are very

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.010 
compare with other glasses that are very
similar<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.539> it<00:01:21.890> I've<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.219> pit<00:01:23.670> bulls<00:01:24.020> which

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
similar to it I've the pit bulls which

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.219 
similar to it I've the pit bulls which
are<00:01:25.229> another<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:25.860> favorites

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
are another one my favorites

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.719 
are another one my favorites
so<00:01:28.229> I'll<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.500> compare<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.189> another

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
so I'll just compare it to the another

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
so I'll just compare it to the another
