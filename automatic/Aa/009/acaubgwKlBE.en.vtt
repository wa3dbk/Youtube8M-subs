00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
like look I've scraped down to the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.010 
like look I've scraped down to the
bottom<00:01:31.790> anyway<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.030> had<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.750> hair

bottom anyway so I had that in my hair
and<00:01:35.000> then<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.299> did<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.049> scrub<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and then I did a scrub with this which I

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.590 
and then I did a scrub with this which I
bought<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.060> Greece<00:01:41.030> which<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.390> nice

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
think one of these little slashes might

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.539 
think one of these little slashes might
last<00:01:46.080> about<00:01:46.409> three<00:01:47.720> exfoliation

yeah<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.820> needed<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> tiny<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.930> bit

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
yeah I just needed to tiny a little bit

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
yeah I just needed to tiny a little bit
just<00:01:56.390> cover<00:01:57.390> my<00:01:57.630> whole<00:01:57.720> face<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.350> it's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
just cover my whole face in it and it's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.390 
just cover my whole face in it and it's
really<00:01:58.829> nice<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.460> I<00:02:00.530> just<00:02:01.530> sort<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> felt<00:02:02.280> like

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
really nice and I just sort of felt like

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.130 
really nice and I just sort of felt like
it<00:02:02.549> was<00:02:02.670> cleaning<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.270> wasn't<00:02:03.630> too<00:02:03.810> harsh

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it was cleaning but it wasn't too harsh

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.249 
it was cleaning but it wasn't too harsh
it<00:02:04.979> was<00:02:05.340> verging<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.119> being<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.479> lit<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.780> hush<00:02:07.020> so

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
it was verging on being a lit to hush so

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.569 
it was verging on being a lit to hush so
if<00:02:07.320> you've<00:02:07.439> got<00:02:07.470> really<00:02:07.890> sensitive<00:02:08.220> skin

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
if you've got really sensitive skin

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.290 
if you've got really sensitive skin
that's<00:02:09.179> probably<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.929> quite<00:02:10.170> right<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.500> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
that's probably not quite right for you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.560 
that's probably not quite right for you
and<00:02:13.300> then<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.290> wash<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.530> off<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:16.120> put<00:02:16.420> on

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
and then so I wash that off and I put on

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.000
