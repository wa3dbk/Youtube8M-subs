Rosewall flight test crew here Norwest
con<00:00:30.819> 35<00:00:31.569> we<00:00:32.320> saw<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.529> hotel<00:00:32.829> these<00:00:33.039> fabulous

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
con 35 we saw the hotel these fabulous

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.580 
con 35 we saw the hotel these fabulous
glass<00:00:33.820> elevators<00:00:34.600> so<00:00:34.840> we<00:00:34.960> thought<00:00:35.170> we'd<00:00:35.379> maybe

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
glass elevators so we thought we'd maybe

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.209 
glass elevators so we thought we'd maybe
do<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:35.920> little<00:00:36.570> science<00:00:37.890> specifically<00:00:38.890> we<00:00:39.100> were

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
do a little science specifically we were

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.069 
do a little science specifically we were
curious<00:00:39.519> to<00:00:39.730> see<00:00:39.969> what<00:00:40.510> would<00:00:40.600> happen<00:00:40.780> with

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
curious to see what would happen with

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.330 
curious to see what would happen with
the<00:00:41.109> quadcopter<00:00:41.379> maneuvering<00:00:42.129> in<00:00:42.219> an

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
the quadcopter maneuvering in an

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.250 
the quadcopter maneuvering in an
accelerated<00:00:43.000> frame<00:00:43.030> like<00:00:43.539> an<00:00:43.660> elevator

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
accelerated frame like an elevator

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.660 
accelerated frame like an elevator
it<00:00:44.410> basically<00:00:44.559> is<00:00:45.039> it<00:00:45.190> gonna<00:00:45.280> go<00:00:45.460> up<00:00:45.519> in<00:00:45.609> the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
it basically is it gonna go up in the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.040 
it basically is it gonna go up in the
elevator<00:00:46.000> cuz<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.329> air<00:00:46.449> moving<00:00:46.750> up<00:00:46.839> with<00:00:46.929> us

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
elevator cuz the air moving up with us

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.299 
elevator cuz the air moving up with us
is<00:00:47.170> it<00:00:47.289> gonna<00:00:47.379> fall<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:47.859> ground<00:00:47.890> what's

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
is it gonna fall to the ground what's

00:00:48.309 --> 00:01:13.170 
is it gonna fall to the ground what's
gonna<00:00:48.399> happen<00:00:48.730> let's<00:00:49.510> find<00:00:49.719> out

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.719 

as<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:14.420> can<00:01:14.570> see<00:01:14.860> when<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.009> elevator<00:01:16.400> begins

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
as you can see when the elevator begins

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.420 
as you can see when the elevator begins
to<00:01:16.909> ascend<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.290> quad<00:01:18.590> appears<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.220> lose

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
to ascend the quad appears to lose

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.530 
to ascend the quad appears to lose
thrust<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.180> drop<00:01:20.390> towards<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.840> floor

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
thrust and drop towards the floor

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.380 
thrust and drop towards the floor
when<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.290> elevator<00:01:23.680> starts<00:01:24.070> down<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:25.120> looks

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
when the elevator starts down it looks

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.750 
when the elevator starts down it looks
like<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.780> dog<00:01:25.870> shoots<00:01:26.470> up<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:27.160> deckle<00:01:27.550> Stein

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
like the dog shoots up and deckle Stein

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.890 
like the dog shoots up and deckle Stein
has<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.090> come<00:01:28.300> from<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:28.870> you<00:01:28.960> begin<00:01:29.440> to<00:01:29.620> see

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
has to come from and you begin to see

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.930 
has to come from and you begin to see
now<00:01:31.900> what's<00:01:32.140> really<00:01:32.350> going<00:01:32.800> on<00:01:33.010> here<00:01:33.340> is<00:01:33.880> that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
now what's really going on here is that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.800 
now what's really going on here is that
the<00:01:34.210> quad<00:01:34.480> doesn't<00:01:34.960> know<00:01:35.260> it's<00:01:35.530> in<00:01:35.650> it<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:37.600> this

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
the quad doesn't know it's in it in this

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.220 
the quad doesn't know it's in it in this
example<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.500> quad<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.890> hovering<00:01:39.280> outdoors

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
example the quad is hovering outdoors

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.600 
example the quad is hovering outdoors
now<00:01:41.230> we<00:01:41.290> take<00:01:41.620> it<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.920> put<00:01:41.980> it<00:01:42.190> inside<00:01:42.310> an

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
now we take it and put it inside an

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.700 
now we take it and put it inside an
elevator

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
elevator

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.170 
elevator
it<00:01:44.710> keeps<00:01:45.070> hovering<00:01:45.580> at<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.700> same<00:01:46.000> altitude

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
it keeps hovering at the same altitude

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.780 
it keeps hovering at the same altitude
when<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.750> elevator<00:01:47.080> starts<00:01:47.410> going<00:01:47.680> up<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.610> it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
when the elevator starts going up and it

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.200 
when the elevator starts going up and it
stays<00:01:49.060> there<00:01:49.360> until<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.780> floor<00:01:50.020> runs<00:01:50.260> into<00:01:50.560> it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.460 

that<00:01:55.210> makes<00:01:55.420> sense<00:01:55.720> if<00:01:55.900> you're<00:01:56.020> watching<00:01:56.350> from

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
that makes sense if you're watching from

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.460 
that makes sense if you're watching from
outside<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.790> if<00:01:57.880> you're<00:01:58.030> inside<00:01:58.479> looks<00:01:59.320> like

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
outside but if you're inside looks like

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.990 
outside but if you're inside looks like
the<00:01:59.560> quad<00:01:59.770> just<00:02:00.100> simply<00:02:00.370> walks<00:02:00.640> towards<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
the quad just simply walks towards the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.330 
the quad just simply walks towards the
floor

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.040 

this<00:02:08.340> illustrates<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.119> first<00:02:09.330> principle<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
this illustrates the first principle of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.020 
this illustrates the first principle of
Albert<00:02:10.650> Einstein's<00:02:11.100> special<00:02:11.280> theory<00:02:11.880> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
Albert Einstein's special theory of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.830 
Albert Einstein's special theory of
relativity<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:13.820> laws<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:15.060> physics<00:02:15.240> are<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
relativity the laws of physics are the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.680 
relativity the laws of physics are the
same<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.860> all<00:02:16.920> observers<00:02:17.100> in<00:02:17.880> uniform<00:02:18.480> motion

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
same for all observers in uniform motion

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.720 
same for all observers in uniform motion
relative<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.370> another<00:02:21.800> here<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:22.920> are<00:02:22.950> in

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
relative to one another here we are in

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.700 
relative to one another here we are in
the<00:02:23.940> same

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:40.880 

the<00:02:32.310> phrases<00:02:38.420> okay<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.260> block<00:02:40.470> off<00:02:40.710> just

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the phrases okay so you block off just

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.520 
the phrases okay so you block off just
like<00:02:41.070> elevators<00:02:41.930> all<00:02:42.930> right<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.260> hear<00:02:43.350> that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
like elevators all right you hear that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.440 
like elevators all right you hear that
don't<00:02:44.220> fly<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.460> quadcopters<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
don't fly the quadcopters and the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.070 
don't fly the quadcopters and the
elevators

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
elevators

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.940 
elevators
alright<00:02:46.320> fly<00:02:46.620> safe<00:02:46.920> see<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.700> next<00:02:47.790> time
