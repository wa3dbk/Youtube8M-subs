00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.529
 it is beautiful to all well- found boys 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.710
 the new extreme pitch after drawing 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.530
 the last video we made that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.730
 where they assembled a computer precisely 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.219
 which I said the video card didn't 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.820
 we bet it but now I do 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.470
 see why we have mounted 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.659
 we will count a 72 50 or there is 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.390
 and I a r 92 93 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.199
 freshly arrived fresh from and price 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.460
 so now we proceed to unboxing 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.899
 let's take a look at where to open it from 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.300
 net we remove the famous si gb 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.940
 now my brother will kindly frame 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.940
 below where we will perform the unboxing 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:16.360
 so what to say on this video card 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:21.100
 it must be said that it is a product of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.880
 tip of the leading product because 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.800
 we also remember r 92 90 in this is the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.850
 model just before it costs anyway 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.380
 lots of money 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.000
 4 gb ddr3 dedicated and a great star 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.470
 video is from the point of view of 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.140
 performance than silence 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.240
 compared to the reference model we go to 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.610
 maybe open it from the right side then 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.560
 here we do mica as we disassemble everything 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.439
 in fact I was opening it from the side 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.360
 right then we turn it back then 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.240
 going to open here we can see a 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.630
 packaging and it looks really good 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.369
 let's go on to how it should be has 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.219
 so we have a layer of material 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.719
 protecting we have our video files 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.310
 which we put aside for a moment and 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.100
 let's see first what is the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.570
 call together as a state of range 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:21.209
 this is the sapphire background 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.209
 also because if not a bundle of kill 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:32.990
 we have the 6-pin molex cable 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:36.920
 ok it's a bit smarter but more 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.840
 the 8-pin molex cable since 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.000
 attention this motherboard namely 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.180
 this video card requires a 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.300
 considerable power supply 750 parts 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.950
 so you also understand that it goes without you 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.320
 yes na what will they think out anyway 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.520
 you see that there are two connectors here 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.620
 molex plus the third will steal three 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.680
 molex connector so you understand that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.210
 it is quite sucky if websites for whom 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.700
 did not have the child directly on the south 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.620
 feeder then we have a leaflet 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.810
 which speaks of the builder a 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.530
 very nice hdmi cable 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.220
 I call it so among other things he talks about 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.440
 ispeed so ok then we have the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.660
 nation cyclist with all the drivers a 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.480
 nice sticker that 's where we're going 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.890
 to apply on my case 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:42.350
 then okay instruction manual with 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:44.570
 quick installation and then the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.600
 registration of the product that gives us the 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.730
 possibility to do access 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.160
 then we go to the reserved guarantee 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.920
 now to the true protagonist of ours 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.790
 unboxing to the real protagonist who is the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.660
 our video card the way with yours 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.130
 if you want it , of what I have it 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:09.760

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:13.730
 part you leave at the hands of red beer 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:18.230

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:25.670

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:30.290
 really big fireplace here we have here 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:35.530
 among other things, a plastic shell or a 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:40.340
 very light aluminum indeed 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:44.440
 important here then we have the glass with 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.440

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:54.169
