new prototype of the magnetic motor and
if<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.430> explain<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:21.150> bit<00:00:21.330> about

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
if I can explain a little bit about

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.590 
if I can explain a little bit about
what's<00:00:21.990> called<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.350> magnetic<00:00:22.769> feel<00:00:23.600> all

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
what's called a magnetic feel all

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.920 
what's called a magnetic feel all
magnets<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.560> big<00:00:25.740> old<00:00:25.920> wooden<00:00:26.130> prototype<00:00:26.930> has

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
magnets the big old wooden prototype has

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.580 
magnets the big old wooden prototype has
a<00:00:27.960> system<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.880> motor<00:00:30.119> went<00:00:30.480> over<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.349> had

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
a system as the motor went over it had

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.380 
a system as the motor went over it had
attention<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.369> jerk<00:00:33.800> jerk<00:00:34.800> over<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.730> if

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
attention to jerk jerk over like that if

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.660 
attention to jerk jerk over like that if
you<00:00:36.600> take<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.960> motor<00:00:37.260> here<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.430> take

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you take this motor here and you take

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.000 
you take this motor here and you take
your<00:00:38.850> finger<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.399> rotate<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:42.770> it<00:00:43.770> doesn't

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
your finger and rotate it it doesn't

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.229 
your finger and rotate it it doesn't
have<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.280> jerking<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
have that jerking in it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.540

voltage and the amperage that's what I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.790 
voltage and the amperage that's what I
was<00:04:26.850> talking<00:04:27.120> about<00:04:27.150> earlier<00:04:27.600> about<00:04:27.800> amperage

was talking about earlier about amperage
on<00:04:28.980> automobiles<00:04:29.730> let's<00:04:30.480> see<00:04:30.660> if<00:04:30.720> we<00:04:30.840> can't<00:04:31.110> get

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
on automobiles let's see if we can't get

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.110 
on automobiles let's see if we can't get
the<00:04:31.590> amperage<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.100> go<00:04:32.190> down<00:04:32.400> stead<00:04:32.730> going<00:04:32.940> up

the<00:04:33.870> voltage<00:04:34.230> on<00:04:34.350> this<00:04:34.530> here<00:04:34.770> should<00:04:34.950> say

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
the voltage on this here should say

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.360 
the voltage on this here should say
somewhere<00:04:35.460> around<00:04:35.600> 120<00:04:36.600> volts<00:04:37.200> when<00:04:38.040> we<00:04:38.130> start

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
somewhere around 120 volts when we start

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.150 
somewhere around 120 volts when we start
out<00:04:38.550> there's<00:04:38.760> no<00:04:38.910> amperage<00:04:39.300> at<00:04:39.420> all<00:04:39.600> so<00:04:40.320> the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
out there's no amperage at all so the

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.330 
out there's no amperage at all so the
gages<00:04:41.610> is<00:04:41.760> down<00:04:42.120> below<00:04:42.480> here<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.340> we're

does<00:04:49.820> all<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:51.150> do<00:04:51.390> is<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:52.620> take<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:53.190> put<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:53.880> in

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
does all you do is to take and put it in

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.370 
does all you do is to take and put it in
gear<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.590> motor<00:04:56.930> sounds<00:04:57.930> like<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.140> little

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
gear and the motor sounds like a little

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.260

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.360 
automobile drives
if<00:05:07.050> you'll<00:05:07.260> see<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.560> amperage<00:05:07.890> on<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.190> gauge

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
if you'll see the amperage on the gauge

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.340 
if you'll see the amperage on the gauge
see<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.790> going<00:05:08.940> down<00:05:10.160> amperage<00:05:11.160> goes<00:05:11.460> way<00:05:11.790> down

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
see it going down amperage goes way down

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.630 
see it going down amperage goes way down
that's<00:05:13.350> what<00:05:13.620> that's<00:05:14.010> what<00:05:14.160> I<00:05:14.190> like<00:05:14.460> about

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
that's what that's what I like about

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.940 
that's what that's what I like about
electric<00:05:15.330> cars

electric cars

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.280 
electric cars
if<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.160> floorboard<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.910> car<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.840> most<00:05:19.080> it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
if you floorboard the car the most it

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.650 
if you floorboard the car the most it
will<00:05:19.440> do<00:05:19.590> would<00:05:19.830> this<00:05:19.950> be<00:05:20.190> about<00:05:20.540> maybe<00:05:21.540> a

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
will do would this be about maybe a

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.040 
will do would this be about maybe a
hundred<00:05:21.840> amps

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
hundred amps

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.529 
hundred amps
and<00:05:24.590> that's<00:05:24.830> what<00:05:25.009> we<00:05:25.160> want<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.460> do<00:05:25.550> is<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:26.360> keep

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
and that's what we want to do is to keep

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.249 
and that's what we want to do is to keep
the<00:05:26.750> amperage<00:05:27.169> down<00:05:28.039> on<00:05:28.370> electric<00:05:28.879> car<00:05:29.120> so<00:05:30.020> as

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
the amperage down on electric car so as

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.309 
the amperage down on electric car so as
go<00:05:30.470> anywhere<00:05:30.919> of<00:05:31.509> really<00:05:32.509> anybody<00:05:32.930> wants<00:05:33.229> to
