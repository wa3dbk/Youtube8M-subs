00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
a battlefield game and the only good

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.959 
a battlefield game and the only good
news<00:01:59.140> about<00:01:59.320> that<00:01:59.590> recoil<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.310> first<00:02:00.729> shot

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
news about that recoil is the first shot

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.810 
news about that recoil is the first shot
multiplier<00:02:01.420> which<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:01.930> only<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.320> 1<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.100> this

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
multiplier which is only a 1 and this

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.910 
multiplier which is only a 1 and this
would<00:02:04.030> have<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.360> lot<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.750> recoil<00:02:05.049> for<00:02:05.350> LMG<00:02:05.770> in

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
would have a lot of recoil for LMG in

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.340 
would have a lot of recoil for LMG in
battlefield<00:02:06.430> 3<00:02:06.509> which<00:02:07.509> is<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.719> game<00:02:07.930> where<00:02:08.200> if

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
battlefield 3 which is a game where if

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.620 
battlefield 3 which is a game where if
you<00:02:08.500> normally<00:02:09.009> wanted<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.369> use<00:02:09.580> an<00:02:09.729> LMG<00:02:10.149> we're

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
you normally wanted to use an LMG we're

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.750 
you normally wanted to use an LMG we're
kind<00:02:10.930> of<00:02:11.020> best<00:02:11.350> off<00:02:11.560> using<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:12.070> with<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> bipod

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
kind of best off using it with a bipod

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.210 
kind of best off using it with a bipod
just<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.420> tame<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.930> recoil<00:02:14.350> well<00:02:14.830> there's<00:02:14.980> no

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
just to tame that recoil well there's no

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.170 
just to tame that recoil well there's no
option<00:02:15.700> for<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.910> bipod<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.390> hard

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
option for a bipod and hard

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.670 
option for a bipod and hard
so<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.600> just<00:02:17.780> have<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:18.020> deal<00:02:18.320> with<00:02:18.350> that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
so you just have to deal with that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.230 
so you just have to deal with that
recoil<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.490> makes<00:02:19.700> using<00:02:19.910> this<00:02:20.090> at

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
recoil and that makes using this at

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.360 
recoil and that makes using this at
longer<00:02:20.480> ranges<00:02:20.960> or<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.710> with<00:02:21.920> sustained

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
longer ranges or just with sustained

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.840 
longer ranges or just with sustained
fire<00:02:22.730> pretty<00:02:23.600> challenging<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.160> well<00:02:25.550> like

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
fire pretty challenging so well like

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.570 
fire pretty challenging so well like
both<00:02:26.090> LMGs<00:02:26.600> burst<00:02:26.960> firing<00:02:27.260> very<00:02:27.950> good<00:02:28.220> idea

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
both LMGs burst firing very good idea

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.180 
both LMGs burst firing very good idea

mg36 on a class and however I wanted

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.960 
mg36 on a class and however I wanted
this<00:03:21.380> is<00:03:21.560> likely<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.130> setup<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.640> would<00:03:22.820> run

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
this is likely the setup I would run

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.550 
this is likely the setup I would run
with<00:03:23.030> well<00:03:23.480> unless<00:03:23.900> they<00:03:24.080> let<00:03:24.230> me<00:03:24.380> use<00:03:24.410> a

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
suppressor in which case I might do that

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.060 
suppressor in which case I might do that
because<00:03:26.390> suppressors<00:03:27.200> on<00:03:27.320> l1<00:03:27.470> G's<00:03:27.709> are<00:03:27.890> just

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
because suppressors on l1 G's are just

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.040 
because suppressors on l1 G's are just
funny<00:03:28.310> but<00:03:28.910> this<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.330> version<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.810> mg

a little higher on the horizontal recoil
for<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.890> category<00:05:06.400> it's<00:05:07.090> got<00:05:07.300> nearly<00:05:07.570> five

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
for the category it's got nearly five

times the magazine of a normal battle
rifle<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.810> only<00:05:11.080> like<00:05:11.260> three<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:11.770> half

times<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.370> reload<00:05:12.760> you'll<00:05:13.480> kill<00:05:13.720> a<00:05:13.750> bunch<00:05:14.020> of

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
times the reload you'll kill a bunch of

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.870 
times the reload you'll kill a bunch of
guys<00:05:14.260> then<00:05:14.740> their<00:05:14.890> friends<00:05:15.340> will<00:05:15.490> come<00:05:15.670> and

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
guys then their friends will come and

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.580 
guys then their friends will come and
you'll<00:05:15.970> kill<00:05:16.180> them<00:05:16.330> too<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:16.840> then<00:05:17.440> their

you'll kill them too and then their
friends<00:05:17.740> will<00:05:18.040> come<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.370> you'll<00:05:18.490> be

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
friends will come and you'll be

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.300 
friends will come and you'll be
reloading<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:19.450> you'll<00:05:19.750> just<00:05:19.900> die<00:05:20.310> while

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
reloading and you'll just die while

reloading and you'll just die while
there's<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.550> bit<00:05:21.730> of<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:21.880> pattern<00:05:22.180> as<00:05:22.330> to<00:05:22.510> where

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
there's a bit of a pattern as to where

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.600 
there's a bit of a pattern as to where
they're<00:05:22.930> put<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.170> LMG<00:05:23.650> spawns<00:05:23.920> on<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.190> map<00:05:24.340> I

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
they're put the LMG spawns on the map I

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.850 
they're put the LMG spawns on the map I
haven't<00:05:25.180> found<00:05:25.420> anything<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:26.170> predict<00:05:26.530> which

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
haven't found anything to predict which

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.160 
haven't found anything to predict which
one<00:05:27.190> will<00:05:27.310> be<00:05:27.340> there<00:05:27.730> I<00:05:27.850> mean<00:05:28.570> once<00:05:28.840> you<00:05:28.960> know

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
one will be there I mean once you know

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.960 
one will be there I mean once you know
what's<00:05:29.410> on<00:05:29.560> that<00:05:29.590> map<00:05:29.920> and<00:05:30.130> mode<00:05:30.340> it's<00:05:30.700> the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
what's on that map and mode it's the

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.850 
what's on that map and mode it's the
same<00:05:31.180> one<00:05:31.360> every<00:05:31.390> time<00:05:31.780> but<00:05:32.380> until<00:05:32.530> then<00:05:32.830> I

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
same one every time but until then I

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.590 
same one every time but until then I
have<00:05:33.160> no<00:05:33.460> way<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.640> predict<00:05:34.030> which<00:05:34.240> one<00:05:34.450> will<00:05:34.570> be

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
have no way to predict which one will be

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.630 
have no way to predict which one will be
there<00:05:34.870> I<00:05:35.020> hope<00:05:35.140> this<00:05:35.560> video<00:05:35.710> was<00:05:35.950> useful<00:05:35.980> a<00:05:36.460> big

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
there I hope this video was useful a big

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.370 
there I hope this video was useful a big

thanks to simply calm for the stats and

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.940 
thanks to simply calm for the stats and
I<00:05:38.980> will<00:05:39.190> see<00:05:39.310> you<00:05:39.400> guys<00:05:39.550> next<00:05:39.790> time
