may imagine I get a lot of comments

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.240 
may imagine I get a lot of comments
about<00:00:12.660> how<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.960> Steelers<00:00:13.349> like<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.650> steal

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
about how the Steelers like to steal

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.400 
about how the Steelers like to steal
victories<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.660> supposed<00:00:16.020> bad

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
victories because of the supposed bad

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.010 
victories because of the supposed bad
calls<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.890> Super<00:00:17.190> Bowl<00:00:17.220> 14<00:00:17.580> Super<00:00:17.789> Bowl<00:00:18.060> 43<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
calls in Super Bowl 14 Super Bowl 43 I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.980 
calls in Super Bowl 14 Super Bowl 43 I
do<00:00:19.830> think<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.340> some<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.670> those<00:00:20.850> claims<00:00:21.359> may

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
do think that some of those claims may

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.599 
do think that some of those claims may
have<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> little<00:00:22.350> merit<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.070> think<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
have a little merit but I do think that

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.540 
have a little merit but I do think that
it<00:00:23.820> really<00:00:24.180> evens<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> end<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:26.310> Super

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it really evens out in the end the Super

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.970 
it really evens out in the end the Super
Bowl<00:00:26.699> 14<00:00:26.970> Super<00:00:27.150> Bowl<00:00:27.420> 43<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.859> at

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
Bowl 14 Super Bowl 43 you can look at

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.380 
Bowl 14 Super Bowl 43 you can look at
examples<00:00:29.429> where<00:00:29.609> they<00:00:29.699> missed<00:00:29.910> calls<00:00:30.150> both

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
examples where they missed calls both

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.459 
examples where they missed calls both
ways<00:00:30.660> or<00:00:30.929> made<00:00:31.080> bad<00:00:31.260> calls<00:00:31.529> both<00:00:31.740> ways<00:00:32.070> um

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
ways or made bad calls both ways um

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.380 
ways or made bad calls both ways um
anyway<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:35.190> think<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.520> honestly<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
anyway I just think that honestly is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.420 
anyway I just think that honestly is
basically<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> bunch<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.559> fans<00:00:37.800> being

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
basically a bunch of fans being

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.180 
basically a bunch of fans being
crybabies<00:00:38.640> there's<00:00:39.329> Raiders<00:00:40.200> fans<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:41.010> say

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
crybabies there's Raiders fans that say

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.799 
crybabies there's Raiders fans that say
the<00:00:41.340> Raiders<00:00:41.610> always<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.149> screwed<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the Raiders always get screwed out of

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
the Raiders always get screwed out of
victories<00:00:43.290> there's<00:00:44.100> people<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> say<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
victories there's people that say the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.450 
victories there's people that say the
Patriots<00:00:45.390> steal<00:00:45.660> victories<00:00:46.140> too<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.340> on

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
Patriots steal victories too and so on

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.950 
Patriots steal victories too and so on
and<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.640> forth<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.210> got<00:00:48.329> me<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.570> thinking

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and so forth so that got me to thinking

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.790 
and so forth so that got me to thinking
about<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:50.309> many<00:00:50.550> truly<00:00:51.539> bad<00:00:51.840> calls<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.620> can

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
about how many truly bad calls I can

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.110 
about how many truly bad calls I can
think<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.160> off<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.399> top<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:53.879> head

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
think of off the top of my head

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.209 
think of off the top of my head
involving<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> playoffs<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.710> art

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
involving the playoffs because if art

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
involving the playoffs because if art
include<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> regular<00:00:57.030> season<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:58.230> would<00:00:58.350> be

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
include the regular season it would be

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.840 
include the regular season it would be
ridiculous<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.219> there's<00:00:59.609> controversy

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
ridiculous because there's controversy

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.170 
ridiculous because there's controversy
involving<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.320> officiating<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.149> not<00:01:03.149> only

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
involving the officiating in not only

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
involving the officiating in not only
most<00:01:03.539> Super<00:01:03.840> Bowls<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.320> nearly<00:01:04.890> every

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
most Super Bowls but nearly every

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.760 
most Super Bowls but nearly every
regular-season<00:01:05.640> game<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.299> well<00:01:06.710> here's<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
regular-season game as well here's the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.320 
regular-season game as well here's the
examples<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.430> could<00:01:08.580> think<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.030> top<00:01:09.150> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
examples I could think of off the top of
