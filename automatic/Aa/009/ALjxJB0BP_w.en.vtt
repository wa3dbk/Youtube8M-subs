the<00:00:05.310> stoner<00:00:05.790> by<00:00:06.359> far<00:00:06.690> my<00:00:06.930> favorite<00:00:07.410> light

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the stoner by far my favorite light

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.680 
the stoner by far my favorite light
machine<00:00:08.130> gun<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.519> game<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:09.090> really<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
machine gun in this game it's really the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.039 
machine gun in this game it's really the
only<00:00:09.719> one<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.590> seem<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> be<00:00:11.190> using<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
only one that I seem to be using and

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.089 
only one that I seem to be using and
part<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.230> might<00:00:13.469> just<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.710> because<00:00:13.799> it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
part of that might just be because it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.039 
part of that might just be because it
feels<00:00:14.250> like<00:00:14.519> an<00:00:14.670> assault<00:00:14.940> rifle<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.750> like

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
feels like an assault rifle and I like

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.630 
feels like an assault rifle and I like
assault<00:00:16.350> rifles<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> guess<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.430> kind<00:00:17.609> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
assault rifles so I guess it kind of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.080 
assault rifles so I guess it kind of
works<00:00:17.880> out<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:19.010> got<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> lot<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.400> stuff<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.850> want<00:00:21.029> to

what they're looking for a series I'm

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.499 
what they're looking for a series I'm
trying<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.409> think<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.799> an<00:03:40.889> example<00:03:41.009> um<00:03:41.669> there

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:42.509 
trying to think of an example um there

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.149 
trying to think of an example um there
aren't<00:03:42.659> really<00:03:42.900> any<00:03:43.079> on<00:03:43.439> the<00:03:43.560> realm<00:03:43.769> right<00:03:44.009> now

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
aren't really any on the realm right now

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.159 
aren't really any on the realm right now
which<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.400> kind<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.299> probably<00:03:45.629> why<00:03:45.900> they<00:03:46.109> were

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
which is kind of probably why they were

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.710 
which is kind of probably why they were
asking<00:03:46.620> all<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.129> directors<00:03:47.639> to<00:03:47.879> maybe<00:03:48.090> try<00:03:48.659> to

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
asking all the directors to maybe try to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.479 
asking all the directors to maybe try to
do<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.169> but<00:03:49.949> what<00:03:50.099> it<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:52.129> kind<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.310> like<00:03:53.459> a

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
do it but what it is is a kind of like a

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.610 
do it but what it is is a kind of like a
series<00:03:53.969> but<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.269> goes<00:03:54.419> on<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.599> schedule<00:03:55.079> so<00:03:55.349> if

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
series but it goes on a schedule so if

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.499 
series but it goes on a schedule so if
you<00:03:55.769> say<00:03:56.040> all<00:03:56.280> right<00:03:56.430> I'm<00:03:56.669> gonna<00:03:56.790> do<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.150> every

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:57.509 
you say all right I'm gonna do it every

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.659 
you say all right I'm gonna do it every
Wednesday<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.739> need<00:03:58.979> to<00:03:59.129> stick<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.639> that

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
Wednesday you need to stick to that

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.969 
Wednesday you need to stick to that
schedule<00:03:59.989> you<00:04:00.989> can't<00:04:01.259> just<00:04:01.319> do<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.799> whenever

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
schedule you can't just do it whenever

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.429 
schedule you can't just do it whenever
you<00:04:02.159> want<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.639> know<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:04.079> do<00:04:04.199> it<00:04:04.319> as

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
you want you know and you can do it as

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.679 
you want you know and you can do it as
many<00:04:04.739> as<00:04:04.889> two<00:04:05.219> times<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.729> week<00:04:05.939> but<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.449> always

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
many as two times a week but it always

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.589 
many as two times a week but it always
needs<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.319> be<00:04:07.500> consistent<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.359> thing

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
needs to be consistent that's the thing

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.619 
needs to be consistent that's the thing
i<00:04:09.870> guess<00:04:10.409> one<00:04:10.769> example<00:04:11.159> would<00:04:11.489> be<00:04:11.549> alike<00:04:12.030> can't

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
i guess one example would be alike can't

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.140 
i guess one example would be alike can't
punch<00:04:13.159> not<00:04:14.159> that<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.400> really<00:04:14.759> had<00:04:15.030> an

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
punch not that that really had an

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.219 
punch not that that really had an
extreme<00:04:15.689> schedule<00:04:16.409> in<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.680> sense<00:04:16.949> but<00:04:17.489> i<00:04:17.989> mean<00:04:18.989> i

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
extreme schedule in a sense but i mean i

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.420 
extreme schedule in a sense but i mean i
think<00:04:19.289> that's<00:04:19.769> kind<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.099> what<00:04:20.250> they're

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
think that's kind of what they're

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.920 
think that's kind of what they're
talking<00:04:20.789> about<00:04:20.849> something<00:04:21.389> unique<00:04:21.900> something

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
talking about something unique something

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.320 
talking about something unique something
that<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.590> can<00:04:22.770> keep<00:04:23.070> doing

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
that you can keep doing

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.570 
that you can keep doing
that<00:04:24.599> in<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.050> sense<00:04:25.500> could<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:26.009> an<00:04:26.129> infinite

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
that in a sense could have an infinite

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.570 
that in a sense could have an infinite
number<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.360> videos<00:04:27.900> though<00:04:28.470> they<00:04:28.680> did<00:04:28.919> say<00:04:29.250> if

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
number of videos though they did say if

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.240 
number of videos though they did say if

idea for a show that would work not a

like a dual commentary with the person
it<00:05:44.849> thinks<00:05:45.089> of<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.300> best<00:05:45.479> idea<00:05:45.839> or<00:05:45.990> something

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
it thinks of the best idea or something

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.350 
it thinks of the best idea or something
I<00:05:48.139> don't<00:05:49.139> know<00:05:49.349> it<00:05:49.529> depends<00:05:49.909> but<00:05:50.909> that's<00:05:51.150> about

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
I don't know it depends but that's about

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.450 
I don't know it depends but that's about
it<00:05:51.419> you<00:05:51.629> guys<00:05:51.990> don't<00:05:52.289> need<00:05:52.469> to<00:05:52.529> i<00:05:52.740> feel<00:05:53.219> bad

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
it you guys don't need to i feel bad

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.399 
it you guys don't need to i feel bad
that<00:05:53.729> are<00:05:53.849> not<00:05:54.029> being<00:05:54.210> creative<00:05:54.750> enough<00:05:54.990> on<00:05:55.199> my

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
that are not being creative enough on my

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.170 
that are not being creative enough on my
own<00:05:55.440> but<00:05:55.949> I<00:05:56.219> really<00:05:56.520> can't<00:05:56.789> think<00:05:57.000> of

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
own but I really can't think of

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.850 
own but I really can't think of
something<00:05:57.599> that<00:05:57.629> what<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.050> would<00:05:58.319> be<00:05:58.409> able<00:05:58.620> to

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
something that what I would be able to

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.709 
something that what I would be able to
sustain<00:05:59.279> for<00:06:00.240> a<00:06:00.300> while<00:06:02.089> clearly<00:06:03.089> I<00:06:03.120> don't<00:06:03.539> like

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
sustain for a while clearly I don't like

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.740 
sustain for a while clearly I don't like
the<00:06:03.900> idea<00:06:04.020> though<00:06:04.440> I<00:06:04.710> won't<00:06:05.099> choose<00:06:05.370> it<00:06:05.750> so

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
the idea though I won't choose it so

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.939 
the idea though I won't choose it so
it's<00:06:06.960> going<00:06:07.139> to<00:06:07.229> be<00:06:07.319> something<00:06:07.529> that<00:06:07.710> also

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
it's going to be something that also

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.730 
it's going to be something that also
suits<00:06:08.490> me<00:06:08.819> and<00:06:08.849> suits<00:06:09.240> my<00:06:09.690> style<00:06:09.750> of<00:06:10.319> video

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
suits me and suits my style of video

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.619 
suits me and suits my style of video
making<00:06:11.370> I<00:06:11.580> guess<00:06:12.110> but<00:06:13.110> anyway<00:06:14.300> that's<00:06:15.300> about

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629 
making I guess but anyway that's about

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:17.029 
making I guess but anyway that's about
it<00:06:15.659> and<00:06:15.960> finally<00:06:16.199> I<00:06:16.409> just<00:06:16.680> want<00:06:16.830> to<00:06:16.919> bitch

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
it and finally I just want to bitch

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.399 
it and finally I just want to bitch
about<00:06:17.069> theater<00:06:17.759> mode<00:06:17.909> for<00:06:18.180> a<00:06:18.210> sec<00:06:18.479> so<00:06:18.509> as<00:06:18.990> you

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
about theater mode for a sec so as you

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.529 
about theater mode for a sec so as you
can<00:06:19.529> see<00:06:19.800> most<00:06:20.370> of<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.639> game<00:06:20.729> plays<00:06:21.150> I've<00:06:21.360> been

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
can see most of the game plays I've been

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.540 
can see most of the game plays I've been
doing<00:06:21.839> have<00:06:22.469> been<00:06:22.740> through<00:06:23.009> theater<00:06:23.400> mode

I've<00:06:23.729> been<00:06:23.909> kind<00:06:24.300> of<00:06:24.419> getting<00:06:24.569> lazy<00:06:24.870> with

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
I've been kind of getting lazy with

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.779 
I've been kind of getting lazy with
recording<00:06:25.680> in<00:06:25.800> the<00:06:25.889> sense<00:06:26.129> that<00:06:26.219> i<00:06:26.339> really

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
recording in the sense that i really

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.930 
recording in the sense that i really
don't<00:06:27.029> record<00:06:27.389> on<00:06:27.599> the<00:06:27.719> spot<00:06:27.960> much<00:06:28.229> anymore

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
don't record on the spot much anymore

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.519 
don't record on the spot much anymore
ninety<00:06:29.940> percent<00:06:29.969> of<00:06:30.569> what<00:06:30.750> I<00:06:30.779> record<00:06:31.229> is

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
ninety percent of what I record is

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.670 
ninety percent of what I record is
through<00:06:31.919> theater<00:06:32.310> mode<00:06:32.490> which<00:06:33.389> is<00:06:33.930> pretty

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
through theater mode which is pretty

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.710 
through theater mode which is pretty
lazy<00:06:35.360> but<00:06:36.360> it's<00:06:36.750> been<00:06:37.050> pretty

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
lazy but it's been pretty

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.460 
lazy but it's been pretty
unless<00:06:38.440> the<00:06:38.680> hosts<00:06:39.030> dashboards<00:06:40.030> for<00:06:40.900> example

last<00:06:41.650> night<00:06:41.920> i<00:06:41.950> was<00:06:42.190> going<00:06:42.400> 33<00:06:42.820> and<00:06:43.180> one<00:06:43.390> in<00:06:43.690> a

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
last night i was going 33 and one in a

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.470 
last night i was going 33 and one in a
ground<00:06:44.200> war<00:06:44.470> team<00:06:44.800> deathmatch<00:06:45.310> and<00:06:45.640> i<00:06:46.180> think<00:06:46.360> i

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
ground war team deathmatch and i think i

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.030 
ground war team deathmatch and i think i
was<00:06:46.600> like<00:06:46.750> one<00:06:47.050> kill<00:06:47.290> away<00:06:47.320> from<00:06:47.770> another

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
was like one kill away from another

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.270 
was like one kill away from another
black<00:06:48.430> bird<00:06:48.730> and<00:06:48.970> the<00:06:49.510> leinie<00:06:49.690> team<00:06:50.110> had<00:06:50.530> 90

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
black bird and the leinie team had 90

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.550 
black bird and the leinie team had 90
kills<00:06:51.580> or<00:06:52.030> nine<00:06:52.450> thousand<00:06:52.930> points<00:06:53.080> whatever

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
kills or nine thousand points whatever

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.140 
kills or nine thousand points whatever
you<00:06:53.650> want<00:06:53.830> to<00:06:53.890> call<00:06:54.010> it<00:06:54.070> so<00:06:54.730> the<00:06:54.880> game<00:06:55.030> was

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
you want to call it so the game was

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.610 
you want to call it so the game was
basically<00:06:55.540> over<00:06:55.660> we<00:06:56.140> were<00:06:56.290> literally

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
basically over we were literally

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.880 
basically over we were literally
doubling<00:06:57.340> the<00:06:57.730> other<00:06:57.940> teams<00:06:58.270> score<00:06:58.630> and<00:06:58.900> the

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
doubling the other teams score and the

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.180 
doubling the other teams score and the
host<00:07:00.190> dashboards<00:07:01.150> and<00:07:01.330> we<00:07:01.600> lose<00:07:01.780> connection

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
host dashboards and we lose connection

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.160 
host dashboards and we lose connection
so<00:07:03.190> while<00:07:03.460> the<00:07:03.790> game<00:07:04.060> did<00:07:04.390> count<00:07:04.720> towards<00:07:05.110> my

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.170 
so while the game did count towards my

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.620 
so while the game did count towards my
stats<00:07:05.680> it<00:07:06.010> counted<00:07:06.460> all<00:07:06.610> my<00:07:06.760> kills<00:07:07.060> accounted

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
stats it counted all my kills accounted

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.500 
stats it counted all my kills accounted
my<00:07:07.750> score<00:07:08.140> I<00:07:08.170> think<00:07:08.830> it<00:07:09.730> did<00:07:09.910> not<00:07:10.030> save<00:07:10.300> it<00:07:10.420> to

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
my score I think it did not save it to

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.540 
my score I think it did not save it to
the<00:07:10.540> theater<00:07:10.990> which<00:07:11.170> is<00:07:11.320> very<00:07:11.680> frustrating<00:07:12.010> so

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
the theater which is very frustrating so

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.040 
the theater which is very frustrating so
I<00:07:12.610> guess<00:07:12.820> the<00:07:13.000> lesson<00:07:13.180> to<00:07:13.480> be<00:07:13.600> learned<00:07:13.840> is<00:07:14.020> that

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
I guess the lesson to be learned is that

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.050 
I guess the lesson to be learned is that
the<00:07:14.320> theater<00:07:14.650> mode<00:07:14.800> isn't<00:07:14.980> flawed<00:07:15.400> because

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
the theater mode isn't flawed because

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.260 
the theater mode isn't flawed because
when<00:07:16.360> the<00:07:16.480> host<00:07:16.690> doesn't<00:07:17.590> dashboard<00:07:18.310> theater

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
when the host doesn't dashboard theater

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.020 
when the host doesn't dashboard theater

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
little flawed at times yeah but it's not

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.770 
little flawed at times yeah but it's not
terribly<00:07:24.550> flawed<00:07:24.850> what's<00:07:25.540> really

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
terribly flawed what's really

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.290 
terribly flawed what's really
frustrating<00:07:25.960> is<00:07:26.580> dashboarding<00:07:27.580> I<00:07:27.730> do<00:07:27.850> it

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.300 
frustrating is dashboarding I do it

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.150 
frustrating is dashboarding I do it
sometimes<00:07:28.750> I'll<00:07:28.990> be<00:07:29.110> honest<00:07:29.500> but<00:07:29.800> when<00:07:30.010> I<00:07:30.040> do

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 
sometimes I'll be honest but when I do

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.250 
sometimes I'll be honest but when I do
it<00:07:30.430> I<00:07:30.580> do<00:07:30.640> it<00:07:30.820> in<00:07:31.210> the<00:07:31.630> middle<00:07:31.870> or<00:07:32.230> the

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
it I do it in the middle or the

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.850 
it I do it in the middle or the
beginning<00:07:32.530> of<00:07:32.890> the<00:07:33.070> match<00:07:33.600> and<00:07:34.600> by<00:07:35.230> that<00:07:35.530> I'm

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
beginning of the match and by that I'm

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.920 
beginning of the match and by that I'm
saying<00:07:36.400> like<00:07:36.640> the<00:07:36.850> other<00:07:37.030> team<00:07:37.360> did<00:07:37.540> not<00:07:37.720> have

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
saying like the other team did not have

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.280 
saying like the other team did not have
a<00:07:37.960> win<00:07:38.290> guaranteed<00:07:39.130> right<00:07:40.030> in<00:07:40.150> the<00:07:40.240> back<00:07:40.480> so

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.290 
a win guaranteed right in the back so

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.080 
a win guaranteed right in the back so
it's<00:07:41.440> not<00:07:41.530> like<00:07:41.740> I<00:07:41.830> was<00:07:41.950> necessarily<00:07:42.460> stealing

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090 
it's not like I was necessarily stealing

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.270 
it's not like I was necessarily stealing
