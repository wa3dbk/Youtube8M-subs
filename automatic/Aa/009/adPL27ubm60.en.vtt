00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.200
 I'll give you back to school or too 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.870
 just after the summer what happens 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.980
 first day of school only the university day or 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.470
 first working day 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.289
 I'll show you a great one today 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.720
 outfit and later in the video too 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.800
 craft ideas like your writing material 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.019
 but you can fight a bit too 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.689
 Now first to the outfit I wear one 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 cardigan of keeping it quite good 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.890
 it's really too hot when it's summer 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.010
 is still a warm but in the rooms 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.850
 it's cold and that's why 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.739
 to collect silt 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.059
 then I wear a t-shirt with micky 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 mouse on it and an ass then I wear 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 a skater skirt i like this shape that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.270
 I like flattering myself quite well 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.950
 and I programmed a shorter one 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.360
 because then the holiday tan one 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.350
 leg can still recognize as long as possible 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.090
 that works and to the sandals this 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.280
 summer loses soles for banks 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.109
 have real trend has perfect find 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.640
 I'll take you to the outfit then a bit 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.589
 his face is still brown 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 Holiday tan all the way up a bit 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.869
 the hair is fresh, I wear it open 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.720
 and then almost a practical one 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.549
 nice backpack so in leather look and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.150
 I think it has everything just fine 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.250
 together 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.100
 I like it very much but I play 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.689
 have here too 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.610
 and although it continues right away 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.190
 supercool notepads I set up 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.229
 have and also with great penalties 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.060
 So now say the money should 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.939
 start with these sweet ones 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.149
 donate with a sweet message on it 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.649
 just brought one 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.630
 Ballpoint pen is best transparent 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.820
 so you can read the message 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.909
 You can also cheat sheet or something 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 what do not say so much for now 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.360

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 cut out 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.580
 and then just in the pen 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.280
 purely 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.000
 Could only sweet friends or night 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.100
 What ever 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.120
 what you think of what I have pleasure 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.310
 such a trifle wine list francs so 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.770
 we want to get done fast 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.440
 our boring donors a bit 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.570
 spice it up and take it for that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.560
 beautiful gashi taping here now 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.560
 get involved once 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.740
 Above all it is always 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.610
 individually and you can your pen 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.610
 and no one can steal 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.510
 next we want ours 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.670
 note book embellishes something to match 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.430
 in no template simply as 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.220
 Paper could be a bit like cardboard 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.700
 Now we want to make the shape we want 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 just do some triangles now 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.850
 then maybe your letters or something 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:04.640
 ok and that I just now with the 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:07.230
 logitech second to pull in the rolli 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.060
 so I as double-sided tape 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.430
 has and now ready so far now 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.770
 namely, then water and water broke 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.500
 I just have the inkbox here 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.660
 it was easy to deliver to the water 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.660
 colors as I want 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.209
 so that must now be the last layer 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.830
 I have made a few spots 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.239
 as you can see but I think it does 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.129
 even the picture a bit 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.420
 interesting now just like 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.420
 remove templates 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:52.030
 and the last one ready for another 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.980

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.020
 Maybe he has an old top 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.880
 Although I use pantyhose now I take 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.920
 simply the slots she puts on the 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.480
 notebook snowing small at first was 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.870
 piece off the surplus so 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:15.440
 turn around now and demo fixes 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.600
 so the last page and then have 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.180
 You had to see yours now 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.970

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.530

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.620
 shake the trail color 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.540
 completely finished then 15 centimeters 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.290
 just keep distance evenly 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.290
 feel about it 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.720
 so if the color is dried 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.280
 we already reveal our project 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.780
 has turned out to be easy now 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.610
 pull off there and then looks finished 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.500
 it has to be bad 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.390
