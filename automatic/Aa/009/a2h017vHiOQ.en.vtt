left that's not a big deal this is just
a<00:01:19.950> proof<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.250> concept<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:21.479> ensure<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
a proof of concept to ensure that this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.880 
a proof of concept to ensure that this
actually<00:01:22.950> does<00:01:23.189> work<00:01:23.369> two<00:01:23.789> three<00:01:24.180> four<00:01:24.890> seven

these<00:01:38.609> cannot<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> broken<00:01:39.299> unless<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
these cannot be broken unless in

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:49.340 
these cannot be broken unless in
creative<00:01:40.500> mode<00:01:43.070> isn't<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.520> cool<00:01:47.509> alright<00:01:48.509> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
