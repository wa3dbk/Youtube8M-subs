hey<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.050> will<00:00:01.230> Martin<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.800> just<00:00:02.340> wanted<00:00:02.520> to

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hey this is will Martin I just wanted to

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.499 
hey this is will Martin I just wanted to
show<00:00:02.760> you<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.060> latest<00:00:03.629> iteration<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:04.380> my

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
show you the latest iteration of my

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.780 
show you the latest iteration of my
suspension<00:00:06.509> design<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.790> tilting

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
suspension design for a tilting

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.360 
suspension design for a tilting
three-wheeled<00:00:09.300> electric<00:00:09.809> car<00:00:10.070> that<00:00:11.070> I'd<00:00:11.190> like

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
three-wheeled electric car that I'd like

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.499 
three-wheeled electric car that I'd like
to<00:00:11.400> build<00:00:12.410> so<00:00:13.410> right<00:00:14.070> now<00:00:14.429> what<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.820> did<00:00:15.120> was<00:00:15.360> I

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
to build so right now what I did was I

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.050 
to build so right now what I did was I
increased<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.650> max<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.490> eye<00:00:17.520> crease<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
increased the max the eye crease the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.010 
increased the max the eye crease the
height<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.789> of<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.090> uprights<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.720> well<00:00:21.869> as

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
height of the of the uprights as well as

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.890 
height of the of the uprights as well as
the<00:00:22.170> tilting<00:00:22.619> frame<00:00:23.359> that<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.750> two

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the tilting frame that was for two

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.820 
the tilting frame that was for two
reasons<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.410> was<00:00:27.109> with<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.349> height<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
reasons one was with the height of the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.290 
reasons one was with the height of the
uprights<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.490> previous<00:00:29.849> suspension

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
uprights and the previous suspension

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.440 
uprights and the previous suspension
design<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> wasn't<00:00:31.019> able<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.560> get<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.880> wasn't

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
design I wasn't able to get the I wasn't

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.049 
design I wasn't able to get the I wasn't
able<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.870> clearance<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.850> brake

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
able to get clearance for the brake

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 
able to get clearance for the brake
rotors<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.809> there's<00:00:37.410> some<00:00:37.620> pretty<00:00:37.950> big<00:00:38.040> brake

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
rotors so there's some pretty big brake

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.510 
rotors so there's some pretty big brake
rotors<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> inside<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> these<00:00:40.520> uprights

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
rotors on the inside of these uprights

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.260 
rotors on the inside of these uprights
and<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.660> needed<00:00:43.050> taller<00:00:43.590> uprights<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and I needed taller uprights for them to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.650 
and I needed taller uprights for them to
clear<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.469> other<00:00:46.620> thing<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:48.450> was

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
clear the other thing was that was

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.729 
clear the other thing was that was
running<00:00:48.899> into<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.860> limit<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.809> stroke<00:00:52.469> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
running into the limit of the stroke of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.139 
running into the limit of the stroke of
the<00:00:53.960> of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.590> shocks<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.000> using

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the of the shocks that I was using

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.630 
the of the shocks that I was using
öhlins<00:00:57.660> shocks<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> last<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
öhlins shocks on the last one and as I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
öhlins shocks on the last one and as I
was<00:00:59.850> tilting<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> frame<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:00.960> running

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
was tilting the frame it was running

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.579 
was tilting the frame it was running
into<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:03.000> limit<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> replaced<00:01:04.170> those<00:01:04.409> with

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
into the limit so I replaced those with

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.100 
into the limit so I replaced those with
these<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:05.250> larger<00:01:06.950> off-road<00:01:08.450> Baja<00:01:09.450> 1000

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
these much larger off-road Baja 1000

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.520 
these much larger off-road Baja 1000
style<00:01:10.380> racing<00:01:10.710> shocks<00:01:11.130> from<00:01:11.549> Fox<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.380> as<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
style racing shocks from Fox and as you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
style racing shocks from Fox and as you
can<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.010> much<00:01:14.280> longer<00:01:15.049> travel

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
can see they have much longer travel

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.100 
can see they have much longer travel
length<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.030> running<00:01:18.630> into<00:01:18.990> any

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
length and so it's not running into any

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.240 
length and so it's not running into any
kind<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> limit<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> tilt<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> frame

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
kind of limit when you tilt the frame

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
kind of limit when you tilt the frame
right<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.729> seems<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.990> limit

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
right now it seems like the the limit

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.980 
right now it seems like the the limit
I'm<00:01:25.439> running<00:01:25.740> into<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> maximum<00:01:26.990> tilt

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
I'm running into with the maximum tilt

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.310 
I'm running into with the maximum tilt
angle<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.220> maximum<00:01:29.729> misalignment<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
angle is the maximum misalignment of the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.460 
angle is the maximum misalignment of the
rod<00:01:32.250> end<00:01:32.460> bearings<00:01:32.520> themselves<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.350> these

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
rod end bearings themselves so these

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
rod end bearings themselves so these
meant<00:01:34.710> these<00:01:34.860> robhan<00:01:35.159> bearings<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.880> Aurora

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
meant these robhan bearings from Aurora

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.289 
meant these robhan bearings from Aurora
that<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.960> modeled<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.909> have<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> 21

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that I have modeled here have a 21

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.170 
that I have modeled here have a 21
degree<00:01:39.630> maximum<00:01:40.140> misalignment<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
degree maximum misalignment and as you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.569 
degree maximum misalignment and as you
can<00:01:42.329> see<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:43.170> gives<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> maximum<00:01:43.890> tilt

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
can see that gives you a maximum tilt

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.780 
can see that gives you a maximum tilt
angle<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.869> car<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.649> maybe<00:01:47.189> about<00:01:47.430> 20

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
angle on the car of maybe about 20

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.280 
angle on the car of maybe about 20
degrees<00:01:48.140> which<00:01:49.140> isn't<00:01:49.290> too<00:01:49.560> bad<00:01:50.390> if<00:01:51.390> you're<00:01:51.840> in

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
degrees which isn't too bad if you're in

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.639 
degrees which isn't too bad if you're in
a<00:01:52.979> motorcycle<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.170> super<00:01:55.170> bike<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
a motorcycle like a super bike on a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.580 
a motorcycle like a super bike on a
track<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.369> might<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.240> maximum<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.170> 40

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
track you might get a maximum of 40

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800 
track you might get a maximum of 40
degrees<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.280> tilt<00:01:59.909> angle<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.689> you're

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
degrees of tilt angle when you're

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.440 
degrees of tilt angle when you're
getting<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.170> knee<00:02:01.350> down<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> corner<00:02:02.450> so

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
getting your knee down in a corner so

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.950 
getting your knee down in a corner so
for<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> road<00:02:04.049> car<00:02:04.079> or<00:02:04.680> 20<00:02:05.070> degrees<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.790> tilt<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
for a road car or 20 degrees of tilt I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.020 
for a road car or 20 degrees of tilt I
think<00:02:07.770> would<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.459> good<00:02:08.700> it'd<00:02:08.940> be

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
think would be pretty good it'd be

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.770 
think would be pretty good it'd be
pretty<00:02:09.209> fun<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.819> know<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
pretty fun so you know if it's not the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.380 
pretty fun so you know if it's not the
end<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.020> world

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
end of the world

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600
