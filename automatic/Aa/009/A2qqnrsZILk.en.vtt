00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.679
 today I show how to make a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.830
 of my favorite colleagues 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.619
 the french actress good ok on jules 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.300
 debate born in Quebec where I live title 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.260
 I know that French is in europe 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.880
 France we say African braids where he 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.140
 are plenty of other names but I 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.390
 will continue to say very alone 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.650
 French because for me it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.600
 gives I'll show it is a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.130
 French truce is new 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.510
 preferred because it is very 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.100
 quickly when you know how 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.079
 do I know very classic 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.969
 thing she gave the impression 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.219
 we spent still time for 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.440
 to do her hair and then I wear in her 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.410
 hancock SÃ©meries poems like a whore 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.579
 to learn in the face to say that we 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.140
 will purchase is not really 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.329
 how to share between French games 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.809
 just practice and now I know 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.430
 how it 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.840
 then I can make several variations to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.199
 do french be mistress and thank you 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.180
 in my Monza before something like that so 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.710
 she plays between is what it tells you in 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.570
 but today the next video 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.210
 it is the basic French truce 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 it only takes a resilient or 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 you have little hair like me 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.340
 who would have nasa on the hole it is written 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.049
 as such crimes go it is very 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.450
 beautiful but if you do not want this 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.000
 manes you can take the full 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.439
 coil for just the approached these 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.439
 berries of your head or even 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.869
 So halak of a surprise here in June 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.140
 So while this one begins with the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.140
 hairstyle 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.590
 so we start by sectioning the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.080
 hair above the ears 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.670
 very flexible and how you want 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.170
 but it's easier to learn from 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.050
 start it over the ears 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.150
 this section there it is divided into three 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.920
 hair short of equal size between 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.100
 we try to make them equal time 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 and there is a real right a real at 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.660
 environment and sandstone left to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.550
 we will start crossing the strand 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.340
 speak right above the wick 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.260
 were in the middle like it is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.140
 full boom with the left strand we 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.110
 crosses over the middle of the arm which 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.670
 was formerly the right bret 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.220
 French press principle is that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.020
 added hair to locks of hair 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.530
 which are outside in skin 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.320
 middle and after we think adds that 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.740
 Halamish of hair like no one 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.700
 too much and then we cross by the fis the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.810
 middle of the magic like it is added 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.800
 Hair to the wick and outside and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.160
 we meet in the middle so we added 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.480
 Hair we meet and that thus we 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.730
 crosses becomes the middle of the league with 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.370
 the other wick hair works and one 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.860
 crosses and you can press 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.770
 as tight or as tight as you 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.320
 want do not mind and end 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.770
 so when you do not have any lashes anymore 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.570
 added 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.790
 you finish the press in the presence 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.080
 regular in the background makes you not 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.410
 French make a truce because there 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.700
 no hair added here everything for 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.110
 a-13 French 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.280
 it was still pretty easy the 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.280
 principle is simple for them those 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.650
 practiced and here is the final result 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.820
 I love this hairstyle I find 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.170
 really city 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.290
 and when we know the make is super 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.290
 easy 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.240
 faye and that was all I hope it 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.740

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.930
 to make a French truce I hope it 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.990
 you had the idea and I swear this 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.070
 depth is really fun to do 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.690
 it was really complicated in 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.120
 potential I love hairstyle 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.890
