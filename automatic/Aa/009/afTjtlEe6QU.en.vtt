strip down to this point I just just
taking<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> bottom<00:01:12.960> off<00:01:13.159> you<00:01:14.159> want<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> look

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
taking the bottom off you want to look

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.510 
taking the bottom off you want to look
for<00:01:14.610> two<00:01:14.820> pins<00:01:15.060> over<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:16.130> smooth<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> screen

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
for two pins over here smooth the screen

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.890 
for two pins over here smooth the screen
out<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> way<00:01:17.850> both<00:01:18.540> led<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.830> two<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.720> top

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
out the way both led a a two is just top

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
out the way both led a a two is just top
one<00:01:22.049> am<00:01:22.340> yeah<00:01:23.509> it's<00:01:24.509> top<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.840> here<00:01:25.369> which<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.400> M

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
one am yeah it's top one here which is M

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.170 
one am yeah it's top one here which is M
and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.310> took<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.610> across<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and then you want to took them across it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.880 
and then you want to took them across it
with<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.650> connect

with this one if you want to connect

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
with this one if you want to connect
these<00:01:31.979> two<00:01:32.189> together<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.640> resistor<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
these two together with a resistor you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.410 
these two together with a resistor you
can<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.950> an<00:01:35.040> LED

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
can like in one of the one have an LED

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.530 
can like in one of the one have an LED
specially<00:01:36.420> soaring<00:01:36.770> slash<00:01:37.770> resistor<00:01:38.450> will<00:01:39.450> go

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
specially soaring slash resistor will go

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.179 
specially soaring slash resistor will go
right<00:01:40.790> later<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.000> tin<00:01:42.240> these<00:01:42.420> two<00:01:42.630> prints<00:01:43.189> you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
right later is tin these two prints you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.520 
right later is tin these two prints you
sell<00:01:44.399> any<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:44.850> quite<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.320> when

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sell any one are quite a you know when

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.330 
sell any one are quite a you know when
I'm<00:01:46.939> fine<00:01:47.939> tip<00:01:48.240> sold<00:01:48.479> an<00:01:48.630> iron<00:01:49.100> into<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> too

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
I'm fine tip sold an iron into a too

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:04.590 
I'm fine tip sold an iron into a too
crazy<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:54.869> these<00:01:55.079> points<00:01:55.380> here

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
the cables tend as well quite thin gauge

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.700 
the cables tend as well quite thin gauge
y-axis<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.610> quite<00:02:11.230> tricky<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.440> get<00:02:12.680> around

the<00:02:18.710> one<00:02:18.860> way<00:02:19.040> on<00:02:21.460> I'll<00:02:22.460> do<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> bad<00:02:22.820> job<00:02:22.850> than

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
the one way on I'll do a bad job than

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:33.610 
the one way on I'll do a bad job than
I'm<00:02:23.330> doing<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.370> these<00:02:25.610> are<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.820> oil<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
I'm doing so these are the oil if you

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.160 
I'm doing so these are the oil if you
are<00:02:33.890> gonna<00:02:34.040> do<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> lead<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:35.540> top<00:02:35.750> one<00:02:35.930> needs

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
are gonna do a lead a the top one needs

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.930 
are gonna do a lead a the top one needs
to<00:02:36.290> be<00:02:36.440> on<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.860> positive<00:02:37.040> leg<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.640> bottom<00:02:37.850> one

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
to be on the positive leg the bottom one

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.190 
to be on the positive leg the bottom one
on<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.120> negative<00:02:38.510> leg<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:40.070> I've<00:02:40.310> got<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.990> was

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
on the negative leg that I've got it was

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.460 
on the negative leg that I've got it was
Esther<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.680> think<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:42.950> one's<00:02:43.190> about<00:02:43.340> 100<00:02:44.210> ohms

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
Esther I think this one's about 100 ohms

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.210 
Esther I think this one's about 100 ohms
resistor<00:02:45.470> doesn't<00:02:46.250> really<00:02:46.430> matter<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:48.220> their

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
resistor doesn't really matter and their

00:02:49.220 --> 00:03:17.050 
resistor doesn't really matter and their
solder<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:53.920> course<00:02:54.920> these<00:02:55.040> pointy

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.920 

and<00:03:18.060> some<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:20.629> so<00:03:21.629> if<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.780> need<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and some this one on so if you need to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.740 
and some this one on so if you need to
bridge<00:03:22.230> um<00:03:22.880> without<00:03:23.880> any<00:03:24.090> resistor<00:03:24.690> or

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
bridge um without any resistor or

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.589 
bridge um without any resistor or
anything<00:03:25.230> away<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.800> just<00:03:25.860> doesn't<00:03:26.340> work<00:03:26.599> it

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
anything away it just doesn't work it

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.600 
anything away it just doesn't work it
just<00:03:27.630> comes<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.080> black<00:03:29.870> ones<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.340> was<00:03:32.340> doing<00:03:32.519> it

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
for it now I sure could do a better job

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.589 
for it now I sure could do a better job
then<00:03:35.880> look<00:03:36.030> at<00:03:36.150> their<00:03:36.269> estate<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:37.549> alright
