your bar finger at the fifth fret

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
your bar finger at the fifth fret
because<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.939> an<00:01:48.060> easy<00:01:48.420> spot<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.140> able

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
because this is an easy spot to be able
