00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.710
 device from German helmets and no usa 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.020
 40

 no here just have a rough 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.719
 the leather substitute is empty and 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.200
 inside 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:16.020
 instead of this pillow that's such a double 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:20.280
 water fights then these nets are leatherette 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 contracted this string here he was at the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.799
 I will not untie him any more 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.799
 here you will see very well erase 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.890
 Top of us 68 years old 4-ki these rivets 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.890
 mounting type 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.680
 one two three four 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.680
 before these riveted mounts are attached 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.900
 directly themselves these here so 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.350
 called 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:59.640
 pillows here it is this piece of iron 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.640
 t-spring leave 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:10.090
 extraordinary life is that which bends 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:12.459
 acura he springs on you here too it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:20.550
 make of springy store just such 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.550
 beech shaped and then dig gently 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.140
 directly to the frame itself and see 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.989
 here is this leather substitute 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.580
 let's say the pillow of the balaclava they to 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.580
 figurative too riveted 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.220
 here and here two places meant i 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.760
 I think what to collect this whole structure 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.459
 Yes, and the T-shaped so that's springy 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.650
 element and then its loop 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:58.239
 stick directly to the most with 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.310
 Carts helmets so would just be more convenient here 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.000
 than the first, this outfit prikopat 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.480
 the spring is then sticking 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.510
 here it is all devices so these springs 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.650
 they are everywhere 4 pieces on each side all 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:20.430
 is it very simple here too 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.430
 the spring is attached it is the same 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:34.150
 spring rivets 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.860
 dangling metals springing no not 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.010
 solid 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.920
 not soft but springy thanks to 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.510
 to this 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.520
 under the neck has a property like 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.220
 spring 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.020
 here and now we push it ourselves 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.330
 you can see that these cushions here and here 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.450
 walk here they are on the sides 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.910
 here here still have rivets here with this 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.520
 her side 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:13.530
 here comes the strap strap performing 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:21.010
 so too hlyastika and too rivet 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:24.460
 made of leather perform even with yellow 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.370
 skin and yellow skin here 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.970
 chin rest so this is not an example 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.790
 hall of skin so there is nothing more than a thousand 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.740
 China shoelaces many shoelaces already and wears 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.650
 such an auxiliary character is not at all 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.780
 I know 2 hours and this lace for fastening 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.610
 mesh 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.560
 this lace still runs along the edges 10 you 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.479
 you see here on the side where it goes 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.060
 attaching all the same camouflage 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.820
 worn over here or bear 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.970
 is masking sacking for 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.970
 masking no more and let's all stas 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.389
 restore the helmet all for now
