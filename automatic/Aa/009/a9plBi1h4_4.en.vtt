00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 from the weekend car drivers theirs 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.720
 lost your driver's license 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.280
 the license is now increasingly in the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.099
 neighboring czech republic 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.230
 whether alcohol or even drugs on the tax 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.080
 prehistory of the autolenker without 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.550
 Driving license does not matter there 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.920
 and because of the driver's license too 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.980
 quick and easy to get there 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.859
 it is now a veritable 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.779
 driving license tourism only one 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.460
 second home in czechia needs one 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.529
 few students in the Czech Republic 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 driving license and that only 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.120
 specialized for around six months 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.100
 agencies do the formalities 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.440
 the students only have to go up once 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.730
 magistrate on the next visit 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.730
 you already start for the exam 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.500
 a colleague of mine has the tip 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 the driving school is all legal and is 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.870
 in germany the chance had more 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 I had lost it then 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 China come as her classmates had 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.190
 Also tamara ever a driver's license 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.780
 she too wants the sparkle in now 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:12.300
 Churches make difficult in Germany 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.120
 So, a cut went the teacher 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.470
 alcohol or drugs handlebars get 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.240
 on this way no national 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.250
 Differences in the teaching methods 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.110
 and laws are concerned 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 czechs and foreigners same the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.140
 However, exams are clear with us 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 easier than in Germany or 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.820
 Austria the picture driver's license costs 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.710
 in Austria about 1500 euro for the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 technical one must indeed around 1000 euros 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.460
 pay more 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.580
 accommodation is provided by interpreters 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.759
 traffic psychological investigations 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.450
 and exams included 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.580
 recruitment agencies advertise with a 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.840
 Success rate of 98 percent 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.720
 But the real problem in Germany 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.039
 gave with the so-called mpu or in 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 Austria vbu called or idiot test 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.369
 but not in germany 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.310
 but managed to find the way over 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.709
 The Czech Republic easily and easily 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.140
 to obtain a driver 's license 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.300
 but from it a business 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.160
 whether the learners on actual the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.910
 second seat in czechia have with 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.910
 not exactly 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.930
 if this residence criterion is bypassed 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.820
 at the moment they are 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.420
 regulations as I said earlier 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.570
 generous that means such driving licenses 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.920
 also be recognized in at least 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.690
 Austria and probably also in 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.370
 the other eu states 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.460
 who has a foreign driving license 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.860
 want to hurry up since 2013 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.690
 an eu directive comes into force 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.760
 the acquisition abroad at least then 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.630
 prevents if the lid in the home country 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.630
 was withdrawn
