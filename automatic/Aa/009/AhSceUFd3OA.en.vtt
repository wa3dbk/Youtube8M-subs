Toronto<00:02:01.509> play<00:02:01.690> stuff<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.410> thought<00:02:02.800> that<00:02:02.950> was

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
Toronto play stuff I thought that was

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.100 
Toronto play stuff I thought that was
pretty<00:02:03.220> cool<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.970> they<00:02:04.090> added<00:02:04.420> in<00:02:04.570> there<00:02:04.810> and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
pretty cool that they added in there and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.960 
pretty cool that they added in there and
then<00:02:05.649> they<00:02:05.740> also<00:02:05.860> added<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.369> this<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:06.850> if

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
then they also added it in this so if

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.020

after the to muvico wrap up the video
but<00:03:07.569> as<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.109> can<00:03:08.230> see<00:03:08.409> the<00:03:08.739> lines<00:03:09.099> are<00:03:09.310> just

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
but as you can see the lines are just

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.449 
but as you can see the lines are just
phenomenal<00:03:09.639> I<00:03:10.359> also<00:03:10.719> thought<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.049> maybe<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
phenomenal I also thought that maybe the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.119 
phenomenal I also thought that maybe the
LA<00:03:13.359> Kings<00:03:13.659> will<00:03:13.840> have<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.109> Stanley<00:03:14.379> Cup<00:03:14.680> cards

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
LA Kings will have to Stanley Cup cards

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.959 
LA Kings will have to Stanley Cup cards

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:18.969 
but I guess they don't and the Lancers

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.080 
but I guess they don't and the Lancers
