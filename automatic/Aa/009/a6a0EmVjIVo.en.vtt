with
which<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.150> where<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.360> stopped<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:15.430> think<00:02:16.120> that

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
which is where I stopped I think that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300 
which is where I stopped I think that
was<00:02:16.450> like<00:02:16.480> how<00:02:16.930> many<00:02:17.080> pages<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.560> maybe<00:02:17.800> 20<00:02:18.100> or

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
was like how many pages like maybe 20 or

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.340 
was like how many pages like maybe 20 or
so<00:02:18.570> there<00:02:19.570> were<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.660> bunch<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.870> pages<00:02:20.020> where<00:02:20.320> I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
so there were a bunch of pages where I

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.870 
so there were a bunch of pages where I
thought<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.830> next<00:02:21.070> page<00:02:21.250> was<00:02:21.430> gonna<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.730> gay

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
thought the next page was gonna be gay

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.880 
thought the next page was gonna be gay
and<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.390> wasn't<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.020> was<00:02:23.170> like<00:02:23.320> thank<00:02:23.650> you
