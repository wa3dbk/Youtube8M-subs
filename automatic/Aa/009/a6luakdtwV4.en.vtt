the<00:01:09.780> cache<00:01:09.960> will<00:01:10.170> work<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.950> first<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.610> need<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the cache will work so first you need to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.620

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
pattern cache so wipe them and come back

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.770 
pattern cache so wipe them and come back
and<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.310> need<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> install<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.299> home

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.030 

that's<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.270> P<00:01:53.720> boarding<00:01:54.020> system<00:01:54.200> after

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
perfectly so remember that this problem

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.060 
perfectly so remember that this problem
is<00:01:59.030> because<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.990> incompatibility<00:02:00.560> between

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
is because the incompatibility between

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.170 
is because the incompatibility between
the<00:02:01.640> G<00:02:02.060> apps<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.690> build<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.280> hope<00:02:04.910> this

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
the G apps and the build so I hope this

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.560 
the G apps and the build so I hope this
