and<00:00:19.910> you<00:00:20.910> won't<00:00:21.119> get<00:00:21.330> 14<00:00:21.750> millimeter<00:00:22.170> out<00:00:22.260> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and you won't get 14 millimeter out of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.599 
and you won't get 14 millimeter out of
it<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:22.769> they'll<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.160> crop<00:00:23.400> mode

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
it because they'll be in the crop mode

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
it because they'll be in the crop mode

but on the full-frame camera you get a

full 14 millimeter wide angle lens my
initial<00:00:29.460> testing<00:00:29.910> shows<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.510> works

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
initial testing shows that it works

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.069 
initial testing shows that it works
pretty<00:00:30.960> daggone<00:00:31.529> good<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.450> I'm<00:00:33.809> not

super picky on on lenses as long as the
photo<00:00:37.440> looks<00:00:37.770> fantastic<00:00:38.670> I'm<00:00:38.879> happy<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> don't

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
photo looks fantastic I'm happy I don't

photo looks fantastic I'm happy I don't
pixel<00:00:39.930> peep<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.350> 100%<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.489> look<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.440> the

pixel peep at 100% and look for the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.639 
pixel peep at 100% and look for the
flaws<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.309> some<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
flaws that that some of the

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.010 
flaws that that some of the
perfectionists<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.149> initial<00:00:48.600> testing

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
perfectionists do but my initial testing

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.900 
perfectionists do but my initial testing
shows<00:00:49.289> me<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.860> look<00:00:50.489> works<00:00:50.700> pretty

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
shows me that this look works pretty

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.760 
shows me that this look works pretty
good<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:51.300> again<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> manual<00:00:52.110> lens<00:00:52.350> so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
good now again it's a manual lens so

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.200 
good now again it's a manual lens so
you're<00:00:52.980> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.730> adjust<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
you're going to have to adjust the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
you're going to have to adjust the
f-stop<00:00:54.600> manually<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> lens<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.190> OK

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
f-stop manually on the lens which is OK

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.360 
f-stop manually on the lens which is OK
with<00:00:56.670> me<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> focus<00:00:57.719> manually<00:00:58.379> but

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
with me and the focus manually but

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
with me and the focus manually but
you're<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> get<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> 14<00:01:00.480> millimeter<00:01:00.719> wide

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you're going to get a 14 millimeter wide

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.170 
you're going to get a 14 millimeter wide
angle<00:01:01.620> lens<00:01:02.030> for<00:01:03.110> around<00:01:04.159> 320<00:01:05.159> dollars<00:01:05.280> some

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
angle lens for around 320 dollars some

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.380 
angle lens for around 320 dollars some
places<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.930> very<00:01:07.560> affordable<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> lens<00:01:09.180> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
places so very affordable for a lens of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.200 
places so very affordable for a lens of
this<00:01:09.540> quality<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.110> feels<00:01:10.380> very<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:10.950> made<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
this quality it feels very well made the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.109 
this quality it feels very well made the
tolerances<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.990> all<00:01:13.140> feel<00:01:13.500> great<00:01:14.119> optically

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
tolerances and all feel great optically

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
tolerances and all feel great optically
it<00:01:15.390> seems<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.869> pretty<00:01:16.049> daggone<00:01:16.619> good<00:01:16.890> for

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
it seems to be pretty daggone good for

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.130 
it seems to be pretty daggone good for
the<00:01:17.220> price<00:01:17.460> point<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> need<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the price point so if you need a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.050 
the price point so if you need a
wide-angle<00:01:19.530> lens<00:01:19.920> from<00:01:20.250> time<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> time<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
wide-angle lens from time to time to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.039 
wide-angle lens from time to time to
shoot<00:01:21.240> building<00:01:21.780> interiors<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:23.390> if<00:01:24.390> you're<00:01:24.960> at

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
shoot building interiors or if you're at

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
shoot building interiors or if you're at
an<00:01:25.170> event<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> need<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> wider<00:01:26.340> angle<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
an event and you need a wider angle of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.630 
an event and you need a wider angle of
view<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:28.049> 24<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> 70<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.280> took<00:01:29.400> off<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
view that 24 to 70 I just took off the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.850 
view that 24 to 70 I just took off the
widest<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> goes<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> 24<00:01:31.200> millimeters<00:01:31.680> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
widest it goes is 24 millimeters and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
widest it goes is 24 millimeters and
there's<00:01:31.979> quite<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> difference<00:01:33.210> between<00:01:33.270> 24

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
there's quite a difference between 24

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
there's quite a difference between 24
and<00:01:34.020> 14<00:01:34.470> millimeter<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> wide<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.600> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and 14 millimeter on the wide side so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.469 
and 14 millimeter on the wide side so
this<00:01:36.810> will<00:01:37.020> give<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.549> much<00:01:38.549> wider<00:01:38.880> field<00:01:39.119> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
this will give you much wider field of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.109 
this will give you much wider field of
view<00:01:39.540> should<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.680> great<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.280> video<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.880> well

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
view should be great for video as well

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.969 
view should be great for video as well
again<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.899> you're<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> situation<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.799> need

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
again if you're in a situation we need

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
again if you're in a situation we need
that<00:01:44.159> wide<00:01:44.369> angle<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:45.090> video<00:01:45.360> should<00:01:46.170> work

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that wide angle for video should work

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.679 
that wide angle for video should work
great<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.250> well<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.509> myself

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
great for that as well don't see myself

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.630 
great for that as well don't see myself
using<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.619> often<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> need

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
using this that often but when you need

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160 
using this that often but when you need
to<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.939> wide<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.869> wide<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
to go wide you need to go wide and
