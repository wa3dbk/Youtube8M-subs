00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.690
 good today we are going to make peppers 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:09.350
 stuffed for it we have peppers 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:14.200
 chopped meat rice 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.100
 garlic onion carrot tomato crushed 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.680
 today we are going to put some mushrooms 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.350
 as well 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.170
 a glass of white wine 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.070
 chicken broth with vegetables you can 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.140
 buy that if you want olive oil and 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 salt good then I'll be preparing all 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.390
 the ingredients and then we started 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.020
 ok so let's continue now 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.200
 with the sofrito we have the carrot and 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.880
 the onion has grated 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.060
 we have cut it not cut it too 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.120
 Very fine 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.120
 let's see we have garlic already golden brown 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.160
 the carrot 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.400
 OK 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.360
 Well, nothing is going to suffer this a little bit 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.710
 and to continue 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.420
 well I already have the vegetable and it is a 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.920
 little bit poached 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.860
 let's take the qualified one in this 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.090
 point and for inside 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.930
 Well, nothing will suffer a little 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.540
 meat and let's see how it continues 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.210
 so we have the meat and a little bit 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.980
 sofrito 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.850
 at this point I'm going to throw the wine because 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.850
 is beginning to stay longer 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.820
 when you have reduced a little already 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.530
 We will miss the mushroom and tomato 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.360
 filling and we'll see 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.150
 Well the wine we just take 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.580
 but 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.770
 once it has been reduced now what 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.770
 let's make is the mushroom with 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.399
 caldito and everything 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.990
 for inside we suffer a little more and 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.990
 Now we take the tomato 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.300
 so this is already 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.490
 It is already beginning to dry 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.490
 caldito let's take the tomato 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.890
 in all the steps I practically went 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.020
 adding a little salt and it does not go 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.610
 watching but good logically takes salt 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.380
 it's worth nothing I'm going to prepare the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.790
 peppers prepare rice and 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.120
 let's see how it comes 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.650
 It's worth the peppers as you can see 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 we already have prepared them clean 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.300
 lavadito without following 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.240
 we take the rice and we're going to go with the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.240
 rice to a pan I'm going to throw 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.050
 let's suffer rice a little bit 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.340
 here we already have this that is 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.260
 practically I'm going to turn it off to the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.840
 right away and now we see how the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.170
 fill in and how we continue as 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.970
 you can see we have the rice with the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.670
 stuffing I'm going to mix it now 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.920
 this we will mix it well mixed and 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.650
 he's just going to keep taking the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.390
 peppers and stuffing them like 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.370
 I have prepared your caps for each pepper 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.140
 it's a whole then we'll close it with some 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.390
 chopsticks for then you will see how 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.330
 it's over and I'm going to put it in a 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.610
 paella I'll put the caldito and baked 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.850
 Well now you see it as it is 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.850
 want 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.170
 As you can see, the peppers are already 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.870
 stuffed locks you do not have it 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.570
 everything left a tad unfilled because 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.150
 then when the rice is swollen now 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.530
 I'm going to take the broth 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.680
 and add the broth to the paella that I said 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.950
 what is simply done in a paella 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.409
 I'm going to put the broth over everything for 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.269
 I'll give them a little spin 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.989
 the peppers and then we'll go 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.920
 watching and here we have the plate 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.920
 finished 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.640
 inside 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.150
 nice smell of category still has if 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.480
 it does not move a little bit it is appreciated has a 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.460
 tad 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.950
 allows caldito 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.780
 and this I'll pass it to a little gadget 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.780
 mud and eat
