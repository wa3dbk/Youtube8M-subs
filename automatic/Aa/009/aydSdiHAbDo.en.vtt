and the material you put into it so I'm
going<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.690> get<00:00:20.840> right<00:00:21.050> to<00:00:21.320> it

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.090 

this<00:00:31.600> is<00:00:31.780> how<00:00:31.960> I'll<00:00:32.110> explain<00:00:32.260> it<00:00:32.800> you're<00:00:32.980> going

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
this is how I'll explain it you're going

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
this is how I'll explain it you're going
to<00:00:33.240> crosshatch<00:00:34.240> the<00:00:34.570> grains<00:00:35.100> right<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
to crosshatch the grains right and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.420 
to crosshatch the grains right and
you're<00:00:37.240> going<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:37.390> have<00:00:37.510> pieces<00:00:37.720> going<00:00:38.430> long

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
you're going to have pieces going long

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.660 
you're going to have pieces going long
ways<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.440> then<00:00:45.190> in<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.400> next

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
ways right and and then in the next

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.910 
ways right and and then in the next
layer<00:00:45.880> you're<00:00:46.600> going<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:46.840> have<00:00:46.960> pieces<00:00:47.320> going

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
layer you're going to have pieces going

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.670 
layer you're going to have pieces going
the<00:00:48.790> short<00:00:49.120> way<00:00:51.150> this<00:00:52.150> way<00:00:52.390> okay<00:00:53.020> that's<00:00:53.590> a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
the short way this way okay that's a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.360 
the short way this way okay that's a
real<00:00:53.860> simple<00:00:54.129> idea<00:00:54.580> right<00:00:55.980> okay<00:00:56.980> so<00:00:57.040> we're

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
real simple idea right okay so we're

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.100 
real simple idea right okay so we're
going<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.520> build<00:00:57.760> up<00:00:57.940> layers<00:00:58.270> as<00:00:58.570> we<00:00:58.870> build

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
going to build up layers as we build

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.689 
going to build up layers as we build
each<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.760> we<00:01:00.940> build<00:01:01.150> each<00:01:01.300> layer<00:01:02.670> we're<00:01:03.670> going

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
each as we build each layer we're going

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.700 
each as we build each layer we're going
to<00:01:04.120> plane<00:01:04.809> down<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.290> top<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:06.100> get<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:06.880> smooth

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to plane down the top and get a smooth

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.060 
to plane down the top and get a smooth
surface<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:09.040> start<00:01:09.280> with<00:01:09.430> again<00:01:09.760> so<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:11.800> begin

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
surface to start with again so to begin

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.020 
surface to start with again so to begin
with<00:01:12.340> when<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.270> make<00:01:13.510> your<00:01:13.659> strips<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:15.790> need

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
with when you make your strips they need

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.100 
with when you make your strips they need
to<00:01:16.150> be<00:01:16.330> smooth<00:01:17.020> on<00:01:17.260> one<00:01:17.440> side<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:19.450> these

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
to be smooth on one side and then these

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.910 
to be smooth on one side and then these
edges<00:01:20.710> preferably<00:01:21.550> will<00:01:22.420> be<00:01:22.540> straight<00:01:22.930> but<00:01:23.770> on

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
edges preferably will be straight but on

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.950 
edges preferably will be straight but on
this<00:01:24.040> side<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.520> can<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:24.880> rough<00:01:25.300> it<00:01:25.720> can<00:01:25.870> be

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
this side this can be rough it can be

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.570 
this side this can be rough it can be
rough<00:01:26.170> cut<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.500> doesn't<00:01:26.800> matter<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:28.000> right<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
rough cut it doesn't matter all right so

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.830 
rough cut it doesn't matter all right so
you<00:01:30.580> definitely<00:01:30.820> need<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.270> decide<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.720> be

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
you definitely need to decide to be

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.899 
you definitely need to decide to be
smooth<00:01:32.170> at<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.409> very<00:01:32.680> least<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.280> butts

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
smooth at the very least and that butts

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.030 
smooth at the very least and that butts
right<00:01:34.120> up<00:01:34.180> against<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:35.320> smooth<00:01:35.560> surface<00:01:36.010> that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
right up against the smooth surface that

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.180 
right up against the smooth surface that
we<00:01:36.280> made<00:01:36.490> on<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.760> base<00:01:39.240> board<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.510> begin<00:01:40.780> with

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
we made on the base board to begin with

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.950 
we made on the base board to begin with
so<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:43.270> put<00:01:43.780> all<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.020> smooth<00:01:44.260> sides<00:01:44.560> down<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
so you put all the smooth sides down you

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.350 
so you put all the smooth sides down you
glue<00:01:47.380> them<00:01:47.560> down<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:48.100> then<00:01:48.760> you<00:01:48.910> plane<00:01:49.150> off

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
glue them down and then you plane off

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.760 
glue them down and then you plane off
the<00:01:49.510> top<00:01:49.720> okay

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
the top okay

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.530 
the top okay
so<00:01:50.920> I'll<00:01:51.040> show<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.310> real<00:01:51.550> quick<00:01:51.760> you're<00:01:52.390> going

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
so I'll show you real quick you're going

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.110 
so I'll show you real quick you're going
to<00:01:52.600> need<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> board<00:01:53.350> for<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.650> top<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.850> wrap

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
to need a board for the top and I wrap

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.740 
to need a board for the top and I wrap
this<00:01:55.390> in<00:01:55.450> plastic<00:01:55.890> okay<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.610> there's<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.540> towel

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
this in plastic okay and there's a towel

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.200 
this in plastic okay and there's a towel
underneath<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.650> towel<00:01:59.860> acts<00:02:00.160> like<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> buffer

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
underneath the towel acts like a buffer

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.840 
underneath the towel acts like a buffer
between<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.500> different<00:02:03.010> sizes<00:02:03.280> and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
between the different sizes and

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.720 
between the different sizes and
thicknesses<00:02:04.330> of<00:02:04.720> your<00:02:04.900> wood<00:02:05.140> okay<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
thicknesses of your wood okay and the

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.550 
thicknesses of your wood okay and the
plastic<00:02:06.970> keeps<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.720> glues<00:02:07.930> from<00:02:08.110> sticking<00:02:08.379> to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
plastic keeps the glues from sticking to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.070 
plastic keeps the glues from sticking to
the<00:02:08.590> towel<00:02:10.050> basically<00:02:12.480> you've<00:02:13.480> got<00:02:13.510> your<00:02:13.870> base

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
the towel basically you've got your base

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.820 
the towel basically you've got your base
board<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.739> that's<00:02:15.250> real<00:02:15.519> sturdy<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.830> then

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
board and that's real sturdy and then

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.400 
board and that's real sturdy and then
you've<00:02:17.950> got<00:02:18.160> this<00:02:18.430> which<00:02:19.300> will<00:02:19.569> layer<00:02:19.930> down<00:02:20.230> on

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
you've got this which will layer down on

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.580 
you've got this which will layer down on
top<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.390> squish<00:02:22.390> all<00:02:22.660> those<00:02:22.900> pieces<00:02:23.260> on

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
top of it and squish all those pieces on

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.030 
top of it and squish all those pieces on
to<00:02:23.830> there<00:02:24.900> after<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.019> glue<00:02:26.200> them<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.920> way

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
to there after you glue them that way

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.320 
to there after you glue them that way
you<00:02:27.129> can<00:02:27.280> clamp<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:27.640> whole<00:02:27.909> thing<00:02:28.150> into

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
you can clamp this whole thing into

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:38.590 
you can clamp this whole thing into
place<00:02:28.620> okay<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:30.010> here<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.310> go

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:52.600

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
all right so we're going to let this set

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.400 
all right so we're going to let this set
for<00:02:55.140> however<00:02:55.770> long<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.400> says<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.880> here<00:03:00.410> 30

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
for however long it says on here 30

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.059 
for however long it says on here 30
minutes<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:03.530> then<00:03:04.530> we're<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.860> come

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
minutes and then we're going to come

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:15.059 
minutes and then we're going to come
back<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.989> clean<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.890> off

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.100 

okay<00:03:18.790> okay<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:19.849> this<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.329> basically<00:03:20.750> what<00:03:20.959> you

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
okay okay so this is basically what you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.899 
okay okay so this is basically what you
have<00:03:21.140> after<00:03:21.799> you<00:03:21.860> do<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.189> first<00:03:22.220> layer<00:03:22.700> and

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
have after you do the first layer and

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.170 
have after you do the first layer and
that<00:03:23.329> totally<00:03:23.810> looks<00:03:24.049> like<00:03:24.230> crap<00:03:24.560> but<00:03:25.000> we<00:03:26.000> will

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
that totally looks like crap but we will

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
that totally looks like crap but we will
transform<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.079> in<00:03:27.409> the<00:03:27.950> planer<00:03:28.989> alright<00:03:29.989> so

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
transform it in the planer alright so

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.349 
transform it in the planer alright so
this<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.650> what<00:03:30.799> it<00:03:30.860> looks<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.129> up<00:03:31.370> close<00:03:31.400> when

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
this is what it looks like up close when

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.809 
this is what it looks like up close when
we<00:03:32.390> got<00:03:32.689> our<00:03:32.900> first<00:03:33.230> layer<00:03:33.560> on<00:03:33.890> there<00:03:34.099> now

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
we got our first layer on there now

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.940 
we got our first layer on there now
we're<00:03:34.939> going<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.090> put<00:03:35.299> our<00:03:35.390> second<00:03:35.810> layer<00:03:35.989> on

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:48.610 

and<00:03:39.950> move<00:03:40.340> on<00:03:40.489> here

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:04:19.680 

you

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:28.160 

you

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:48.409 

you

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.549 

all<00:04:49.419> right<00:04:49.599> so<00:04:49.749> now<00:04:49.869> we're<00:04:50.020> doing<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.349> third

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:50.559 
all right so now we're doing the third

00:04:50.559 --> 00:05:08.970 
all right so now we're doing the third
layer

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.760 

all<00:05:09.970> right<00:05:10.120> so<00:05:10.330> now<00:05:11.140> we've<00:05:11.320> done<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.590> third

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
all right so now we've done the third

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.330 
all right so now we've done the third
layer<00:05:12.040> and<00:05:13.380> we're<00:05:14.380> going<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.590> move<00:05:14.740> on<00:05:14.920> to<00:05:15.130> the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
layer and we're going to move on to the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.480 
layer and we're going to move on to the
final<00:05:15.780> piece<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.710> decided<00:05:18.280> to

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
final piece and and I decided to

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.000 
final piece and and I decided to
decorate<00:05:18.640> it<00:05:19.030> with<00:05:19.200> maple<00:05:20.310> on<00:05:21.310> this<00:05:22.030> side<00:05:22.300> so

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
decorate it with maple on this side so

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.530 
decorate it with maple on this side so
we'll<00:05:24.010> glue<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.370> down<00:05:24.640> and<00:05:24.940> move<00:05:25.120> on<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.450> the

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
we'll glue that down and move on to the

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.110 
we'll glue that down and move on to the
next<00:05:25.660> step<00:05:26.160> all<00:05:27.160> right<00:05:27.310> so<00:05:27.520> we<00:05:27.730> got<00:05:27.850> our<00:05:27.970> piece

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
next step all right so we got our piece

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.230 
next step all right so we got our piece
of<00:05:28.150> maple<00:05:28.420> glued<00:05:28.810> on<00:05:28.990> top<00:05:29.290> and<00:05:30.150> kind<00:05:31.150> of

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
of maple glued on top and kind of

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.780 
of maple glued on top and kind of
trimmed<00:05:31.510> off<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.750> edges<00:05:32.050> roughly<00:05:32.710> make<00:05:33.640> it

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
trimmed off the edges roughly make it

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.240 
trimmed off the edges roughly make it
easier<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.150> work<00:05:34.330> with<00:05:34.620> okay<00:05:35.620> now<00:05:35.950> we're<00:05:36.130> going

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
easier to work with okay now we're going

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.680 
easier to work with okay now we're going
to<00:05:36.310> want<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.580> get<00:05:36.730> rid<00:05:36.790> of<00:05:36.940> this<00:05:37.120> piece<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.570> wood

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
to want to get rid of this piece of wood

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:46.320 
to want to get rid of this piece of wood
on<00:05:37.810> bottom

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.760

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
all right so we've knocked out a bunch

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.480 
all right so we've knocked out a bunch
of<00:05:52.320> lines<00:05:52.530> and<00:05:52.920> now<00:05:53.010> we're<00:05:53.130> going<00:05:53.250> to<00:05:53.310> start

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
of lines and now we're going to start

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.890 
of lines and now we're going to start
busting<00:05:53.880> off<00:05:54.000> all<00:05:54.180> these<00:05:54.360> little<00:05:54.600> bits<00:05:54.810> of

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
busting off all these little bits of

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.020 
busting off all these little bits of
wood<00:05:55.110> all<00:05:55.650> right<00:05:55.860> so<00:05:56.130> you<00:05:56.190> can<00:05:56.370> see<00:05:56.520> we<00:05:56.760> got<00:05:56.910> her

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
wood all right so you can see we got her

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.110 
wood all right so you can see we got her
pretty<00:05:57.540> much<00:05:57.720> knocked<00:05:58.140> down<00:05:58.410> I<00:05:58.860> just<00:05:59.850> hit<00:06:00.000> the

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
pretty much knocked down I just hit the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.610 
pretty much knocked down I just hit the
little<00:06:00.360> pieces<00:06:00.510> with<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:00.780> hammer<00:06:01.050> I'm<00:06:01.290> taking<00:06:01.560> a

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
little pieces with a hammer I'm taking a

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.140 
little pieces with a hammer I'm taking a
couple<00:06:01.830> more<00:06:02.070> little<00:06:02.250> bits<00:06:02.520> off<00:06:02.700> of<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:02.970> saw

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
couple more little bits off of the saw

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.330 
couple more little bits off of the saw
then<00:06:03.420> we'll<00:06:03.570> run<00:06:04.440> it<00:06:04.560> through<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:04.800> planer<00:06:04.980> and

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
then we'll run it through the planer and

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.060 
then we'll run it through the planer and
I'll<00:06:05.940> show<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:06.270> what<00:06:06.540> we<00:06:06.630> got<00:06:06.830> all<00:06:07.830> right

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
I'll show you what we got all right

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.420 
I'll show you what we got all right
there<00:06:08.940> you<00:06:09.090> have<00:06:09.270> it<00:06:09.560> finished<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.740> off<00:06:10.920> this

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
there you have it finished it off this

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.790 
there you have it finished it off this
is<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.910> maple<00:06:12.090> side<00:06:12.480> that<00:06:12.840> I<00:06:12.930> planed<00:06:13.290> down<00:06:13.530> to

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
is the maple side that I planed down to

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.000 
is the maple side that I planed down to
and<00:06:14.330> this<00:06:15.330> is<00:06:15.390> the<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:16.260> original<00:06:16.530> piece<00:06:16.980> of

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
and this is the the original piece of

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.440 
and this is the the original piece of
wood<00:06:17.250> that<00:06:17.400> we<00:06:17.490> started<00:06:17.820> with<00:06:18.000> on<00:06:18.210> the<00:06:18.330> other

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
wood that we started with on the other

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.550 
wood that we started with on the other
side<00:06:18.890> it<00:06:19.890> looks<00:06:20.160> like<00:06:21.020> almost<00:06:22.020> something<00:06:22.320> you

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
side it looks like almost something you

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.560 
side it looks like almost something you
would<00:06:22.680> buy<00:06:22.830> from<00:06:23.040> the<00:06:23.160> store<00:06:23.430> but<00:06:24.150> trust<00:06:24.480> me

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
would buy from the store but trust me

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.130 
would buy from the store but trust me
it's<00:06:25.440> much<00:06:25.740> stronger
