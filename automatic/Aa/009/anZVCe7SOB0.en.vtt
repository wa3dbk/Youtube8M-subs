00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:02.880
陈绮贞 - Distance 

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.090
 The word Chen Yuqu Chen Yu 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.251
 Further retreat 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.571
 Retreat in your shadow coverage 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.731
 What are you looking at absolutely? 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.901
 There is absolutely no chance of allowing mistakes. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.311
 Take a step back 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.731
 Chase the chance of being violated by you 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.881
 The more space I leave, the more absolute 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.861
 The more you see the meaning you want to hug 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.151
 And I am guessing what you will do... 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.311
 When you lose your willpower is weak 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.801
 Unless I am telling you in your ear 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.951
 Make up for a person's void 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.291
 We are now in love for a long distance... 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.541
 Should I relax my expectations? 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.681
 Unless it is me 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.311
 Familiar with your body's pulse 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.651
 Need the deepest comfort 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.921
 Let me put it in your softest heart 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.941
 Only I can make your good or bad 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:36.101
 Have 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.171
 We are now in love with zero distance... 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.411
 Should I confess my concern? 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.691
 If I am telling you in your ear 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.981
 Can you make up for the void of two people? 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.271
 And I am guessing what you will do. 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.591
 When you can't satisfy your desires 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.591
 Unless it is me 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.371
 Familiar with your body's pulse 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.721
 Need the deepest comfort 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.951
 Let me put it in your softest heart 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.951
 Only I can take our distance 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.121
 Possession 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.201
 Take a step back 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.471
 Chase the chance of being violated by you 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.521
 The space you leave unless it is me 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:56.271
 To take possession of our distance
