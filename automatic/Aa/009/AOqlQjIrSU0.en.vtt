00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
these a series of mighty strikes which
could<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.629> done<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.770> three<00:00:47.010> different

could be done in the three different
directions<00:00:47.719> as<00:00:48.719> well<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.489> his<00:00:50.700> real

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
directions as well as this is his real

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
directions as well as this is his real
moneymaker<00:00:51.949> especially<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.070> short<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.520> in

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
moneymaker especially this short one in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.630 
moneymaker especially this short one in
the<00:00:53.699> corner<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:56.160> course<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> mighty

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the corner and of course the mighty

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.310 
the corner and of course the mighty
spark<00:00:57.030> which<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.360> sort<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> standard

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
spark which is sort of a standard

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.349 
spark which is sort of a standard
fireball<00:00:58.739> which<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.160> done<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> air<00:00:59.640> or

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
fireball which can be done in the air or

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.280 
fireball which can be done in the air or
on<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.260> ground<00:01:02.480> he's<00:01:03.480> also<00:01:03.629> got<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> command

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
on the ground he's also got the command

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.980 
on the ground he's also got the command
grab<00:01:04.909> which<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.180> done<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> air<00:01:06.720> as

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
grab which can be done in the air as

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.060 
grab which can be done in the air as
well<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> when<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.680> air<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
well and when it's in the air it's a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.580 
well and when it's in the air it's a
little<00:01:08.220> more<00:01:08.310> interesting<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.880> jump<00:01:09.090> up

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
little more interesting so if we jump up

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.050 
little more interesting so if we jump up
it'll<00:01:10.590> miss<00:01:10.890> them<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.430> might<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.700> too<00:01:14.880> far

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it'll miss them and I might be too far

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.490 
it'll miss them and I might be too far
away<00:01:15.180> yeah<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.780> too<00:01:15.900> slow<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.380> can

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
away yeah it's too slow but you can

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.870 
away yeah it's too slow but you can
actually<00:01:16.619> combo<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.700> done

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
actually combo off of that when done

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.950 
actually combo off of that when done
from<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.090> air<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.420> certain<00:01:18.689> circumstances

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
from the air in certain circumstances

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.859 
from the air in certain circumstances
which<00:01:19.860> makes<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.189> nice<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.610> interesting

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
which makes that nice and interesting

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.490 
which makes that nice and interesting
but<00:01:21.869> those<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.259> basic<00:01:22.619> options<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:24.500> let's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
but those are is basic options and let's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.730 
but those are is basic options and let's
see<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:26.299> build<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:27.600> more

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.890 

we'll<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.760> level<00:01:32.909> three

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.600 

this<00:01:39.900> mighty<00:01:40.140> thunders<00:01:40.590> quite<00:01:41.070> quite<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> good

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
this mighty thunders quite quite a good

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.850 
this mighty thunders quite quite a good
super<00:01:42.000> level<00:01:42.900> three<00:01:43.080> not<00:01:43.259> implemented<00:01:43.740> in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
super level three not implemented in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.859 
super level three not implemented in
this<00:01:43.979> build<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.549> we'll<00:01:45.270> show<00:01:45.420> also<00:01:45.600> his

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this build so we'll show also his

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
this build so we'll show also his
regular<00:01:46.530> grabs<00:01:46.850> super<00:01:47.850> grab<00:01:49.610> that's<00:01:50.610> quite

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
regular grabs super grab that's quite

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.870 
regular grabs super grab that's quite
nice<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.840> course<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.700> very

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
nice and of course this is very

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.490 
nice and of course this is very
versatile<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> done<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> air

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
versatile as well can be done in the air

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
versatile as well can be done in the air
really<00:01:56.399> messes<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> opponent<00:01:57.210> gives<00:01:57.330> them

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
really messes up the opponent gives them

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.719 
really messes up the opponent gives them
a<00:01:57.509> lot<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.780> good<00:01:57.810> combo<00:01:58.229> options<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.580> can

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
a lot of good combo options but you can

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.480 
a lot of good combo options but you can
think<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.000> Thor<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> bit<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.600> Colossus<00:02:01.490> but

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
think of Thor a bit like Colossus but

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.850 
think of Thor a bit like Colossus but
really<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.000> all<00:02:03.210> about<00:02:03.530> staying<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.619> here

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
really it's all about staying in here

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.200 
really it's all about staying in here
he's<00:02:05.130> got<00:02:05.280> some<00:02:05.429> interesting<00:02:05.610> normal<00:02:06.090> move

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210

properties<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.929> like<00:02:07.229> particularly<00:02:07.800> his

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
properties to I like particularly his

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.820 
properties to I like particularly his
jumping<00:02:08.310> heart<00:02:08.519> attack<00:02:08.789> which<00:02:09.660> jumps<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
jumping heart attack which jumps out and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.770 
jumping heart attack which jumps out and
stays<00:02:11.070> out<00:02:11.280> sort<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:11.850> Zangief<00:02:12.390> splash

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
stays out sort of like a Zangief splash

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.809 
stays out sort of like a Zangief splash
almost<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.440> most<00:02:13.950> moves<00:02:14.160> jump<00:02:14.459> in<00:02:14.580> they<00:02:14.670> go

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
almost so most moves jump in they go

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.570 
almost so most moves jump in they go
away<00:02:15.620> fierce<00:02:16.620> will<00:02:16.830> stay<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> whole<00:02:17.280> way

away fierce will stay out the whole way

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.280 
away fierce will stay out the whole way
