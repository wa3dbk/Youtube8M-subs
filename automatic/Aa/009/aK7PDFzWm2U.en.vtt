it's<00:02:09.429> going<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.670> prevent<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.330> brave<00:02:11.050> from

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
it's going to prevent that brave from

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.060 
it's going to prevent that brave from
spinning<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.250> spool<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.650> now<00:02:14.740> I'm<00:02:14.950> going

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
spinning on the spool so now I'm going

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.250 
spinning on the spool so now I'm going
to<00:02:15.160> do<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.820> go<00:02:15.970> ahead<00:02:16.200> hold<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.440> line

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
to do is just go ahead hold this line

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.800 
to do is just go ahead hold this line
and<00:02:20.260> start<00:02:20.560> reeling<00:02:20.740> on<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.100> spool<00:02:21.690> now<00:02:22.690> this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
and start reeling on the spool now this

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.450 
and start reeling on the spool now this
is<00:02:22.930> going<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> go<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.350> nice<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.800> tight<00:02:23.980> it's

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
is going to go on nice and tight it's

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.630 
is going to go on nice and tight it's
packed<00:02:24.790> wet<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.959> it's<00:02:26.200> going<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.410> lay<00:02:26.560> well<00:02:26.830> and

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
packed wet so it's going to lay well and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880 
packed wet so it's going to lay well and
the<00:02:28.390> nice<00:02:28.540> thing<00:02:28.780> about<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.170> line<00:02:29.410> being<00:02:29.740> in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the nice thing about that line being in

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.680 
the nice thing about that line being in
that<00:02:29.980> bucket<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.459> doesn't<00:02:30.790> overrun<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.330> lot<00:02:31.570> of

somebody holding on to it you get over
runs<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.480> water<00:02:37.810> keeps<00:02:38.110> enough<00:02:38.350> tension<00:02:38.620> on

runs that water keeps enough tension on

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.090 
runs that water keeps enough tension on
it<00:02:39.150> prevents<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.209> from<00:02:40.330> over<00:02:40.630> running<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
it prevents it from over running it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.500 
it prevents it from over running it
actually<00:02:42.459> gives<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.730> enough<00:02:42.940> tension<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.450> I

actually gives it enough tension that I

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.910 
actually gives it enough tension that I
don't<00:02:43.690> even<00:02:43.750> need<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.959> hold<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.440> line<00:02:44.650> if<00:02:44.830> I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
don't even need to hold that line if I

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.090 
don't even need to hold that line if I

a little indicator where you know that
you're<00:02:49.720> full<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.800> you're<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.070> going<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.310> fill
