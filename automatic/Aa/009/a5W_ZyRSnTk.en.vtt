00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.650
 it's not the same flesh and the same chains it's the latest game 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.780
 starring as you probably have lives the very famous 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.060
 love poem these kits do so the game of his predecessors is that we 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.240
 can now controlled catecar nations to make a ball a sailor 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.700
 is that here too the future playability textiles so we could 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.920
 find particularly in the last games of the series the story of the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.690
 game is quite expensive this not the same must go in search of several 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.250
 pieces of a very powerful artifact that have been scattered across 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.710
 four dimensions completely third 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.160
 by each dimension a controversy not the same to take a small step that of 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.810
 unique abilities to buy the smallest one that friends do not leave 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.960
 the same are also looking for the precious piece which will complicate 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 obviously the task is severe 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.380
 what will make it depends on a spa itself loaded with the same chances 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.420
 it's definitely the visual side that's very good here the levels of 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.660
 details in cinematics is really impressive 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.170
 the styles of the cafes crescent a lot to what one could have in the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.519
 navy comics it's a visual style that stick really well 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.180
 the universe of this palace 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.310
 it gets a little more complicated in terms of the gameplay it's not always 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.530
 obvious to orient himself after his bullets to his stars to win another in 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.820
 the game's environments the movements of the camera that follows the superheroes 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.980
 are not very neat would have gone one wonders sometimes where one is 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.120
 rendered when we win on the walls the camera is usually at the wrong 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.940
 place and it can become very problematic at times 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.070
 the gameplay challenge more and more textiles throughout your adventure 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.930
 we must constantly find a new piece of artifact for each of these 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.479
 last 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.840
 francs must face an eternal enigma of spanair the structure of 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.649
 levels is usually the hand and we end up so this will do the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:38.170
 same things 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.310
 the fights against the kids bosses in several stages and at times simple 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.430
 real ones 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.560
 they will start but we always have the same way and the element of 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.440
 surprise is virtually nonexistent 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.180
 the freedom of exploration that could be found in some games of the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.170
 series is no longer present in this panel a cat with blessing 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.820
 we can not roam freely in the game's environments because we 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.530
 is constantly at the Parisian attack 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.560
 the missions were born after midnight nothing and it often comes down to saving 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.200
 civilians 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 it's a country of arms found at our pieces of the article 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.590
 Throughout our adventure we can unlock new t to avoid to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.180
 using points that are attracted as you progress through the game 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.380
 his abilities can give us for example new attacks that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.529
 will come to diversify the kittel fights of fairly repetitive year 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.999
 it's a shame given that the action of the rests largely only on the 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:21.629
 cons 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.930
 Diabetes judges take much less seriously than before that would have 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.290
 could be a good thing but the humor that makes that many replicas 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.599
 of spa the same and sometimes dubious we are entitled to a Berlin festival which 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.579
 often fall flat in a year at times are born in the skin 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.579
 superhero or rather numonyx 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.219
 seck 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.259
 when 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.259
 the story 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.260
 it's not the same charm of the matches is definitely by the fact that the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.859
 women of my generation 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.040
 the problematic camera movements the gameplay hate 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.189
 it materializes this reader of the commune 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.010
 artistically snow is pretty successful but anything that touches the side 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.319
 technique they allowed the gaming experience
