00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.170
 a relaxed greeting here from ours 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.230
 measure news on my side of andrÃ© 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.439
 greet you and get very firm in his 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.009
 hand a duesenberg what is that for a 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.520
 model 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.110
 what you imagine us because this is our 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.570
 59 model this year on the name 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.260
 in principle, a merger is presented 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 from our old models of the 49 152 he 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.780
 that in principle it must be the construction 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.730
 with big sound chambers makes the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.920
 guitar very light we have in 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.690
 Comparison to other duesenberg models 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.790
 exceptionally two in this model 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.219
 Hamburger on the neck so what for this 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.120
 mountain and typical but is the clouds as 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.930
 make classical 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.510
 we have a tape we have the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.080
 three with inlays we on the cd 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.490
 deluxe presented and we have 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.070
 something special in the circuit 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.930
 Middle position we make this mountain 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.440
 typically a bit different than than 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.300
 other 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.280
 what's up with what's there 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.280
 the core features in the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.660
 middle position is the 100 as a taker 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.209
 completely left in the signal 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.069
 The pantograph is split 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.679
 but about a capacitor what to 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.840
 consequence has that only certain frequencies 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.130
 stay in the signal from the bridge pickups 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.959
 what the sound 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.819
 in our opinion makes more usable 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.800
 where do you see the the so 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.390
 employment weather guitarist 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.420
 is addressed with the model 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.429
 that 's definitely what we like to say 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.539
 pretty much asrock board so there comes too 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.250
 not something out and generally but very 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.840
 versatile so we all duesenberg 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.880
 Instruments can do so much 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.970
 be made from small to harry 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.739
 you like to clean everything you have us for 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.830
 entry already proved 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:02.259
 I'll give you one more here 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.569
 element and you give us that again 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.679
 rock sound and I say 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.780
 Again we see the news here 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.780
 stay tuned for the Musikmesse 2014
