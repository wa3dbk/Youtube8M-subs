00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
may be wrong it's just kind of a

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.789 
may be wrong it's just kind of a
combination<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.880> both<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.299> those<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:32.229> that's

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
combination of both of those so that's

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.450

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.770 

I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:29.890 

Oh

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.140 

so<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.880> far<00:02:32.880> left<00:02:33.180> position<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
so that's the far left position the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.500 
so that's the far left position the
tones<00:02:37.140> although<00:02:37.590> all<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.130> way<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> right

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
tones although all the way to the right

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.020 
tones although all the way to the right
so<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.080> fat<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:41.069> fuzz<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.489> at<00:02:41.610> about<00:02:41.790> three

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
so it's fat the fuzz is at about three

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.290 
so it's fat the fuzz is at about three
o'clock<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.560> volume<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:44.220> right<00:02:45.150> about

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
