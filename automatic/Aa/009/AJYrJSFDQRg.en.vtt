00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
one the LEGO City truck so I guess

they're<00:00:45.030> twins

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
they're twins

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.330 
they're twins
and<00:00:46.170> he<00:00:46.320> looks<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.830> your<00:00:47.070> average<00:00:47.250> guy

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340

next we have the Toys R Us cashier and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
next we have the Toys R Us cashier and
I'm<00:00:52.470> gonna<00:00:52.650> guess<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.920> she's<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.580> new

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
I'm gonna guess that she's kind of new

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.280 
I'm gonna guess that she's kind of new
to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> store<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.570> she<00:00:54.840> doesn't<00:00:55.020> come

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
to the store because she doesn't come

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.230 
to the store because she doesn't come
with<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> uniform<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> Toys<00:00:56.790> R<00:00:56.880> Us<00:00:56.970> vest

with the uniform or the Toys R Us vest

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.000 
with the uniform or the Toys R Us vest
and<00:00:57.450> they<00:00:58.320> should<00:00:58.470> have<00:00:58.560> made<00:00:58.650> it<00:00:58.800> toys

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and they should have made it toys

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.620 
and they should have made it toys
minifig<00:00:59.610> this<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.060> it<00:01:00.300> would<00:01:00.420> add<00:01:00.600> more

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
a view of the back and it looks kind of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.360 
a view of the back and it looks kind of
naked<00:02:10.289> back<00:02:10.560> here<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.099> could<00:02:11.220> definitely

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
naked back here it could definitely

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.010 
naked back here it could definitely
benefit<00:02:11.849> with<00:02:12.030> some<00:02:12.240> wet<00:02:12.420> guards<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.900> some

benefit with some wet guards and some
flaps<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.590> back<00:02:14.160> here<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.610> sticker

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
since plate here's the view of the other

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.100 
since plate here's the view of the other
side<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.040> here's<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.850> bottom<00:02:19.090> now<00:02:19.690> these<00:02:19.870> two

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
side and here's the bottom now these two

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.809 
side and here's the bottom now these two
parts<00:02:20.440> right<00:02:20.500> here<00:02:20.620> are<00:02:21.010> built<00:02:21.250> exactly<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
parts right here are built exactly the

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.250 
parts right here are built exactly the
same<00:02:22.000> way<00:02:22.180> which<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.660> why<00:02:22.810> they<00:02:22.959> look<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.200> little

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
same way which is why they look a little

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.470 
same way which is why they look a little
bit<00:02:23.470> uneven<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:24.459> from<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.850> side<00:02:25.030> view<00:02:25.060> you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
bit uneven but from the side view you

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.449 
bit uneven but from the side view you
don't<00:02:25.600> really<00:02:25.990> notice<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.350> difference<00:02:26.459> and

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
don't really notice the difference and

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.770 
don't really notice the difference and
here's<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.819> view<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.090> front<00:02:28.270> where<00:02:28.660> we

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
here's the view of the front where we

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.720 
here's the view of the front where we
have<00:02:28.870> no<00:02:28.959> sticker<00:02:29.290> end<00:02:29.800> up<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:30.490> with<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
have no sticker end up there with the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.000 
have no sticker end up there with the
toys-r-us<00:02:31.060> logo<00:02:31.420> now<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.590> part<00:02:32.890> up

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
toys-r-us logo now I like the part up

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.830 
toys-r-us logo now I like the part up
here<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.489> can<00:02:33.640> open<00:02:33.819> up<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.300> think<00:02:34.690> that's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
here that you can open up I think that's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.390 
here that you can open up I think that's
a<00:02:34.870> really<00:02:34.989> cool<00:02:35.200> feature<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:36.069> when<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.280> try

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
a really cool feature but when you try

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.740 
a really cool feature but when you try
to<00:02:36.459> close<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.700> though<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.209> just<00:02:37.239> comes<00:02:37.569> right

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
to close it though it just comes right

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.330 
to close it though it just comes right
off<00:02:37.780> because<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.590> hinge<00:02:38.830> piece<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.190> actually

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
off because this hinge piece is actually

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.240 
off because this hinge piece is actually
really<00:02:39.970> tight<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.860> I'm<00:02:41.860> not<00:02:41.980> gonna<00:02:42.069> make<00:02:42.220> a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
really tight and I'm not gonna make a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.770 
really tight and I'm not gonna make a
big<00:02:42.340> deal<00:02:42.580> out<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.880> because<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.360> do<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
big deal out of it because we do have a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.090 
big deal out of it because we do have a
lot<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:43.959> other<00:02:44.140> vehicles<00:02:44.500> where<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.950> do<00:02:45.069> have

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
lot of other vehicles where you do have

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.680 
lot of other vehicles where you do have
to<00:02:45.280> rip<00:02:45.550> off<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.819> roof<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.209> again<00:02:46.420> inside

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
to rip off the roof just again inside

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.420 
to rip off the roof just again inside
but<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.320> would<00:02:47.440> be<00:02:47.560> nice<00:02:47.709> if<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.980> hinge<00:02:48.220> piece

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
but it would be nice if the hinge piece

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.430 
but it would be nice if the hinge piece
was<00:02:48.640> working<00:02:48.970> as<00:02:49.060> intended<00:02:49.330> but<00:02:50.170> anyway

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
was working as intended but anyway

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.320 
was working as intended but anyway
looking<00:02:50.739> inside<00:02:51.070> we<00:02:51.430> have<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.550> nice<00:02:51.820> little<00:02:52.030> bed

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
looking inside we have a nice little bed

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.540 
looking inside we have a nice little bed
right<00:02:52.780> next<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.170> driver's<00:02:53.500> seat<00:02:53.650> it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
right next to the driver's seat it

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.130 
right next to the driver's seat it
sounds<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> good<00:02:55.120> idea<00:02:55.150> at<00:02:55.450> first<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:55.900> if

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
sounds like a good idea at first but if

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.110 
sounds like a good idea at first but if
you've<00:02:56.260> ever<00:02:56.380> driven<00:02:56.650> long<00:02:56.950> hours<00:02:57.340> late<00:02:58.000> at

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
night I'll tell you having a bed next to

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.380 
night I'll tell you having a bed next to
you<00:02:59.830> does<00:03:00.010> not<00:03:00.069> help<00:03:00.400> because<00:03:00.940> all<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.269> can

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
you does not help because all I can

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.500 
you does not help because all I can
think<00:03:01.450> about<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:01.870> soft<00:03:02.319> pillow<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:03.510> that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
think about is that soft pillow and that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.940 
think about is that soft pillow and that
cup<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.840> coffee<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.319> getting<00:03:05.530> colder<00:03:05.830> and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
cup of coffee is just getting colder and

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.130 
cup of coffee is just getting colder and
colder<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.330> just<00:03:07.420> want<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.630> sleep<00:03:07.840> but

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
colder and you just want to sleep but

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.380 
colder and you just want to sleep but
anyway<00:03:08.380> moving<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.250> next<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:09.910> bed<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.239> have

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
anyway moving on next to the bed we have

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.809 
anyway moving on next to the bed we have
a<00:03:10.630> TV<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:12.040> doesn't<00:03:12.250> come<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.459> remote<00:03:12.700> but

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
a TV and it doesn't come the remote but

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.130 
a TV and it doesn't come the remote but
I<00:03:12.880> guess<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:13.209> okay<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.510> think<00:03:13.660> could<00:03:13.870> reach<00:03:14.019> it

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
I guess it's okay I think could reach it

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.930 
I guess it's okay I think could reach it
from<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.350> bed<00:03:14.500> there<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.040> then<00:03:15.160> again<00:03:15.459> don't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
from the bed there but then again don't

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.280 
from the bed there but then again don't
think<00:03:16.120> why<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.269> screen<00:03:16.600> I<00:03:16.810> don't<00:03:17.050> think<00:03:17.170> it's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
think why the screen I don't think it's

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.440 
think why the screen I don't think it's
working<00:03:17.440> right<00:03:17.769> anyway<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.209> good<00:03:19.209> luck<00:03:19.329> with

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
working right anyway so good luck with

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.000 
working right anyway so good luck with
that<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:20.410> otherwise<00:03:20.620> it's<00:03:20.950> pretty

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
that but otherwise it's pretty

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.650 
that but otherwise it's pretty
comfortable<00:03:21.459> inside<00:03:21.760> for<00:03:22.269> all<00:03:22.360> your<00:03:22.600> other

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
comfortable inside for all your other

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.300 
comfortable inside for all your other
needs<00:03:22.900> just<00:03:23.230> stop<00:03:23.410> by<00:03:23.590> your<00:03:23.739> local<00:03:23.799> service

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
needs just stop by your local service

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.580 
needs just stop by your local service
area<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.180> should<00:03:25.329> do<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.510> pretty<00:03:26.380> nice

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
area and I should do it pretty nice

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.300 
area and I should do it pretty nice
truck<00:03:26.739> right<00:03:28.709> next<00:03:29.709> we'll<00:03:29.829> take<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.980> closer

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
truck right next we'll take a closer

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.100 
truck right next we'll take a closer
look<00:03:30.400> at<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.700> trailer<00:03:31.030> now<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.750> just<00:03:31.930> want<00:03:32.049> to

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
look at the trailer now I just want to

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.330 
look at the trailer now I just want to
point<00:03:32.290> out<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.470> when<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.650> have<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.799> prompt<00:03:33.190> up

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
point out that when you have a prompt up

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.800 
point out that when you have a prompt up
it<00:03:33.579> doesn't<00:03:33.820> really<00:03:33.940> sit<00:03:34.209> level<00:03:34.420> with<00:03:34.690> the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
it doesn't really sit level with the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.780 
it doesn't really sit level with the
ground<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.410> here's<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.160> view<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.489> bottom

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
ground and here's the view of the bottom

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.400 
ground and here's the view of the bottom
and<00:03:37.030> as<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.660> can<00:03:37.750> see<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.989> wheels<00:03:38.170> are

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
and as you can see the wheels are

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.140 
and as you can see the wheels are
loosely<00:03:38.799> suspended<00:03:39.340> over<00:03:39.519> there<00:03:39.670> which<00:03:39.970> is

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
loosely suspended over there which is

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.370 
loosely suspended over there which is
nice<00:03:40.299> because<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.660> makes<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:40.989> easier<00:03:41.260> to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
nice because it makes it easier to

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.920 
nice because it makes it easier to
travel<00:03:41.650> on<00:03:41.890> small<00:03:42.250> slopes<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.910> here's<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
travel on small slopes and here's the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.720 
travel on small slopes and here's the
view<00:03:44.079> of<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.470> back<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:45.040> notice<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.370> we<00:03:45.519> have

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
view of the back you notice that we have

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.670 
view of the back you notice that we have
two<00:03:46.120> big<00:03:46.390> our<00:03:46.630> stickers<00:03:47.019> on<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.260> sides<00:03:47.440> there

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
two big our stickers on the sides there

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.530 
two big our stickers on the sides there
and<00:03:48.190> when<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.549> put<00:03:48.700> them<00:03:48.820> there<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.209> might

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
and when you put them there you might

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.479 
and when you put them there you might
want<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.750> put<00:03:49.930> them<00:03:50.109> just<00:03:50.709> above<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.250> little

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
want to put them just above that little

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.009 
want to put them just above that little
circle<00:03:51.880> right<00:03:52.090> there<00:03:52.299> on<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.600> panel<00:03:52.870> there

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
circle right there on the panel there

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.660 
circle right there on the panel there
because<00:03:53.739> if<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.980> put<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.160> sticker<00:03:54.370> over<00:03:54.459> it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
because if you put the sticker over it

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.710 
because if you put the sticker over it
you<00:03:54.820> could<00:03:55.030> end<00:03:55.180> up<00:03:55.239> with<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.510> little

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
you could end up with a little

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.509 
you could end up with a little
indentation<00:03:56.049> on<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.590> sticker<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.070> you<00:03:57.190> don't

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
indentation on the sticker and you don't

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.340 
indentation on the sticker and you don't
really<00:03:57.640> want<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:57.989> down<00:03:58.989> here<00:03:59.109> we<00:03:59.230> have<00:03:59.320> a

Toys R Us store which looks great

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.470 
Toys R Us store which looks great
although<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.040> do<00:04:27.130> think<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:27.880> really<00:04:27.910> small

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
although I do think it's a really small

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.420 
although I do think it's a really small
store<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.140> do<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.890> how<00:04:30.040> we<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.280> these

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
stickers on the front there it kind of

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.270 
stickers on the front there it kind of
reminds<00:04:32.110> me<00:04:32.170> of<00:04:32.260> those<00:04:32.380> Toys<00:04:32.680> R<00:04:32.800> Us<00:04:32.920> Express

the<00:04:55.780> cashier<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.500> next<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.190> we<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:57.400> a

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
the cashier and next to that we have a

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.310 
the cashier and next to that we have a
little<00:04:57.820> bin<00:04:58.030> I'm<00:04:58.690> guessing<00:04:59.020> that's<00:04:59.110> where

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
little bin I'm guessing that's where

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.750 
little bin I'm guessing that's where
they<00:04:59.380> usually<00:04:59.500> hold<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.190> batteries<00:05:00.550> because

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
they usually hold the batteries because

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.830 
they usually hold the batteries because
every<00:05:00.940> time<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:01.180> try<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.330> purchase<00:05:01.540> something

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
every time you try to purchase something

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.990 
every time you try to purchase something
that<00:05:01.960> was<00:05:02.170> asking<00:05:02.500> for<00:05:02.560> my<00:05:02.680> batteries<00:05:03.100> and

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
that was asking for my batteries and

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.520 
that was asking for my batteries and
behind<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.390> counter<00:05:04.600> we<00:05:04.720> have<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.080> lego<00:05:05.260> sets

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
behind the counter we have the lego sets

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.560 
behind the counter we have the lego sets
it<00:05:05.860> looks<00:05:06.010> like<00:05:06.160> they<00:05:06.280> have<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:07.060> off-road

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
it looks like they have the off-road

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.090 
it looks like they have the off-road
fire<00:05:07.810> rescue<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.590> city<00:05:08.830> police

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
fire rescue and the city police

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.520 
fire rescue and the city police
motorcycle<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:10.060> that's<00:05:11.020> about<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.260> now<00:05:11.470> the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
motorcycle and that's about it now the

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.440 
motorcycle and that's about it now the
only<00:05:11.860> bad<00:05:12.100> thing<00:05:12.280> about<00:05:12.310> this<00:05:12.670> store<00:05:12.940> is<00:05:13.420> that

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
only bad thing about this store is that

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.730 
only bad thing about this store is that
there<00:05:13.840> doesn't<00:05:14.110> seem<00:05:14.140> to<00:05:14.290> be<00:05:14.380> a<00:05:14.470> whole<00:05:14.560> lot<00:05:14.590> of

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.020 
there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of
space<00:05:14.920> behind<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.310> cash<00:05:15.520> register

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
space behind the cash register

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.570 
space behind the cash register
in<00:05:16.750> fact<00:05:16.960> she<00:05:17.470> could<00:05:17.530> only<00:05:17.650> fit<00:05:17.980> in<00:05:18.190> on<00:05:18.430> those

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
in fact she could only fit in on those

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.430 
in fact she could only fit in on those
two<00:05:18.640> studs<00:05:19.060> right<00:05:19.120> there<00:05:19.330> because<00:05:19.690> that<00:05:20.230> Lego

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
two studs right there because that Lego

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.130 
two studs right there because that Lego
box<00:05:20.650> kind<00:05:20.950> of<00:05:21.040> gets<00:05:21.190> in<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.310> way<00:05:21.460> there<00:05:21.640> and

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
box kind of gets in the way there and

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.950 
box kind of gets in the way there and
there<00:05:23.140> we<00:05:23.230> go<00:05:23.380> and<00:05:23.770> we<00:05:24.430> do<00:05:24.550> have<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:25.210> hand<00:05:25.780> truck

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
there we go and we do have a hand truck

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.870 
there we go and we do have a hand truck
that<00:05:26.170> comes<00:05:26.320> with<00:05:26.440> it<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:27.220> teddy<00:05:27.430> bear<00:05:27.520> that

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
that comes with it and a teddy bear that

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.070 
that comes with it and a teddy bear that
doesn't<00:05:28.330> even<00:05:28.450> look<00:05:28.570> like<00:05:28.630> a<00:05:28.780> Lego<00:05:29.050> piece

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
doesn't even look like a Lego piece

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.690 
doesn't even look like a Lego piece
because<00:05:29.530> it<00:05:29.680> doesn't<00:05:29.920> attach<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.310> any<00:05:30.430> studs

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
because it doesn't attach to any studs

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.210 
because it doesn't attach to any studs
but<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:31.630> does<00:05:31.750> say<00:05:31.990> where<00:05:32.290> Lego<00:05:32.500> on<00:05:32.710> is<00:05:32.830> but<00:05:33.010> and

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
but it does say where Lego on is but and

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.220 
but it does say where Lego on is but and
that<00:05:33.430> makes<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.730> official<00:05:33.820> and<00:05:34.540> now<00:05:35.020> we'll

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
that makes it official and now we'll

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.820 
that makes it official and now we'll
just<00:05:35.260> move<00:05:35.500> on<00:05:35.620> to<00:05:35.740> their<00:05:35.890> recommendations

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
just move on to their recommendations

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.990 
just move on to their recommendations
overall<00:05:38.830> I'd<00:05:39.010> say<00:05:39.040> this<00:05:39.400> is<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.580> pretty<00:05:39.850> good

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
overall I'd say this is a pretty good

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.640 
overall I'd say this is a pretty good
set<00:05:40.270> although<00:05:40.630> when<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:40.990> comes<00:05:41.200> to<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.380> value

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
set although when it comes to the value

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.560 
set although when it comes to the value
it's<00:05:41.800> not<00:05:41.890> so<00:05:42.160> good<00:05:42.400> we<00:05:43.000> have<00:05:43.090> a<00:05:43.150> price<00:05:43.360> for

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
it's not so good we have a price for

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.570 
it's not so good we have a price for
peace<00:05:43.690> ratio<00:05:44.080> of<00:05:44.260> 14<00:05:44.650> cents<00:05:44.920> per<00:05:45.100> piece<00:05:45.280> and

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
peace ratio of 14 cents per piece and

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.180

truck is the same as the one in Lego
step<00:06:30.640> three<00:06:30.850> two<00:06:31.000> -<00:06:31.180> one<00:06:31.390> which<00:06:31.750> is<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:31.930> Lego

step three two - one which is a Lego
City<00:06:32.530> truck<00:06:32.830> the<00:06:33.520> only<00:06:33.669> difference<00:06:33.970> is<00:06:34.090> that

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
City truck the only difference is that

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.740 
City truck the only difference is that
it<00:06:34.390> has<00:06:34.480> the

so<00:06:36.910> if<00:06:37.060> you<00:06:37.150> have<00:06:37.240> that<00:06:37.390> one<00:06:37.450> you<00:06:37.600> might<00:06:37.780> be<00:06:37.840> a

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
so if you have that one you might be a

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.150 
so if you have that one you might be a
little<00:06:38.110> bit<00:06:38.290> discouraged<00:06:38.590> to<00:06:38.740> get<00:06:38.890> this<00:06:39.010> one

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
little bit discouraged to get this one

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.350 
little bit discouraged to get this one

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
because they're pretty much the same

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.300 
because they're pretty much the same
model<00:06:40.690> truck<00:06:40.900> but<00:06:41.620> in<00:06:41.710> the<00:06:41.830> end<00:06:42.010> if<00:06:42.130> you<00:06:42.190> can

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
model truck but in the end if you can
