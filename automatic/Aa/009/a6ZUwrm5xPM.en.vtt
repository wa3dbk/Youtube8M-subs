off<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.910> rumble<00:02:16.240> motors<00:02:16.540> right<00:02:16.750> now<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.110> it's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
off the rumble motors right now and it's

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.920 
off the rumble motors right now and it's
not<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:18.240> really<00:02:19.240> have<00:02:19.360> been<00:02:19.390> able<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.720> figure

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
not I really have been able to figure

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.540 
not I really have been able to figure
out<00:02:20.200> why<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:22.150> not<00:02:22.720> always<00:02:23.550> reliable

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
out why it is not always reliable

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.110 
out why it is not always reliable
especially<00:02:25.330> when<00:02:25.420> I'm<00:02:25.540> using<00:02:25.750> an<00:02:25.960> official

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120

it<00:02:53.140> actually<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.740> reading<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.790> pressure<00:02:55.060> and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
it actually is reading the pressure and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.880 
it actually is reading the pressure and
