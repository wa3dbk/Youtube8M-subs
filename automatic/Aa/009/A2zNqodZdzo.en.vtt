00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.600
 to see children shape up please god to see 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.630
 to see by mind 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:23.130
 let's understand what the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.880
 numbers and how can we use them who I 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.270
 it says from when the numbers are used I 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.270
 I also let me choose 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.090
 anselmo is used since prehistory 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.090
 teacher 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.510
 the man had the need to tell 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.610
 your belongings and thus be able to protect them 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.019
 not mine I also needed to count for 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.019
 know the cycles of nature 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.920
 at the beginning to count them make marks 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.920
 but it was complicated 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.510
 well over time they were using 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:17.650
 drawings like this came the numbering 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.650
 geographic spectrographic 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.590
 and in anselmo the human being I need 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.380
 make a symbolic representation of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.610
 counting with your own body 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.410
 that's why he invented the decimal system 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.530
 because he used the 10 fingers of the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.410
 master hands or back has peak 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.730
 we are eggs and we have only 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:48.450
 eight fingers then we have the 8 system 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:54.690
 clear decimal that is not called opted if 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.860
 wrong we also do not use the decimal system 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:04.380
 that has 10 digits in Latin digits 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:09.410
 means from 2 to see let's try it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:13.560
 one two three four five six seven 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.550
 eight nine and we must increase the zero 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.600
 to get the ten digits with these 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.480
 we can represent 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 jr number for example number 135 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:34.050
 has the digits 13 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.530
 now tell me what we can identify 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.390
 with the numbers and identify which is the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.670
 number of our house 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.460
 to identify what your size is 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.990
 clothing 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.990
 identify our phone number 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:03:00.360
 I made a mistake to identify 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.360
 my favorite channel good 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.940
 and what can we remember with the numbers 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.850
 we can remember how many tablecloths should I 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.370
 put on the table before eating a post 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.580
 to remember how many do the exam 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.580
 Spanish 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.200
 wonderful and that we can calculate with 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.210
 the numbers we can calculate how much 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.750
 I would have to pay for five cubes of 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.270
 ice if each one costs 50 new kisses 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.400
 I can also calculate the number of 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.170
 gelatin trolleys that I'm missing for 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.750
 have the same amount of cart 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.660
 gelatin that salmon has if he has 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.420
 8 little jar of gelatin and I just 5 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.030
 then I need 3 I can calculate 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.430
 how much do I owe to the other eggs kits 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.850
 if each one lent me 13 eggs weights 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.830
 as a child 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:00.530
 they never cease to amaze me excellent have 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.020
 understood everything very well 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.950
 remember that we find numbers in 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.950
 everywhere but not all mean what 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.390
 same because it will depend for the 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.330
 use like this in school at home in 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:23.320
 the store or when you play with your friends 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.320
 in the neat park and talking about that 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.380
 and me
