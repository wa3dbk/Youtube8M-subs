00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.429 
presser so it kind of pressed the false
lashes<00:01:30.810> against<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.619> lash<00:01:31.890> line<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.659> cool<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the lashes are actually like this so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.840 
the lashes are actually like this so
they<00:01:40.650> absolutely<00:01:40.799> go<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.180> left<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
they absolutely go right and left and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.590 
they absolutely go right and left and
I'll<00:01:44.850> show<00:01:45.119> you

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.350 

so<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.729> very

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so as you can see here there is a very

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.190 
so as you can see here there is a very
dark<00:01:51.899> band<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> bottom<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> end<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
dark band at the bottom or the end of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.459 
dark band at the bottom or the end of
the<00:01:55.320> lashes<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> self<00:01:58.229> adhesive

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the lashes and that is a self adhesive

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.889 
the lashes and that is a self adhesive
strip<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.909> you<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.119> need<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.360> pull<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.630> off

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
strip so you just need to pull it off

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.700 
strip so you just need to pull it off
and<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.290> put

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and I put

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.609 
and I put
your<00:02:01.830> lashline<00:02:02.010> that's<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.820> very<00:02:02.909> simple<00:02:03.750> so

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
your lashline that's it's very simple so

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
investing in the tube of glue or things

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.560 
investing in the tube of glue or things
like<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:27.400> that's<00:05:27.520> very<00:05:27.760> good<00:05:28.060> for<00:05:28.360> them

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
like that and that's very good for them

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.540 
like that and that's very good for them
because<00:05:28.810> you<00:05:29.169> can<00:05:29.349> just<00:05:29.560> use<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:29.979> once<00:05:30.370> or

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
because you can just use it once or

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.089 
because you can just use it once or
twice<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:31.000> just<00:05:31.060> discard<00:05:31.570> it<00:05:31.810> and<00:05:32.099> never

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
twice and just discard it and never

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.089 
twice and just discard it and never
think<00:05:33.340> about<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.760> so<00:05:34.510> that's<00:05:34.960> very<00:05:35.229> good<00:05:35.560> for

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
think about it so that's very good for

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.659 
think about it so that's very good for
those<00:05:36.880> kind<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.210> people<00:05:37.360> however<00:05:38.229> I<00:05:39.190> wouldn't

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
those kind of people however I wouldn't

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.390 
those kind of people however I wouldn't

because I already have them on but I'm

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.210 
because I already have them on but I'm
probably<00:05:51.430> remember<00:05:52.120> how<00:05:52.660> flimsy<00:05:53.289> they<00:05:53.590> look

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220

like<00:05:54.490> it<00:05:54.669> without<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.210> band<00:05:55.389> so<00:05:56.200> I<00:05:56.560> actually

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
like it without the band so I actually

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.800 
like it without the band so I actually
tried<00:05:57.340> to<00:05:57.370> put<00:05:57.880> glue<00:05:59.250> on<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.610> band<00:06:00.820> but<00:06:01.510> it

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
tried to put glue on the band but it

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.700 
tried to put glue on the band but it
doesn't<00:06:02.700> hold<00:06:03.700> very<00:06:04.180> wall<00:06:04.539> I<00:06:04.960> don't<00:06:05.590> know

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
doesn't hold very wall I don't know

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.110 
doesn't hold very wall I don't know
whether<00:06:05.919> you<00:06:06.130> know<00:06:06.280> what<00:06:06.460> I<00:06:06.490> mean<00:06:06.700> but<00:06:06.940> you

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
whether you know what I mean but you

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.510 
whether you know what I mean but you
know<00:06:07.240> regular<00:06:07.860> false<00:06:08.860> lashes<00:06:09.099> have<00:06:09.490> a

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
know regular false lashes have a

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.620 
know regular false lashes have a
relatively<00:06:10.510> sturdy<00:06:10.960> band<00:06:11.949> and

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
relatively sturdy band and

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.080 
relatively sturdy band and
you<00:06:12.690> put<00:06:12.900> glue<00:06:13.080> on<00:06:13.350> that<00:06:13.410> band<00:06:13.860> but<00:06:14.580> because

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
you put glue on that band but because

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.150 
you put glue on that band but because
you<00:06:15.270> need<00:06:15.450> to<00:06:15.540> put<00:06:15.810> this<00:06:15.990> sticky<00:06:16.530> bin<00:06:16.710> on<00:06:16.920> top

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
you need to put this sticky bin on top

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.120 
you need to put this sticky bin on top
of<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.460> bin<00:06:18.050> the<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.320> band<00:06:19.530> that<00:06:19.860> is

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
of that bin the the band that is

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.810 
of that bin the the band that is
attached<00:06:20.670> to<00:06:20.850> false<00:06:21.810> lashes<00:06:22.400> very<00:06:23.400> very

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
attached to false lashes very very

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.520 
attached to false lashes very very
fragile<00:06:24.560> so<00:06:26.360> so<00:06:27.360> what<00:06:27.840> I'm<00:06:27.960> saying<00:06:28.260> is<00:06:28.500> that

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
fragile so so what I'm saying is that

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.430 
fragile so so what I'm saying is that
it's<00:06:29.100> very<00:06:29.220> hard<00:06:29.670> to<00:06:29.730> reuse<00:06:30.300> it<00:06:30.570> or<00:06:30.780> use<00:06:31.290> it

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
it's very hard to reuse it or use it

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.580 
it's very hard to reuse it or use it
with<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.770> regular<00:06:32.220> glue<00:06:32.690> so<00:06:33.690> that's<00:06:34.200> the<00:06:34.350> thing

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590
