developed<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.610> exterior<00:00:33.500> skeleton<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.620> this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
developed an exterior skeleton on this

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.709 
developed an exterior skeleton on this
helmet<00:00:35.190> unlike<00:00:35.520> most<00:00:35.820> helmets<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.510> an

helmet unlike most helmets that have an
internal<00:00:37.170> skeleton<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:38.280> allowed<00:00:38.610> us<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
internal skeleton this allowed us as you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.569 
internal skeleton this allowed us as you
can<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.690> larger<00:00:40.410> vents<00:00:40.739> which<00:00:41.250> gives

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
can see to make larger vents which gives

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.630 
can see to make larger vents which gives
us<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.180> most<00:00:42.390> ventilation<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.320> any<00:00:44.010> helmet<00:00:44.370> in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
us the most ventilation of any helmet in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.670 
us the most ventilation of any helmet in
the<00:00:44.760> road<00:00:44.910> market<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.899> also<00:00:45.960> gave<00:00:46.350> us<00:00:46.530> an

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the road market it also gave us an

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.150 
the road market it also gave us an
extremely<00:00:47.070> light<00:00:47.670> weight<00:00:48.800> at<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:50.129> a

and most importantly that external

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.279 
and most importantly that external
skeleton<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:57.090> only<00:00:57.390> keeps<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.780> very<00:00:57.989> stiff

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
skeleton not only keeps a very stiff

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
skeleton not only keeps a very stiff
outer<00:00:58.530> structure<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.579> make<00:01:00.180> sure<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> we

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
outer structure to make sure that we

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360 
outer structure to make sure that we
don't<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.930> any<00:01:01.109> catastrophic<00:01:01.410> failures<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
don't have any catastrophic failures and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.759 
don't have any catastrophic failures and
major<00:01:02.579> collisions<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> inside<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
major collisions but on the inside it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.570 
major collisions but on the inside it
allows<00:01:05.070> us<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.540> most<00:01:07.010> light<00:01:08.010> density

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
allows us to have the most light density

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.539 
allows us to have the most light density
foam<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.229> market<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:10.799> means<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.369> can

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
foam in the market which means we can

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.539 
foam in the market which means we can
activate<00:01:12.119> our<00:01:12.150> foam<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.380> other<00:01:13.590> words<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
activate our foam or in other words you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.359 
activate our foam or in other words you
can<00:01:14.760> use<00:01:14.790> our<00:01:15.299> helmet<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.869> light<00:01:16.409> medium<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
can use our helmet in light medium and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.969 
can use our helmet in light medium and
high<00:01:17.909> speed<00:01:18.360> flashes<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.200> thereby

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
high speed flashes and thereby

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.270 
high speed flashes and thereby
decelerating<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> head<00:01:21.270> speed<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:22.830> also<00:01:22.979> have

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
decelerating the head speed we also have

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.499 
decelerating the head speed we also have
built<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> back<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.240> our<00:01:24.450> own

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
here is 100% reflective so we are

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
here is 100% reflective so we are
getting<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.820> very<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.299> high<00:01:33.540> visibility<00:01:33.960> and

as you can see from the rear exit ports

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.039 
as you can see from the rear exit ports
we<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> massive<00:01:37.619> outflow<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:39.049> rear

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
we have a massive outflow of rear

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.920 
we have a massive outflow of rear
ventilation<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.829> well<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.420> very<00:01:42.600> proud
