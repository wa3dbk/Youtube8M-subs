00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.650
 It is this first step one 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.140
 legal education of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.699
 psychotherapy psychotherapy 20 whole 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.260
 exciting job as very complex 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.689
 occupation and exactly this complexity 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.849
 is also necessary in the audience with 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 to deal with that is called man 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 finally learn a lot 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.329
 on the one hand, classic contents from the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 range of psychiatry different 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.820
 therapeutic schools in her 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 human image that is a whole 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.480
 essential point as a feature 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.850
 our course is a special one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
 focus on growth 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.250
 psychological content medical 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.379
 content actually 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.690
 we could even call it very much 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.309
 a psychosocial basic education 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 was to be the concept of me 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.120
 personally almost prefered 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.809
 probiotikum a political is only 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.370
 a precursor to the Fachspezifikum 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.470
 politician designation would actually be 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.680
 psychosocial basic competence so someone 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.680
 who has mastered his course 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.780
 a total of three semesters of the content 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.850
 it depends on the sources relied on can 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.650
 even less are with these things 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.150
 has certainly something like 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.570
 a psychosocial basic competence 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.570
 boast 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 our intention at that time already in 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.320
 the early nineties was one 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.509
 offer to make targeted 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.950
 Meanwhile, students have addressed themselves 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.869
 evaluated a bit but the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.179
 Target group are actually students 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.820
 the uni vienna in the broadest sense at that time 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.409
 even the med-uni so almost all 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.319
 students who call themselves in sources 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.509
 Are these sources profession intel of 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.990
 psychotherapeutic training that 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.369
 means that the main target audience 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.610
 students of educational science 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.840
 of psychology biology teaching posts and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.819
 similar professions 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.770
 It can also be another of our policies 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.450
 and visit this group will always be 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.360
 bigger over the last few years though 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.349
 Actually it is the law 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.030
 main focus on this so-called 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.470
 occupations sources aligned and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.049
 Typically, in this training 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.420
 as an additional education to choose a profession 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.420
 Mostly started at the end of the study 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.079
 So probiotic there is a whole 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.630
 a feature of providers is that feature 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.579
 It offered as a university course 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.769
 is therefore also these quality standards 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.200
 a universe fulfills the try 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.510
 We also so as a kind of a usb of our 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.640
 to distinguish it from others 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.150
 that we simply value high quality 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.630
 lay 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.459
 the uni course is just there 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.220
 good frame 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.630
 we are pretty much the biggest supplier 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.950
 Austria is one of the biggest 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.280
 means we can maximum flexibility 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.709
 offer and that means in particular that 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.450
 extra-occupational actually quite optimal 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.370
 is feasible if we just so many 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.019
 can offer courses basically 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.019
 outside working hours or 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.910
 typically weekdays from 17 o'clock or 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.139
 On Saturdays, if possible, no 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.209
 sunday around that too with the 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.489
 family life we bring to 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.859
 can make the offer so flexible 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.019
 that's actually pretty perfect 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.019
 in addition to the profession can be performed 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.549
 So this is a vocational training for 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.959
 Psychotherapy in this respect is this 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.640
 direction quasi predetermined 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.860
 there it is rather the question in which 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.580
 specific direction people 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.170
 develop 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.269
 that is another feature 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.000
 our course is that we are whole 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.190
 deliberately assigned to no school 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.599
 So again understand the psychoanalysis 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.280
 nor the behavioral therapy nor a 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.250
 humanistic or systems deleted if 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.569
 one continues like that but quite consciously and 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.250
 understand comprehensively about the 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.810
 avert graduates 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.610
 the decision is to facilitate 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.340
 that you are simply the school for yourself 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:03.299
 then find the medal yours 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.890
 selection list to them suits so 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.010
 my personal access is it 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.739
 on the one hand recognized strong personal 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.269
 connections to psychotherapy I am 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.340
 in the training even in a fold 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.350
 it was always quite specific to me 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.000
 big concern the psychotherapy the 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.709
 also to give a place at the university 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.079
 psychotherapy is not 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.840
 Regular study will also take place in the near future 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.950
 does not have his process in 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.870
 direction of an academy 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.940
 go through in recent years 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.610
 although not legally but de 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.500
 factually purely practical academic professions 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.000
 I have always been very concerned that the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.130
 uni vienna also has a place on it 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.020
 ultimately and psycho therapy must 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.419
 in this framework also as sources 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.610
 So called to swell job to as 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.200
 additional education really for many 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.200
 The University of Vienna can be offered
