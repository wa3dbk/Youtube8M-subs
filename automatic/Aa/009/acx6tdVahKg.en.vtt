179 euro or 449 euro my impression
though<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.470> deal<00:02:36.800> quite<00:02:37.370> well

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
though is that you can deal quite well

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.000 
though is that you can deal quite well
with<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.970> game<00:02:38.150> without<00:02:38.540> in-app<00:02:39.440> purchases

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
with the game without in-app purchases

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.000 
with the game without in-app purchases
but<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:41.030> frequent<00:02:41.570> calls<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.440> invest<00:02:42.800> money

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
but the frequent calls to invest money

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.479 
but the frequent calls to invest money
are<00:02:43.280> definitely<00:02:44.239> disturbing<00:02:45.070> nevertheless<00:02:46.070> I

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
are definitely disturbing nevertheless I

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.910 
are definitely disturbing nevertheless I
had<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> lot<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.270> fun<00:02:47.660> with<00:02:47.840> toy<00:02:48.170> defense<00:02:48.440> too

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
had a lot of fun with toy defense too

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.610 
had a lot of fun with toy defense too
especially<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.330> action-packed<00:02:50.930> later

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
especially in the action-packed later

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.670 
especially in the action-packed later
levels<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:53.030> anyone<00:02:53.780> who<00:02:54.050> wants<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.380> play<00:02:54.590> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
levels so anyone who wants to play a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.860 
levels so anyone who wants to play a
well-made<00:02:55.280> tower<00:02:55.670> defense<00:02:56.090> title<00:02:56.450> should

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
well-made tower defense title should

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.259 
well-made tower defense title should
definitely<00:02:57.739> take<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.250> look<00:02:58.550> at<00:02:58.730> toy<00:02:59.030> defense

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
definitely take a look at toy defense

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.590 
definitely take a look at toy defense
too<00:02:59.720> since<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.860> predecessor<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.940> not<00:03:02.239> so

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
too since the predecessor is not so

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.960 
too since the predecessor is not so
massively<00:03:03.200> geared<00:03:03.920> towards<00:03:04.550> in-app

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
massively geared towards in-app

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.420 
massively geared towards in-app
purchases<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.660> recommend<00:03:06.650> interested<00:03:07.280> players
