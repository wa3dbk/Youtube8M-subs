00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:30.459 
but for the most part you can get a

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.670 
but for the most part you can get a
pretty<00:05:30.729> decent<00:05:30.849> amount<00:05:31.389> of<00:05:31.479> apps<00:05:31.899> that<00:05:32.199> you

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
pretty decent amount of apps that you

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.199 
pretty decent amount of apps that you
don't<00:05:32.830> have<00:05:32.949> to<00:05:33.069> pay<00:05:33.279> for<00:05:33.309> which<00:05:33.849> is<00:05:34.029> really

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:34.209
