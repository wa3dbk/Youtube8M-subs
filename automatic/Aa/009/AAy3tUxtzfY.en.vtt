00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.450 
floors properly without a powerful motor
you<00:00:13.839> do<00:00:13.960> not<00:00:14.110> have<00:00:14.290> good<00:00:14.440> suction<00:00:14.740> so<00:00:15.309> what

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
you do not have good suction so what

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.370 
you do not have good suction so what
we've<00:00:15.639> done<00:00:15.790> at<00:00:15.910> Dyson<00:00:16.330> is<00:00:16.540> developed<00:00:17.080> our<00:00:17.350> own

these<00:00:27.970> air<00:00:28.210> Watts<00:00:28.390> boxes<00:00:28.900> allow<00:00:29.140> us<00:00:29.290> to

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
these air Watts boxes allow us to

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.260 
these air Watts boxes allow us to
measure<00:00:29.620> that<00:00:29.830> difference<00:00:30.310> and<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:31.060> can

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
measure that difference and you can

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.120 
measure that difference and you can
clearly<00:00:31.510> see<00:00:31.630> that<00:00:31.870> the<00:00:32.230> Dyson<00:00:32.680> generates

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
clearly see that the Dyson generates

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.650 
clearly see that the Dyson generates
great<00:00:33.400> to<00:00:33.580> touch<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.730> this<00:00:36.910> test<00:00:37.180> will<00:00:37.390> show<00:00:37.420> us

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
great to touch so this test will show us

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.540 
great to touch so this test will show us
visually<00:00:38.140> how<00:00:38.380> important<00:00:38.950> that<00:00:39.010> extra

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
visually how important that extra

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.100 
visually how important that extra
suction<00:00:39.970> is<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.330> the<00:00:40.420> performance<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.050> the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
suction is to the performance of the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.340 
suction is to the performance of the
product<00:00:42.060> so<00:00:43.060> here<00:00:43.270> you<00:00:43.390> can<00:00:43.570> see<00:00:43.810> how<00:00:44.110> much

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
product so here you can see how much

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.840 
product so here you can see how much
dust<00:00:44.710> has<00:00:44.920> been<00:00:45.070> left<00:00:45.250> behind<00:00:45.340> by<00:00:45.790> this

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
dust has been left behind by this

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.690 
dust has been left behind by this
machine<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:47.500> a<00:00:47.590> huge<00:00:47.829> amount<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.190> dust<00:00:48.430> the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
machine it's a huge amount of dust the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.880 
machine it's a huge amount of dust the
crevice<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.180> still<00:00:49.390> full<00:00:49.570> of<00:00:49.690> dirt<00:00:49.900> which<00:00:50.710> is

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
crevice is still full of dirt which is

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.500 
crevice is still full of dirt which is
in<00:00:51.010> complete<00:00:51.280> contrast<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.910> our<00:00:52.120> machine

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
in complete contrast to our machine

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.020 
in complete contrast to our machine
which<00:00:52.720> has<00:00:52.810> picked<00:00:53.079> up<00:00:53.200> much<00:00:53.440> more<00:00:53.739> dust<00:00:54.030> our

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
which has picked up much more dust our

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.120 
which has picked up much more dust our
machine<00:00:55.570> have<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.440> cleaner<00:00:56.680> head<00:00:56.950> that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
machine have the cleaner head that

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.040 
machine have the cleaner head that
covers<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.579> width<00:00:57.760> of<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.030> product<00:00:58.360> so<00:00:58.930> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
covers the width of the product so the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.010 
covers the width of the product so the
path<00:00:59.230> it<00:00:59.470> takes<00:00:59.649> is<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.010> path<00:01:00.340> it<00:01:00.550> cleans<00:01:01.020> some

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
path it takes is the path it cleans some

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.630 
path it takes is the path it cleans some
other<00:01:02.170> robot<00:01:02.530> machines<00:01:02.860> have<00:01:03.190> these<00:01:03.370> side

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
other robot machines have these side

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.430 
other robot machines have these side
sweepers<00:01:04.089> which<00:01:04.330> are<00:01:04.570> meant<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.809> help<00:01:05.019> make<00:01:05.260> up

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
sweepers which are meant to help make up

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.840 
sweepers which are meant to help make up
for<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.740> small<00:01:05.860> width<00:01:06.220> of<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.430> cleaner<00:01:06.670> head

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
for the small width of the cleaner head

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.390 
for the small width of the cleaner head
these<00:01:07.600> side<00:01:07.900> sweepers<00:01:08.380> sometimes<00:01:08.860> just

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
these side sweepers sometimes just

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.490 
these side sweepers sometimes just
disturb<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.030> dust<00:01:10.300> rather<00:01:10.960> than<00:01:11.170> actually

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
disturb the dust rather than actually

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.649 
disturb the dust rather than actually
sucking<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.950> up<00:01:12.100> they<00:01:12.640> can<00:01:12.940> flick<00:01:13.240> dust<00:01:13.479> up

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
sucking it up they can flick dust up

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.030 
sucking it up they can flick dust up
into<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:13.990> air<00:01:14.140> which<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.500> really<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.860> last

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
into the air which is really the last

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.789 
into the air which is really the last
place<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.490> want<00:01:15.729> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
place that you want it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.050 
place that you want it
having<00:01:17.799> sucked<00:01:18.040> up<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.400> dust<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.760> dirt<00:01:18.880> from

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
having sucked up the dust and dirt from

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.430 
having sucked up the dust and dirt from
the<00:01:19.180> floor<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.630> next<00:01:19.750> thing<00:01:19.990> we<00:01:20.080> have<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.260> do

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
the floor the next thing we have to do

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.050 
the floor the next thing we have to do
is<00:01:20.560> separate<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.070> dust<00:01:21.400> from<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.670> airflow

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
is separate the dust from the airflow

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.730 
is separate the dust from the airflow
and<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.600> way<00:01:22.780> we<00:01:22.900> achieve<00:01:23.200> this<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.590> by<00:01:23.620> using

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
and the way we achieve this is by using

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.760 
and the way we achieve this is by using
cyclonic<00:01:24.490> technology<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.900> we<00:01:26.049> have<00:01:26.200> one<00:01:26.440> large

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
cyclonic technology so we have one large

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.980 
cyclonic technology so we have one large
outer<00:01:27.190> cyclone<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.060> we<00:01:28.210> have<00:01:28.360> eight<00:01:28.570> inner

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
outer cyclone and we have eight inner

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.990 
outer cyclone and we have eight inner
cyclones<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.799> remove<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.159> finer<00:01:30.430> dust<00:01:30.760> and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
cyclones that remove the finer dust and

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000 
cyclones that remove the finer dust and
because<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.840> extremely<00:01:32.229> high<00:01:32.470> velocity

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
because of the extremely high velocity

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.710 
because of the extremely high velocity
of<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.190> airflow<00:01:33.610> we're<00:01:33.880> even<00:01:34.150> able<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.510> remove

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
of the airflow we're even able to remove

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.460 
of the airflow we're even able to remove
microscopic<00:01:35.500> particles<00:01:35.950> from<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.220> air

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
microscopic particles from the air

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.899 
microscopic particles from the air
another<00:01:38.470> important<00:01:38.950> feature<00:01:39.100> for<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.580> robot
