are<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.860> overalls<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:11.220> then<00:05:11.520> from<00:05:11.940> about

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
are the overalls and then from about

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.070

maybe<00:05:12.720> right<00:05:13.140> here<00:05:13.970> we're<00:05:14.970> gonna<00:05:15.300> take<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:15.810> and

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
maybe right here we're gonna take it and

maybe right here we're gonna take it and
go<00:05:16.320> out<00:05:17.990> then<00:05:18.990> you're<00:05:19.200> gonna<00:05:19.380> draw<00:05:21.530> their

farmer you can draw some scarecrows in
the<00:05:49.020> background<00:05:58.069> can<00:05:59.069> draw<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.310> code<00:05:59.669> close

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
the background can draw the code close

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:23.629 
the background can draw the code close
to<00:06:00.840> me<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.439> then<00:06:02.569> small<00:06:03.569> scarecrow<00:06:04.289> them

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:39.810 

that<00:06:24.569> can<00:06:24.870> be<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.229> farmer<00:06:25.680> scarecrow

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.560 

and<00:06:40.390> that<00:06:41.050> is<00:06:41.490> basically<00:06:42.490> how<00:06:42.850> you<00:06:42.880> control

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
and that is basically how you control

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.550 
and that is basically how you control
farming<00:06:45.120> you<00:06:46.120> could<00:06:46.330> draw<00:06:46.540> anything<00:06:47.380> in<00:06:47.470> the

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
farming you could draw anything in the

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.170 
farming you could draw anything in the
background<00:06:47.740> you<00:06:48.130> want<00:06:48.370> you<00:06:48.700> could<00:06:48.940> change

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
background you want you could change

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.930 
background you want you could change
anything<00:06:50.070> you<00:06:51.070> think<00:06:51.370> I<00:06:51.490> should<00:06:51.700> do<00:06:51.850> it

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
anything you think I should do it

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.060 
anything you think I should do it
differently<00:06:52.390> but<00:06:52.900> comment<00:06:53.230> down<00:06:53.560> below<00:06:53.770> what
