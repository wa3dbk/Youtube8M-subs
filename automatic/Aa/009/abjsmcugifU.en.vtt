00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
for the mcx technology but maybe you can

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.190 
for the mcx technology but maybe you can
get<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.340> composite<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.689> three

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
get this to composite as well three

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.830 
get this to composite as well three
composites<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.369> plug<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.670> any<00:01:21.630> sort

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.300 
but not a big deal I don't think we're a
little<00:02:17.280> bit<00:02:17.550> annoying<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
little bit annoying this is the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.280 
little bit annoying this is the
microfiber<00:02:20.310> sleeve<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.000> came<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:22.020> one

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
microfiber sleeve that it came in on one

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.500 
microfiber sleeve that it came in on one
side<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:24.080> already<00:02:25.280> ripped<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:27.239> can<00:02:27.360> see

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
side it's already ripped you can see

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.500 
side it's already ripped you can see
that<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:29.430> looks<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:29.790> very<00:02:30.090> easy<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
that and it looks like it's very easy to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.009 
that and it looks like it's very easy to
rip<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.080> fact<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:33.090> stitching<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.569> not<00:02:33.810> very

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
rip in fact the stitching is not very

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.130 
rip in fact the stitching is not very
strong<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:36.230> over<00:02:37.230> there<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:39.300> actually

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
strong just over there and I actually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.750 
strong just over there and I actually
quite<00:02:40.410> like<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.709> sleeve<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.099> is<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> quite

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
nifty and quite thick it's not going to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.199 
nifty and quite thick it's not going to
get<00:02:46.650> any<00:02:46.799> protection<00:02:47.190> obviously<00:02:47.489> but<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.819> might

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
get any protection obviously but I might

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.690 
get any protection obviously but I might
keep<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.630> might<00:02:48.989> stitch<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:50.069> cuz

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.509 
know if you can see that and you can see
that<00:03:07.230> bit<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.660> it's<00:03:09.660> just<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.620> back<00:03:10.890> is

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
that bit just here it's just the back is

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.970 
that bit just here it's just the back is
propping<00:03:12.269> out<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.420> little<00:03:12.690> bit<00:03:12.840> now<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:13.890> might

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
propping out a little bit now it might

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.380 
propping out a little bit now it might
seem<00:03:14.040> minor<00:03:14.489> but<00:03:14.790> that's<00:03:14.910> actually<00:03:15.180> really

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
seem minor but that's actually really

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.370 
seem minor but that's actually really
annoying<00:03:15.720> it's<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:15.870> something<00:03:16.230> could<00:03:16.349> be

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
annoying it's like something could be

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.740 
annoying it's like something could be
stuck<00:03:17.070> there<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:18.090> reason<00:03:18.329> why<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:18.540> annoying

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
stuck there the reason why it's annoying

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.620 
stuck there the reason why it's annoying
is<00:03:18.870> because<00:03:19.079> i<00:03:19.260> think<00:03:19.590> that's<00:03:19.980> why<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
is because i think that's why the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.800 
is because i think that's why the
batteries<00:03:21.630> are<00:03:21.750> actually<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.019> bit<00:03:22.200> loose<00:03:23.810> so

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
batteries are actually a bit loose so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.400 
batteries are actually a bit loose so
when<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.140> are<00:03:25.230> actually<00:03:25.350> using<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:26.130> laptop

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.449 

this<00:03:31.410> bit<00:03:33.859> don't<00:03:34.859> know<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.069> can<00:03:35.190> see<00:03:35.310> that

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
this bit don't know if you can see that

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.770 
this bit don't know if you can see that
but<00:03:35.549> it's<00:03:35.700> actually<00:03:35.790> coming<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.569> down<00:03:36.750> a

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
but it's actually coming up and down a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.910 
but it's actually coming up and down a
lot<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:38.810> that's<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.959> bit<00:03:40.079> annoying<00:03:40.170> makes<00:03:40.799> it

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
lot and that's a bit annoying makes it

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.809 
lot and that's a bit annoying makes it
feel<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.069> bit<00:03:41.220> cheap<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:43.250> what<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> might<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.639> I

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
feel a bit cheap so what I might do is I

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:45.920 
feel a bit cheap so what I might do is I
might<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.090> quickly<00:03:45.299> see<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:45.569> there<00:03:45.810> is

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
might just quickly see if there is

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.440 
might just quickly see if there is
something<00:03:46.109> stuck<00:03:46.440> under<00:03:46.709> there<00:03:47.180> was<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.329> a

if<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.330> can<00:04:21.419> see<00:04:21.659> that<00:04:21.690> but<00:04:22.490> can<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.580> see<00:04:23.669> that

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
if you can see that but can you see that

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.709 
if you can see that but can you see that
slight<00:04:24.120> elevation<00:04:24.409> just<00:04:25.409> here

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:26.719 
slight elevation just here

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:30.920 
slight elevation just here
I<00:04:27.719> think<00:04:28.409> this<00:04:28.469> is<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.789> motherboard<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:29.999> I

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
I think this is the motherboard and I

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.230 
I think this is the motherboard and I
think<00:04:31.110> what<00:04:31.349> happened<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.830> with<00:04:32.069> 46<00:04:32.460> 70s<00:04:32.969> I

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
think what happened is with 46 70s I

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.230 
think what happened is with 46 70s I
want<00:04:34.110> only<00:04:34.229> entity<00:04:34.889> that<00:04:35.099> graphics<00:04:35.669> card<00:04:35.879> they

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
want only entity that graphics card they

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.909 
want only entity that graphics card they
actually<00:04:36.360> changed<00:04:36.749> the<00:04:36.960> motherboard<00:04:37.439> as<00:04:37.620> well

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
actually changed the motherboard as well

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.879 
actually changed the motherboard as well
and<00:04:38.639> so<00:04:38.819> that<00:04:38.969> this<00:04:39.150> could<00:04:39.840> be<00:04:39.930> reason<00:04:40.169> why<00:04:40.289> may

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
and so that this could be reason why may

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.980 
and so that this could be reason why may
be<00:04:40.949> a<00:04:41.039> problem<00:04:41.189> not<00:04:41.490> seen<00:04:41.789> in<00:04:42.689> the<00:04:42.840> previous

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
be a problem not seen in the previous

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.779 
be a problem not seen in the previous
units<00:04:45.259> but<00:04:46.259> in<00:04:46.469> any<00:04:46.979> case<00:04:49.159> I'm<00:04:50.159> a<00:04:50.310> screw<00:04:50.669> this

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
units but in any case I'm a screw this

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.649 
units but in any case I'm a screw this
back<00:04:51.029> on<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:52.800> know<00:04:53.789> if<00:04:53.909> it<00:04:53.999> bothers<00:04:54.300> me<00:04:54.330> I

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
back on and I know if it bothers me I

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.439 
back on and I know if it bothers me I
might<00:04:55.409> call<00:04:55.590> dell<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:55.979> get<00:04:56.099> it<00:04:56.159> replaced<00:04:56.449> not

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
might call dell and get it replaced not

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.260 
might call dell and get it replaced not
sure<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:58.139> might<00:04:58.590> do<00:04:58.710> some<00:04:58.919> googling<00:04:59.310> see<00:04:59.759> if
