that's<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:12.160> very<00:01:12.190> very<00:01:13.090> good<00:01:13.750> question<00:01:14.200> because

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
that's a very very good question because

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.190 
that's a very very good question because
I<00:01:15.070> really<00:01:15.580> think<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.150> it's<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.720> personal

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
I really think that it's a personal

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.040 
I really think that it's a personal
decision<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.980> how<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.550> go<00:01:18.910> about<00:01:19.050> disclosing

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
decision and how you go about disclosing

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.890 
decision and how you go about disclosing
your<00:01:20.320> status<00:01:21.010> whether<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.550> be<00:01:21.700> gay<00:01:22.150> whether<00:01:22.780> it

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
your status whether it be gay whether it

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.660 
your status whether it be gay whether it
be<00:01:22.930> transsexual<00:01:23.740> whether<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.070> be<00:01:24.160> your<00:01:24.310> HIV

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
be transsexual whether it be your HIV

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.300 
be transsexual whether it be your HIV
status<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.480> I<00:01:25.990> think<00:01:26.080> that<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.830> have<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.070> take

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
status and I think that you have to take

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.060 
status and I think that you have to take
into<00:01:27.550> consideration<00:01:28.330> many<00:01:28.660> points<00:01:29.230> such<00:01:30.040> as

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
into consideration many points such as

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.430 
into consideration many points such as
how<00:01:30.760> are<00:01:30.940> your<00:01:31.060> parents<00:01:31.240> when<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.840> confront

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
how are your parents when you confront

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.900 
how are your parents when you confront
them<00:01:32.590> on<00:01:32.740> other<00:01:32.860> kinds<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.310> issues<00:01:33.460> are<00:01:33.790> they

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
them on other kinds of issues are they

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.670 
them on other kinds of issues are they
really<00:01:34.060> cool<00:01:34.360> about<00:01:34.570> stuff<00:01:34.780> or<00:01:35.170> are<00:01:35.230> they

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
really cool about stuff or are they

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.280 
really cool about stuff or are they
really<00:01:35.910> very<00:01:36.910> horrible<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.960> they<00:01:38.020> don't<00:01:38.080> want

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
really very horrible and they don't want

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.570 
really very horrible and they don't want
to<00:01:38.380> listen<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.650> what<00:01:38.980> you<00:01:39.070> have<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.370> say<00:01:39.550> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
to listen to what you have to say and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.120 
to listen to what you have to say and
they're<00:01:40.000> very<00:01:40.030> demeaning<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:41.230> so<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:41.980> think

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
they're very demeaning and so I think

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.650 
they're very demeaning and so I think
that's<00:01:42.490> something<00:01:42.880> that<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:43.330> need<00:01:43.570> to

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
that's something that you really need to

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.200 
that's something that you really need to
take<00:01:43.840> into<00:01:43.990> account<00:01:44.350> for<00:01:45.190> me<00:01:45.340> when<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.730> told<00:01:45.850> my

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
take into account for me when I told my

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.510 
take into account for me when I told my
parents<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.440> was<00:01:47.590> pretty<00:01:48.100> much<00:01:48.280> when<00:01:48.490> I

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
parents and it was pretty much when I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.000 
parents and it was pretty much when I
was<00:01:48.670> in<00:01:48.790> my<00:01:48.880> late<00:01:48.910> 20s<00:01:49.510> that<00:01:49.900> I<00:01:50.170> felt<00:01:50.770> like<00:01:50.950> a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
was in my late 20s that I felt like a

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.480
