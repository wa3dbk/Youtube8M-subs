because<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:24.119> not<00:00:24.359> complete<00:00:24.869> until<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
because it's not complete until you do a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.410 
because it's not complete until you do a
little<00:00:26.220> step<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.760> I'll<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.090> show<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
little step so I'll just show you that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.230 
little step so I'll just show you that
step<00:00:27.949> everything<00:00:28.949> right<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.670> done<00:00:29.880> first

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
step everything right here is done first

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.790 
step everything right here is done first
step<00:00:30.420> you'll<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> layers<00:00:31.199> menu<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
step you'll see in the layers menu is to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380 
step you'll see in the layers menu is to
delete<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.279> because<00:00:32.850> we'll<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.270> in

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
delete that because we'll get to that in

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.729 
delete that because we'll get to that in
a<00:00:33.630> sec<00:00:34.010> okay<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.329> it's<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> league<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
a sec okay so it's the league of and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.520 
a sec okay so it's the league of and
then<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.460> problem<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.290> first

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
then the problem with this is the first

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.229 
then the problem with this is the first
letter<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> different<00:00:41.730> size<00:00:41.910> font

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
letter of this is a different size font

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.650 
letter of this is a different size font
or<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.840> different<00:00:43.290> size<00:00:43.440> uh<00:00:44.090> lettering<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
or a different size uh lettering so I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
or a different size uh lettering so I
had<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> separate<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> rest<00:00:47.370> of

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
had to make it separate from the rest of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.069 
had to make it separate from the rest of
the<00:00:47.550> word<00:00:47.700> same<00:00:48.120> thing<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> last<00:00:48.719> other

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the word same thing with the last other

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.979 
the word same thing with the last other
so<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:50.610> example<00:00:51.059> let's<00:00:51.300> say<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.660> wanted<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so for example let's say if we wanted to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.760 
so for example let's say if we wanted to
make<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.469> say<00:00:52.649> League<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:55.219> Dre<00:00:57.500> make<00:00:58.500> sure<00:00:58.649> it's

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
make it say League of Dre make sure it's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.950 
make it say League of Dre make sure it's
all<00:00:58.859> caps<00:00:59.989> link<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.170> oh<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:02.070> no<00:01:02.969> n<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.809> don't

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
all caps link of oh not no n you don't

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.289 
all caps link of oh not no n you don't
want<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> last<00:01:04.589> letter<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.100> showing<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
want the last letter to be showing so

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
see this will just take a little bit of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
see this will just take a little bit of
your<00:01:10.080> time<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.729> making<00:01:11.729> sure<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.540> goes
