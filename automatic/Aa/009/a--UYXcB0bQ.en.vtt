00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
in here and spark this so that's the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
in here and spark this so that's the
first<00:00:21.179> thing<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.539> order<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.929> if<00:00:22.349> you<00:00:22.439> don't

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
here I put a GPS power supply to the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
here I put a GPS power supply to the
lighter<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> whenever<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.949> there<00:00:44.190> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
lighter and whenever it's in there it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.279 
lighter and whenever it's in there it
lights<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.600> there's<00:00:45.750> no<00:00:45.870> juice<00:00:46.110> in

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
lights up and if there's no juice in

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.760 
lights up and if there's no juice in
there<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.710> turns<00:00:47.160> off<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.809> off<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
there it turns off so if that's off and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
there it turns off so if that's off and
you<00:00:49.949> pull<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> fuse<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.670> should<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.940> off<00:00:51.090> let's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you pull the fuse I should be off let's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.549 
you pull the fuse I should be off let's
go<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
go do that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.240 
go do that
this<00:00:52.980> car<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.489> third-generation<00:00:53.850> Camaro

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
this car is a third-generation Camaro

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.970 
this car is a third-generation Camaro
but<00:00:56.480> every<00:00:57.480> car<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.050> pretty<00:00:58.350> much<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.739> same

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
but every car is pretty much the same

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.000 
but every car is pretty much the same
for<00:00:59.280> minor<00:00:59.460> variations<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.300> how<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.719> this

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
for minor variations on how to do this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:10.420 
for minor variations on how to do this
so<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.429> car<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.449> CC<00:01:04.460> that's<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.850> there

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.120 

this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.790> CC<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.770> pull

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this is a CC so I'm just going to pull

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:24.679 
this is a CC so I'm just going to pull
that<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.780> leave<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.890> aside<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:23.540> as<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that out and leave that aside and as you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.030 
that out and leave that aside and as you
can<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.250> light<00:01:26.460> went<00:01:26.790> off

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
can see here the light went off

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.249 
can see here the light went off
so<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.340> confirmed<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.150> there's<00:01:30.390> no<00:01:30.540> juice

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so I'm confirmed that there's no juice

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:50.920 
so I'm confirmed that there's no juice
in<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:34.280> next<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:37.610> is<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.020> take<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.229> off

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.480 

before<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.320> ahead<00:01:52.619> let<00:01:52.950> me<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.280> show<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.200 
before we go ahead let me just show you
what<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.060> wrong<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.600> mine<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.820> my

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
what is wrong with mine this is my

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.929 
what is wrong with mine this is my
cigarette<00:01:57.600> lighter<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.369> when<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> insert<00:01:59.909> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
cigarette lighter and when I insert it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.190 
cigarette lighter and when I insert it
in<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.240> hole<00:02:00.409> like<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.939> it<00:02:02.939> actually<00:02:03.479> comes

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
in the hole like so it actually comes

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
in the hole like so it actually comes
out<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:05.149> which<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.390> good

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
out out which is not good

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.990 
out out which is not good

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
because without driving I press the gas

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.930 
because without driving I press the gas
this<00:02:09.420> thing<00:02:09.660> shoots<00:02:09.990> out<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.580> hits<00:02:11.700> me<00:02:11.790> in

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
this thing shoots out and it hits me in

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.610

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
like a socket in the back to actually

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.000 
like a socket in the back to actually
turn<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:27.060> once<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.750> dis<00:03:28.020> once<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.500> take<00:03:28.860> all

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
turn it once you dis once you take all

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.330 
turn it once you dis once you take all
the<00:03:29.100> wiring<00:03:29.310> off<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:31.080> let's<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:31.830> right

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
the wiring off it so let's do that right

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.550 
the wiring off it so let's do that right
now<00:03:32.600> what<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.660> can<00:03:33.780> do<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.200> have<00:03:34.350> like

now what you can do is you can have like

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.590 
now what you can do is you can have like
a<00:03:34.590> little<00:03:34.860> hook<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:36.120> grab<00:03:36.360> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
a little hook like this to grab the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.330 
a little hook like this to grab the
inside<00:03:37.490> so<00:03:38.490> you<00:03:38.550> could<00:03:38.760> turn<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.600> around<00:03:40.340> so

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
inside so you could turn it around so

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.830 
inside so you could turn it around so
I'm<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.610> hooking<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.330> hole<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.690> there
