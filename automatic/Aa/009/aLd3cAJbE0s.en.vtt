vehicles but like I think this is the
most<00:04:33.950> current<00:04:34.250> one<00:04:34.490> they<00:04:34.850> make<00:04:35.530> but<00:04:36.530> if<00:04:37.280> that's

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
most current one they make but if that's

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.210 
most current one they make but if that's
it<00:04:38.000> then<00:04:38.390> that's<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:40.510> thanks<00:04:41.510> for<00:04:41.570> watching<00:04:42.220> go
