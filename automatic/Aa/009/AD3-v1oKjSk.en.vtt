00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.530 

so<00:00:01.490> today<00:00:02.000> we're<00:00:02.090> going<00:00:02.180> to<00:00:02.300> talk<00:00:02.420> about

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.540 
so today we're going to talk about

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.599 
so today we're going to talk about
enzymes<00:00:03.230> and<00:00:03.530> all<00:00:03.710> the<00:00:03.890> different<00:00:04.190> kinds<00:00:04.549> of

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:04.609 
enzymes and all the different kinds of

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.449 
enzymes and all the different kinds of
reactions<00:00:05.299> that<00:00:05.509> enzymes<00:00:05.810> can<00:00:06.049> catalyze<00:00:06.529> but

00:00:07.449 --> 00:00:07.459 
reactions that enzymes can catalyze but

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:08.980 
reactions that enzymes can catalyze but
before<00:00:07.819> we<00:00:07.939> do<00:00:08.059> that<00:00:08.120> let's<00:00:08.450> review<00:00:08.810> the<00:00:08.960> idea

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
before we do that let's review the idea

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.290 
before we do that let's review the idea
that<00:00:09.320> enzymes<00:00:09.470> make<00:00:10.130> biochemical<00:00:10.850> reactions

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
that enzymes make biochemical reactions

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.420 
that enzymes make biochemical reactions
go<00:00:11.450> faster<00:00:11.480> and<00:00:12.170> if<00:00:12.860> you<00:00:12.950> look<00:00:13.100> at<00:00:13.190> a<00:00:13.220> reaction

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
go faster and if you look at a reaction

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.280 
go faster and if you look at a reaction
coordinate<00:00:13.790> diagram<00:00:14.480> you'd<00:00:14.720> notice<00:00:15.140> that

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
coordinate diagram you'd notice that

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.560 
coordinate diagram you'd notice that
enzymes<00:00:15.710> speed<00:00:16.010> up<00:00:16.309> reactions<00:00:16.519> by<00:00:17.000> lowering

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
enzymes speed up reactions by lowering

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.620 
enzymes speed up reactions by lowering
their<00:00:17.750> activation<00:00:18.230> energy<00:00:18.910> now<00:00:19.940> enzymes<00:00:20.450> are

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
their activation energy now enzymes are

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.390 
their activation energy now enzymes are
generally<00:00:21.200> named<00:00:21.500> for<00:00:21.800> their<00:00:21.890> reactions

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
generally named for their reactions

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.430 
generally named for their reactions
which<00:00:23.030> is<00:00:23.150> convenient<00:00:23.570> because<00:00:24.050> it<00:00:24.170> makes<00:00:24.320> it

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
which is convenient because it makes it

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.170 
which is convenient because it makes it
a<00:00:24.500> lot<00:00:24.740> easier<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.369> remember<00:00:25.520> what<00:00:25.940> an<00:00:26.030> enzyme

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
a lot easier to remember what an enzyme

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.230 
a lot easier to remember what an enzyme
does<00:00:26.720> if<00:00:27.020> someone<00:00:27.289> gives<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:27.560> its<00:00:27.710> name<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.250> a

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
does if someone gives you its name and a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.790 
does if someone gives you its name and a
great<00:00:29.420> example<00:00:29.570> of<00:00:29.960> this<00:00:30.080> is<00:00:30.289> that<00:00:30.440> one<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:30.650> the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
called DNA polymerase which is named as

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.360 
called DNA polymerase which is named as
such<00:00:35.750> because<00:00:36.140> it<00:00:36.260> acts<00:00:36.470> on<00:00:36.710> DNA<00:00:36.980> and

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370
