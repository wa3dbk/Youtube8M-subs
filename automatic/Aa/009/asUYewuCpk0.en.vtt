00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.690
 smith and mint min 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:17.270
 we are in pokémon generation as you see 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.110
 I made a video of this game explaining 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.439
 certain things and got a patch done 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.200
 that time I said it could swim 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.640
 no previous video that would put and 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.180
 you told me to do the video and he said 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.090
 and says and said city sometimes does not 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.790
 now and then I have trouble doing 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.290
 and I said no because the truth is that 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.020
 It was very little but I've seen this 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.370
 patch and loop with more new things and 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.320
 Well, I wanted to take it out 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.360
 basically so I'm going to tell you how 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.620
 is the pokemon project genre edition 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.350
 which is a game that interests us a lot 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.330
 everyone so let's go with it we're in 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.070
 the principle, as you can see now, 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.570
 move 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.570
 they are no longer standing in one place 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.680
 you can enter here as you see 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.690
 or let's go there 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.700
 There are new ones to take charge over everything 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.250
 I think that is what has changed the most 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.330
 great new posts 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.330
 new animations 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.740
 and the folien groening or not the fire not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.740
 he did not move 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.000
 they have put that sound of footsteps 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.650
 you can not be in command, it seems to me that 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 there is a tractor 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.300
 now the fighting here is easier 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.690
 as you see now there are rocks to be able 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.550
 fight against squirt the one who is here 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.710
 Now they have changed that is what I wanted 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.480
 explain in previous patch was this 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.480
 basically that is going to give 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.330
 from here at least here you can 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.490
 fight against school even if it is not 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.100
 water the pokemon with the horse is 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.650
 use basically there are no new ones 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.330
 but in the next part they're going to take out 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.820
 crowley that there yes I tell you then 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.039
 I'll do to show you basically here 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.130
 Well, there's nothing and a coz and 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.140
 here is the 95 that you see there but there's no 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.709
 absolutely nothing you can not spend 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.140
 so you know after this one 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.820
 let's go see, let's try the 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.120
 new animations of charm under by 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.120
 example 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.970
 now it does not arrive 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.970
 to see charm ande 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.440
 He is cured of all but we are going to 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.930
 heal me 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.230
 is supposed to throw mandery to pikachu what 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.460
 have changed a little bit the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.920
 bully gro I've seen doing a turn 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.410
 fire if I remember I'll put some small 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.030
 images 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.410
 they have there they have put two only two 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.410
 images so not much 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.659
 and it starts to be a little bit more 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.659
 advantage 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.980
 that yes remember I do not remember anything 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.400
 neither nor how to attack 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.950
 it jumps that they can all jump to 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.030
 that you know before I could not jump I think 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.569
 that arm themselves of the era of those who do not 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.569
 they can jump 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.050
 then we can see the camera I'm 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.060
 looking has new controls now 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.379
 during easier to move as you see no 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.129
 you see now that they follow me improves the 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.959
 pokemon and you can move the camera like this and 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.060
 I can move the with the credit but it is that 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.530
 I did not say it right click we turn the 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.530
 camera left click up and down 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.860
 it will look like scratch 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.480
 and this adware today just goes over 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.819
 is that I think they were put more 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.879
 distance because they have been put more 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.880
 distant but that no longer or is not going 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.800
 all right 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.440
 and I shot there look where it leads 2 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.920
 I do not have to throw here at least 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.920
 he threw him back 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.740
 oysters is that I guess it's worth having 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.990
 new animations and everything you 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.290
 you want and it's better I do not say it's 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.400
 bad but good 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.400
 it's twice as bad 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.820
 hit an embers I mean no play 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.820
 it is much easier to move it 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.150
 Over there 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.770
 come up with the classes but come on I have to 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.400
 point here 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.060
 well, we were not in the idea that 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.060
 has died 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.759
 it's not bad the new animations are 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.490
 well the combat is not eloquent 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.500
 moved also 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.180
 let's go to the lab since it would be 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.390
 the new thing I have not seen anything of what there is 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.980
 inside so it's new in new by me 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.790
 I'm not supposed to think there's anything 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.670
 basically only that we can enter 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.140
 here basically he imagined me 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.750
 because they have not said anything what there was 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.980
 inside this for sure then they will 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.620
 put other things that can fly 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.030
 pretty here in here, well, I think 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.920
 which is has been the patch in the 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.340
 next part will growl and I'll 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.080
 I will teach 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.210
 I've had enough problems to 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.280
 install this because well then you 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.460
 They catch me often and I've had it 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.380
 to delete in the folder and install it 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.650
 install it again you see that it does not take 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.880
 nothing but let's go 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:54.370
 well let's try to see 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.370
 the new swimming technique 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.659
 or take out pikachu 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.360
 a pattern is not that 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.660
 and I do not eat anything now squirt you're gürtel 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.060
 I did not swim before 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.670
 of that impact on so good and not 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.620
 embers enrique could already kill him after 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.530
 we have nothing equal 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.180
 my house moves super fast is very 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.020
 well it's getting better I like it 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.020
 let's exhaust them 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.560
 and that's good, well, I think so 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.860
 that has been all or nothing has not been 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.150
 the last 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.919
 and I think it 's all over now 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.719
 I hope you liked it and 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.650
 see you in the next video until the 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:52.650
 next and goodbye
