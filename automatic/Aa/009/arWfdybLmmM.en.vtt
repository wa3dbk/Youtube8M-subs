that
now<00:00:19.010> what<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> did<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> review

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
now what I did not do is make a review

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.630 
now what I did not do is make a review
of<00:00:22.289> my<00:00:22.380> Ensor<00:00:22.710> belt<00:00:22.920> because<00:00:23.279> pretty<00:00:23.550> much

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
of my Ensor belt because pretty much

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060 
of my Ensor belt because pretty much
every<00:00:24.480> YouTube<00:00:24.869> channel<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.380> has<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.769> UN

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
every YouTube channel that has the UN

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.710 
every YouTube channel that has the UN
Ensor<00:00:26.340> belt<00:00:26.519> has<00:00:26.730> done<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> review<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.539> they

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
Ensor belt has done a review and they

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
Ensor belt has done a review and they
all<00:00:27.840> pretty<00:00:28.080> much<00:00:28.230> say<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> same<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:28.949> so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
all pretty much say the same thing so

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
all pretty much say the same thing so
that's<00:00:29.910> why<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> did<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.660> make<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> review<00:00:31.170> of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that's why I did not make a review of

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.020 
that's why I did not make a review of
the<00:00:31.439> ins<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.710> belt<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.340> basically<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.910> reason

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the ins or belt so basically the reason

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.350 
the ins or belt so basically the reason
I<00:00:33.239> switch<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.200> my<00:00:34.440> Titan<00:00:34.860> lever<00:00:35.070> belt

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
I switch is because my Titan lever belt

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
I switch is because my Titan lever belt
essentially<00:00:36.360> went<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.559> thing<00:00:37.829> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
essentially went to that thing I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.830 
essentially went to that thing I
don't<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.730> if<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.210> because<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.660> was

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
don't know if it was because I was

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.900 
don't know if it was because I was
leaving<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.410> gym<00:00:40.680> bag<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.430> car<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
leaving it in my gym bag in my car and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.569 
leaving it in my gym bag in my car and
was<00:00:42.059> getting<00:00:42.270> hot<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.160> soft

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
was getting hot or what but it got soft

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.869 
was getting hot or what but it got soft
the<00:00:45.059> quality<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.789> was

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the quality was just not good and it was

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.580 
the quality was just not good and it was
just<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.180> providing<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> support<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
just not providing the support that it

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.520 
just not providing the support that it
should<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.399> lifting<00:00:51.059> belt<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> reason

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
should for a lifting belt now the reason

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.529 
should for a lifting belt now the reason
I<00:00:52.590> got<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.070> Titan<00:00:53.699> belt<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> first<00:00:54.270> place

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
I got the Titan belt in the first place

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.790 
I got the Titan belt in the first place
has<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> fact<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:55.770> just

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
has to do with the fact that it was just

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.099 
has to do with the fact that it was just
cheap<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.270> first<00:00:57.539> started<00:00:57.809> getting<00:00:57.899> into

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
cheap when I first started getting into

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.099 
cheap when I first started getting into
lifting<00:00:58.710> heavier<00:00:59.160> doing<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.989> squatting<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
lifting heavier doing more squatting and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
lifting heavier doing more squatting and
dead<00:01:01.289> lifting<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> kind<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> thing<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.940> was<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
dead lifting that kind of thing it was a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
dead lifting that kind of thing it was a
cheap<00:01:03.840> alternative<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.650> seemed<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> get

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
cheap alternative and it seemed to get

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.399 
cheap alternative and it seemed to get
ok<00:01:05.369> reviews<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.850> internet<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> didn't<00:01:07.260> have

squeeze<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.729> BET<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.420> can

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
squeeze this and the BET and I can

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.020 
squeeze this and the BET and I can
literally<00:01:40.020> touch<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.500> together<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.159> just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
literally touch it together it just

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.170 
literally touch it together it just
shows<00:01:42.390> how<00:01:42.560> crappy<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> mention

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
shows how crappy it is not to mention

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.690 
shows how crappy it is not to mention
the<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> lever<00:01:46.170> itself<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.340> chintzy

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the the lever itself is pretty chintzy

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.690 
the the lever itself is pretty chintzy
you'll<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.560> these<00:01:49.920> connections<00:01:50.549> are

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you'll see that these connections are

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.450 
you'll see that these connections are
kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.000> wack<00:01:51.420> every<00:01:52.079> once<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.500> while<00:01:52.649> this

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
kind of wack every once in a while this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.300 
kind of wack every once in a while this
little<00:01:53.759> plug<00:01:54.149> gets<00:01:54.990> gets<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.710> bit<00:01:55.860> messed<00:01:56.070> up

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
little plug gets gets a bit messed up

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.060 
little plug gets gets a bit messed up
right<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.380> it'll<00:01:58.560> come<00:01:58.770> out<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
right over here and it'll come out the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.020 
right over here and it'll come out the
bottom<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:01.130> overall<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.729> not

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
bottom so overall it's really just not

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.280 
bottom so overall it's really just not
that<00:02:03.689> thick<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:05.479> flimsy<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.990> said

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
that thick but it's flimsy like I said

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.139 
that thick but it's flimsy like I said
so<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.160> gonna<00:02:08.250> move<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:08.879> going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> show

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you guys the ins our belt it seems to be

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760 
you guys the ins our belt it seems to be
a<00:02:12.599> lot<00:02:12.780> thicker

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
a lot thicker

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.400 
a lot thicker
pretty<00:02:14.100> sure<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.850> tighten<00:02:15.180> belt

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
pretty sure that the tighten belt

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.810 
pretty sure that the tighten belt
claimed<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.740> 10-millimeter<00:02:17.190> belt<00:02:17.670> as

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
claimed to be a 10-millimeter belt as

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.710 
claimed to be a 10-millimeter belt as
well<00:02:17.850> though<00:02:18.710> side-by-side<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:20.480> it's<00:02:21.480> hard<00:02:21.660> to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
well though side-by-side it it's hard to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.250 
well though side-by-side it it's hard to
say

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
say

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.410 
say
it<00:02:22.320> seems<00:02:22.890> definitely<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.700> sturdy<00:02:24.000> that's

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
it seems definitely not as sturdy that's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.950 
it seems definitely not as sturdy that's
for<00:02:24.600> sure<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.100> ins<00:02:26.250> are<00:02:26.400> built<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.720> lever

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
for sure so the ins are built the lever

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.400 
for sure so the ins are built the lever
is<00:02:28.490> way<00:02:29.490> better<00:02:29.700> quality<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.600> never<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.230> any

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
is way better quality I never have any

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.280 
is way better quality I never have any
issues<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:31.920> always<00:02:32.280> very<00:02:32.550> secure<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.290> it's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
issues it's always very secure and it's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.320 
issues it's always very secure and it's
firm<00:02:34.710> this<00:02:35.040> thing<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.400> rock-solid

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
firm this thing is rock-solid

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.750 
firm this thing is rock-solid
so<00:02:36.840> I'm<00:02:37.140> squeezing<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.800> as<00:02:37.920> hard<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.520> lot

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
so I'm squeezing it as hard as a lot

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.100 
so I'm squeezing it as hard as a lot

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
harder than I was on the tighten belt

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.370 
harder than I was on the tighten belt
and<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.770> not<00:02:40.890> budging<00:02:41.070> right<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.570> I'll<00:02:43.170> show
