 1 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.280
 running water 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.620
 we are 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.230
 it's everyone I hope you 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.460
 okay I'm very happy kind of 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.439
 portrait the acts in this new 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.880
 video on in this regard this and today 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.240
 we'll get behind the wheel of a small 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.419
 fashion 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.750
 the nissan primera btcc these lines of 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.610
 cars that remains compatible with one 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.199
 of his latest updates of the bone 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.280
 is it again precisely because 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.480
 know that all modes and 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.100
 previous cars that I had been able 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.629
 add unfortunately they are not 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.920
 plus they are available it can be 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.600
 is driven by contains not at all 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.400
 without them having generated and this one 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.440
 is one of the few accessible 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.850
 and compatible with the latest update 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.769
 day is here today I will you the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.199
 present in flip stirs so you 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.220
 shows a little bit its external appearance 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.019
 where we obviously have the possibility 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.390
 to turn on the lights the wipers 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.500
 apparently do not answer the call 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.839
 of the ex-star she is more or less 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.869
 true to the real models so this is the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:12.400
 british tourism category btcc 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:16.090
 championship racing championship 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.060
 1 a championship car 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.280
 English passenger cars and by the way 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.070
 inside we notice at the level of 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.700
 flying we have a hell of a gap between his 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.530
 hands that's another milestone clearly less 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.530
 wild employer cd that is more or 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.190
 less complete with a time of chrono 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.420
 which will show the engine speed 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.000
 as for two speeds obviously the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.050
 amount of fuel 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.920
 so we will pilot it on this circuit 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.150
 the year a little bit that that little what 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.520
 it can give I made some laps 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.900
 just now a shot it goes through a 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.170
 well held one shot I tend to 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.240
 to survive the back tends to leave 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 as if I leave in wifi will also be 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.570
 accelerated 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.340
 but be careful it's really a 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.720
 story he no no 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.170
 settings that is imposed on this 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.660
 car 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.090
 I started the session directly 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.729
 with this car 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.740
 a raw setting on the other hand at the level of 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.450
 its slowed down weighs that I had said 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.450
 once we do is nothing 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.239
 really distinguishes no difference 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.910
 between the inside view and the outside view 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.600
 these eu exchanges with the sounds do not 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.600
 not change at all 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.540
 the whole rest 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.190
 I really think the horns free 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.360
 and the little green space that next to it 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.590
 you really have to dodge it so I have not 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.650
 still really taken but note 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.320
 finally my remarks but mark pardon 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.650
 at the braking zones there are 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.880
 has so much geek and with gt3 we 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.050
 was with the gt2 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.820
 and close with this it lasts a little 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.140
 little different especially that I tend 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.140
 regularly violating the waters 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.080
 so again thanks to all those 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.130
 who joined me 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.660
 Sunday in this online session will be 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.030
 this agreement without was behind on his 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.560
 circular it is very pleasant we have 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.660
 really deal with pros since 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.130
 honestly a new goal of the clock 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.490
 I struggled to do better always 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.750
 no new difference seconds 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.010
 it was really to garlin shared 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.990
 a lot of things and then we're dealing 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.060
 a month of professionals these wastes 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.250
 pleasure we will go to people who 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.330
 do it happen that she spoke mostly 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.890
 connects to a problem they are there for 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.590
 to be able to solve it was really 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.760
 very pleasant of a commercial having for 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.410
 this session was a first for 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.490
 me 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.400
 since I started my youtube channel 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.900
 I really have not the opportunity it 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.689
 to be able to make a meeting to define 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.069
 same time I already played with a subscriber 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.579
 from time to time and there this evening 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.280
 it was we were six if I remember 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.829
 it was really nice 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.129
 no immaturity no name is 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.109
 really exchanged because what delirium I 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.209
 think we'll do that it's his death under 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.910
 little for that I had indicated that 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.710
 I had a small video on a plate 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.120
 body without just to satisfy a 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.160
 maximum of people because some 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.720
 people were saying that I 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.130
 did not have enough ascetic and corsa 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.020
 and people prefer to this 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.810
 nobody tells you I'll try to 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.370
 please a maximum of people 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.050
 present is additional content 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.520
 like this mode that can be found on 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.190
 internet by the way it's still answers 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.780
 a comment from a person who is 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.530
 question why is that 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.389
 some people 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.460
 following the last update of 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.110
 dispose of this car and him because 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.449
 that just a flight in the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.800
 telegrams 13 you play it you my friend and 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.410
 then this accessible car 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.490
 directly by the hysteria of 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:05.070
 cars dassetto I would have written 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.750
 as well as nissan and then you over 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.680
 disappointed this will be the only one available on the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.000
 site we added the other but like 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.910
 grable to ride aside it's a 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.370
 oversteer and braking that for our 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.790
 problem needs it's going to be a 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.860
 not powerful car of Calais 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.180
 manageable it's not something that 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.150
 is a tale is that at the floor with the 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.230
 traction control disable most 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.370
 while drifting enough on bend 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.850
 was pretty much all the time 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.720
 important floor it remains stable this 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.000
 kind of car it's still 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.770
 nice to drive what it is not no 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.240
 plus something that has you so much 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.830
 can hardly walk that takes off his 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.000
 advertised quenching of cars that are 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.340
 exploitable Madior on steering is 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.930
 may have a little aggressive and these 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.410
 cars there if you find the right setting 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.570
 it really becomes atomic bombs 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.820
 good current back of the right pressure 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.850
 braking is clearly becoming a 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.960
 killer I think even with that one 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.960
 you can smoke a gt2 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.530
 here we did maybe two three 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:17.410
 tours because to show you a 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.250
 little bit this general license that 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.840
 you can discover 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.460
 we always see a little 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.670
 slip to port at the end of 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.600
 video 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.100
 I stalled alone you want a little 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.710
 little this discovery of that night sounds 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.180
 Award-winning fashion ranch because it's nice to 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.940
 hoping that all the other cars 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.910
 that never added make themselves available 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.320
 again so we can still enjoy 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.760
 additional content 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.650
 Feel free to leave a comment 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.150
 our opinion your impressions of this nissan 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.690
 primero precisely that you can what 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.490
 what do you think 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.660
 if you liked the video do not hesitate 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.490
 to leave a small lake do not hesitate 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.600
 also subscribe to my channel it's 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.160
 the lie understand I see again 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.520
 more people still me 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.140
 join 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.760
 we arrive very quickly very 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.310
 quickly I am a little bit 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.500
 less than 440 subscribers but there are some 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.850
 time I was still at 300 so that's 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.740
 true that it adds up very quickly 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.330
 and once again a big thank you to you 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.860

 back and actually on my last 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.800
 video we had a problem at the level of 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.170
 it was spoken very little my voice so 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.060
 that was it will be correct on this 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.290
 montage that I'm going to establish on this 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.700
 video so it remains for me to you 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.320
