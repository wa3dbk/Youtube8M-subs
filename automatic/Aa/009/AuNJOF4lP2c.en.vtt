00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the geforce GT 520 box which is just big

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
the geforce GT 520 box which is just big
enough<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> give<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.649> card<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.640> how

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
enough just to give it up card but how

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.330 
enough just to give it up card but how
much<00:00:44.910> taller<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.350> much<00:00:46.559> bigger<00:00:46.829> and

much taller it is so much bigger and
like<00:00:48.090> even<00:00:48.360> length<00:00:48.690> even<00:00:49.110> anyways<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.250> just

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520

so much taller let's get y'all's an
hour's<00:00:54.000> wait<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> new<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:56.010> line

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
hour's wait and get the new one in line

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
hour's wait and get the new one in line
so<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.899> gonna<00:00:57.989> try<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.859> my

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
so I'm gonna try and see if we do my

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.439 
so I'm gonna try and see if we do my
best<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.460> because<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.820> can't<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.120> see

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
best to do because I can't really see

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.200 
best to do because I can't really see
what<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.690> doing<00:01:00.930> right<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.090> see

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

the first thing you open up and there it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.160 
the first thing you open up and there it
is<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.119> grants<00:01:06.450> God<00:01:06.630> let's<00:01:06.840> turn<00:01:07.049> it

else with it I just grabbed this like

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.430 
else with it I just grabbed this like
them<00:02:11.030> come<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.900> we'll<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.110> let<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
them come in now so we'll just let the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.520 
them come in now so we'll just let the
Fox<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.130> side<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.840> fall<00:02:16.320> though

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
Fox to one side and then fall though

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.940 
Fox to one side and then fall though
right<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.450> there<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.810> there<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.680> actual

right so there it is there is the actual

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.770 
right so there it is there is the actual
graphics<00:02:20.580> code<00:02:20.850> itself<00:02:21.240> let's<00:02:21.450> go<00:02:21.570> ahead<00:02:21.630> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
graphics code itself let's go ahead and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.540 
graphics code itself let's go ahead and
pull<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.709> out<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.100> box<00:02:23.340> now<00:02:25.370> move<00:02:26.370> that

and<00:02:56.940> end<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.020> one<00:02:58.230> now<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:58.739> here<00:02:59.070> at

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and end this one now this one here at

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.580 
and end this one now this one here at
the<00:02:59.340> hdmi<00:02:59.940> this<00:03:00.209> one<00:03:00.360> here<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.630> DisplayPort

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the hdmi this one here is DisplayPort

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.300 
the hdmi this one here is DisplayPort
and<00:03:01.860> then<00:03:02.430> these<00:03:02.610> two<00:03:02.670> are<00:03:03.239> DVI<00:03:03.750> ports<00:03:04.410> both

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
and then these two are DVI ports both

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.780 
and then these two are DVI ports both
are<00:03:05.640> slightly<00:03:05.970> different<00:03:06.330> ones<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.790> there's

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
are slightly different ones so there's

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.539 
are slightly different ones so there's
the<00:03:08.970> graphics<00:03:09.360> card<00:03:09.660> itself<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.500> auto<00:03:10.830> focus

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
the graphics card itself a auto focus

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.370 
the graphics card itself a auto focus
there<00:03:11.820> we<00:03:11.970> go<00:03:12.150> one<00:03:12.390> more<00:03:12.510> time<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.989> can<00:03:13.140> see

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
there we go one more time you can see

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.539 
there we go one more time you can see
that<00:03:13.620> or<00:03:14.370> we<00:03:14.489> put<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.760> back<00:03:15.470> over<00:03:16.470> there<00:03:16.620> right
