 THE OLAPLEX TREATMENT 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.740
 Hi, my name is Slim, Vice President of Education for OLAPLEX 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.700
 and I'm here to tell you about one of the most common uses of the product: 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.580
 the treatment. We want to highlight that however it is not a moisturizing treatment, 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.359
 which normally wraps the hair with silicone, nor is it a protein treatment 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.490
 which can be excessive causing fragility and breakage. 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.800
 This unique molecule reconnects the broken bisulphide bridges in the hair 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 and restores strength, structure and integrity 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.070
 from the inside. You can use this treatment first, 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.989
 during and after operations to repair hair that has suffered chemical damage, 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.260
 mechanical and thermal. Let's start with an applicator bottle 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.960
 with 90 ml of water 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.699
 90 ml of water 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.100
 and 15 ml of OLAPLEX N ° 1 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.879
 Apply to hair, saturate and leave on for at least 5 minutes 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.100
 and without rinsing 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.250
 apply OLAPLEX N ° 2 from the roots to the ends. At this point leave to rest for 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.879
 at least 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.850
 10 minutes or more. Rinse, shampoo and conditioner as usual. 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.979
 Here to talk about your personal experience with OLAPLEX Treatment 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.470
 we have Justin Anderson of the salon Chris McMillan 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.210
 of Beverly Hills. Hey I'm Justin Anderson of the Chris McMillan's salon of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740
 Beverly Hills California. This particular client of mine always had to do 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.190
 with dry and damaged hair and it was even worse when they were colored, 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.940
 seemed to respond to color in different ways, they always seemed dry, dry, 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.940
 very "poor". So we did the treatment, left in place by the 10 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.950
 around 20 minutes. 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.149
 When she returned the next time her hair problems had vanished 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.869
 Maybe we were afraid of making some mistakes instead when 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.930
 she came back to the salon and told us that her hair was so gorgeous last time. 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.350
 That was the first time I thought: ok maybe something is really happening 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.620
 incredible here.
