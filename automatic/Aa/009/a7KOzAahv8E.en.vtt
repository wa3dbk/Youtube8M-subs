00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
plays the fact that he still has a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.590 
plays the fact that he still has a
little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> room<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.090> grow<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.390> he<00:00:48.480> has<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
little bit of room to grow if he has a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.319 
little bit of room to grow if he has a
good<00:00:48.780> season<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:50.129> he's<00:00:50.280> also<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.149> good

as javale mcgee already so i think he's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.510 
as javale mcgee already so i think he's
a<00:00:54.090> pretty<00:00:54.360> solid<00:00:54.719> center<00:00:55.289> also<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
was the best way to get him interested

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.990 
was the best way to get him interested
in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> team<00:01:28.829> without<00:01:28.979> breaking<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> bank<00:01:29.640> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
in the team without breaking the bank I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.460 
in the team without breaking the bank I
still<00:01:30.210> wanted<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> keep<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.900> cap<00:01:31.200> space

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.839 
but hopefully it's still good enough
because<00:04:22.560> that's<00:04:22.919> really<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.190> only<00:04:23.280> one<00:04:23.700> that

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
because that's really the only one that

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.610 
because that's really the only one that
i<00:04:23.880> could<00:04:24.090> find<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.419> i<00:04:24.510> had<00:04:24.750> any<00:04:24.990> semblance<00:04:25.380> of

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
i could find that i had any semblance of

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.940 
i could find that i had any semblance of
respect<00:04:25.979> for

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
respect for

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.400 
respect for

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410

another thing that you know for the most

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.720 
another thing that you know for the most
part<00:05:08.200> not<00:05:08.770> a<00:05:08.800> lot<00:05:09.040> of<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.220> guys<00:05:09.280> want<00:05:09.610> to

Dwight<00:05:09.910> Howard<00:05:10.440> made<00:05:11.440> many<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:11.980> wanted<00:05:12.220> to

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
Dwight Howard made many of you wanted to

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.710 
Dwight Howard made many of you wanted to
move<00:05:12.460> on<00:05:12.670> because<00:05:12.910> that<00:05:13.210> was<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.420> whole<00:05:13.540> point

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
move on because that was the whole point

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.060 
move on because that was the whole point
of<00:05:13.840> this<00:05:13.930> series<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.470> that's<00:05:14.530> why<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:14.770> kind<00:05:15.040> of

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
of this series and that's why I kind of

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.130 
of this series and that's why I kind of
tend<00:05:15.340> to<00:05:15.520> agree<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.180> now<00:05:16.660> we're<00:05:16.840> in<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:16.960> good

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
tend to agree and now we're in a good

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.660 
tend to agree and now we're in a good
spot<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.650> know<00:05:17.740> we<00:05:17.890> really<00:05:18.040> are<00:05:18.340> I<00:05:18.370> mean<00:05:18.460> the

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
spot you know we really are I mean the

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.850 
spot you know we really are I mean the
team<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.090> overall<00:05:19.510> team<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.170> we<00:05:20.590> moved

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
team the overall team is that we moved

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.920 
team the overall team is that we moved
from<00:05:21.040> like<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.280> 60-something<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.330> I<00:05:22.600> think<00:05:22.690> a

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
from like a 60-something to I think a

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.350 
from like a 60-something to I think a
high<00:05:23.140> a<00:05:23.440> low<00:05:23.740> 80<00:05:24.010> something<00:05:24.580> because<00:05:25.150> we<00:05:25.270> have

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
high a low 80 something because we have

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.570 
high a low 80 something because we have
a<00:05:25.420> lot<00:05:25.600> of<00:05:25.630> depth<00:05:25.990> now<00:05:26.260> and<00:05:26.590> our<00:05:27.100> best<00:05:27.280> player

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
a lot of depth now and our best player

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.490 
a lot of depth now and our best player
used<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:27.940> be<00:05:28.060> here<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:28.300> Afflalo<00:05:28.540> but<00:05:29.290> now<00:05:29.440> we

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
used to be here and Afflalo but now we

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.680 
used to be here and Afflalo but now we
have<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:29.830> lot<00:05:30.220> of<00:05:30.250> players<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.700> are<00:05:30.910> over<00:05:31.270> 70

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
have a lot of players that are over 70

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.690 
have a lot of players that are over 70
overall<00:05:32.080> I<00:05:32.320> think<00:05:32.620> Patty<00:05:32.980> Mills<00:05:33.220> is<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.580> only

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
overall I think Patty Mills is the only

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.360 
overall I think Patty Mills is the only
guy<00:05:33.880> hits<00:05:34.180> like<00:05:34.330> under<00:05:34.630> 70<00:05:35.050> overall<00:05:35.380> and<00:05:36.340> he's

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
guy hits like under 70 overall and he's

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.670 
guy hits like under 70 overall and he's
a<00:05:36.640> guy<00:05:36.910> that<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.720> know<00:05:37.810> will<00:05:38.050> go<00:05:38.200> up<00:05:38.440> with

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
a guy that you know will go up with

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.940 
a guy that you know will go up with
chemistry<00:05:39.490> increases<00:05:40.120> now<00:05:41.080> there's<00:05:41.770> not

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
chemistry increases now there's not

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.830 
chemistry increases now there's not
really<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.310> lot<00:05:42.460> of<00:05:42.580> guys<00:05:42.700> I<00:05:42.850> want<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.420> get<00:05:43.630> with
