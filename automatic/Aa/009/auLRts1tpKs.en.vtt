recession sectioning this top area off I

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.729 
recession sectioning this top area off I
am<00:00:32.750> going<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:33.020> be<00:00:33.110> working<00:00:33.469> horizontally

across but I need to section the top

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.250 
across but I need to section the top
section<00:00:37.640> first<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.420> make<00:00:38.570> sure<00:00:38.629> that<00:00:38.929> I<00:00:38.960> have

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
section first to make sure that I have

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.500 
section first to make sure that I have
the<00:00:39.410> wave<00:00:39.620> pushing<00:00:40.429> back<00:00:40.609> in<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.210> direction

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
the wave pushing back in the direction

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.930 
the wave pushing back in the direction
that<00:00:41.749> I<00:00:41.899> want<00:00:42.170> it

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.670 

it's<00:00:47.630> really<00:00:47.840> important<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.500> pay<00:00:48.650> attention

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
it's really important to pay attention

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.790 
it's really important to pay attention
to<00:00:49.550> where<00:00:50.000> your<00:00:50.210> place<00:00:50.420> intersection<00:00:51.170> because

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
to where your place intersection because

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.680 
to where your place intersection because
it's<00:00:52.130> going<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.310> have<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.610> biggest<00:00:52.820> impact<00:00:53.420> on

it's going to have the biggest impact on

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.110 
it's going to have the biggest impact on
to<00:00:54.520> where<00:00:55.520> your<00:00:55.760> wave<00:00:55.970> is<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.450> sit<00:00:56.780> ah<00:01:01.120> ha

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
right side because it's going to send

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.930 
right side because it's going to send
little<00:01:08.869> asymmetrically<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:10.040> left<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.640> bottom

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
little asymmetrically I left the bottom

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.370 
little asymmetrically I left the bottom
out<00:01:11.119> because<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.900> first<00:01:12.140> section

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
out because this is the first section

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.020 
out because this is the first section
that<00:01:12.650> I'm<00:01:12.740> going<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:12.979> crawl<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.670> next

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
that I'm going to crawl this next

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.210 
that I'm going to crawl this next
section<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.600> going<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.869> be<00:01:15.050> set<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.680> go<00:01:15.830> back

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
section is going to be set to go back

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.830 
section is going to be set to go back
away<00:01:16.610> from<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.940> face<00:01:17.119> which<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.630> going<00:01:17.780> to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
away from the face which is going to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.930 
away from the face which is going to
create<00:01:18.050> a<00:01:18.140> little<00:01:18.290> bit<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.710> buckle<00:01:19.160> right<00:01:19.790> up

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
create a little bit of a buckle right up

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.060 
create a little bit of a buckle right up
in<00:01:20.090> here<00:01:20.420> I'm<00:01:20.630> coming<00:01:21.110> in<00:01:21.229> with<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.410> cross<00:01:21.770> stick

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
in here I'm coming in with a cross stick

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.460 
in here I'm coming in with a cross stick
making<00:01:22.880> sure<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.420> really<00:01:23.720> heat<00:01:23.960> up<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.229> room

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
making sure to really heat up the room

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.620 
making sure to really heat up the room
because<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.490> route<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.910> where<00:01:26.149> most<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.539> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
because the route is where most of the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.150 
because the route is where most of the
movement<00:01:27.080> inside<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.500> wave<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:27.950> going<00:01:28.009> to

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
movement inside the wave is going to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.790 
movement inside the wave is going to
come<00:01:28.220> from<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:29.080> then<00:01:30.080> just<00:01:30.320> wrapping<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
come from and then just wrapping the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.999 
come from and then just wrapping the
hair<00:01:30.979> around<00:01:31.039> flat<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.270> that's<00:01:32.960> one<00:01:33.229> thing

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
hair around flat and that's one thing

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.190 
hair around flat and that's one thing
that's<00:01:34.250> important<00:01:34.880> about<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.780> looks<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.080> we

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
that's important about the looks that we

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.499 
that's important about the looks that we
saw<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.500> Oscars<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.820> we<00:01:37.910> wrap<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.300> hair

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
saw the Oscars is that we wrap the hair

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.630 
saw the Oscars is that we wrap the hair
around<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:39.050> curling<00:01:39.110> iron<00:01:39.500> flat<00:01:39.920> instead<00:01:40.580> of

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
around the curling iron flat instead of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.420 
around the curling iron flat instead of
letting<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:41.030> twist

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:52.310 

and<00:01:44.240> just<00:01:44.480> pin<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:45.220> flat<00:01:46.220> against<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.700> scalp

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.340 

this<00:01:53.320> section<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.250> last<00:01:54.550> section<00:01:55.120> on<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
this section is the last section on the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.310 
this section is the last section on the
left<00:01:56.710> side<00:01:56.980> that<00:01:57.190> I'm<00:01:57.310> curling<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.320> this

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
left side that I'm curling and this

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.650 
left side that I'm curling and this
section<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.980> being<00:02:00.190> curled<00:02:00.580> towards<00:02:01.330> her<00:02:01.480> face

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
section is being curled towards her face

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.350 
section is being curled towards her face
so<00:02:02.230> we're<00:02:02.440> still<00:02:02.680> alternating<00:02:03.460> from<00:02:04.090> what<00:02:04.270> we

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
so we're still alternating from what we

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.620 
so we're still alternating from what we
did<00:02:04.540> underneath<00:02:05.820> also<00:02:06.820> I'm<00:02:07.060> making<00:02:07.390> sure<00:02:07.600> that

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
did underneath also I'm making sure that

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.960 
did underneath also I'm making sure that
when<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.020> clip<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.680> section<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.820> it's

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
when I clip this section that it's

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.610 
when I clip this section that it's
dropped<00:02:10.360> down<00:02:10.570> a<00:02:10.630> little<00:02:10.899> bit<00:02:11.140> because<00:02:11.380> I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
dropped down a little bit because I

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.230 
dropped down a little bit because I
don't<00:02:11.830> want<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.130> create<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.640> lot<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:12.970> volume

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
don't want to create a lot of volume

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.110 
don't want to create a lot of volume
through<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.840> top<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:15.460> want<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.670> make<00:02:15.790> sure

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
through the top I just want to make sure

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.550 
through the top I just want to make sure
that<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> lay<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> little<00:02:17.440> bit

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
that it's going to lay a little bit

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.230 
that it's going to lay a little bit
flatter<00:02:17.860> from<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> top<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:18.790> move<00:02:19.060> into

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
flatter from the top and just move into

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.780 
flatter from the top and just move into
a<00:02:19.390> little<00:02:19.630> bit<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.870> softer<00:02:20.230> way<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:21.610> working

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
a little bit of a softer way I'm working

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.670 
a little bit of a softer way I'm working
with<00:02:22.120> my<00:02:22.150> Bhatia's<00:02:22.750> hairspray

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
with my Bhatia's hairspray

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.890 
with my Bhatia's hairspray
it's<00:02:24.160> going<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> give<00:02:24.520> me<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> nice<00:02:25.000> medium<00:02:25.630> hold

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
it's going to give me a nice medium hold

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.480 
it's going to give me a nice medium hold
but<00:02:26.350> it's<00:02:26.590> still<00:02:26.770> gonna<00:02:26.920> let<00:02:27.160> her<00:02:27.220> hang<00:02:27.400> or

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
but it's still gonna let her hang or

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.090 
but it's still gonna let her hang or
being<00:02:27.790> workable<00:02:28.300> afterwards<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.260> still<00:02:29.920> keep

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
being workable afterwards and still keep

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.040 
being workable afterwards and still keep
a<00:02:30.160> little<00:02:30.400> bit<00:02:30.550> of<00:02:30.670> bounce<00:02:31.030> into<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:31.840> really

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
a little bit of bounce into it so really

thermal scent that is going to create

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.950 
thermal scent that is going to create
the<00:02:43.030> soft<00:02:43.590> kind<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.710> red<00:02:44.920> carpet<00:02:45.340> wave<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:46.780> to

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
the soft kind of red carpet wave just to

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.990 
the soft kind of red carpet wave just to
recap<00:02:47.440> what<00:02:47.830> we<00:02:47.980> did<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.490> we<00:02:48.520> started

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
recap what we did is we started

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.440 
recap what we did is we started
horizontal<00:02:49.750> sections<00:02:50.200> in<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.500> very<00:02:50.710> bottom

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
horizontal sections in the very bottom

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.430 
horizontal sections in the very bottom
curling<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.540> hair<00:02:52.570> in<00:02:52.810> alternating

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
curling the hair in alternating

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.370 
curling the hair in alternating
direction<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.220> each<00:02:54.550> section<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:56.230> is

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
direction in each section so that is

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.630 
direction in each section so that is
actually<00:02:56.770> what's<00:02:56.920> going<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.100> create<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.489> wave

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
actually what's going to create the wave

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.870 
actually what's going to create the wave
pattern<00:02:58.090> moving<00:02:58.390> forward<00:02:58.780> making<00:02:59.110> sure<00:02:59.290> to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
pattern moving forward making sure to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.960 
pattern moving forward making sure to
also<00:03:01.470> pay<00:03:02.470> attention<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.190> root<00:03:03.489> movement

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
also pay attention to the root movement

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.340 
also pay attention to the root movement
because<00:03:04.510> that's<00:03:04.660> actually<00:03:05.020> what's<00:03:05.170> going<00:03:05.320> to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
because that's actually what's going to

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.870 
because that's actually what's going to
push<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.770> hair<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.130> direction<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.640> you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
push the hair in the direction that you

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.000 
push the hair in the direction that you
want<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.270> move<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.660> blend<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.620> out<00:03:08.770> now<00:03:08.950> I'm

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
want it to move in blend it out now I'm

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.530 
want it to move in blend it out now I'm
just<00:03:09.220> going

just going
Kliff<00:03:09.870> each<00:03:10.170> curl<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.189> just<00:03:11.549> kind<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.819> let<00:03:11.939> it

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969

way back I'm going to brush out all of
our<00:03:20.730> curls<00:03:21.540> which<00:03:22.200> can<00:03:22.409> sometimes<00:03:22.739> be<00:03:22.950> a

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
our curls which can sometimes be a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.490 
our curls which can sometimes be a
little<00:03:23.969> bit<00:03:24.120> scary<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.170> think<00:03:25.379> they

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
little bit scary because you think they

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.190 
little bit scary because you think they
might<00:03:25.650> not<00:03:25.799> come<00:03:26.040> back<00:03:26.220> but<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.720> set<00:03:28.079> it

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
might not come back but if you set it

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.569 
might not come back but if you set it
properly<00:03:28.230> though<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.159> curls<00:03:29.430> will

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
properly though the curls will

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.550 
properly though the curls will
definitely<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.090> able<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.480> pop<00:03:31.019> back<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.409> there

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
definitely be able to pop back in there
