00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.360
 Many nights 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.900
 I watched you sleep 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.940
 I watched you sleep 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.960
 I tried your resistance 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.400
 But the subject got deeper 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.260
 And deeper 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.640
 And when you are beside me 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.860
 I still feel you are far away 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.420
 But I miss you 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.420
 My soul is dark and I take the night 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.940
 (Take the night) 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.240
 But you are the angel who showed me the light 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.100
 Arini Light 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.680
 I try to be stronger 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.500
 But I miss you 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.380
 Look at your heart 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.640
 He discovered my self 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 But I can not 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.560
 To be part of your world 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.160
 I need you 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.660
 But can not get out to you 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.920
 As if we were different worlds 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.940
 If you need me 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.100
 Look at your heart 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.760
 I was able to be a monster 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.800
 I'm bleeding for you 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.280
 (I'm bleeding for you) 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.860
 And I saw love with you 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.820
 I did not know him before 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.960
 (I did not know him) 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.800
 I will take all the blame 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.120
 My life has become a disgrace 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.360
 But I miss you 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.360
 Do not wait for me 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.120
 Do not wait for me, girl 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.320
 I will never be 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.080
 Part of your world 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.880
 But I will stay with your heart 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.160
 forever 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.360
 Look at your heart 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.660
 He discovered my self 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.220
 But I will never be 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.180
 Part of your world 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.180
 I need to 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.540
 I can not get out to you 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.520
 We were different worlds 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.280
 If you need me 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.840
 Look at your heart 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.320
 Look at your heart and discover my self 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.560
 (Myself) 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.460
 But I will not be part of your world, I will not be part of your world 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.340
 I need you 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.340
 I will not be able to reach you 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.720
 I will not be able to reach you sweetie, we are different worlds 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.780
 I can not reach you
