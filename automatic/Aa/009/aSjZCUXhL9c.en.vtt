00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
world now depending on your computer and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.740 
world now depending on your computer and
honor<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.590> may<00:00:40.860> take<00:00:41.160> some<00:00:41.399> time<00:00:41.460> I've<00:00:42.059> found

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
honor this may take some time I've found

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
honor this may take some time I've found
that<00:00:42.930> sometimes<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.620> tends<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.399> take<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> while

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that sometimes it tends to take a while

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.799 
that sometimes it tends to take a while
but<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.739> kind<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.070> worth<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.719> this

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
but it is kind of worth it for what this

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.110 
but it is kind of worth it for what this
might<00:00:49.020> actually<00:00:49.110> does<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.910> wait<00:00:51.090> for

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
might actually does so just go wait for

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.189 
might actually does so just go wait for
it<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.480> build<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.320> world<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.090> are

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
buildings so I suppose there's gonna be

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.500 
buildings so I suppose there's gonna be
some<00:03:01.860> out<00:03:01.980> there<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.220> are<00:03:02.340> very<00:03:02.430> hard<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
some out there that are very hard to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.820 
some out there that are very hard to
find<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.870> all<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.080> sort<00:03:04.350> stuff<00:03:04.470> right<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
find and all that sort stuff right and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.000 
find and all that sort stuff right and
as<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.400> imagine<00:03:06.590> see<00:03:07.590> there's<00:03:07.770> food

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
as you can imagine see there's food

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.150
