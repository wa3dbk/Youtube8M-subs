usually people do when they get this is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.370 
usually people do when they get this is
that<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:28.100> FD<00:02:28.550> 5<00:02:28.790> milliliters<00:02:29.480> meanwhile<00:02:30.080> they

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
that the FD 5 milliliters meanwhile they

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.730 
that the FD 5 milliliters meanwhile they
you<00:02:30.950> know<00:02:31.070> bite<00:02:31.700> drop<00:02:32.030> by<00:02:32.210> drop<00:02:32.590> shaking<00:02:33.590> this

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
you know bite drop by drop shaking this

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.980 
you know bite drop by drop shaking this
one<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.220> don't<00:02:34.400> need<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.670> do<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:35.030> let<00:02:35.960> me

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
one but you don't need to do that let me

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.190 
one but you don't need to do that let me
just<00:02:36.050> put<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:37.840> you're<00:02:38.840> going<00:02:39.050> to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
just put it in like this you're going to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.170 
just put it in like this you're going to
get<00:02:39.380> just<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:39.890> second<00:02:40.190> repeating<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.970> one's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
get just a second repeating this one's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.540 
get just a second repeating this one's
moving<00:02:41.420> great<00:02:42.250> as<00:02:43.250> your<00:02:43.580> words<00:02:43.880> before<00:02:45.460> so<00:02:46.460> we

moving great as your words before so we

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.910 
moving great as your words before so we
understand<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.300> accept<00:02:47.750> me<00:02:47.960> 0.5<00:02:48.500> million

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
understand and accept me 0.5 million

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.630 
understand and accept me 0.5 million
years<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:51.410> don't<00:02:51.590> want<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:51.950> be<00:02:52.070> shaking<00:02:52.520> it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
years you don't want to be shaking it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.020 
years you don't want to be shaking it
like<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:54.020> want<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.550> gently<00:02:55.550> swirl

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
like this you want to gently swirl

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.090 
like this you want to gently swirl
around<00:02:56.270> like<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:56.870> because<00:02:57.380> if<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.920> do

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
around like this because if you just do

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.410 
around like this because if you just do
it<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.370> other<00:02:58.400> way<00:02:58.640> you're<00:02:59.000> going<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.270> get

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
it the other way you're going to get

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.150 
it the other way you're going to get
more<00:02:59.600> inaccurate<00:02:59.959> readings<00:03:00.530> which<00:03:00.800> is<00:03:00.950> not<00:03:01.130> a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
more inaccurate readings which is not a

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.840 
more inaccurate readings which is not a
good<00:03:01.340> thing<00:03:02.050> but<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.110> just<00:03:03.320> do<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.890> you

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
good thing but you just do this and you

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.750 
good thing but you just do this and you
want<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.270> it<00:03:05.360> for<00:03:05.510> 30<00:03:05.690> seconds<00:03:06.730> usually<00:03:07.730> I

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
want to do it for 30 seconds usually I

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.310 
want to do it for 30 seconds usually I
just<00:03:07.820> shake<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.480> little<00:03:08.510> bit<00:03:08.870> more<00:03:09.080> than

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
just shake it a little bit more than

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.190 
just shake it a little bit more than
that<00:03:09.440> because<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.980> doesn't<00:03:10.280> hurt<00:03:11.050> just<00:03:12.050> like

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
that because it doesn't hurt just like

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.010 
that because it doesn't hurt just like
that<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.190> what<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.430> want<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.640> do<00:03:13.850> now<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.480> that

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
just get a half millimeter of this extra

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.380 
just get a half millimeter of this extra
and<00:04:06.439> warning<00:04:06.859> that<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.099> don't<00:04:07.340> need<00:04:07.579> you're

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
stuff here and the oxide on this test I

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.800 
stuff here and the oxide on this test I
will<00:04:21.079> of<00:04:21.380> course<00:04:21.620> be<00:04:21.940> cleaning<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.030> glass<00:04:23.150> so

will of course be cleaning the glass so

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.560 
will of course be cleaning the glass so
it's<00:04:24.199> ready<00:04:24.590> for<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.860> next<00:04:24.949> round<00:04:25.849> you<00:04:26.240> know
