00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.960
 the conventional vespa brand works quite independently and is 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.750
 responsible for the quality of his own work 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.010
 He must not only be accurately quality-conscious and problem-solving 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.899
 to be 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:14.069
 but he must also be able to handle his colleagues well 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.679
 in the machining department where work is done with conventional 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.779
 so not computer-controlled turning and milling machines 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.060
 he receives an explanation from a supervisor about the drawing 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.060
 the drawing shows exactly what must be made 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.540
 in this case it is a tube that can be turned on the outside 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.019
 the personal toolbox is packed 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.430
 but everything that he needs for his daily work 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
 managing this is completely nonsense 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.260
 exactly how much can be measured with a digitally readable caliper 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.139
 material and removed from the tube 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:53.139
 machined 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.860
 three claws are fixed in the claw plate to later be the tube 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.850
 able to capture 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 the cloud is locked with a pin 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.290
 the understood that sets the chisels members to zero degrees 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.090
 he does this because a straight piece has to be turned 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.770
 after he has placed the center he sets the chisel at the correct height 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.930
 if he would not do so the quality of the surface of the tube 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.480
 becoming less 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.500
 the tube is fixed with a chuck key 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.840
 because it is a fairly long tube, it must be supported at the front with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.560
 the rotating center 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.620
 this is now confirmed in the loose head of the lathe 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.500
 the tube so different by the enormous machining power of the chisel from the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.750
 cloud shoot 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.280
 after it is properly positioned on the machine and safety 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.290
 players set up replaces the coolant add 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.470
 which consists of a combination of water and oil 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.730
 it must ensure that the material and the pond are not forgotten 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.200
 After spraying, the drawing is run over to the correct dimensions 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.650
 to check 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.780
 then a final measurement on the product to see if everything is accurate 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.749
 is right 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.369
 after that, of course, the workplace still needs cleaning and the tools 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.369
 be stored in the right place in the toolbox 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.150
 cleaning the floor is also important newspaper, of course you do 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.579
 put on safety shoes but you can get rid of metal splinters and the 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.289
 coolant left on the floor 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.969
 for proper maintenance, the oil should bathe at the same level about once a month 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.649
 are held 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.189
 after work it is good to rest 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.500
 especially with nice colleagues
