00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.660
 out 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.670
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.560
 another courage concept here 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.869
 j채gerhof tv my name is g체nther kuhn 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.720
 and i want you the car today 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.020
 tractor version 1.5 introduce one 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.540
 another murder of bidens also auto 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.520
 combine has written and is acting 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.270
 it's not just a script here 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.399
 the threshing controls but also 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.110
 tractors for example with group or 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.260
 very machines or fertilizer machines 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.030
 the control is relatively similar to 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.490
 button 5 call the overlay car cared 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.320
 info to help out 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.030
 you can see below the buttons are too 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.760
 again knows the same many of them 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.610
 which he already wants from only a few 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.700
 few additional features here 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.059
 enter and there are here to 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.640
 for example, the possibility of the tractor too 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.100
 say he is finally over the field 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.850
 should drive out and then turn 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.820
 should or within the field 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.950
 already being started over 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.229
 is there still the possibility here 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.229
 to close a so-called Vorgel채nde 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.299
 So if working widths of the devices 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.430
 wider than for example the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.890
 vehicle length then you can tell them 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.800
 you can already do a few meters now 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.610
 start burning before and there 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.700
 or falls completely then gives 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.430
 here is the type of turning maneuver 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.030
 in this case, for example, one should 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.360
 turn then straight back and then 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.150
 forward again in the next lane of the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.760
 In this case he should have one 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.800
 so-called loop drive so should one 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.200
 Take a circle and drive out 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.490
 then back in the loop and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 There is one more function 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.750
 it does not appear here at gruber 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.360
 because I fall everything in bows so drives 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.270
 quasi out of the field 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.160
 Turn in a bow and elbow 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.100
 back again I have this here 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.490
 prepared for the body and that was 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.440
 just drive the field there 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.580
 you can see it's the tick season 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.600
 vomit vigorously size of the field and 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:35.230
 so then the possibility 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.710
 we want to work here at the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.770
 location 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.100
 that it end once on the field also 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.100
 heart 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.440
 and you see 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.990
 here too 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.990
 absolutely clean work 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.140
 and then let's have a look 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.430
 what it looks like when it arrives at the end 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.430
 here he corrects a bit 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.050
 if it does not because he will be on the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.629
 return automatically the right side 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.400
 switch again 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.550
 So use the right side of the sensor 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.150
 to make that mistake again 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.150
 correct 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:30.370
 so now we have arrived at the end and 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.080
 looks sr he turns turns so misunderstood 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.260
 You can do more in a loop 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.260
 Not 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.060
 drive backwards 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.790
 and of course the sign rent well 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.330
 if you fall in the way 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.280
 since the kommune hellwig one has seen 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.280
 now refunded in time 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.270
 the group 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.960
 and drives now almost 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.670
 Sensor is on the right side 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.950
 no swerve he does 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.080
 now automatically again 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.490
 to make up for this mistake again 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.020
 a great script by bidens link 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.480
 of course, there is also murder again 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.860
 here in the video presentation 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.989
 otherwise I will stay with Beatles 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.870
 Sincerely for the two great mods of 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.500
 Auto combine and car tractor a whole 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.270
 good work 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.690
 Here we work in the singleplayer 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.870
 very happy with and also from time to time 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.830

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.360
 Thank you for today 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.830
 watch if you liked it 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.940
