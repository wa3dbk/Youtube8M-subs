s4 is going to have a 5-inch display so

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.610 
s4 is going to have a 5-inch display so
it's<00:02:27.420> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.630> move<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:27.900> from<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> galaxy's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's going to move up from the galaxy's

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.040 
it's going to move up from the galaxy's
three<00:02:28.980> from<00:02:29.670> four<00:02:29.850> point<00:02:30.030> eight<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.480> five<00:02:30.780> inch

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
three from four point eight to five inch

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.780

that kind of sucks because you can't
remove<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.890> battery<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> batter<00:02:50.700> else<00:02:50.940> is

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
remove the battery so the batter else is

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.779 
battery and then when you do a lot of
things<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.659> can<00:05:22.810> use<00:05:22.960> cortex<00:05:23.380> a15<00:05:24.039> so<00:05:24.639> right

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
things it can use cortex a15 so right

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.309 
things it can use cortex a15 so right
now<00:05:24.849> something<00:05:25.419> is<00:05:25.479> there<00:05:25.659> in<00:05:25.840> their<00:05:25.990> galaxy

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
now something is there in their galaxy

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.740 
now something is there in their galaxy
loss<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.800> using<00:05:27.190> cortex<00:05:27.490> a9<00:05:27.789> so<00:05:28.150> quite<00:05:28.449> a<00:05:28.599> few

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
loss is using cortex a9 so quite a few

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.360 
loss is using cortex a9 so quite a few
things<00:05:28.960> kind<00:05:29.409> of<00:05:29.470> twice<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.220> performance

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
things kind of twice the performance

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.890 
things kind of twice the performance
there<00:05:30.909> and<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.650> GPU<00:05:33.130> can<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:34.570> know<00:05:34.690> we

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
there and so the GPU can I you know we

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.210 
there and so the GPU can I you know we
don't<00:05:34.990> know<00:05:35.169> right<00:05:35.199> now<00:05:35.409> but<00:05:35.860> they're<00:05:36.099> driven

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
don't know right now but they're driven

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.210 
don't know right now but they're driven
320gb<00:05:37.030> of<00:05:37.270> course<00:05:37.570> in<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.930> HTC<00:05:38.320> One<00:05:38.530> same<00:05:39.099> as

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
320gb of course in the HTC One same as

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.899 
320gb of course in the HTC One same as
with<00:05:39.250> love<00:05:39.610> other<00:05:39.849> high-end<00:05:40.300> smartphones<00:05:41.169> and

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
with love other high-end smartphones and

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.279 
with love other high-end smartphones and
so<00:05:42.909> when<00:05:43.300> we<00:05:43.330> go<00:05:43.509> down<00:05:43.750> now<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.169> bottom

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
so when we go down now to the bottom

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.070 
so when we go down now to the bottom
also<00:05:44.680> rumors<00:05:45.400> Potter<00:05:45.580> battery<00:05:45.940> is<00:05:46.090> 2600

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
also rumors Potter battery is 2600

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.709 
also rumors Potter battery is 2600
milliamp<00:05:47.199> battery<00:05:47.409> on<00:05:47.949> the<00:05:48.070> galaxy<00:05:48.430> s4<00:05:48.759> and<00:05:49.000> I

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
milliamp battery on the galaxy s4 and I

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:50.939 
milliamp battery on the galaxy s4 and I
think<00:05:49.930> something's<00:05:50.320> been<00:05:50.469> doing<00:05:50.889> a<00:05:50.919> really

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
think something's been doing a really

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.219 
think something's been doing a really
good<00:05:51.219> job<00:05:51.280> at<00:05:51.759> keeping<00:05:51.820> a<00:05:52.419> high<00:05:52.570> battery<00:05:52.990> here

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
good job at keeping a high battery here

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.350 
good job at keeping a high battery here
and<00:05:53.740> usually<00:05:54.070> HTC<00:05:54.430> has<00:05:54.550> been<00:05:54.729> having<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.150> lower

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
and usually HTC has been having a lower

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.620 
and usually HTC has been having a lower
battery<00:05:55.740> compared<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.860> something<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:57.490> so<00:05:58.360> it

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
battery compared to something and so it

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.469 
battery compared to something and so it
sounds<00:05:58.870> so<00:05:59.259> HTC<00:05:59.710> One<00:05:59.949> is<00:06:00.190> having<00:06:00.669> to<00:06:00.789> 300

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
sounds so HTC One is having to 300

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.379 
sounds so HTC One is having to 300
million<00:06:01.659> battery<00:06:02.250> so<00:06:03.250> I<00:06:03.699> mean<00:06:04.000> when<00:06:04.180> we<00:06:04.270> look

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
million battery so I mean when we look

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:05.999 
million battery so I mean when we look
at<00:06:04.479> these<00:06:04.630> specs<00:06:05.020> it<00:06:05.440> doesn't<00:06:05.770> really<00:06:05.830> feel

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
at these specs it doesn't really feel

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.120 
at these specs it doesn't really feel
that<00:06:06.780> there's<00:06:07.780> not<00:06:07.930> that<00:06:07.990> much<00:06:08.409> different<00:06:08.889> if

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
that there's not that much different if

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.290 
that there's not that much different if
they're<00:06:09.340> going<00:06:09.430> to<00:06:09.520> use<00:06:09.669> the<00:06:09.789> same<00:06:09.969> kind<00:06:10.150> of

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
they're going to use the same kind of

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.779 
they're going to use the same kind of
chips<00:06:10.570> it<00:06:10.810> and<00:06:11.080> cpu<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:11.889> GPU<00:06:11.919> and<00:06:12.490> all<00:06:12.550> that

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
chips it and cpu and GPU and all that

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.060 
chips it and cpu and GPU and all that
and<00:06:13.150> you'll<00:06:13.990> really<00:06:14.289> be<00:06:14.409> interesting<00:06:14.860> to<00:06:14.949> see

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
and you'll really be interesting to see

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.980 
and you'll really be interesting to see
how<00:06:15.099> this<00:06:15.430> year<00:06:16.000> will<00:06:16.300> come<00:06:16.479> out<00:06:16.599> and<00:06:16.810> how<00:06:16.930> the

how this year will come out and how the

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.629 
how this year will come out and how the
galaxy<00:06:17.440> s4<00:06:17.710> will<00:06:17.889> look<00:06:18.039> like<00:06:18.190> and<00:06:18.340> of<00:06:18.430> course

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
galaxy s4 will look like and of course

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.820 
galaxy s4 will look like and of course
we<00:06:18.759> will<00:06:18.820> see<00:06:19.150> those<00:06:19.449> things<00:06:19.750> at<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.620> unveil
