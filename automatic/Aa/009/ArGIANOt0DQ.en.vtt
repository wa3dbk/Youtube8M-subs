00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
wanted to duplicate it I'd put something

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.059 
wanted to duplicate it I'd put something
really<00:01:48.030> cool<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:49.020> ox1<00:01:49.469> and<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.799> wanted<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
really cool into ox1 and we wanted to

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.160 
really cool into ox1 and we wanted to
duplicate<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.609> on<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> channels<00:01:51.659> that's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
duplicate it on all the channels that's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.319 
duplicate it on all the channels that's
available<00:01:52.469> so<00:01:52.859> i<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.159> switch<00:01:53.369> program<00:01:54.090> one

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
available so i can switch program one

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.410 
available so i can switch program one
two<00:01:54.750> three<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:55.229> four<00:01:55.469> all<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> aux<00:01:56.340> 1<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.359> i

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
two three and four all the aux 1 so i

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.669 
two three and four all the aux 1 so i
can<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.719> different<00:01:57.869> fades<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.500> have

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
can do different fades and have

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.249 
can do different fades and have
different<00:01:59.030> DJ<00:02:00.030> styles<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.509> techniques<00:02:00.659> by

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
different DJ styles and techniques by

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.289 
different DJ styles and techniques by
using<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.679> oxygen<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.250> way<00:02:02.459> the<00:02:03.179> other

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
using the oxygen that way the other

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.760 
using the oxygen that way the other
really<00:02:03.509> interesting<00:02:03.599> thing<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.469> mixer

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
really interesting thing about the mixer

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.150 
really interesting thing about the mixer
is<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.450> supports<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.569> 22<00:02:07.170> channel<00:02:07.619> sound<00:02:07.859> card

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
is it supports a 22 channel sound card

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.630 
is it supports a 22 channel sound card
via<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> USB<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.679> plug<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.099> here<00:02:11.430> this

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
via a USB so when you plug in here this

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.509 
via a USB so when you plug in here this
is<00:02:11.790> half<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.239> 68<00:02:12.780> performance<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.620> we're

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
is half of the 68 performance and we're

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.580 
is half of the 68 performance and we're
supporting<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:15.180> zealand<00:02:15.720> core<00:02:15.900> audio<00:02:16.170> drivers

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
supporting a zealand core audio drivers

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.830 
supporting a zealand core audio drivers
we<00:02:17.250> had<00:02:17.370> drivers<00:02:17.760> custom-made<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.390> are<00:02:18.720> very

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
we had drivers custom-made that are very

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.110 
we had drivers custom-made that are very
low<00:02:19.079> latent<00:02:19.470> latency<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.579> went<00:02:20.790> very<00:02:21.000> very

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
low latent latency that went very very

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.839 
low latent latency that went very very
well<00:02:21.360> with<00:02:21.690> many<00:02:21.959> other<00:02:22.319> DJ<00:02:22.829> programs<00:02:23.280> we

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
well with many other DJ programs we

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.280 
well with many other DJ programs we
realize<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.299> there<00:02:24.420> are<00:02:24.450> some<00:02:24.690> DJ's<00:02:25.049> who

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
realize that there are some DJ's who

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.470 
realize that there are some DJ's who
already<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.670> software<00:02:27.090> program<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
already have a software program that

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.180 
already have a software program that
they<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.349> they<00:02:28.379> mobile<00:02:28.829> want<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.160> a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
they like and they mobile want to have a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.949 
they like and they mobile want to have a
nice<00:02:29.400> new<00:02:29.610> control<00:02:30.000> surface<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.480> use<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
nice new control surface to use it and

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.710 
nice new control surface to use it and
the<00:02:31.410> MP<00:02:31.739> 25<00:02:32.220> does<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:32.910> them<00:02:33.060> we're

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the MP 25 does that for them we're

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.240 
the MP 25 does that for them we're
running<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.109> with<00:02:34.140> Ableton<00:02:34.769> next<00:02:35.040> door

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
running it with Ableton next door

running it with Ableton next door
Ableton<00:02:35.760> makes<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.060> great<00:02:36.269> program<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:37.319> can

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
Ableton makes a great program you can

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.589 
Ableton makes a great program you can
run<00:02:37.680> four<00:02:37.950> channels<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.519> Ableton<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
run four channels of Ableton on the

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.569 
run four channels of Ableton on the
mixer<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.109> simultaneously<00:02:40.859> be<00:02:41.069> recording

the sport

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.780 
the sport
in<00:02:42.959> fact<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> mixer<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:43.739> record<00:02:44.099> up<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.400> 12

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
in fact the mixer will record up to 12

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.030 
in fact the mixer will record up to 12
channels<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.780> playback<00:02:46.260> 10

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
you have a great mixing machine that can

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.470 
you have a great mixing machine that can
also<00:02:50.079> be<00:02:50.230> used<00:02:50.650> as<00:02:51.129> a<00:02:51.219> production<00:02:51.489> tool<00:02:51.849> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
also be used as a production tool the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.640 
also be used as a production tool the
other<00:02:52.599> thing<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.989> all<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> control<00:02:53.620> surfaces

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
other thing is all the control surfaces

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.280 
other thing is all the control surfaces
are<00:02:54.280> MIDI<00:02:54.489> mappable<00:02:54.849> so<00:02:55.540> if<00:02:55.659> you<00:02:55.810> want<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.140> take

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
are MIDI mappable so if you want to take

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.729 
are MIDI mappable so if you want to take
this<00:02:56.439> box<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.040> use<00:02:57.549> it<00:02:57.730> with<00:02:58.260> another<00:02:59.260> program

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
this box and use it with another program

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.199 
this box and use it with another program
that<00:02:59.769> supports<00:03:00.040> mini<00:03:00.459> mapping<00:03:00.849> it's<00:03:00.969> very

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
that supports mini mapping it's very

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.870 
that supports mini mapping it's very
simple<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.599> do<00:03:01.870> with<00:03:02.439> the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
simple to do with the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.570 
simple to do with the
