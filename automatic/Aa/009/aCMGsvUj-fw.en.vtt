00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.290 
possibly for a really complicated or
intricate<00:00:38.749> pattern<00:00:39.730> kind<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.789> like<00:00:40.910> this<00:00:41.089> one

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
intricate pattern kind of like this one

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.819 
intricate pattern kind of like this one
here<00:00:41.749> I<00:00:41.870> mean<00:00:42.050> it's<00:00:42.199> not<00:00:42.320> horribly

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
here I mean it's not horribly

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.090 
here I mean it's not horribly
complicated<00:00:43.249> but<00:00:44.239> I<00:00:44.480> don't<00:00:44.989> add<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:45.649> I<00:00:45.890> don't

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
complicated but I don't add and I don't

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.160 
complicated but I don't add and I don't
count<00:00:46.339> very<00:00:46.579> well<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.269> sometimes<00:00:47.839> I<00:00:47.989> lose

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
count very well so sometimes I lose

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.369 
count very well so sometimes I lose
stitches<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.120> will<00:00:50.659> and<00:00:50.960> having<00:00:51.289> a

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
stitches and this will and having a

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.189 
stitches and this will and having a
lifeline<00:00:51.769> will<00:00:51.980> actually<00:00:52.429> help<00:00:52.999> me<00:00:53.239> from

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
lifeline will actually help me from

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.779 
lifeline will actually help me from
having<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.620> start<00:00:55.069> all<00:00:55.249> the<00:00:55.519> way<00:00:55.579> back<00:00:55.760> down

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
having to start all the way back down

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.950 
having to start all the way back down
here<00:00:56.210> at<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.390> beginning<00:00:57.670> so<00:00:58.670> but<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.629> method

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
here at the beginning so but the method

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.509 
here at the beginning so but the method
that<00:01:00.050> I'm<00:01:00.229> going<00:01:00.499> to<00:01:00.589> use<00:01:00.829> for<00:01:01.100> putting<00:01:01.339> in<00:01:01.429> my

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
that I'm going to use for putting in my

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.009 
that I'm going to use for putting in my
lifeline<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.179> probably<00:01:02.569> a<00:01:02.659> little<00:01:02.839> different

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
lifeline is probably a little different

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.719 
lifeline is probably a little different
than<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.649> ones<00:01:03.859> that<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.220> might<00:01:04.370> have<00:01:04.489> heard

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
than the ones that you might have heard

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.640 
than the ones that you might have heard
about<00:01:05.000> or<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:06.470> know<00:01:06.590> have<00:01:06.950> learned<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.820> do<00:01:08.060> and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
about or you know have learned to do and

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.310 
about or you know have learned to do and
that<00:01:09.650> is<00:01:09.979> rather<00:01:10.729> than<00:01:11.090> use<00:01:11.360> like<00:01:11.899> a<00:01:11.930> tapestry

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
that is rather than use like a tapestry

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.039 
that is rather than use like a tapestry
needle<00:01:12.680> or<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.880> large<00:01:14.950> like<00:01:16.509> embroidery<00:01:17.509> needle

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
needle or a large like embroidery needle

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.270 
needle or a large like embroidery needle
and<00:01:18.399> some<00:01:19.399> yarn<00:01:20.180> or<00:01:20.630> thread<00:01:20.950> I'm<00:01:21.950> actually

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
and some yarn or thread I'm actually

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.940 
and some yarn or thread I'm actually
going<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:23.030> use<00:01:24.009> another<00:01:25.009> set<00:01:25.549> of<00:01:25.610> needles<00:01:26.060> and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
going to use another set of needles and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950 
going to use another set of needles and
you<00:01:27.950> can<00:01:28.130> see<00:01:28.310> this<00:01:28.460> needle<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.390> obviously

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
you can see this needle is obviously

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.490 
you can see this needle is obviously
considerably<00:01:30.909> smaller<00:01:31.960> than<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.170> ones<00:01:33.380> that

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
considerably smaller than the ones that

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.080 
considerably smaller than the ones that
I'm<00:01:33.680> actually<00:01:33.890> knitting<00:01:34.430> on<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:34.880> my<00:01:35.659> wire<00:01:35.960> I

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
I'm actually knitting on and my wire I

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.789 
I'm actually knitting on and my wire I
know<00:01:38.090> it's<00:01:38.299> not<00:01:38.450> really<00:01:38.719> thinner<00:01:38.930> but<00:01:39.200> this

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
know it's not really thinner but this

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.370 
know it's not really thinner but this
whole<00:01:40.009> process<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.270> needle<00:01:41.869> itself<00:01:42.140> is

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
whole process is the needle itself is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.289 
whole process is the needle itself is
actually<00:01:42.829> thinner<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:45.560> inside<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.670> work<00:01:47.090> of

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
actually thinner so I inside the work of

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.700 
actually thinner so I inside the work of
a<00:01:47.689> cold<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.409> laryngitis<00:01:49.450> soft<00:01:50.450> eye<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.710> make

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
a cold and laryngitis soft eye to make

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.950 
a cold and laryngitis soft eye to make
this<00:01:51.890> playful<00:01:52.460> okay<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:53.240> what<00:01:53.719> you're<00:01:53.810> going

all your stitches threaded and I
actually<00:02:21.220> chose<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.730> point<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.709> this

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
actually chose a point here in this

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.949 
actually chose a point here in this
project<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.330> been<00:02:25.510> giving<00:02:25.810> me<00:02:25.930> a

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
project that have been giving me a

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.320 
project that have been giving me a
little<00:02:26.140> bit<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.410> trouble<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.209> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
little bit of trouble and it's just the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.750 
little bit of trouble and it's just the
same<00:02:28.569> two<00:02:28.959> rows<00:02:29.620> over<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.099> over<00:02:30.340> again<00:02:30.430> but

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
same two rows over and over again but

you can see it's right under here and
you're<00:03:16.150> knitting<00:03:16.380> because<00:03:17.380> you've<00:03:17.560> got<00:03:17.709> a

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
you're knitting because you've got a

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.949 
you're knitting because you've got a
cable<00:03:18.040> through<00:03:18.489> here<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.940> not<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.420> know<00:03:19.450> like

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
cable through here and not you know like

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.259 
cable through here and not you know like
a<00:03:19.989> really<00:03:20.380> thin<00:03:20.890> piece<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.220> yarn<00:03:21.670> or<00:03:22.030> another

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
a really thin piece of yarn or another

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.949 
a really thin piece of yarn or another
piece<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.540> thread<00:03:24.359> it<00:03:25.359> might<00:03:25.570> feel<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.810> little

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
piece of thread it might feel a little

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.960 
piece of thread it might feel a little
tight<00:03:26.470> but<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.799> think<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.250> like<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:27.700> better

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
tight but I think I like this better

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.860 
tight but I think I like this better
because<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.560> would<00:03:29.890> be<00:03:29.920> afraid<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.870> actually

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
because I would be afraid of actually

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.009 
because I would be afraid of actually
knitting<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.290> lifeline<00:03:33.269> if<00:03:34.269> it's<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.630> piece

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
knitting that lifeline if it's a piece

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.530 
knitting that lifeline if it's a piece
of<00:03:35.200> yarn<00:03:35.380> or<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.620> piece<00:03:35.799> of<00:03:35.950> thread<00:03:36.190> up<00:03:36.400> in<00:03:36.730> to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
of yarn or a piece of thread up in to

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.340 
of yarn or a piece of thread up in to
the<00:03:37.570> project<00:03:37.900> which<00:03:38.500> would<00:03:38.829> be<00:03:38.950> my<00:03:39.130> luck<00:03:40.350> so

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
the project which would be my luck so

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.080 
the project which would be my luck so
like<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.590> said<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.799> like<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.459> option<00:03:42.700> better

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
like I said I like this option better

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.849 
like I said I like this option better
because<00:03:43.480> this<00:03:43.660> cable<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.200> here<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.590> it's

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
because this cable is here and it's

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.349 
because this cable is here and it's
going<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.280> be<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> little<00:03:45.700> more<00:03:45.790> difficult<00:03:46.269> to

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
going to be a little more difficult to

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.500 
going to be a little more difficult to
knit<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.870> cable<00:03:47.440> up<00:03:47.650> into<00:03:48.609> your<00:03:48.730> project<00:03:49.299> so
