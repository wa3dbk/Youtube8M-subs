everything that's going on so yeah these
three<00:03:21.330> views<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.769> open<00:03:23.190> application<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.000> are

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
three views the open application you are

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.229 
three views the open application you are
the<00:03:24.269> multitasking<00:03:24.959> view<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:26.459> events<00:03:26.790> feed

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
the multitasking view the events feed

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.220 
the multitasking view the events feed
and<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:28.380> application<00:03:28.920> Creed<00:03:29.690> are<00:03:30.690> actually<00:03:31.200> a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
and the application Creed are actually a

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.710 
and the application Creed are actually a
really<00:03:31.920> nice<00:03:32.160> way<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.459> handling<00:03:32.820> everything

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
really nice way of handling everything

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.660 
really nice way of handling everything
that<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.110> need<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.410> do<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.739> your<00:03:34.860> device<00:03:35.220> and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
that you need to do with your device and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.150 
that you need to do with your device and
the<00:03:36.180> cool<00:03:36.390> thing<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.720> for<00:03:37.650> example<00:03:38.070> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
the cool thing is that for example the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.580 
the cool thing is that for example the
events<00:03:38.580> feed<00:03:38.910> i<00:03:39.209> would<00:03:39.420> say<00:03:39.630> compares<00:03:40.380> to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
events feed i would say compares to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.390 
events feed i would say compares to
let's<00:03:40.799> say<00:03:41.010> four<00:03:41.580> or<00:03:42.079> five<00:03:43.079> different

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
let's say four or five different

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.770 
let's say four or five different
applications<00:03:44.400> on<00:03:44.670> other<00:03:44.850> devices<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.720> you

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
applications on other devices so you

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.800 
applications on other devices so you
don't<00:03:46.019> need<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.489> spend<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:47.730> much<00:03:47.880> time<00:03:47.940> opening

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
don't need to spend so much time opening

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.960 
don't need to spend so much time opening
and<00:03:48.989> closing<00:03:49.170> applications<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:50.280> just

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
and closing applications you can just

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.560 
and closing applications you can just
have<00:03:51.120> them<00:03:51.150> everything<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:51.989> one<00:03:52.200> stream<00:03:52.590> and

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
have them everything in one stream and

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.690 
have them everything in one stream and
these<00:03:54.570> three<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.200> get<00:03:55.350> these<00:03:56.100> three<00:03:56.430> views

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
these three to get these three views

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.270 
these three to get these three views
together<00:03:57.120> are<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.930> very<00:03:58.380> intuitive<00:03:58.950> way<00:03:59.100> of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
together are a very intuitive way of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.800 
together are a very intuitive way of
handling<00:03:59.459> your<00:03:59.670> device<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.329> makes<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.750> very

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
handling your device it makes it very

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.740 
handling your device it makes it very
easy<00:04:01.370> very<00:04:02.370> addictive<00:04:03.060> at<00:04:03.209> at<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.390> same<00:04:03.570> time

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
easy very addictive at at the same time

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.039 
easy very addictive at at the same time
very<00:04:03.900> powerful<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.400> think<00:04:05.670> using<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.870> mobile

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
very powerful so I think using a mobile

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.030 
very powerful so I think using a mobile
phone<00:04:07.500> has<00:04:07.799> never<00:04:08.340> been<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:09.269> fun<00:04:09.650> with<00:04:10.650> done
