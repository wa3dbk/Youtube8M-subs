00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.399 
little wrist strap should we want to use
this<00:02:17.719> for<00:02:18.500> sort<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.959> supporting<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.049> camera

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
this for sort of supporting the camera

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.080 
this for sort of supporting the camera
so<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.680> don't<00:02:21.920> drop<00:02:22.159> it<00:02:22.189> when<00:02:22.730> we're<00:02:22.879> out<00:02:22.969> and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so we don't drop it when we're out and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.690 
so we don't drop it when we're out and
about<00:02:23.170> now<00:02:24.170> let's<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.829> take<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.189> out<00:02:25.459> so

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.539 
camera but still quite chunky at the
same<00:02:36.319> time<00:02:36.590> but<00:02:36.829> it's<00:02:36.950> definitely<00:02:37.129> small

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
will be putting this up against the

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.930 
will be putting this up against the
rx100<00:04:51.260> mark<00:04:51.740> 3<00:04:52.040> which<00:04:52.310> i'll<00:04:52.460> just<00:04:52.640> briefly

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
rx100 mark 3 which i'll just briefly

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.880 
rx100 mark 3 which i'll just briefly
bring<00:04:53.360> into<00:04:53.600> shop<00:04:53.810> just<00:04:54.320> so<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:54.530> can<00:04:54.650> see<00:04:54.860> a

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
bring into shop just so you can see a

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.300 
bring into shop just so you can see a
size<00:04:55.190> comparison<00:04:55.480> very<00:04:56.480> similar<00:04:57.140> sizes<00:04:57.440> as

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
size comparison very similar sizes as

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.340 
size comparison very similar sizes as
you<00:04:58.460> can<00:04:58.610> see<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.030> width<00:04:59.300> is<00:04:59.510> pretty<00:04:59.960> much<00:05:00.140> the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
you can see the width is pretty much the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.650 
you can see the width is pretty much the
same<00:05:00.530> with<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.310> 60<00:05:01.670> VB<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.180> a<00:05:02.240> little<00:05:02.540> bit

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
same with the 60 VB and a little bit

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.750 
same with the 60 VB and a little bit
bigger<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.140> then<00:05:03.200> if<00:05:03.710> we<00:05:03.830> look<00:05:03.980> top<00:05:04.250> down<00:05:04.520> you

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
bigger and then if we look top down you

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.540 
bigger and then if we look top down you
can<00:05:05.330> see<00:05:05.540> they're<00:05:05.750> pretty<00:05:06.080> identical<00:05:06.950> sizes

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
can see they're pretty identical sizes

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.930 
can see they're pretty identical sizes
in<00:05:08.440> relative<00:05:09.440> terms<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:09.980> know<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.280> actually

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
in relative terms you know the actually

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.770 
in relative terms you know the actually
the<00:05:11.060> rx100<00:05:11.510> mark<00:05:11.930> 3<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.650> a<00:05:13.100> lot<00:05:13.520> heavier<00:05:13.970> but<00:05:14.750> a

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
the rx100 mark 3 is a lot heavier but a

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.100 
the rx100 mark 3 is a lot heavier but a
tiny<00:05:15.260> bit<00:05:15.560> more<00:05:15.710> compact<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:17.330> this<00:05:17.630> being<00:05:17.870> a

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
tiny bit more compact so this being a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.500 
tiny bit more compact so this being a
metal<00:05:18.650> body<00:05:18.890> and<00:05:19.160> this<00:05:19.580> being<00:05:19.910> primarily

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
metal body and this being primarily

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.050 
metal body and this being primarily
plastic<00:05:21.110> so<00:05:21.920> that's<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.340> for<00:05:22.610> this<00:05:22.730> video<00:05:23.000> I

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
plastic so that's it for this video I

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.610 
plastic so that's it for this video I
hope<00:05:23.120> you've<00:05:23.360> enjoyed<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.660> please<00:05:24.050> do<00:05:24.350> look

out for my video sample test I'll

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.840 
out for my video sample test I'll
probably<00:05:27.620> use<00:05:27.860> this<00:05:28.010> in<00:05:28.160> one<00:05:28.190> of<00:05:28.310> my<00:05:28.400> daily
