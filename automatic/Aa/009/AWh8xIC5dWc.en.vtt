in<00:00:04.250> my<00:00:05.250> last<00:00:05.520> theory<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.000> discussed<00:00:06.480> how<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
in my last theory I discussed how the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.600 
in my last theory I discussed how the
player<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.470> lead<00:00:07.740> protagonist<00:00:08.010> of

generation 3 Brandon destroyed Wally's
confidence<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.610> continue<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.150> fight<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.630> is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
confidence to continue the fight this is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.539 
confidence to continue the fight this is
pretty<00:00:13.049> obvious<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:13.620> there<00:00:14.219> were<00:00:14.340> some

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
pretty obvious but there were some

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.640 
pretty obvious but there were some
subjective<00:00:14.820> elements<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> hand<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
subjective elements to it hand as the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.010 
subjective elements to it hand as the
comments<00:00:17.130> section<00:00:17.460> did<00:00:17.670> suggest<00:00:18.240> perhaps<00:00:18.480> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
comments section did suggest perhaps it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.439 
comments section did suggest perhaps it
was<00:00:19.260> Brendan<00:00:19.800> who<00:00:19.980> helped<00:00:20.340> Wally<00:00:20.760> start<00:00:21.240> his

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
was Brendan who helped Wally start his

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.000 
was Brendan who helped Wally start his
adventure<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.109> Brendan<00:00:22.529> who<00:00:22.740> ultimately

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
adventure and Brendan who ultimately

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.759 
adventure and Brendan who ultimately
helped<00:00:23.880> Wally<00:00:24.150> train<00:00:24.630> harder<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.109> get<00:00:25.470> strong

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
helped Wally train harder and get strong

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.560 
helped Wally train harder and get strong
and<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.340> good<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.670> appreciate<00:00:27.000> when

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and that is good I appreciate when

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.599 
and that is good I appreciate when
people<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.050> add<00:00:28.230> plausible<00:00:28.890> possibilities

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
people can add plausible possibilities

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.580 
people can add plausible possibilities
to<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:29.910> theory<00:00:30.150> however<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.869> thing<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.260> skimmed

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to my theory however one thing I skimmed

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500 
to my theory however one thing I skimmed
over<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:32.099> Wally<00:00:32.369> sickness<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
over was Wally sickness and this is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.330 
over was Wally sickness and this is
mainly<00:00:33.750> due<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.440> lack<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.829> evidence<00:00:35.010> but

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
mainly due to the lack of evidence but

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.280 
mainly due to the lack of evidence but
why<00:00:35.760> not<00:00:35.969> let's<00:00:36.210> take<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.450> look<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.020> stay

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
why not let's take a look at it stay

evidence<00:03:39.819> for<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:40.569> falling<00:03:41.260> Wally<00:03:41.590> on

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
evidence for this is falling Wally on

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.309 
evidence for this is falling Wally on
the<00:03:42.010> hones<00:03:42.220> news<00:03:42.849> network<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.720> looking<00:03:44.200> at

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
the hones news network and looking at

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.770 
the hones news network and looking at
the<00:03:44.440> names<00:03:44.680> on<00:03:44.890> statues<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:45.849> this<00:03:46.060> means<00:03:46.360> Wally

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
the names on statues so this means Wally

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.009 
the names on statues so this means Wally
would<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.530> had<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.130> go<00:03:48.400> extremely<00:03:49.209> fast<00:03:49.630> keep

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
would have had to go extremely fast keep

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.569 
would have had to go extremely fast keep
up<00:03:50.170> with<00:03:50.319> Brendon<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.769> though<00:03:51.010> we<00:03:51.250> do<00:03:51.430> not

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
up with Brendon and though we do not

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.120 
up with Brendon and though we do not
have<00:03:52.000> any<00:03:52.360> official<00:03:52.780> can<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.440> timeline<00:03:53.920> it

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
have any official can and timeline it

took<00:03:54.370> Brendan<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.090> beat<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.450> Hoenn<00:03:55.660> league<00:03:55.690> we

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
took Brendan to beat the Hoenn league we

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.860 
took Brendan to beat the Hoenn league we
can<00:03:56.560> estimate<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.489> wasn't<00:03:58.000> very<00:03:58.239> long<00:03:58.390> as

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
can estimate that it wasn't very long as

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.020 
can estimate that it wasn't very long as
he<00:03:59.049> never<00:03:59.200> needs<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.739> sleep<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.430> game<00:04:00.610> can

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
he never needs to sleep and the game can

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.400 
he never needs to sleep and the game can
be<00:04:01.060> completed<00:04:01.599> in<00:04:01.750> less<00:04:01.870> than<00:04:02.230> eight<00:04:02.380> hours

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
be completed in less than eight hours

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.860 
be completed in less than eight hours
now<00:04:02.890> excuse<00:04:03.400> me<00:04:03.579> for<00:04:03.819> being<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:04.209> skeptical

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
now excuse me for being so skeptical

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.140 
now excuse me for being so skeptical
that<00:04:04.900> Armour<00:04:05.349> skeptic<00:04:06.069> would<00:04:06.340> be<00:04:06.489> proud<00:04:06.730> but

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
that Armour skeptic would be proud but

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.710 
that Armour skeptic would be proud but
that<00:04:07.599> seems<00:04:08.140> an<00:04:08.530> extremely<00:04:09.489> short<00:04:09.880> time<00:04:10.209> for

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
that seems an extremely short time for

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.750 
that seems an extremely short time for
