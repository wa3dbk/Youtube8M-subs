the owner shadow there you go yes so she

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.999

Lightner um L'Oreal L'Oreal
okay<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.380> biggest<00:02:10.590> thing<00:02:10.830> is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
okay and I think the biggest thing is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.699 
okay and I think the biggest thing is
that<00:02:11.039> she<00:02:11.400> kind<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.140> brought<00:02:13.140> back<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
that she kind of brought back like the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.589 
that she kind of brought back like the
full<00:02:13.950> foil<00:02:14.280> again<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.970> we've<00:02:15.209> been<00:02:15.300> doing<00:02:15.540> a

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
full foil again so we've been doing a

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.640 
full foil again so we've been doing a
lot<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.840> balayage<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.810> kind<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.840> wanted<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.260> go

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
lot of balayage and kind of wanted to go

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.710 
lot of balayage and kind of wanted to go
totally<00:02:19.950> lighter<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.730> she<00:02:20.790> actually<00:02:21.239> did<00:02:21.569> like

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
totally lighter so she actually did like

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.280 
totally lighter so she actually did like
a<00:02:21.780> full<00:02:22.340> full<00:02:23.340> foil<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.959> what<00:02:25.080> was<00:02:25.200> that

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
older shampoos used to do I think that

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.960 
older shampoos used to do I think that
I've<00:05:41.320> got<00:05:41.500> another<00:05:41.710> tip<00:05:42.010> is<00:05:42.190> we<00:05:42.669> don't<00:05:42.790> ever

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
I've got another tip is we don't ever

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.400 
I've got another tip is we don't ever
rush<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:44.229> processing<00:05:44.979> time<00:05:45.510> and<00:05:46.510> the<00:05:47.050> key<00:05:47.260> to

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
rush the processing time and the key to

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.200 
rush the processing time and the key to
that<00:05:47.440> is<00:05:47.830> we<00:05:48.340> we<00:05:48.820> are<00:05:48.970> big<00:05:49.419> on<00:05:49.630> olaplex<00:05:50.290> so

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
that is we we are big on olaplex so

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.670 
that is we we are big on olaplex so
leaving<00:05:52.210> leaving<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:53.050> on<00:05:53.140> for<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.500> full

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
leaving leaving it on for the full

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.680 
leaving leaving it on for the full
process<00:05:53.950> is<00:05:54.310> good<00:05:54.550> but<00:05:55.830> damage<00:05:56.830> is<00:05:56.979> not<00:05:57.160> so<00:05:57.690> the

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
process is good but damage is not so the

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.570 
process is good but damage is not so the
olaplex<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.350> key<00:05:59.530> and<00:05:59.770> somebody<00:06:00.250> asked<00:06:00.490> your

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580
