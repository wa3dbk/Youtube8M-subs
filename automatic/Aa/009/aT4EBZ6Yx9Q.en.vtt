00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.120
 youtube as you can see we are already in a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.469
 new information video the truth is 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.539
 that this video is focused for that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.820
 community that is just starting in 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.920
 the call of duty box and who cares or 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.890
 he gives a lot of importance to call al kiel 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.499
 ratio and wing ratio the truth is that a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.939
 a personal point the truth is that to me 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.279
 I do not care what the ratio and erwin 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.779
 I'm so good, but because I 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.880
 they have been asking and I want them 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.730
 help since this channel is going to focus 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.770
 that to help 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.570
 heat players and ticos good at 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.850
 this time you can explain quickly 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.100
 as a way you get this proportion of 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.449
 x ratio basically for giving an example 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.730
 if you max after 15 15 players and you 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.559
 kill 5 times you have to look for a 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.690
 number that multiplied that result 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.930
 for example in this case it would be 3 % equal 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.730
 to 15 so all ratio would be 3 and it 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.010
 applies the same for some ratio so 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.100
 basically that way you learn the proportion 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.470
 and we start with the types so that I 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.200
 we always recommend you go starting 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.270
 if you are interested in raising your proportion more or 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.070
 you want to keep your proportion so 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.320
 I do not recommend hard corn island versus 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.590
 clan since it becomes very difficult to win 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.270
 the games if you play alone and apart from 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.509
 that you can around difficult afternoons of 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.789
 do a result so we started with 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.640
 infected the truth is that the infected 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.320
 I highly recommend this mode and if 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.690
 you're just starting since here you 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.370
 can give different weapons and you go 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.650
 knowing how it works 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.750
 then I recommend it basically 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.360
 because I prefer you to play here 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.030
 infected of freely change here not 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.860
 It is frowned upon to change here that cafes 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.180
 example on face that by virtue have 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.250
 others so I recommend and why 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.230
 advantage of this that if you play it it is 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.790
 that if one hundred times you will have 100 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.130
 victories it is now that you can never 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.920
 to lose 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.360
 just touch you once in 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.189
 games that you lose but in the truth 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.289
 very difficult to lose so you always 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.490
 van will give you victories and already in the 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.590
 proportion of equis ratio because 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.410
 It's up to you if you kill or not kill like that 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.660
 I 'm going to start and I'm going to talk 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.849
 about the types so that I 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.380
 I recommend those I do not recommend, I do not 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.560
 I'm going to mention them so they do not 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.150
 lengthen the video and another type so that 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.160
 I recommend this in the match the truth 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.800
 is that they misunderstand you if you find yourself 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.780
 to the players so to speak 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.370
 they just are starting so if 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.890
 It's just starting, so I recommend you 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.270
 this way since you will find 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.240
 players of your level 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.550
 and basically give him some advice 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.190
 to attend machi kraken which is the other 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.350
 modality that I recommend for the kiel 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.810
 ratio that the ratio would focus me more on 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.230
 indec max and I think that to stop I do not know how 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.260
 will tell you and for the wing ratio I 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.690
 I would focus infected already on these 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.180
 depends on the team having neither 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.460
 you guys play very well 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.800
 nothing now the news now or the 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.510
 defeat so here's the same now 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.670
 I'll talk a bit more about crack in the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.380
 I really have to stop for 30 seconds 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.340
 every time you get a low so 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.769
 it is very important 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.720
 I also recommend 'free float' in 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.959
 question of casualty ratio since 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.900
 here you will always get at least one 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.459
 2.0 of cris ratio the truth is that I 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.500
 before he played at the beginning of carl 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.019
 objectives when I just do not buy it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.299
 I played quite this so that's why it's 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.540
 I have enough that I can say that 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.439
 I have the level 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.090
 of standard ratio so to speak 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.129
 that's good, I recommend it already 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.819
 it's up to you 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.819
 if you want to win 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.830
 which I do not recommend would be all these 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.080
 that minute since I can touch you 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.640
 here litigation domain or team deathmatch and 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.810
 the truth to be creating classes to 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.390
 every time and like that is not going to be so 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.270
 Without the resist, neither does it seek to destroy 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.250
 either that he trusts either because he 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.100
 it becomes very rural 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.310
 in this way for reasons of plates and 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.460
 that the sheet is always floating and 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.370
 can some enemy go 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.950
 for her and good you tell the truth 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.260
 domain I do not recommend it either because it 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.450
 it's very boring they 're 10-15 games 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.130
 10 minutes 12 minutes that the truth 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.660
 is that it gives laziness to play those games and 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.240
 is just beginning, well, let's go 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.120
 the tips that I can give you to 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.140
 team deathmatch and stop this time 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.990
 basically the weapon is the weapon 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.639
 secondary the lethal and the tactics and the 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.169
 dogs there is what you say 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.550
 If you want, you can leave me at 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.189
 comments if you want me to make a video 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.960
 explaining the best classes or the 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.360
 classes that I recommend for types 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.729
 in game mode but you're already saying and 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.240
 if you want that then post here below 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.550
 I am and if I see that yes they are 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.110
 interested in the video but I do that 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.719
 basically for you internal what 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.889
 I recommend respecting this row the sat 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:08.800
 with ims dog and those in wheat here can 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.240
 choose between these two since always 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.250
 I say is not very important because if I go 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.449
 to feel bad and there is another one who gets 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.650
 to be with the truth is that they are going to 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.319
 Help enough to see the enemies 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.479
 on Friday they can nail him where he is 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.590
 where they consider that they change a lot 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.490
 truth is that you can inflate the 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.800
 Friday 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.659
 the dog the same for russia is very very 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.250
 well the truth is that if you laugh a lot if 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.979
 run a lot through the network is that the dog 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.229
 is going to swell the same if you stay that 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.120
 changing and harassing somewhere the 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.279
 truth is that I doubt that dog matrix the 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.219
 centric you can put it the same in some 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:41.289
 place where a lot of people like that usually go 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.449
 that basically this is the idea in the 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.610
 row that I recommend to swell 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.639
 since if they make seven casualties for 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:52.539
 they are going to take out in a game of 14 that I 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.250
 always multiplied 7 so the 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.800
 truth is that they can reach up to 15 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.229
 going down like taking the first streak 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.169
 that would be 7 if you have chat with dog and 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.150
 the turret what I do not recommend are 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.939
 all these the truth is that it is very 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.340
 tedious to be watching your streak and that and 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:11.139
 that suddenly even though it is a 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.819
 helicopter and this the map closed with 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.189
 houses and do not kill the so you do not 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.979
 I recommend all these I take it in another 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:20.139
 Council for the truth is that 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.090
 in crack in few people who are just going 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.550
 starting at that he knows so when 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.319
 you make the first bomb jaén to butt that 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.840
 you are going to give all these by default 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.330
 these advantages that would be dismissed 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.460
 the whole speed line and they're going to give you 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.659
 four so what I recommend is 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.659
 to put on any other advantage 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.850
 so to speak like that so they go super 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.580
 doped and so they want to put this 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.880
 services so that they go super 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.350
 more more accelerated but then I what 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.270
 I recommend it is the same to put in the same 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.300
 recipe here to improve your 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.370
 low ratio so that's all 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.440
 I hope it has helped them the truth is that 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.979
 as I tell you what I recommend extending 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.410
 more I think I recommend it yes but if 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.360
 you have a little more experience and already 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.630
 you know where to move so what 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.180
 I recommend quite so infected 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.599
 to camps it is comfortable here if you 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.759
 like to change so good and free foral 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:18.740
 last flow so I say goodbye 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:21.080
 I'm vivex and we're going to the next one to 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.960
 Do not forget to subscribe before 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.229
 to leave and friend so we'll see the 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.229
 next
