00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello good today I bring you another goal 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.290
 are 20 millimeters of canon a 20 28 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.320
 and the truth is that it 's pretty enough 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.439
 useful I've been testing it for a few days what 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.790
 I have compared with a fixed 35 I have 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.110
 compared also with a 2035 and the 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.310
 true that is one of the ones that has most 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.840
 liked basically by 2 with 8 by 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.210
 your focus the south or sonic 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.710
 you know the approach is the best 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.530
 less noisy 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.290
 and the truth that I thought was a 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.780
 Very useful goal to go on a trip 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.480
 kallejeo we are worth for portrait we are worth 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.720
 for landscape 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.280
 to see a fixed goal as I always say 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.550
 They are very specific objectives as 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.150
 who buys one of these will give you a 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.880
 fairly specific use is worth but 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.600
 yes that can be a pretty goal 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.420
 pretty good for the day to day I 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.220
 I will teach closely 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.060
 we have the autofocus button there 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.060
 manuel or approach 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.380
 the route is very good is something that 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.810
 he liked it a lot 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.810
 I really like that the tour of the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.560
 objectives be good be short and in addition 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.710
 short is good because not for very 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.440
 bit quintero touches already moves 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.180
 and well the truth is that it is very good for 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.550
 precision and so on and nothing then the lens 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.700
 that the lens almost protrudes from the outside 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.000
 that's why I recommend a filter so that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.400
 there is not that lens 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.520
 and what I 'm going to do is mount it 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.370
 in the in the camera to show you the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.880
 noise that makes when focusing though good 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.410
 these goals are not usually for video 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.200
 although it can be quite useful too 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.240
 for video and I'll show you the noise 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.660
 what are we doing and are we going to do some tests 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.460
 of 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.280
 after photography so you can see the 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.270
 quality the quality of contrasts and others 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.270
 that has the goal worth 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.550
 well we have it already mounted so nothing 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.290
 Let's put it in manually defocusing mos 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.290
 automatic and we focus 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.290
 As you can see, it 's quite fast focusing 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.290
 let's see 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.250
 yes very fast 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.510
 it's very fast very quiet and the truth 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.510
 that the approach is going very well 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.600
 so nothing I'm going to do a few 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.930
 photos with him both the landscape and here 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.780
 to the image that you have now on screen 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.350
 and now I give you the conclusion about the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.350
 goal is worth 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.810
 the final conclusion you have just seen what 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.450
 that are the photographs the sound that 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.030
 the river makes in noise makes it too 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.790
 well almost does not make noise the approach is 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.790
 very fast the quality is pretty good 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.140
 has very good contrasts has the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.970
 quality of the lens is very good 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.730
 true 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.350
 price the truth that is a tad expensive 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.130
 ok I expected it a little cheaper 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:20.390
 but about 400 or so I've 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.810
 seen in 350 but the average is 44 50 is 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:27.230
 a tad expensive since for that price 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:31.040
 I'm just prior to 2035 but not 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:38.100
 we have 28 or I would go to a 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:41.250
 50 14 maybe it's not the same but that 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.760
 we would still win a tad even so it's a 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.220
 very good objective 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.300
 as I said at the beginning depending 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.340
 of what we are going to use it for if 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.620
 what we are going to use is this and it is 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.240
 specific to this I recommend you the 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.819
 100% worth 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.849
 so I do not expect anything that has served you 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.330
 help and subscribe to my channel 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.330
 a greeting
