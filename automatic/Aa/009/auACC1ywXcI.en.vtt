00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.420
 hello my dear viewer with you but 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.810
 rus and today we look at who 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.150
 character as a magician magician 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.770
 before the caster has him like me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.020
 ignite virgin characteristics 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.410
 power of reason I think that he is here 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.970
 of which much better is his mind 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.320
 increases magical damage with auto attack 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.160
 increases damage 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 Abilities fireball therefore recommend 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.129
 all swing it into the mind and of course 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.379
 increase its health efficiency . here 4 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.290
 500 I think it could still be there 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.210
 a thousand more to do well and a little 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.340
 tricks for what was punching then 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 there is a trick and here is 10 on a modest 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.380
 amount maybe i'm his little 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.730
 increase the time look at the class 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.010
 your talent of this character 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.380
 1 class your talent is enchanted 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 flank tells us here about what 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.180
 a magician can start a codepen about her and this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 te in the direction of that is to spell it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.580
 not interrupt like no other 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.320
 characters 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.970
 that is, he is not here at all 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.020
 stand still is a mobile character 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.720
 he runs 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 that is, he is really engaged in that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.100
 what he started to cast 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.330
 and ran off began to cast and ran away worth 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.060
 on the spot completely this character is not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.710
 need our most basic chief 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.540
 home talent is a fire blow 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.340
 firestrike on the ground appears 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 area there in one second 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.040
 arrives fireball which is applied 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.150
 magic damage at what this ball 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.659
 there are two areas 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.820
 the epicenter itself if that heroes falls 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.150
 they additionally take damage then 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.939
 there is as it is written here all who 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.549
 is inside get 40 to 400 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.740
 16 damage if plus in the epicenter 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.829
 this damage they get from twenty more 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.170
 up to two hundred and forty three is pretty 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.759
 important to file well with its ball center 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.189
 on the enemy hero turns a half 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.710
 times the damage more they 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.799
 Upgrade two talents this the the, that those 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.959
 who hit the center 4 seconds gets more 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.500
 physical damage they continue like that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.620
 burn a little further our second 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.090
 abundant talent is transformation 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.810
 the smartest talent for controlling creating 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.060
 from 18 seconds but it's rather long 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.340
 to control of course here it will be necessary 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.250
 practice with this when 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.319
 x less just get up for two seconds 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.420
 faction rotates in a chicken dropping it 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.660
 speed of movement and he gets not 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.160
 can physical freak apart from this with 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.510
 upgrade talent and this we see that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.180
 increases physical damage which 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.920
 turns man turned into a chicken 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.200
 and if you finish 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.730
 during the chicken then the hero having achieved 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.590
 stops your health energy in 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.690
 size of 15 percent yes it's nice so 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.350
 that chase characters in hens yet 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.590
 blame yourself grabs imanov our next 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:05.269
 talent is an energy barrier this 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.650
 the camp and in the group magicians 075 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.860
 open circle 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.140
 if someone goes over this circle 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.019
 of this circle then man falls camp on 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.489
 one and a half seconds can not do anything 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.819
 besides this we see that if a country 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.470
 earth 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.380
 get that inside the circle write 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.700
 percent worse health regeneration 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.829
 upgrades talent gives that all who 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.739
 is inside gets a little more 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.230
 physical damage smartest talent for 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.109
 control kites quickly can 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.560
 pick up a few characters 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:41.569
 super this talent just decides our 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.170
 Ulta such she quite peculiar 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.680
 here is a call to her she has 120 seconds 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.060
 cd 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.799
 Well, such an intermediary that he does through 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.859
 starts casting in a second 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.780
 the demon gets out for 20 seconds and in the first 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.819
 option he just post hands then 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.310
 there is a physical like you here 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.959
 see him hp depends on the growth of the sea 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.329
 strength is chosen more 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.670
 that is very good when using a demon 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.329
 from the native land around the emerging demon 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.450
 still all 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.030
 once get this magic 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.630
 damage from reason is therefore also worth only 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.229
 little reason for this reason, too, and 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.300
 next nice upgrade of this case 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.389
 is that everyone who is near 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.389
 the demon around him 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.759
 that is, in radius oh I get it in 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.180
 second magic damage that's from 8 to 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.099
 80 this is from the mind that's why 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.110
 Accordingly, the magician in the mind really 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.400
 drags 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.909
 diligence in power will damage a little 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.099
 more 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:45.759
 from chicken and a little more in a circle but 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:47.110
 this is not worth the talent 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.180
 what is useful for him that is 1 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.509
 regeneration we are first line behind the eyes 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.150
 and for the ears that is talent for hp here yes 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.949
 These well probably still want kpmf 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.430
 add here i have four and a half 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.129
 thousands it seems to me that you need about 5 to 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.129
 5 500 may be closer to six 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.689
 because the character is pretty pretty well 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.479
 or maybe it's me that you play it 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:13.080
 Changed pretty cotton it turns out that 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.150
 useful here is this thing cover it shadows 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.639
 just a mast hev because magician 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.870
 he controller knows all about it and everything 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.370
 will try to merge it first 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.599
 turn because if the magician does not drain 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.060
 but the point is just for you to mix the enemy 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.740
 a team like that . water 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.599
 turn into a chicken a few 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.370
 characters will be found several times 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.669
 you will fly the ball on his head and all 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.139
 continue that is therefore cover 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.360
 blue is worth having so that as soon as you 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.360
 someone aiming enemy assassin you 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.479
 ejection clicked gone stealth all of you 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.370
 see you saved your life here we are 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.770
 rather strange line here she is 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.990
 do something about it change that 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.800
 There is of course intelligence efficiency at once HP 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.050
 that is , everything here is in my mind all that 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.550
 only possible and here is the survival instinct I 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.139
 with many characters removed but this 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.589
 character also think that instinct 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:08.469
 survival it must be up 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:11.889
 extra 650 may at some point 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:14.289
 save your life just pass rollback 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.139
 hens will roll circle 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:21.330
 and we will be able to sew but let's now 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.330
 let's see how in action a magician
