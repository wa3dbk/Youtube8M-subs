00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.700
 hi youtube i'm pete seeger and 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.059
 welcome to the double review of the web 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.290
 9 and vp 45 if they are new here 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.090
 remember that these videos are not for 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.070
 demonstrate skills but to see 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.900
 how the weapon works or in this case the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.759
 weapons in the hands of an average puppet 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.290
 As I am, I also ask you to 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.759
 please put in the comments a 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.310
 weapon that they would like to see in the future 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.189
 next in review or if not the word of 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.590
 day that is olive let's start talking to 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.329
 the review of these or mps in real life 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.590
 there are universe martÃ­n pistols are 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.350
 manufactured by heck shrinks it in 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.660
 Germany since 1999 depending on the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.329
 model is the version or cartridge that 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.329
 used in the case of the vp 9 is a 9 x 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.940
 19 for bellum and in the case of vp 45 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.489
 is the point 45 acp there is also another 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.379
 vp version that uses 40 point 40 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.030
 it is a thousand waters now passing inside the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.379
 game to unlock each of these 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.469
 weapons let's start with the easiest 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.089
 the vp 45 that is achieved after 11,000 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.789
 points with self-defense weapons 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.769
 now the difficult one is the web again more 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.050
 well not difficult but laborious because 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.000
 they need to complete three missions in 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.740
 total the first is that you complete 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.360
 the mission basic engineer for 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.270
 unlock that mission are to have 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.340
 rank 10 the emission consists of 7 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.800
 deaths with any carbine and 16 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.050
 repairs doing that unlocks the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.240
 veteran engineer mission consisting 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.790
 in one more death that is 8 deaths with 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.470
 any carbine 17 repairs 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.300
 completing veteran engineer 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.190
 unlock the expert engineer mission 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.790
 which is the one that is going to give you the weapon as 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.470
 such 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.530
 the expert engineer mission consists of 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.080
 60 deaths with carbines 400 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.190
 repairs and 200 deaths with any 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.320
 carbine of your liking 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.180
 I really do not remember if the 200 deaths 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.130
 they had to be with the same carbine 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.140
 because in that process I unlock it 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.060
 without noticing but my suggestion is 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.400
 Equip the carbine of your preference 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.110
 Do not take it off at any time or for 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.430
 act another class and preferably 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.440
 always be an engineer on maps 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.790
 conquest they already have both unlocked 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.009
 we can start with statistics 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.630
 let's start by comparing them with the damage of 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.009
 damage is the main difference by 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.229
 since they use ammunition 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.390
 different this will confer that the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.920
 Charger capacity is different than 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.290
 the cheap speed lies differently and 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.610
 obviously the rate of shots in 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.530
 few words the only thing that they have 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.110
 similar is the appearance regarding the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.240
 damage the uem p45 is victorious 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.220
 because it has 34 points of damage in the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.380
 first 8 meters is to say a death 3 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.960
 shots to the chest and after 40 meters is 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.630
 a death of 7 shots with 15.4 points of 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.820
 damage by the part of the uem 9 has a 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.740
 damage on average of 25 points of the year 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.620
 between the first 8 meters a death 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.320
 of 4 shots and after 55 meters is a 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.860
 death of 9 shots with 12.1 points 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.420
 hurt 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.300
 after that we can notice a charger 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.740
 straight from the one 45 that gives you only 25 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.290
 bullets in the mason magazine in the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.220
 bedroom while web 9 has 30 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.590
 bullets in the charger 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.140
 likewise the cadence of shots of the 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.840
 web 9 is 700 rounds per minute 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.720
 really that cadence is not good with 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.459
 that damage and for vp 45 is 600 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.989
 shots per minute that makes up for it 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.400
 pretty good with the damage 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.670
 in a few words we can say that the 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.470
 web of 45 has more damage per second to 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.870
 Although it shoots fewer bullets per 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.900
 minute however if you fail in 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.030
 a shot is more damaging with the 45 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.830
 that with the vp 9 likewise another 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.720
 feature that bullets have 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.600
 different is a weak difference or of 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.650
 speed the 45th point by itself has no 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.329
 much rank 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.340
 has a speed reflected in the 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.890
 320 meters game on second 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.349
 while vp 9 has a little more 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.870
 370 meters about second equally 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.610
 both are extremely slow and do not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.049
 suitable for distance if you 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.329
 they are going to shoot someone beyond 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.069
 about 20 meters point slightly at 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.569
 in front of them and if they want to 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.400
 complete the statistics we can 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.959
 mention the recharge that is identical to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.609
 the quick recharge is to say when it is 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.609
 at least one bullet in the chamber of 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.159
 1.85 seconds and if all have been finished 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:59.329
 the bullets is 2.5 seconds for the 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:01.310
 baby 45 and 2.4 seconds for uem 9 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.019
 both very fast recharges that are not 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.989
 finish all the bullets take advantage of that 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.060
 1.85 seconds again come back with 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.430
 more statistics compared to the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.500
 bullet being a more powerful bullet inside 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.030
 of the game must be balanced with a 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.280
 firing rate lower than already 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.030
 we saw and a shooting pattern a little more 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.070
 strong 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.630
 both bp are kicked the same towards the 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.759
 left of them on the right point 2 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.139
 towards both sides however the kick 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.630
 upwards and the multiplier of the 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.840
 first shot are different point 4 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.310
 for vp 45 that is not much 15 is 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.900
 medium medium high but with 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.510
 that rate of shots is very very 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.850
 controllable and point 26 for the web 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.110
 9 that is practically not noticeable 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.640
 while on the side of the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.710
 multiplier of the first shot is 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.450
 say how strong or how many times 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.550
 stronger will kick the first bullet 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.330
 in comparison to the subsequent ones it is of 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.840
 1.8 for the uaem ep 45 and 1.5 for the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.640
 99 both very low that means that if 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.770
 they see someone beyond 20 or 25 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.600
 meters do small bursts so that 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.370
 the precision is not lost and finally 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.170
 before talking about the pros and cons of 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.640
 each weapon and which one is better in my opinion 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.500
 let's talk about some accessories 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.570
 recommended more than anything the look of 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.430
 Red dot of your holographic preference 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.200
 although if for some reason you 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.000
 prefer the iron mines are not 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.040
 difficult to use although it is not 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.380
 ideal second place a laser sight 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.540
 because they are guns from nearby shots 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.790
 ergonomic so you never lose 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.980
 its mobility or vertical handle and in the 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.780
 nothing cannon or a suppressor are my 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.240
 Favorite accessories as you can give 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.520
 account use the same accessories not 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.230
 I have a difference for one or the other and 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.780
 is more than anything for two reasons meet 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.460
 the same distance range and two the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.210
 shooting pattern is very controllable and 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.819
 they do not need 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.710
 too much now which of these two 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.020
 it's better and if any of these two 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.819
 competes against all the others being the 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.680
 better try it to consider obviously 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.960
 it is the damage to have the same precision 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.360
 point 4 from the sight is not very 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.889
 good and one from the hip really does not 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.229
 there is no benefit for which to 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.720
 use vp 9 compared to damage 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.280
 from vp 45 however if you guys 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.870
 they feel they are missing a bit of 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.000
 precision do not like to shoot from the 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.580
 hip-type rambo definitely side 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.789
 mp 9 although there are 700 shots per 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.190
 minute beats vp 45 but of all 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.370
 ways 700 shots per minute with a 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.770
 damage of 4 shots to the chest is very very very 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.440
 low and it's definitely from 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.930
 consider comparing it with a 60 3 to 1 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.240
 which are 25 points of damage with a thousand 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.979
 shots per minute so quickly 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.409
 to remove the water qualification 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.699
 in 9 of the head two slices of pizza 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.380
 about four in my opinion because 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.169
 really the effort that involves 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.419
 unlocks this weapon does not make up for its low 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.460
 damage per second while the web of 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.680
 45 could be given a rating of 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.210
 4 slices of pizza on four or 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.110
 even three slices of floors over 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.570
 four if they are others 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.850
 strict since that damage only 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:53.300
 exceeded by 60 3 to 1 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.920
 for that there is that voucher for s r2 but 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.870
 still have the opportunity to give it a 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.970
 shot to the head and then one to the chest and 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.890
 that the enemy is dead is a great 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.050
 benefit of that high damage model of 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.940
 the bp 45 and it's definitely from my 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.710
 favorite of the engineer class but 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.870
 as always the best judge are you 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.340
 Tell me what you think of each weapon 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.170
 such they thought the comparison that they 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.760
 like or do not like each weapon if 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.560
 considered that the review was useful 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.120
 or can you serve someone or liked them 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.950
 or something like that or I play that 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.120
 consider giving it a rating and if 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.380
 they are not subscribed, I recommend them 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.910
 broadly go to the channel to the 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.830
 videos tab and see the content 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.870
 that I have so that they convince themselves facebook 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:30.040
 twitter are in the description and we 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.040
 we see in the next 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.980
