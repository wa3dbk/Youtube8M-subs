 olive is a natural conservative and is the

 that will help us not to lose 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.650
 so fast that you remember that the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.230
 conservatives like salt like oils we 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.240
 allow the ingredients to last longer 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.240
