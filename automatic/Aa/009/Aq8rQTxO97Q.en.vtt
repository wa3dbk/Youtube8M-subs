00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.660 
the quick fuse that is makes it a lot
better<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.140> lot<00:04:10.290> easier<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.709> use<00:04:10.739> as<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> frag

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
better and a lot easier to use as a frag

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.520 
better and a lot easier to use as a frag
but<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.030> cannot<00:04:12.360> be<00:04:12.510> bounced<00:04:12.900> off<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.019> objects

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
but it cannot be bounced off of objects

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
but it cannot be bounced off of objects
such<00:04:13.650> as<00:04:13.680> buildings<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:14.640> if<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.760> are<00:04:14.850> trying

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
such as buildings so if you are trying

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.610 
such as buildings so if you are trying
to<00:04:15.150> do<00:04:15.269> frag<00:04:15.540> bounces<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.049> definitely<00:04:16.530> been

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
to do frag bounces I definitely been

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
to do frag bounces I definitely been
putting<00:04:16.890> on<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.280> frag<00:04:17.489> grenade<00:04:17.729> what<00:04:17.970> it's

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
putting on the frag grenade what it's

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.500 
putting on the frag grenade what it's
for

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
for

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.900 
for
now<00:04:18.840> tactical<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.859> put<00:04:20.160> on<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> EMP<00:04:20.669> grenade

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
now tactical I put on the EMP grenade

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.310 
now tactical I put on the EMP grenade
