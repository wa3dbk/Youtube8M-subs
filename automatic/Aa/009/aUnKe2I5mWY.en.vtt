00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
just a nice clean machine just how we

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.459 
just a nice clean machine just how we
like<00:00:57.840> them<00:00:58.670> these<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> 650<00:01:00.690> CC<00:01:01.140> v-twin

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
like them these have the 650 CC v-twin

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.179 
like them these have the 650 CC v-twin
engine<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.120> twin<00:01:03.480> cylinder<00:01:03.809> engine<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
engine so it's a twin cylinder engine so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.530 
engine so it's a twin cylinder engine so
you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.519> they<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:06.030> silver<00:01:06.360> going

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you can see they got one silver going

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
you can see they got one silver going
forward<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> other<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.590> will<00:01:07.799> maybe<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> can

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
forward the other one will maybe you can

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.440 
forward the other one will maybe you can
see<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> other<00:01:08.760> sides<00:01:09.119> going

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
see it on the other sides going

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
see it on the other sides going
backwards<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.710> v-twin<00:01:11.250> makes<00:01:11.520> all<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
backwards but that v-twin makes all the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
backwards but that v-twin makes all the
difference<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.560> v-twin<00:01:14.390> 650<00:01:15.860> nothing

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
difference with that v-twin 650 nothing

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.440 
difference with that v-twin 650 nothing

let's<00:01:45.750> take<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> look<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.439> side<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
let's take a look at this side of the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
let's take a look at this side of the
motor<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.970> kind<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.689> rear

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
motor and we can kind of see that rear

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.770 
motor and we can kind of see that rear
cylinder<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.680> may<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:51.270> that's<00:01:51.479> nice

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
cylinder in there may be but that's nice

brakes<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.740> front<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.400> then<00:02:17.000> let's<00:02:17.240> take

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
brakes in the front and then let's take

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.210 
brakes in the front and then let's take
a<00:02:17.420> look<00:02:17.660> at<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.900> rear<00:02:18.170> suspension<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:18.890> brake

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
a look at this rear suspension and brake

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.490 
a look at this rear suspension and brake
system<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.850> back<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.810> you've<00:02:20.930> got<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.110> swing

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
system in the back so you've got a swing

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.300 
system in the back so you've got a swing
arm<00:02:22.210> solid<00:02:23.210> rear<00:02:23.420> axle<00:02:23.450> we<00:02:24.020> call<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.530> he's

couple of these myself and what I like
about<00:02:31.520> them<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.240> they're<00:02:32.930> very<00:02:32.959> simple

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
you with the independent suspension

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.930 
you with the independent suspension
you've<00:02:35.930> got<00:02:36.050> lots<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.560> arms<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.220> joints<00:02:37.730> and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
CV boots and see the axles and you just

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.010 
CV boots and see the axles and you just
don't<00:02:40.820> have<00:02:40.970> all<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.180> here<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.900> makes

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
don't have all that here so it makes

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.699 
don't have all that here so it makes
these<00:02:42.230> very<00:02:42.500> durable<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.070> reliable<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.720> I

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
these very durable and reliable and I

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.830 
these very durable and reliable and I
like<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.160> about<00:02:46.310> these<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.300> you'll<00:02:47.570> notice

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
like that about these and you'll notice

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.479 
like that about these and you'll notice
we<00:02:48.170> look<00:02:48.320> here<00:02:48.560> at<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.770> rear<00:02:48.980> hub<00:02:49.160> there's<00:02:49.370> no

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
we look here at this rear hub there's no

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.850 
we look here at this rear hub there's no
break<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:50.030> here<00:02:50.390> don't<00:02:50.870> brake<00:02:51.050> here<00:02:51.380> no<00:02:51.620> break

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
break in here don't brake here no break

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.920 
break in here don't brake here no break
here<00:02:51.890> no<00:02:52.430> break<00:02:52.640> here<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.450> rear<00:02:53.630> brake<00:02:53.900> is

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
here no break here the rear brake is

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.500 
here no break here the rear brake is
right<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.650> here<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.220> it's<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.550> multi-disc<00:02:56.209> wet

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
right in here and it's a multi-disc wet

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.210 
right in here and it's a multi-disc wet
rear<00:02:56.750> brake<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:57.260> what<00:02:57.380> that<00:02:57.560> means<00:02:57.770> is<00:02:58.010> is

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
rear brake and what that means is is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.970 
rear brake and what that means is is
that<00:02:58.250> rear<00:02:58.550> brake<00:02:58.820> is<00:02:59.320> built<00:03:00.320> into<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.680> case

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
that rear brake is built into this case

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.860 
that rear brake is built into this case
and<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.400> rides<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.820> an<00:03:01.910> oil<00:03:02.120> bath<00:03:02.360> there's<00:03:02.660> oil

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
and it rides in an oil bath there's oil

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.199 
and it rides in an oil bath there's oil
in<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:03.320> case<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.160> lubricate<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.790> ring<00:03:05.030> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
in this case so lubricate this ring and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.870 
in this case so lubricate this ring and
pinion<00:03:05.390> gear<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.190> because<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.430> rides<00:03:07.640> in<00:03:07.790> that

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
pinion gear and because it rides in that

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.330 
pinion gear and because it rides in that
oil<00:03:07.970> bath<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.480> stays<00:03:08.750> very<00:03:08.930> clean<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.830> you'll

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
oil bath it stays very clean and you'll

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.430 
oil bath it stays very clean and you'll
probably<00:03:10.610> never<00:03:11.060> replace<00:03:11.690> these<00:03:11.930> rear<00:03:12.170> brakes

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
probably never replace these rear brakes

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.890 
probably never replace these rear brakes
they'll<00:03:12.739> probably<00:03:12.950> last<00:03:13.360> just<00:03:14.360> long<00:03:14.630> long

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
they'll probably last just long long

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.870 
they'll probably last just long long
long<00:03:15.170> time

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
long time

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.420 
long time
we<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:18.050> yet<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.290> replace<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.740> set<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.220> fear

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
we have yet to replace a set of the fear

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.280 
we have yet to replace a set of the fear
brakes<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.240> it's<00:03:20.600> awesome<00:03:21.050> awesome

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
brakes that just it's awesome awesome

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.680 
brakes that just it's awesome awesome
future<00:03:21.850> alright<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.060> that's<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.330> look<00:03:23.480> at<00:03:23.600> the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
future alright so that's a look at the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.720 
future alright so that's a look at the
rear<00:03:23.870> end<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:25.070> take<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.280> look<00:03:25.520> at<00:03:25.610> the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
rear end to take a look at the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.850 
rear end to take a look at the
instrumentation<00:03:26.450> on<00:03:26.570> it

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.490 

so<00:03:30.430> we've<00:03:30.550> got<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.700> digital<00:03:30.970> speedometer<00:03:31.500> this

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
so we've got a digital speedometer this

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.230 
so we've got a digital speedometer this
units<00:03:32.860> got<00:03:33.010> twelve<00:03:33.370> hundred<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.790> seventy<00:03:34.210> two

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
units got twelve hundred and seventy two

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.840 
units got twelve hundred and seventy two
miles<00:03:35.020> on<00:03:35.260> it

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850

when you put it in four-wheel drive you

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.310 
when you put it in four-wheel drive you
engage<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.640> front<00:04:33.910> end<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.990> front<00:04:35.110> end

engage the front end and the front end

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.110 
engage the front end and the front end
is<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.530> limited<00:04:36.070> slip<00:04:36.220> front<00:04:36.700> differential

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
is a limited slip front differential

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.490 
is a limited slip front differential
which<00:04:37.330> means<00:04:37.540> it's<00:04:37.690> going<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:37.900> try<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.169> send

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
which means it's going to try to send

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.950 
which means it's going to try to send
power<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.010> wheel<00:04:39.160> that<00:04:39.190> has<00:04:39.580> traction<00:04:40.000> but

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
power to the wheel that has traction but

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.060 
power to the wheel that has traction but
if<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.169> reach<00:04:41.350> up<00:04:41.500> here<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.710> pull<00:04:41.919> this

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
if you reach up here and pull this

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.320 
if you reach up here and pull this
little<00:04:42.190> yellow<00:04:42.490> lever<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.910> will<00:04:43.090> lock<00:04:43.300> up

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
little yellow lever that will lock up

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.480 
little yellow lever that will lock up
the<00:04:43.660> front<00:04:43.690> differential<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:45.250> gives

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
the front differential and that gives

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.150 
the front differential and that gives
you<00:04:45.669> full<00:04:46.210> full<00:04:46.930> power<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.470> all<00:04:47.620> four<00:04:47.890> wheels
