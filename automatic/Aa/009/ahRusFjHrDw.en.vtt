banned for it but I can be fun sometimes

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.390 
banned for it but I can be fun sometimes
or<00:00:18.270> even<00:00:18.510> useful<00:00:20.960> we'll<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.350> hover<00:00:23.100> drive

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
or even useful we'll get a hover drive

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.429 
or even useful we'll get a hover drive
controller<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.590> actually<00:00:25.590> two<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:27.439> get

controller out actually two of them get

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.930 
controller out actually two of them get
your<00:00:28.680> easy<00:00:29.039> well<00:00:29.400> tool<00:00:30.590> click<00:00:31.669> exactly<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
your easy well tool click exactly in the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:43.130 
your easy well tool click exactly in the
mill<00:00:33.149> if<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:38.690> here<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:42.140> now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
mill if you can and here on this one now

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.080 
mill if you can and here on this one now
I<00:00:43.170> should<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.620> frozen<00:00:43.950> those<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.700> make<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
I should have frozen those to make that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.869 
I should have frozen those to make that
a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.420> bit<00:00:45.600> better<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:49.820> weld<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:52.879> okay

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
a little bit better just weld that okay

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.750 
a little bit better just weld that okay
and<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.510> holler<00:00:54.750> drives<00:00:55.050> here

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and then we have to holler drives here

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.520 
and then we have to holler drives here
now<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.820> idea<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.539> having<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.989> holla<00:00:58.199> drives

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
now the idea of having to holla drives

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.779 
now the idea of having to holla drives
is<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.219> teleport<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
is so that you can teleport it to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.060 
is so that you can teleport it to
different<00:01:03.030> locations<00:01:03.329> once<00:01:03.930> you've<00:01:04.140> grabbed

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
different locations once you've grabbed

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.250 
different locations once you've grabbed
the<00:01:05.250> prop<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:05.790> teleport<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the prop bit or teleport it you can

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.050 
the prop bit or teleport it you can
press<00:01:07.500> wanting<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> numpad<00:01:08.610> buttons<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
press wanting a numpad buttons a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.929 
press wanting a numpad buttons a
teleporter<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.840> location<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.880> when<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
teleporter to one location and when you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.480 
teleporter to one location and when you
want<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> bring<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.420> back<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.490> teleport

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
want to bring it back you can teleport

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.370 
want to bring it back you can teleport
it<00:01:14.610> again<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.600> we're<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.170> need<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:20.479> gps

thing as before let's do this more

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.710 
thing as before let's do this more
quickly

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720

one<00:03:31.740> now<00:03:32.740> that<00:03:32.920> that's<00:03:33.100> all<00:03:33.250> wired<00:03:33.550> up<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:35.110> is

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
one now that that's all wired up this is

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.440 
one now that that's all wired up this is
our<00:03:36.330> returning<00:03:38.310> GPS<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.610> when<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.880> hit<00:03:40.030> three

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
our returning GPS so when you hit three

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.570 
our returning GPS so when you hit three
a<00:03:40.650> teleporter<00:03:41.650> will<00:03:41.830> go<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.370> location

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.570 
a teleporter will go to this location
and<00:03:44.250> when<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.400> hit<00:03:45.610> one<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:47.530> hover<00:03:48.250> drives

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
and when you hit one the hover drives

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.290 
and when you hit one the hover drives
will<00:03:48.910> teleport<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:49.780> location<00:03:51.210> now<00:03:52.210> i'm

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
will teleport to this location now i'm

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.500

container

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.860 

I<00:04:03.910> think<00:04:04.910> it's<00:04:05.030> point<00:04:05.240> anything<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.660> like

a<00:04:26.120> bit<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:26.390> I<00:04:26.420> just<00:04:26.600> shift<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:27.860> lasers

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
a bit so I just shift it so that lasers

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.030 
a bit so I just shift it so that lasers
pointing<00:04:28.580> in<00:04:28.670> a<00:04:28.730> straight<00:04:29.000> line<00:04:29.770> now<00:04:30.770> when

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
pointing in a straight line now when

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.190 
pointing in a straight line now when
their<00:04:31.190> laser<00:04:31.430> is<00:04:31.910> hitting<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.360> prop<00:04:32.630> as<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.020> can

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
their laser is hitting a prop as you can

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.840 
their laser is hitting a prop as you can
see<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.910> press<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:36.320> once<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.190> grabber

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
see you press to once and the grabber

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.140 
see you press to once and the grabber
should<00:04:38.120> go<00:04:38.270> read<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:39.490> when<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.640> teleport<00:04:42.130> one

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
should go read and when you teleport one

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.720 
should go read and when you teleport one
teleports<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.240> prop<00:04:44.480> and<00:04:45.340> then<00:04:46.340> if<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:46.580> hit

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
teleports the prop and then if you hit

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.140 
teleports the prop and then if you hit
three<00:04:48.100> you'll<00:04:49.100> see<00:04:49.430> that<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.760> will<00:04:49.880> teleport

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
three you'll see that it will teleport

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.410 
three you'll see that it will teleport
back<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.780> this<00:04:50.900> one<00:04:51.140> and<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:52.820> can<00:04:52.850> press<00:04:53.180> two

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
back to this one and you can press two

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.850 
back to this one and you can press two
to<00:04:53.570> let<00:04:53.720> go<00:04:53.900> of<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.140> prop<00:04:56.440> now<00:04:57.440> we'll<00:04:57.680> bring

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
to let go of the prop now we'll bring

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.290 
to let go of the prop now we'll bring
this<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.370> vehicle<00:05:02.410> 21<00:05:04.030> I'll<00:05:05.030> leave<00:05:05.240> that

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
this to the vehicle 21 I'll leave that

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.890 
this to the vehicle 21 I'll leave that
there<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:07.120> bring<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.240> hover<00:05:08.390> drive<00:05:08.660> back

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
there and bring the hover drive back

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.830 
there and bring the hover drive back
