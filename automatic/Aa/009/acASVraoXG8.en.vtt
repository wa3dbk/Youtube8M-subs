detectors<00:00:11.400> now<00:00:12.210> what<00:00:12.450> we're<00:00:12.750> gonna<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.049> is

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
detectors now what we're gonna use is

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.609 
detectors now what we're gonna use is
dry<00:00:14.639> ice<00:00:14.880> which<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.389> solid<00:00:15.929> carbon<00:00:16.170> dioxide

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
dry ice which is solid carbon dioxide

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.230 
dry ice which is solid carbon dioxide
and<00:00:17.630> hot<00:00:18.630> water<00:00:18.930> now<00:00:19.470> dry<00:00:19.800> ice<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.000> be

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and hot water now dry ice you have to be

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720 
and hot water now dry ice you have to be
very<00:00:21.510> careful<00:00:22.050> careful<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:23.519> dry

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
very careful careful with because dry

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.390 
very careful careful with because dry
ice<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> hundred<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> ten<00:00:25.320> degrees<00:00:25.529> about

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
ice is a hundred and ten degrees about

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.040 
ice is a hundred and ten degrees about
one<00:00:26.519> hundred<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.820> nine<00:00:27.000> point<00:00:27.269> five<00:00:27.510> degrees

one hundred and nine point five degrees

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.070 
one hundred and nine point five degrees
below<00:00:28.230> zero<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:30.000> cold<00:00:30.330> enough<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
below zero and it's cold enough to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.459 
below zero and it's cold enough to
freeze<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.189> skin<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.960> give<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.200> frostbite

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
freeze the skin and give you frostbite

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.350 
freeze the skin and give you frostbite
in<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.130> matter<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> seconds<00:00:35.850> that's<00:00:36.000> why<00:00:36.180> I'm

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
in a matter of seconds that's why I'm

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.090 
in a matter of seconds that's why I'm
using<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.840> glove<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> even<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:37.950> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
using this glove and even with this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.799 
using this glove and even with this
glove<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.579> very<00:00:38.850> cold<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:41.210> I've<00:00:42.210> got<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> flask

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
glove it's very cold so I've got a flask

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.410 
glove it's very cold so I've got a flask
here<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:43.920> use<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.370> pop<00:00:44.879> bottle<00:00:45.090> or

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
here that you can use a pop bottle or

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 
here that you can use a pop bottle or
something<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> got<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> show<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> some

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
something but I got to show you some

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.790 
something but I got to show you some
important<00:00:47.730> safety<00:00:48.030> things<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:49.140> never<00:00:49.500> want

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
important safety things you never want

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.229 
important safety things you never want
to<00:00:49.890> close<00:00:50.219> off<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.300> top<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> bottle

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
to close off the top of the bottle

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.729 
to close off the top of the bottle
because<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> dry<00:00:54.600> ice<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:55.110> continue<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
because the dry ice will continue to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
because the dry ice will continue to
expand<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.550> eventually<00:00:57.030> bursts<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> bottle

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
expand it eventually bursts the bottle

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
expand it eventually bursts the bottle
and<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.379> could<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.590> very<00:00:58.829> dangerous<00:00:59.070> this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
and that could be very dangerous this

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.729 
and that could be very dangerous this
one's<00:01:00.030> glass<00:01:00.210> that's<00:01:00.690> dangerous<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.440> even<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
one's glass that's dangerous but even a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.140 
one's glass that's dangerous but even a
plastic<00:01:01.980> bottle<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.539> very<00:01:03.750> dangerous

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
plastic bottle can be very dangerous

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.600 
plastic bottle can be very dangerous
plastic<00:01:06.150> bottles<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.750> cut<00:01:07.049> through<00:01:07.979> your

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
plastic bottles can cut through your

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.640 
plastic bottles can cut through your
skin<00:01:08.880> very<00:01:09.240> eventually<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.260> explode

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
skin very eventually when they explode

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.039 
skin very eventually when they explode
with<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> force<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.869> cut

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
with that with that force they can cut

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.030 
with that with that force they can cut
through<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.350> skin<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.830> personally

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
don't do that okay we're ready to make a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.770 
don't do that okay we're ready to make a
smoke<00:01:21.659> bomb<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.140> dry<00:01:22.320> ice<00:01:23.030> now<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
smoke bomb with dry ice now I'm going to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.960 
smoke bomb with dry ice now I'm going to
pour<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> water<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.890> first<00:01:26.159> dry<00:01:26.490> ice<00:01:26.700> will

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
pour the water in first dry ice will

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.499 
pour the water in first dry ice will
expand<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.570> push<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> water<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.259> at<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
expand and push the water up at you and

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.319 
expand and push the water up at you and
may<00:01:30.509> scald<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> I'm<00:01:32.820> putting<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> water

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
may scald you so I'm putting the water

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:47.230 
may scald you so I'm putting the water
in<00:01:33.600> first<00:01:33.990> put<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.070> some<00:01:35.939> dry<00:01:36.240> ice<00:01:36.450> pellets

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.730 

now<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.300> nice<00:01:48.600> part<00:01:48.960> about<00:01:49.050> this<00:01:49.350> these<00:01:49.620> are

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
now the nice part about this these are

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
now the nice part about this these are
actually<00:01:50.130> clouds<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:50.820> smoke<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.660> they<00:01:51.810> won't

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
actually clouds not smoke so they won't

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.160 
actually clouds not smoke so they won't
set<00:01:52.350> off<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.500> smoke<00:01:52.890> detector<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.640> building

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
set off a smoke detector in a building

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.030 
set off a smoke detector in a building
know<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.510> clouds<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.170> co2<00:01:58.650> in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
know that the clouds are have co2 in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.120 
know that the clouds are have co2 in
them<00:01:59.190> which<00:01:59.430> makes<00:01:59.610> them<00:01:59.790> heavier<00:02:00.120> than<00:02:00.330> air

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
them which makes them heavier than air

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.990 
them which makes them heavier than air
so<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.370> smoke<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.870> can<00:02:04.050> pick<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.410> up<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
so this smoke you can pick it up and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.469 
so this smoke you can pick it up and
pour<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.150> out<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:07.610> have<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> safety<00:02:09.030> release

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
pour it out I have a safety release

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.420 
pour it out I have a safety release
valve<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.350> as<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.370> see<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:13.470> carbon

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
valve on here as you can see that carbon

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.449 
valve on here as you can see that carbon
dioxide<00:02:15.150> as<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.690> goes<00:02:15.840> from<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.140> solid<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> gas

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
dioxide as it goes from a solid to a gas

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.070 
dioxide as it goes from a solid to a gas
is<00:02:18.470> expanding<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:21.180> little<00:02:21.630> bit<00:02:21.840> of

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
is expanding and this little bit of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.630 
is expanding and this little bit of
carbon<00:02:22.530> dioxide<00:02:22.560> I've<00:02:23.070> got<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.370> there's<00:02:23.610> a

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
carbon dioxide I've got in there's a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.280 
carbon dioxide I've got in there's a
little<00:02:23.790> bit<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.970> dry<00:02:24.120> ice<00:02:24.270> will<00:02:24.840> turn<00:02:25.050> into<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
little bit of dry ice will turn into a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.420 
little bit of dry ice will turn into a
whole<00:02:25.500> room<00:02:25.890> full<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.310> gas<00:02:27.530> okay<00:02:28.530> at<00:02:28.770> home<00:02:29.130> you

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
whole room full of gas okay at home you

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.760 
whole room full of gas okay at home you
can<00:02:29.580> use<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.790> pop<00:02:30.120> bottle<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:31.110> never<00:02:31.380> put<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
can use a pop bottle but never put the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.340 
can use a pop bottle but never put the
top<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.280> seal<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.820> inside<00:02:33.170> because<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
top on and seal it inside because this

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.430 
top on and seal it inside because this
as<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.100> can<00:02:35.250> see<00:02:35.459> it's<00:02:35.610> pressing<00:02:35.910> out<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:37.200> you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
as you can see it's pressing out if you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.270 
as you can see it's pressing out if you
contain<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:40.200> dry<00:02:40.410> ice<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.830> gonna<00:02:40.980> win

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
contain it the dry ice is gonna win

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.830 
contain it the dry ice is gonna win
because<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:41.940> gonna<00:02:42.090> make<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.450> pop<00:02:42.660> bottle

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
because it's gonna make the pop bottle

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.590 
because it's gonna make the pop bottle
explode<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.800> even<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.490> Platte<00:02:44.850> little<00:02:45.180> plastic

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
explode and even a Platte little plastic

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.740 
explode and even a Platte little plastic
pop<00:02:45.870> bottle<00:02:46.290> going<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.220> fast<00:02:47.550> can<00:02:48.270> cut<00:02:48.540> you

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
pop bottle going that fast can cut you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.060 
pop bottle going that fast can cut you
right<00:02:48.959> open<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.350> give<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.709> you're<00:02:49.980> gonna

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
right open and give you you're gonna

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.240 
right open and give you you're gonna
have<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:50.459> stitches<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.540> never<00:02:52.050> seal<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
have to have stitches so never seal the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.030 
have to have stitches so never seal the
top<00:02:53.459> off<00:02:53.750> that's<00:02:54.750> very<00:02:55.200> dangerous<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.769> if<00:02:58.950> I

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
top off that's very dangerous so if I

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.810 
top off that's very dangerous so if I
put<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> stopper<00:02:59.700> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.880> top<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.610> can

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
put a stopper in the top I can I can

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:17.589 
put a stopper in the top I can I can
make<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.060> stopper<00:03:11.030> pop<00:03:12.030> its<00:03:12.269> top

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.690 

and<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.220> how<00:03:20.879> to<00:03:21.390> make<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:22.400> smoke<00:03:23.400> bomb

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
and that is how to make a smoke bomb

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.230 
and that is how to make a smoke bomb
using<00:03:24.090> dry<00:03:24.420> ice<00:03:24.629> in<00:03:24.870> hot<00:03:25.049> water
