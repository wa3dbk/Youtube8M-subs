going to create the illusion of a more
defined<00:01:58.340> jawline<00:01:58.790> -<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.299> I'm<00:01:59.780> going<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.020> show

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
defined jawline - so I'm going to show

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.510 
defined jawline - so I'm going to show
you<00:02:00.229> with<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.439> much<00:02:00.680> darker<00:02:00.890> color<00:02:01.280> than<00:02:01.490> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
you with a much darker color than I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.940 
you with a much darker color than I
would<00:02:01.670> views<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.290> kind<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.350> like<00:02:03.439> a<00:02:03.500> line<00:02:03.740> like

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
would views but kind of like a line like

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.890 
would views but kind of like a line like
that<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.430> then<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.939> then<00:02:05.780> you're

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
that and then like that and then you're

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.660 
that and then like that and then you're
just<00:02:05.990> going<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.259> blend<00:02:06.530> back<00:02:06.950> towards<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.490> ear

and blend down again just keep blending
down<00:02:11.870> same<00:02:12.769> thing<00:02:13.010> we're<00:02:13.159> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.340> create

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
down same thing we're going to create

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.000 
down same thing we're going to create
our<00:02:13.700> L<00:02:13.939> look<00:02:14.180> over<00:02:14.480> here<00:02:14.810> you're<00:02:15.620> young<00:02:15.890> you're

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
our L look over here you're young you're

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.819 
our L look over here you're young you're
right<00:02:16.220> in<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.489> way<00:02:16.930> create<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.049> L<00:02:18.290> shape<00:02:18.319> and

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
right in the way create this L shape and

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.610 
right in the way create this L shape and
then<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.159> blend<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.959> can<00:02:21.139> buff<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.469> with

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
then just blend it you can buff it with

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.360 
then just blend it you can buff it with
a<00:02:21.650> sponge<00:02:22.069> and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
a sponge and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.190 
a sponge and
then<00:02:22.459> go<00:02:22.700> right<00:02:22.940> under<00:02:23.209> here<00:02:23.690> we're<00:02:23.989> going<00:02:24.110> to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
then go right under here we're going to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.170 
then go right under here we're going to
make<00:02:24.349> sure<00:02:24.560> everywhere<00:02:25.280> under<00:02:25.580> your<00:02:25.760> creating

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
make sure everywhere under your creating

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.240 
make sure everywhere under your creating
this<00:02:26.269> dark<00:02:26.659> color<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.500> can<00:02:27.739> go<00:02:27.799> up<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:28.099> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
this dark color you can go up on the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.559 
this dark color you can go up on the
chin<00:02:28.459> like<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.790> with<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.060> dart<00:02:29.360> too

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
chin like that with this dart too

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.490 
chin like that with this dart too
because<00:02:29.780> it's<00:02:29.930> going<00:02:30.049> to<00:02:30.140> create<00:02:30.349> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
because it's going to create the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.930 
because it's going to create the
illusion<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> beginning<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.640> curve

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
illusion of the beginning of a curve

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.509 
illusion of the beginning of a curve
even<00:02:32.599> if<00:02:32.900> it's<00:02:33.019> more<00:02:33.200> flat<00:02:33.470> there<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.280> just

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
even if it's more flat there so just

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.170 
even if it's more flat there so just
blend<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:34.909> down

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
blend this down

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.149 
blend this down
remember<00:02:35.659> triangle<00:02:36.230> going<00:02:36.409> this<00:02:36.680> way<00:02:36.890> and

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
remember triangle going this way and

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.460 
remember triangle going this way and
blend<00:02:37.760> down<00:02:37.849> these<00:02:38.120> sides<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.780> then<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.290> can

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
blend down these sides and then you can

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.580 
blend down these sides and then you can
lock<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.159> in<00:02:40.280> with<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.489> darker<00:02:40.940> powder<00:02:41.150> or<00:02:41.510> a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
lock it in with a darker powder or a

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.119 
lock it in with a darker powder or a
darker<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:43.239> have<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.569> is<00:02:44.750> I'll<00:02:45.470> show<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.709> this
