always remember to I know beads are

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.680 
always remember to I know beads are
pretty<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:35.500> keep<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.550> mind<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:37.030> put<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.270> lot<00:02:37.540> of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
pretty but keep in mind you put a lot of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.110 
pretty but keep in mind you put a lot of
beads<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.050> something<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.680> gets<00:02:38.860> heavy<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:40.030> you

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
beads on something it gets heavy so you

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.520 
beads on something it gets heavy so you
always<00:02:40.480> want<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.910> keep<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.270> mind<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
always want to keep that in mind if I

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.650 
always want to keep that in mind if I
have<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> shawl<00:02:45.100> sometimes<00:02:45.880> that's<00:02:46.180> why<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.330> put

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
have a shawl sometimes that's why I put

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.510 
have a shawl sometimes that's why I put
beads<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.110> my<00:02:47.230> bind<00:02:47.560> up<00:02:47.740> because<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.160> holds

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
beads in my bind up because it holds

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.270 
beads in my bind up because it holds
them<00:02:48.640> down<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:50.260> keeps<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.650> edge<00:02:50.860> nice

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.180 
them down and it keeps that edge nice
and<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:52.209> lays<00:02:52.420> nice<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.050> that's<00:02:53.260> just<00:02:53.500> more<00:02:54.130> of

and it lays nice so that's just more of
a<00:02:54.280> functional<00:02:54.850> use<00:02:55.150> than<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> decorative<00:02:56.020> can't

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
stockinette pattern and sometimes I will

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.699 
stockinette pattern and sometimes I will
decide<00:03:13.150> for<00:03:13.209> my<00:03:13.690> own<00:03:13.840> reasons<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.500> I'm<00:03:14.680> not

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709

going<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.100> do<00:03:15.310> what<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.670> pattern<00:03:16.030> tells<00:03:16.209> me<00:03:16.480> to

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
going to do what the pattern tells me to

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.880 
going to do what the pattern tells me to
do<00:03:17.550> because<00:03:18.550> I<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:19.120> my<00:03:19.330> mind<00:03:19.360> may<00:03:20.290> be<00:03:20.320> like<00:03:20.680> how

do because I in my mind may be like how

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.330 
do because I in my mind may be like how
something<00:03:21.370> looks<00:03:21.519> better<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.870> other<00:03:22.900> way<00:03:23.340> so

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
something looks better the other way so

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.290 
something looks better the other way so

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
them on the wrong side so that they have

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.280 
them on the wrong side so that they have
a<00:04:56.710> purl<00:04:57.190> on<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:58.090> front<00:04:58.420> you<00:04:58.600> can't<00:04:58.930> see<00:04:59.170> the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.240 
pearl but you sure can see the bead and

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
that's why I like to do it that way but

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.930 
that's why I like to do it that way but
anyways<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:03.910> is<00:05:03.940> how<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.360> knit<00:05:04.930> beads<00:05:05.940> that

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
anyways that is how you knit beads that

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.260 
anyways that is how you knit beads that
have<00:05:07.000> been<00:05:07.210> strung<00:05:07.570> on<00:05:07.840> your<00:05:08.080> ear
