00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.570 
comes in handy or whatever it's called
um<00:05:16.320> it'll<00:05:17.320> just<00:05:17.440> transform<00:05:17.890> it<00:05:17.980> by<00:05:18.130> flipping

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
um it'll just transform it by flipping

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.650 
um it'll just transform it by flipping
those<00:05:18.790> forward<00:05:21.000> separating<00:05:22.000> those<00:05:22.180> all<00:05:22.540> the

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
those forward separating those all the

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:37.210 
those forward separating those all the
way<00:05:22.750> out<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:29.130> flipping<00:05:30.130> those<00:05:30.400> on<00:05:31.169> it<00:05:32.169> so

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.400 

Jesse<00:05:38.000> kind<00:05:38.510> of<00:05:38.630> confuses<00:05:39.050> me<00:05:39.170> when<00:05:39.350> you

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
Jesse kind of confuses me when you

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.740 
Jesse kind of confuses me when you
transform<00:05:39.770> it<00:05:39.950> because<00:05:40.250> on<00:05:40.520> there's<00:05:41.420> a<00:05:41.540> lot<00:05:41.720> of

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
transform it because on there's a lot of

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.990 
transform it because on there's a lot of
rotation<00:05:42.410> of<00:05:42.530> the<00:05:42.590> panels<00:05:42.980> so<00:05:43.280> it<00:05:43.490> can<00:05:43.670> be<00:05:43.820> kind

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
rotation of the panels so it can be kind

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.350 
rotation of the panels so it can be kind
of<00:05:44.030> confusing<00:05:44.320> on<00:05:45.640> cuz<00:05:46.640> sometimes<00:05:46.970> you<00:05:47.270> don't

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
of confusing on cuz sometimes you don't

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.360 
of confusing on cuz sometimes you don't
exactly<00:05:47.720> know<00:05:48.050> where<00:05:48.200> to<00:05:48.350> rotate<00:05:48.740> all<00:05:49.340> the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
exactly know where to rotate all the

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.230 
exactly know where to rotate all the
panels<00:05:49.760> um<00:05:50.680> but<00:05:51.680> there<00:05:52.070> you<00:05:52.280> have<00:05:52.310> bombed<00:05:52.940> be

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
panels um but there you have bombed be

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.160 
panels um but there you have bombed be
with<00:05:53.450> his<00:05:53.630> own<00:05:54.130> jet<00:05:55.130> pack<00:05:55.720> doesn't<00:05:56.720> really<00:05:56.930> add

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
with his own jet pack doesn't really add

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.350 
with his own jet pack doesn't really add
or<00:05:57.500> subtract<00:05:58.100> anything<00:05:58.370> from<00:05:58.700> the<00:05:58.850> figure<00:05:59.210> in

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
or subtract anything from the figure in

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.870 
or subtract anything from the figure in
my<00:05:59.480> opinion<00:05:59.750> it's<00:06:00.590> kind<00:06:00.830> of<00:06:00.890> this<00:06:01.070> just<00:06:01.580> there

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
my opinion it's kind of this just there

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.730 
my opinion it's kind of this just there
to<00:06:01.910> own<00:06:02.540> fill<00:06:02.840> out<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:03.050> empty<00:06:03.320> space<00:06:03.530> above

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
to own fill out the empty space above

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.440 
to own fill out the empty space above
his<00:06:03.890> head<00:06:04.100> oh<00:06:05.230> but<00:06:06.230> yeah<00:06:06.490> so<00:06:07.490> one<00:06:08.090> feature<00:06:08.330> that

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
his head oh but yeah so one feature that

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.030 
his head oh but yeah so one feature that
I<00:06:08.630> wish<00:06:08.810> that<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.110> animated<00:06:09.620> one<00:06:09.650> week

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
I wish that the animated one week

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.540 
I wish that the animated one week
bumblebee<00:06:10.580> would<00:06:10.760> have<00:06:10.850> had<00:06:10.970> is<00:06:11.410> that<00:06:12.410> um<00:06:12.710> that

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
bumblebee would have had is that um that

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.400 
bumblebee would have had is that um that
I<00:06:13.790> wish<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.120> enmity<00:06:14.540> bumblebee<00:06:14.930> could<00:06:15.170> roll

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
I wish the enmity bumblebee could roll

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.660 
I wish the enmity bumblebee could roll
on<00:06:15.940> this<00:06:16.940> figures<00:06:17.390> feet<00:06:17.720> have<00:06:17.990> tires<00:06:18.470> um<00:06:18.920> on

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
on this figures feet have tires um on

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.080 
on this figures feet have tires um on
the<00:06:19.730> bottom<00:06:20.570> of<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:20.690> feet<00:06:20.870> which<00:06:21.170> on<00:06:22.090> cause

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
the bottom of the feet which on cause

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.350 
the bottom of the feet which on cause
him<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.480> roll<00:06:23.690> and<00:06:24.500> I<00:06:25.430> just<00:06:25.550> think<00:06:25.940> that<00:06:26.090> that

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
him to roll and I just think that that

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.820 
him to roll and I just think that that
would<00:06:26.450> fit<00:06:26.660> in<00:06:26.780> with<00:06:26.930> that<00:06:26.990> make<00:06:27.470> up<00:06:27.590> on<00:06:27.710> movies

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
would fit in with that make up on movies

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.030 
would fit in with that make up on movies
on<00:06:29.020> character<00:06:30.310> more<00:06:31.960> so<00:06:32.960> I'm<00:06:33.230> just<00:06:33.530> for<00:06:33.710> a<00:06:33.740> size

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
on character more so I'm just for a size

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.640 
on character more so I'm just for a size
comparison<00:06:34.070> I'll<00:06:34.790> bring<00:06:35.000> in<00:06:35.180> the<00:06:35.650> animated

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
comparison I'll bring in the animated

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.930 
comparison I'll bring in the animated
bumblebee<00:06:37.419> and<00:06:38.890> as<00:06:39.890> you<00:06:40.160> can<00:06:40.310> see<00:06:40.340> the

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
bumblebee and as you can see the

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.030 
bumblebee and as you can see the
animated<00:06:41.480> bone<00:06:41.630> would<00:06:41.750> be<00:06:41.900> is<00:06:42.110> slightly

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
animated bone would be is slightly

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.530 
animated bone would be is slightly
taller<00:06:43.520> than<00:06:43.910> on<00:06:44.150> classics<00:06:44.720> won't<00:06:44.930> be<00:06:45.080> um

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
taller than on classics won't be um

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.120 
taller than on classics won't be um
animated<00:06:47.540> is<00:06:47.810> just<00:06:48.260> a<00:06:48.470> little<00:06:48.980> bit<00:06:49.100> taller

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
animated is just a little bit taller

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.409 
animated is just a little bit taller
than<00:06:49.610> home<00:06:50.540> movies<00:06:50.870> on<00:06:51.110> Jetpack<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:52.419> just

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
than home movies on Jetpack and just

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.659 
than home movies on Jetpack and just
