program<00:00:57.260> at<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.470> point<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.860> do<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.670> run<00:01:00.360> your

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
program at that point you do is run your

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.860 
program at that point you do is run your
food<00:01:01.220> in<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.370> browser<00:01:02.580> right<00:01:03.150> we<00:01:03.540> can<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.840> that

food in the browser right we can do that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.110 
food in the browser right we can do that
actually<00:01:04.170> without<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> microwave<00:01:05.160> now<00:01:05.640> you're

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
actually without a microwave now you're

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:15.950 
actually without a microwave now you're
happy<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:13.130> present<00:01:14.130> arm<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.330> run<00:01:15.780> back

for<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.410> compilers<00:01:16.950> they're<00:01:17.820> gonna<00:01:17.910> send<00:01:18.180> us

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
for the compilers they're gonna send us

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.400 
for the compilers they're gonna send us
back<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:20.210> binary<00:01:21.210> code<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.990> needs<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.259> go

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
back the binary code that needs to go

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.740 
back the binary code that needs to go
into<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.009> microwave<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.390> compaction

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
into the microwave that will compaction

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.620 
into the microwave that will compaction
five<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> new<00:01:26.250> browsers<00:01:26.850> browsers<00:01:27.180> going

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
five like a new browsers browsers going

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.200 
five like a new browsers browsers going
to<00:01:27.690> save<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:28.950> point<00:01:29.250> usually<00:01:29.400> drag<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
to save that that point usually drag and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
to save that that point usually drag and
drop<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.450> power<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> micro-pay<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:32.070> your

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
drop the power to you micro-pay to your

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
drop the power to you micro-pay to your
spirit<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.910> you<00:01:33.000> were<00:01:33.210> yours<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.200> very

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
spirit so you were yours here it's very

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.900 
spirit so you were yours here it's very
simple<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.130> case<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> little

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
simple in this case we have a little

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.060 
simple in this case we have a little
application<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.630> does<00:01:36.660> that<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.050> us<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
application that does that for us and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.300 
application that does that for us and
you<00:01:38.160> can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.210> happened<00:01:40.310> you'll

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you can see when this happened you'll

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.620 
you can see when this happened you'll
see<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.910> light<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.149> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> be

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
see that the light is going to be

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.160 
see that the light is going to be
blinking<00:01:43.759> MacLeod<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.149> means<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.690> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
blinking MacLeod so that means here is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.380 
blinking MacLeod so that means here is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
copying the firmware into the back of it
