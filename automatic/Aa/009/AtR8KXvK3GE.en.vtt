00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
gonna show you the importance of

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.200 
gonna show you the importance of
weighing<00:00:03.990> your<00:00:04.640> ingredients<00:00:05.640> rather<00:00:05.819> than

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
weighing your ingredients rather than

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.540 
weighing your ingredients rather than
using<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.600> measuring<00:00:07.140> cups<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.560> why<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.400> that

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
using the measuring cups and why is that

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.040 
using the measuring cups and why is that
I'm<00:00:09.269> just<00:00:09.450> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.630> show<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.750> everything

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
I'm just going to show you everything

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.320 
I'm just going to show you everything
and<00:00:10.349> how<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.559> convert<00:00:11.040> from<00:00:11.370> cups<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.120> grams

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
and how to convert from cups to grams

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.570 
and how to convert from cups to grams
and<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.469> let's<00:00:13.650> get<00:00:13.799> started<00:00:14.160> with<00:00:14.340> this

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and so on so let's get started with this

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.000 
and so on so let's get started with this
measuring<00:00:15.030> 101<00:00:15.570> video<00:00:15.900> okay<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> get<00:00:16.949> started

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
measuring 101 video okay to get started

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.310 
measuring 101 video okay to get started
I'm<00:00:17.609> just<00:00:17.850> gonna<00:00:18.000> start<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.390> flour<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:19.080> have

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
I'm just gonna start with flour I have

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.439 
I'm just gonna start with flour I have
my<00:00:19.470> measuring<00:00:19.770> cup<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.160> here<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.150> two

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
my measuring cup in here and I have two

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.140 
my measuring cup in here and I have two
different<00:00:21.779> brand<00:00:22.650> measuring<00:00:23.460> cups<00:00:23.670> let's<00:00:23.939> get

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
different brand measuring cups let's get

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.839 
different brand measuring cups let's get
started<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.410> I'll<00:00:25.529> take<00:00:25.740> 1<00:00:26.160> cup<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
started like this so I'll take 1 cup of

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.519 
started like this so I'll take 1 cup of
flour<00:00:28.099> doesn't<00:00:29.099> matter<00:00:29.250> which<00:00:29.490> kind<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.789> flour

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
flour doesn't matter which kind of flour

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.540 
flour doesn't matter which kind of flour
we're<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> show<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.219> difference

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
we're going to show you the difference

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.110 
we're going to show you the difference
it<00:00:32.700> makes

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
it makes

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.900 
it makes
for<00:00:33.719> example<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> recipe<00:00:34.559> asked<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.070> 100

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
for example the recipe asked for 100

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
for example the recipe asked for 100
gram<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.329> flour

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
gram of flour

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
gram of flour
now<00:00:37.440> imagine<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.120> scrape

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
now imagine if you do this and scrape

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.250 
now imagine if you do this and scrape
your<00:00:40.020> measuring<00:00:40.649> cup<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:42.050> okay<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
your measuring cup like that okay and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
your measuring cup like that okay and
rather<00:00:43.890> than<00:00:44.190> using<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> knife<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
rather than using it with a knife or a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
rather than using it with a knife or a
spatula<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.110> let's<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.620> how<00:00:46.890> much<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.309> out

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
spatula so let's see how much we get out

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.720 
spatula so let's see how much we get out
of<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:50.239> we<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.989> 100<00:00:52.920> grams<00:00:53.129> exactly

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
of this we got here 100 grams exactly

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.720 
of this we got here 100 grams exactly
and<00:00:54.140> 1<00:00:55.140> cup<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.590> flour<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.430> wanting

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and 1 cup of flour is actually wanting

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.330 
and 1 cup of flour is actually wanting
to<00:00:56.850> end<00:00:57.030> 20<00:00:57.539> grams<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.129> first

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to end 20 grams so that's the first

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.610 
to end 20 grams so that's the first
difference<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.910> 20<00:01:00.270> grams<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.899> difference<00:01:01.379> see

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
difference so 20 grams of difference see

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.299 
difference so 20 grams of difference see
how<00:01:01.829> much<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> give<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.420> change<00:01:04.379> or

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
how much it's going to give a change or

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.740 
how much it's going to give a change or
actually<00:01:05.820> how<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> change<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
actually how it's going to change the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually how it's going to change the
result<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.890> let's<00:01:08.189> try<00:01:08.549> doing<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.510> this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
result so let's try doing it with this

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.530 
result so let's try doing it with this
brand<00:01:10.229> come<00:01:13.820> some<00:01:14.820> people<00:01:14.939> shake<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> like

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
brand come some people shake it like

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.730 
brand come some people shake it like
that<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:16.110> also<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that that's also going to make a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.359 
that that's also going to make a
difference

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
difference

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
difference
so<00:01:17.700> let's<00:01:17.939> scrape<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.380> did<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
so let's scrape it like we did in the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.310 
so let's scrape it like we did in the
other<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.420> let's<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.570> how<00:01:21.689> much<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.110> out

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
other one let's see how much we get out

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.469 
other one let's see how much we get out
of<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:23.990> here<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.970> 115<00:01:26.970> grams<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.439> 15<00:01:28.979> more

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
of this here we got 115 grams so 15 more

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
of this here we got 115 grams so 15 more
actually<00:01:30.479> grams<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
actually grams so that's also going to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
actually grams so that's also going to
make<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> difference<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.869> use<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> knife

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
make a difference and if you use a knife

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.780 
make a difference and if you use a knife
as<00:01:34.829> well<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> make<00:01:35.520> more

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
as well it's going to make more

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.810 
as well it's going to make more
difference<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> recipe<00:01:37.110> asks<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.979> 100

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
difference so if the recipe asks for 100

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.270 
difference so if the recipe asks for 100
grams<00:01:39.000> exactly<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.990> flour<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.920> want<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> use

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
grams exactly if flour you want to use

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.090 
grams exactly if flour you want to use
the<00:01:41.400> 100<00:01:41.790> grams<00:01:42.090> measured<00:01:42.840> by<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.590> weighting

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the 100 grams measured by a weighting

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
the 100 grams measured by a weighting
measure<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> scale<00:01:45.090> or<00:01:45.119> something<00:01:45.600> but

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
measure like a scale or something but

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.179 
measure like a scale or something but
you<00:01:46.110> don't<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> use<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> cups<00:01:46.890> because

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you don't want to use the cups because

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.030 
you don't want to use the cups because
as<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.530> 220<00:01:49.530> grams<00:01:49.680> sorry

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
as you can see we have 220 grams sorry

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
as you can see we have 220 grams sorry
if<00:01:50.250> difference<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> change

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
if difference and that's going to change

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.810 
if difference and that's going to change
your<00:01:52.200> result<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.619> cake<00:01:52.799> sometimes<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.640> they

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
your result of cake sometimes if they

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.270 
your result of cake sometimes if they
are<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.570> recipe<00:01:54.750> asks<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.799> 100

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
are if the recipe asks for like 100

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.789 
are if the recipe asks for like 100
grams<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.000> put<00:01:57.259> 120<00:01:58.259> grams<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
grams and you put 120 grams in the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
grams and you put 120 grams in the
recipe<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.549> going<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> make<00:01:59.850> your<00:01:59.939> batter

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
recipe it's going to make your batter

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.179 
recipe it's going to make your batter
thicker<00:02:00.600> actually<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> give<00:02:02.070> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
thicker actually it's going to give a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.459 
thicker actually it's going to give a
denser<00:02:02.579> result<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.479> sometimes<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> ask<00:02:04.170> why

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
denser result so sometimes you ask why

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
denser result so sometimes you ask why
does<00:02:04.680> my<00:02:04.829> cake<00:02:05.009> look<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.579> because<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
does my cake look like that because you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.540 
does my cake look like that because you
use<00:02:06.329> those<00:02:06.570> cups<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.920> weight<00:02:08.129> that

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
use those cups and use the weight that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.749 
use those cups and use the weight that
and<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> weight<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> most

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
and actually the weight is the most

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.080 
and actually the weight is the most
exact<00:02:11.409> way<00:02:12.409> of<00:02:12.680> using<00:02:12.920> your<00:02:13.129> ingredients<00:02:13.970> so

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.759 
it in a like a heart shape it's gotta
give<00:04:10.449> you<00:04:10.569> less<00:04:10.780> because<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.319> less<00:04:11.530> space

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
give you less because the less space

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.339 
give you less because the less space
it's<00:04:12.280> going<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.519> fit<00:04:12.729> in<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.509> almonds<00:04:14.019> they

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
it's going to fit in the almonds they

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.499 
it's going to fit in the almonds they
won't<00:04:14.620> have<00:04:14.769> such<00:04:14.979> space<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.459> fit<00:04:15.639> in<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.150> it

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
won't have such space to fit in so it

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.800 
won't have such space to fit in so it
might<00:04:16.780> be<00:04:16.989> like<00:04:17.139> 100<00:04:17.709> nanograms<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.389> you're

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
might be like 100 nanograms so if you're

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.509 
might be like 100 nanograms so if you're
using<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.409> scale<00:04:20.709> it's<00:04:21.099> going<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.310> give<00:04:21.430> you

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
using the scale it's going to give you

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.879 
using the scale it's going to give you
exactly<00:04:21.970> what<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.570> recipe<00:04:22.840> asks<00:04:23.110> for<00:04:23.620> and

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
exactly what the recipe asks for and

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.310 
exactly what the recipe asks for and
that's<00:04:24.729> what<00:04:25.000> makes<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.360> difference<00:04:25.750> in<00:04:25.990> the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
that's what makes the difference in the

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.529 
that's what makes the difference in the
end<00:04:26.680> result<00:04:27.130> if<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.400> have<00:04:28.090> anything<00:04:28.570> jams<00:04:29.440> or

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
end result if you have anything jams or

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.600 
end result if you have anything jams or
it's<00:04:31.539> stuff<00:04:31.870> or<00:04:32.080> anything<00:04:32.320> any<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:33.070> results

it's stuff or anything any it results

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.210 
it's stuff or anything any it results
that<00:04:34.180> our<00:04:34.360> problems<00:04:34.840> actually<00:04:35.110> or<00:04:35.560> negative

that our problems actually or negative

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.029 
that our problems actually or negative
stuff<00:04:36.490> that's<00:04:37.000> why<00:04:37.210> you're<00:04:37.389> not<00:04:37.539> using<00:04:38.039> that's

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
stuff that's why you're not using that's

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.980 
stuff that's why you're not using that's
why<00:04:39.190> because<00:04:39.400> you're<00:04:39.820> using<00:04:40.180> those<00:04:40.599> measuring

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
why because you're using those measuring

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.830 
why because you're using those measuring

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 
is not that expensive like I think I

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.300 
is not that expensive like I think I
read<00:05:07.340> this<00:05:07.460> for<00:05:07.789> like<00:05:07.940> $10<00:05:08.629> and<00:05:08.930> it's<00:05:09.919> very

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
very good to have I swear you're going

very good to have I swear you're going
to<00:05:12.289> get<00:05:12.440> better<00:05:12.949> results<00:05:13.159> because<00:05:13.789> like

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
to get better results because like

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.010 
to get better results because like
imagine<00:05:15.229> fusing<00:05:15.740> 20<00:05:16.400> more<00:05:16.940> grams<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.449> anything

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
imagine fusing 20 more grams of anything

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.390 
imagine fusing 20 more grams of anything
that's<00:05:18.289> going<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.530> ruin<00:05:18.740> your<00:05:18.919> recipe<00:05:19.370> and

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
that's going to ruin your recipe and

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.210 
that's going to ruin your recipe and
baking<00:05:20.000> is<00:05:20.180> science<00:05:20.659> so<00:05:21.139> anything<00:05:21.650> is<00:05:21.800> exact

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
baking is science so anything is exact

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.240 
baking is science so anything is exact
is<00:05:22.460> better<00:05:22.849> using<00:05:23.449> it<00:05:23.599> I<00:05:23.720> think<00:05:24.169> is<00:05:24.409> used<00:05:24.770> with

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
is better using it I think is used with

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.399 
is better using it I think is used with
those<00:05:25.430> cups<00:05:25.759> so<00:05:26.180> those<00:05:26.449> cups<00:05:26.720> are<00:05:26.870> our

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
those cups so those cups are our

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.879 
those cups so those cups are our
for<00:05:28.310> me<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.699> don't<00:05:29.539> really<00:05:29.720> use<00:05:30.379> them<00:05:30.409> that<00:05:30.830> much

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
for me I don't really use them that much

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.550 
for me I don't really use them that much
as<00:05:31.550> much<00:05:31.849> as<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.060> used<00:05:32.090> chaos<00:05:32.750> because<00:05:32.960> skills

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
as much as I used chaos because skills

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.020 
as much as I used chaos because skills
will<00:05:33.860> give<00:05:34.039> me<00:05:34.190> a<00:05:34.220> better<00:05:34.370> result<00:05:34.759> in<00:05:34.879> the<00:05:34.909> end

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
will give me a better result in the end

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.210 
will give me a better result in the end
of<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.300> thing<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.720> if<00:05:36.440> you're<00:05:36.680> willing<00:05:37.190> to

of the thing and if you're willing to
use<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:38.210> cups<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:38.810> risk<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:40.430> like<00:05:41.300> the

use the cups and risk the like the
results<00:05:41.810> are<00:05:41.930> getting<00:05:42.229> feel<00:05:42.710> free<00:05:42.889> to<00:05:42.919> use
