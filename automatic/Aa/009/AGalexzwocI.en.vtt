 and stony stay that are sent to you 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.370
 How many times have I wanted to gather your children?

 a hen gathers her chicks under her wings 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.190

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.690
 it will not stay one stone on the other here, not broken 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.690
 will 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.799
 in the year 70 AD 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.409
 This prophecy of Christ over the city of Jerusalem was fulfilled 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.599
 the Roman legions under Titus made the city and the temple the 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.599
 Earth equal 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.279
 today archaeologists deal with today's Euros all the 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.279
 To rediscover traces of the past 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:41.869
 many individual customers are silent witnesses of the terrible events of those 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.169
 past times 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.959
 pte 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.229
 this is the ground on which Jesus gives 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:52.819
 From this point on, he will be out of anger building Jugo Salems with his 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.529
 have looked at great temples 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:59.089
 yet no stone should remain on the other as Jesus said 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.089
 would have 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.649
 if Marcel predicted that would happen 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.649
 with frightening accuracy 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.809
 who is this Jesus? 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:24.040
 He is one of those calamity prophets who only disturb death by misery and judgment 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.899
 speak 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.899
 or is more behind it 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.269
 this is the country where he was born 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.219
 because the teachers in northern Israel is the area where he grew up 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.099
 Here he is with his friends 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.029
 and here he spoke to people who came to him 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.379
 to listen to live or cure diseases in the summer 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.169
 and that is it 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.219
 He gave them bread to eat and the living water for their hearts 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.549
 and Jesus spoke to them 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.919
 I am the bread of life 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.539
 he who comes to me will not come 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:21.939
 and who does not believe 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.939

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.500
 It will be a source of water to India that flexes the libraries

 and I want to make you into people 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.949
 He said that to them and they followed seven and listened to what he said 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.819
 had to be able to and some of them got on everything they saw and 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:51.819
 heard rank 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.189
 In this way, the books of the New Testament originated these books 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:01.599
 tell us about the deep trenches that Jesus removes for the poor 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.819
 b They report and tell them about his cutting comments on the 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.889
 Spiritual guides of his time and she does not join us from his death 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:18.440
 as it were the sacrificial lamb was slain and how he started on the cross No but this 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.080
 is not the end 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.330
 because the story continues after that come from the dead 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:28.830
 his friends saw him 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.910
 he was still talking to him here with him on the shores of the Sea of ​​Galilee 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.240
 Finally, he said goodbye to him but as he said 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:40.529
 not forever 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.210
 because that's the way it is said 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.190
 I will come back at the end of times to make all things new 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.009
 His friends gave their lives for this resurrected Jesus 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.339
 the new life that Jesus could offer 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:55.810
 was more valuable to her 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.810
 as her own Turkish possessions 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.699
 they started to hear everyone who wanted to talk about it 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.699
 and very quickly, small groups of believers emerged everywhere 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.330
 they were called Christians 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
 Followers of Jesus Christ 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:30.129
 I gave the first report to Theophilus 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:35.379
 from all that Jesus taught from the beginning to Edwards and taught until the day 

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:38.379
 where he was taken to heaven 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.449
 This is what Luke writes about a Greek Hartz who himself is all about Jesus 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.489
 had happened around very carefully 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.650
 his accounts the lukas gospel the Acts of the Apostles are two of the 27th

 Books of the New Testament 

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:08.879
 14 other writings of the New Testament are by Paulus 

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:14.279
 Paul was someone who, from childhood, was firmly rooted in Jewish faith 

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:14.999
 was 

00:08:14.999 --> 00:08:17.909
