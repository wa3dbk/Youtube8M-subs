much<00:01:50.549> better<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.590> when<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> comes<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
much better and when it comes to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.420 
much better and when it comes to
drifting<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.180> lot<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.540> easier<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.430> see
