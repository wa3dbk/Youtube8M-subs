everyone's<00:00:19.940> on<00:00:20.120> a<00:00:20.150> massive<00:00:20.390> learning<00:00:20.660> curve

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
everyone's on a massive learning curve

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.260 
everyone's on a massive learning curve
of<00:00:21.350> trying<00:00:21.590> to<00:00:21.680> deal<00:00:22.430> with<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.790> new<00:00:22.940> power

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
of trying to deal with the new power

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.940 
of trying to deal with the new power
units<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:23.960> yet<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.500> proper<00:00:24.800> energy

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
units and yet the proper energy

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.180 
units and yet the proper energy
deployment<00:00:25.400> strategies<00:00:26.740> yeah<00:00:27.740> we've<00:00:28.160> been

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
deployment strategies yeah we've been

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.600 
deployment strategies yeah we've been
slowly<00:00:28.640> methodically<00:00:28.940> working<00:00:29.690> through

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
slowly methodically working through

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.520 
slowly methodically working through
improving<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:31.820> car<00:00:32.029> in<00:00:32.210> all<00:00:32.330> areas<00:00:32.840> really<00:00:33.350> so

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
improving the car in all areas really so

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.370 
improving the car in all areas really so
her<00:00:33.710> s<00:00:33.920> was<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:35.270> know<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.420> steady<00:00:35.809> start<00:00:36.110> and

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
her s was you know a steady start and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.810 
her s was you know a steady start and
careful<00:00:36.710> introduction<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.309> checking<00:00:37.640> all<00:00:37.730> the

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
careful introduction of checking all the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.000 
careful introduction of checking all the
systems<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.510> then<00:00:39.170> we've<00:00:39.320> been<00:00:39.470> working<00:00:39.680> up

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
systems and then we've been working up

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.190 
systems and then we've been working up
through<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.520> Bahrain<00:00:40.940> test<00:00:41.239> two<00:00:41.510> what's

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
through the to Bahrain test two what's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.720 
through the to Bahrain test two what's
going<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.470> be<00:00:42.559> closer<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:43.100> our<00:00:43.390> potential<00:00:44.390> race

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
going to be closer to our potential race

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.520 
going to be closer to our potential race
potential<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:47.960> think<00:00:48.140> over<00:00:48.350> those<00:00:48.500> three

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
potential and I think over those three

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.229 
potential and I think over those three
tests<00:00:49.160> you<00:00:49.309> know<00:00:49.370> we've<00:00:49.550> learned<00:00:49.790> you<00:00:50.120> know<00:00:50.180> a

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
tests you know we've learned you know a

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.110 
tests you know we've learned you know a
huge<00:00:50.629> amount<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:52.070> know<00:00:52.129> just<00:00:52.370> trying<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.879> deal

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
huge amount you know just trying to deal

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.579 
huge amount you know just trying to deal
with<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:54.739> complexity<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:56.030> power<00:00:56.239> unit

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
with the complexity of the power unit

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.990 
with the complexity of the power unit
even<00:00:57.589> in<00:00:57.710> terms<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.010> engineering<00:00:58.610> of<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.790> car

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
even in terms of engineering of the car

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.399 
even in terms of engineering of the car
and<00:00:59.150> all<00:00:59.269> the<00:00:59.390> interactions<00:00:59.629> of<00:01:00.110> all<00:01:00.290> the

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
and all the interactions of all the

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.740 
and all the interactions of all the
different<00:01:00.680> control<00:01:00.949> systems<00:01:01.400> is<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.059> huge<00:01:02.449> task

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
different control systems is a huge task

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.030 
different control systems is a huge task
and<00:01:03.080> you<00:01:03.110> know<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.290> track<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.680> really<00:01:03.949> the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
and you know the track is really the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.950 
and you know the track is really the
only<00:01:04.070> place<00:01:04.460> where<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.479> really<00:01:05.810> actually

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
only place where you you really actually

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.500 
only place where you you really actually
learn<00:01:06.320> how<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.650> deal<00:01:06.920> with<00:01:06.950> all<00:01:07.159> of<00:01:07.310> those<00:01:07.510> as

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
learn how to deal with all of those as

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.940 
learn how to deal with all of those as
we<00:01:08.659> head<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.930> Melbourne<00:01:09.080> for<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.560> start<00:01:09.800> of

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
we head to Melbourne for the start of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.540 
we head to Melbourne for the start of
the<00:01:09.979> year<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.460> mean<00:01:10.850> obviously<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:12.409> know

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
the year I mean obviously the you know

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.910 
the year I mean obviously the you know
the<00:01:13.550> concept<00:01:13.970> of<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.270> race<00:01:14.479> will<00:01:15.229> change

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the concept of a race will change

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.610 
the concept of a race will change
dramatically<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.150> reliability<00:01:17.659> I<00:01:18.140> think<00:01:18.470> you

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
dramatically and reliability I think you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.930 
dramatically and reliability I think you
know<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:18.860> start<00:01:19.100> with<00:01:19.340> that's<00:01:19.549> going<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.850> be

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
know to start with that's going to be

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.850 
know to start with that's going to be
challenged<00:01:20.450> just<00:01:21.049> for<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.229> sheer<00:01:21.409> complexity

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
challenged just for the sheer complexity

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.280 
challenged just for the sheer complexity
of<00:01:22.010> cars<00:01:22.310> obviously<00:01:22.850> there<00:01:23.060> see<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.960> normal

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
of cars obviously there see the normal

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.020 
of cars obviously there see the normal
arrow<00:01:24.500> performance<00:01:25.190> side<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.550> things<00:01:25.730> and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
arrow performance side of things and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.640 
arrow performance side of things and
that<00:01:26.390> performance<00:01:26.810> development<00:01:27.050> needs<00:01:27.530> to

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
that performance development needs to

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.980 
that performance development needs to
keep<00:01:27.770> going<00:01:28.070> all<00:01:28.220> through<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.580> year

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
keep going all through the year

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.970 
keep going all through the year
obviously<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.080> big<00:01:30.260> factor<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.830> we've

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
obviously the big factor that we've

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.400 
obviously the big factor that we've
added<00:01:31.190> for<00:01:31.520> this<00:01:31.640> year<00:01:31.940> is<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:33.170> know<00:01:33.290> the

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
added for this year is the you know the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.960 
added for this year is the you know the
powertrain<00:01:33.650> how<00:01:34.220> we<00:01:34.280> optimize<00:01:34.790> the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
powertrain how we optimize the

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.330 
powertrain how we optimize the
powertrain<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.830> getting<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.920> most<00:01:37.040> out<00:01:37.280> of

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
powertrain and getting the most out of

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.460 
powertrain and getting the most out of
it<00:01:37.520> both<00:01:37.760> in<00:01:37.970> qualifying<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.320> race

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
it both in qualifying and in the race

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.430 
it both in qualifying and in the race
and<00:01:39.500> some<00:01:40.040> races<00:01:40.490> where<00:01:40.670> fuel<00:01:41.330> limited<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:42.320> all

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
and some races where fuel limited we all

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.350 
and some races where fuel limited we all
have<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.650> work<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:43.130> how<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.370> best<00:01:43.760> way<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.000> save

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
have to work on how the best way to save

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.570 
have to work on how the best way to save
fuel<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.960> also<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.530> minimize<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.370> fuel

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
fuel and also to minimize the fuel

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.710 
fuel and also to minimize the fuel
consumption<00:01:47.120> so<00:01:47.300> there's<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.540> lot<00:01:47.660> more

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
consumption so there's a lot more

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.230 
consumption so there's a lot more
factors<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.530> year<00:01:48.830> which<00:01:49.460> will<00:01:49.670> affect<00:01:50.090> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
factors this year which will affect the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.050 
factors this year which will affect the
end<00:01:50.360> race<00:01:50.570> result<00:01:50.960> we<00:01:51.410> can<00:01:51.740> burn<00:01:51.890> fuel<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.610> try

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
end race result we can burn fuel to try

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.300 
end race result we can burn fuel to try
and<00:01:53.210> recover<00:01:53.480> energy<00:01:53.780> from<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.440> motor<00:01:55.010> that's

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
and recover energy from the motor that's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.730 
and recover energy from the motor that's
on<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.550> turbo<00:01:55.900> we<00:01:56.900> can<00:01:57.050> put<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.380> straight

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
on the turbo we can put that straight

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.590 
on the turbo we can put that straight
