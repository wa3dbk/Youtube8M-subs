Oh

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.690 

this<00:00:54.170> is<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.320> five<00:00:54.650> axis<00:00:55.160> state-of-the-art

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
this is a five axis state-of-the-art

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.510 
this is a five axis state-of-the-art
water<00:00:56.120> jet<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.020> water<00:00:57.350> comes<00:00:57.650> out<00:00:57.800> at<00:00:57.950> 2,000

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
water jet the water comes out at 2,000

water jet the water comes out at 2,000
miles<00:00:58.640> an<00:00:58.790> hour<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.180> cut<00:00:59.870> anything<00:01:00.230> and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
miles an hour and cut anything and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:23.530 
miles an hour and cut anything and
believe<00:01:00.800> me<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.130> get<00:01:01.280> anything

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:37.690 

yeah<00:01:24.540> fine<00:01:24.990> made<00:01:30.470> solid<00:01:31.470> sodium<00:01:32.070> hydroxide

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.390 

which<00:01:38.270> in<00:01:38.479> principle<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:39.710> react<00:01:40.070> with<00:01:40.340> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
which in principle to react with the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.140 
which in principle to react with the
butter<00:01:41.650> though<00:01:42.650> we<00:01:43.040> may<00:01:43.220> need<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.460> add<00:01:43.580> little

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
butter though we may need to add little

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.350 
butter though we may need to add little
water<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:45.080> melted<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.680> butter

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
water it's melted the butter

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.820 
water it's melted the butter
unfortunately<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:48.229> wouldn't<00:01:48.470> want<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.740> eat

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
unfortunately you wouldn't want to eat

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.649 
unfortunately you wouldn't want to eat
the<00:01:49.040> batter<00:01:49.220> after<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:49.880> whereas<00:01:50.330> with<00:01:50.570> the

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
the batter after this whereas with the

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.960 
the batter after this whereas with the
laser<00:01:50.869> or<00:01:51.320> some<00:01:51.619> of<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.890> others<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:52.490> would<00:01:52.909> be

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
laser or some of the others it would be

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.899 
laser or some of the others it would be
fine<00:01:53.740> with<00:01:54.740> this<00:01:54.890> you've<00:01:55.220> turned<00:01:55.520> your<00:01:55.640> batter

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
fine with this you've turned your batter

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.859 
fine with this you've turned your batter
into<00:01:56.210> soap<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.180> think<00:01:59.240> we're<00:01:59.509> just<00:01:59.539> about

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
into soap so I think we're just about

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.109 
into soap so I think we're just about
there<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.560> mean<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:01.340> when<00:02:01.549> we've<00:02:01.700> washed

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
there I mean it so when we've washed

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.260 
there I mean it so when we've washed
everything<00:02:02.600> away<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:04.100> can<00:02:04.369> see<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.939> we<00:02:05.240> are

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
everything away you can see that we are

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.929 
everything away you can see that we are
we<00:02:06.049> have<00:02:06.080> separated<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.189> butter<00:02:07.399> into<00:02:07.789> two

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
we have separated the butter into two

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:08.790 
we have separated the butter into two
pieces

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
pieces

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.770 
pieces
but<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:10.369> dead<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.090> nobody<00:02:11.630> would

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
but it's so dead that nobody would

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.270 
but it's so dead that nobody would
really<00:02:11.989> want<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.560> at<00:02:12.739> all

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
really want it at all

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.670 
really want it at all
so<00:02:13.489> I<00:02:13.760> regard<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.019> complete<00:02:15.500> failure

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
so I regard this as a complete failure

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.490 
so I regard this as a complete failure
as<00:02:16.250> an<00:02:16.370> experiment<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.049> shows<00:02:18.260> it's

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
as an experiment that it shows it's

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.900 
as an experiment that it shows it's
possible

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.970
