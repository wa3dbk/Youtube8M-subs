00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
so really quickly what's going on so our

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.839 
so really quickly what's going on so our
our<00:00:05.460> goal<00:00:05.640> here<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.830> to<00:00:07.830> develop<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.970> method<00:00:09.780> of

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
our goal here is to develop a method of

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.169 
our goal here is to develop a method of
cutting<00:00:12.019> wheel<00:00:13.019> wells<00:00:13.440> into<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.460> skateboard

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
cutting wheel wells into a skateboard

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.910 
cutting wheel wells into a skateboard
deck<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.850> perfect<00:00:18.920> alignment

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
deck so that you have perfect alignment

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.570 
deck so that you have perfect alignment
yeah<00:00:20.840> perfect<00:00:21.840> conjunction<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:23.369> your

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
yeah perfect conjunction with your

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.150 
yeah perfect conjunction with your
wheels<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.689> your<00:00:24.869> deck<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> basically<00:00:26.689> this<00:00:27.689> is

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
wheels to your deck so basically this is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.840 
wheels to your deck so basically this is
a<00:00:29.160> way<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.810> cutting<00:00:30.810> your<00:00:31.230> wheels<00:00:31.650> into<00:00:32.219> your

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
a way of cutting your wheels into your

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.880 
a way of cutting your wheels into your
deck<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.989> basically<00:00:34.760> we<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.690> idea<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.440> how

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
deck so basically we have an idea of how

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.280 
deck so basically we have an idea of how
it's<00:00:38.100> gonna<00:00:38.219> work<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.790> basically<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.870> took<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
it's gonna work we basically we took a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.799 
it's gonna work we basically we took a
truck<00:00:41.570> put<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> Chuck<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.809> built

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
truck put it into the Chuck and built

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.420 
truck put it into the Chuck and built
this<00:00:46.230> around<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:48.420> full<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.649> maximum<00:00:50.190> deck

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this around it at full at maximum deck

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819 
this around it at full at maximum deck
tip<00:00:50.640> yeah<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.660> basically<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> jig

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
tip yeah so basically we have a jig

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.209 
tip yeah so basically we have a jig
that'll<00:00:53.460> hold<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> deck<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.840> angles<00:00:55.320> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that'll hold the deck at the angles that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.599 
that'll hold the deck at the angles that
a<00:00:56.489> deck<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.930> at<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.859> were<00:00:59.100> tipped<00:00:59.430> all

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
a deck would be at if it were tipped all

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.250 
a deck would be at if it were tipped all
the<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.850> over<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.449> yeah<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.899> now<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.140> have

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the way over so yeah so now we just have

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.549 
the way over so yeah so now we just have
to<00:01:01.350> figure<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:02.480> how<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> make<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.019> work<00:01:04.080> yes

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to figure out how to make that work yes

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.210 
to figure out how to make that work yes
this<00:01:04.920> spinning<00:01:05.750> saw<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.170> basically<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.979> wheel

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
this spinning saw is basically the wheel

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.090 
this spinning saw is basically the wheel
and<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.689> basically<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> deck<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.860> there

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and this is basically the deck but there

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.210 
and this is basically the deck but there
are<00:01:11.189> two<00:01:11.369> different<00:01:11.760> things<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.390> they're

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
are two different things but they're

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.859 
are two different things but they're
aligned<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.390> they're<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> same

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
aligned to be like they're the same

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
aligned to be like they're the same
thing<00:01:16.200> yeah<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> don't<00:01:17.009> know<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.549> go

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
thing yeah so I don't know here we go

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
thing yeah so I don't know here we go
let's<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.479> happens<00:01:19.100> safety

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
let's just see what happens safety

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:31.749 
let's just see what happens safety
glasses<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.700> highly<00:01:21.030> recommended

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.139 

well<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.170> did<00:01:34.170> cut<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.759> promising

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
well it did cut so that's it's promising

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.370 
well it did cut so that's it's promising
what<00:01:39.149> is<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.450> about<00:01:39.630> experiments

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
what is it you like about experiments

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.169 
what is it you like about experiments
David<00:01:40.710> okay<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.250> what<00:01:41.399> I<00:01:41.429> like<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:41.729> doing

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
David okay so what I like about doing

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.160 
David okay so what I like about doing
these<00:01:42.329> experiments<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.170> helps

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
these experiments is you know it helps

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.679 
these experiments is you know it helps
to<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> first<00:01:47.039> time<00:01:47.539> but<00:01:48.539> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
to get it right the first time but it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.870 
to get it right the first time but it
doesn't<00:01:49.049> necessarily<00:01:49.710> need<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.009> right

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:06.919 

those<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> rules<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.689> live<00:01:54.840> by<00:02:05.929> my

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
those are the rules we live by my

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.620 
those are the rules we live by my
hearing<00:02:07.860> isn't<00:02:08.039> as<00:02:08.369> sharp<00:02:08.819> as<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.060> used<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.450> be

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
hearing isn't as sharp as it used to be

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.559 
hearing isn't as sharp as it used to be
but<00:02:10.140> her<00:02:10.289> pencils<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.769> my<00:02:11.430> pencils<00:02:11.910> are<00:02:14.569> this

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
but her pencils are my pencils are this

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.180 
but her pencils are my pencils are this
is<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> first<00:02:16.049> attempt<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.799> second

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
is the first attempt this is the second

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.620 
is the first attempt this is the second
attempt<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:20.400> very<00:02:20.700> successful<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:21.599> far

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
attempt and it's very successful as far

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:35.039 
attempt and it's very successful as far
as<00:02:21.989> I'm<00:02:22.170> concerned

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.140 

okay<00:02:36.049> now<00:02:36.349> your<00:02:36.709> job<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.159> to<00:02:37.190> figure<00:02:37.459> out<00:02:37.700> how

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
okay now your job is to figure out how

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.670 
okay now your job is to figure out how
to<00:02:38.180> consistently<00:02:38.900> line<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.319> up<00:02:39.379> with<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
to consistently line it up with the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.630 
to consistently line it up with the
right<00:02:39.860> place

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
right place

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.289 
right place
every<00:02:41.360> single<00:02:41.690> time<00:02:42.489> whoa

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
every single time whoa

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.300 
every single time whoa
I<00:02:44.330> only<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.140> right<00:02:45.379> most<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.099> time

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
I only get it right most of the time

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.630 
I only get it right most of the time
every<00:02:47.150> time<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.330> got<00:02:53.510> there<00:02:53.810> David

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
every time what you got there David

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.589 
every time what you got there David
pivot<00:02:55.640> righty

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
pivot righty

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.470 
pivot righty
better<00:02:57.019> see<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:58.430> stops<00:02:58.849> something<00:02:59.150> on

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
better see it's it stops something on

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.770 
better see it's it stops something on
top<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.200> then<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.470> rolls<00:03:01.000> like<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.090> pivot<00:03:02.420> piggy

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
top and then it rolls like a pivot piggy

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:14.369 
top and then it rolls like a pivot piggy
mm-hmm<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.730> don't<00:03:04.730> get<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:10.629> I<00:03:12.310> need<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.340> marble

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
mm-hmm I don't get it I need a marble

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.759 
mm-hmm I don't get it I need a marble
yeah<00:03:15.379> here<00:03:15.829> we<00:03:15.859> go

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
yeah here we go
