00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
easiest way but probably not the easiest

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.300 
easiest way but probably not the easiest
for<00:00:29.099> your<00:00:29.250> computer<00:00:29.779> but<00:00:30.779> yeah<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.950> we<00:00:32.130> will

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
for your computer but yeah so we will

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.180 
for your computer but yeah so we will
start<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> plane<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.860> am

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
start with a plane so actually I am

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
start with a plane so actually I am
narrating<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.850> after<00:00:36.239> recording<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
narrating this after recording so I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080 
narrating this after recording so I
might

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
might

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.610 
might
I'm<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.110> generation<00:00:40.739> might<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.250> accurate

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
I'm the generation might not be accurate

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.980 
I'm the generation might not be accurate
so<00:00:43.620> yeah<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.460> will<00:00:44.610> select<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.120> face<00:00:45.330> extrude

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
so yeah you will select the face extrude

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.910 
so yeah you will select the face extrude
it<00:00:46.700> make<00:00:47.700> sure<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.180> selected<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:48.990> go<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it make sure it's selected then go to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.190 
it make sure it's selected then go to
simulate<00:00:52.070> hair<00:00:53.070> objects<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.970> add<00:00:54.660> hair

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.860 

we<00:00:58.739> will<00:00:58.920> play<00:00:59.160> with<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.399> 16s<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.809> will

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we will play with the 16s a bit we will

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.840 
we will play with the 16s a bit we will
change<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> length<00:01:02.239> but<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:04.220> yeah<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
change the length but this yeah and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.980 
change the length but this yeah and
maybe<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> segments

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.340 

and<00:01:11.440> then<00:01:11.740> we<00:01:11.860> will<00:01:11.950> go<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.370> hair<00:01:12.610> material

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and then we will go to the hair material

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.680 
and then we will go to the hair material
hair<00:01:14.350> settings<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:15.100> well<00:01:15.430> tell<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.760> that<00:01:16.479> the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
hair settings and well tell it that the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.710

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
hair must be curly and be thick because

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.160 
hair must be curly and be thick because
the<00:01:22.720> hair<00:01:22.990> on<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.260> carpet<00:01:23.710> is<00:01:23.950> not<00:01:24.250> like<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
the hair on the carpet is not like the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.790 
the hair on the carpet is not like the
hair<00:01:26.440> on<00:01:26.590> your<00:01:26.619> head<00:01:26.799> it's<00:01:27.430> not<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.850> thin<00:01:31.800> now

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
we will create a new variable we will

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.460 
we will create a new variable we will
load<00:01:38.470> animation<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.630> will<00:01:40.750> find<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.320> the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
load animation you will find it in the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.450 
load animation you will find it in the
description<00:01:41.740> below<00:01:45.420> choose<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.600> filter<00:01:46.869> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
description below choose the filter and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.639 
description below choose the filter and
we<00:01:48.460> will<00:01:48.640> give<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:48.880> some<00:01:49.149> color

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
we will give it some color

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.859 
we will give it some color
because<00:01:50.649> I<00:01:51.100> don't<00:01:51.369> want<00:01:51.580> it<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.789> be<00:01:51.940> that<00:01:52.600> black

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
because I don't want it to be that black

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.660 
because I don't want it to be that black
I<00:01:53.280> mean<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.460> white<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.979> sure<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.369> check

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
I mean that white make sure you check

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.570 
I mean that white make sure you check
colorize<00:01:58.440> otherwise<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.710> look<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.160> will<00:02:00.399> look

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
colorize otherwise it look it will look

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.790 
colorize otherwise it look it will look
weird<00:02:01.270> when<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.409> play<00:02:02.649> with<00:02:02.860> these<00:02:03.039> settings

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
weird when you play with these settings

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.290 
weird when you play with these settings
anyway<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:05.860> assign<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.610> material<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:07.270> the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
anyway you assign the material to the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.330 
anyway you assign the material to the
hair<00:02:07.600> object<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.649> today<00:02:09.190> plane<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:15.190> will

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
hair object and today plane and we will

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.600 
hair object and today plane and we will
change<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:15.790> projection<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.420> cubic<00:02:17.610> so

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
change the projection to cubic so

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.010 
change the projection to cubic so
without<00:02:18.910> egg<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.510> looks<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.079> bit<00:02:20.110> smaller

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.600 

we<00:02:24.920> will<00:02:25.100> add<00:02:25.660> some<00:02:26.660> light<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.100> see<00:02:28.340> what

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
we will add some light just to see what

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.140 
we will add some light just to see what
we're<00:02:28.820> working<00:02:28.850> at<00:02:29.620> what<00:02:30.620> we're<00:02:30.890> working<00:02:30.920> on

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.720 

change<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.330> infinite<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.430> check<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
change it to infinite and check the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.520 
change it to infinite and check the
shadows<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.390> check<00:02:38.660> physical<00:02:39.140> Sun<00:02:39.350> and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
shadows and check physical Sun and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.330 
shadows and check physical Sun and
physical<00:02:39.890> sky<00:02:44.080> now<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.140> some<00:02:45.440> very<00:02:45.710> basic

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
physical sky now to some very basic

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.780 
physical sky now to some very basic
render<00:02:46.880> settings<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.100> we<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.310> what

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
render settings just so we see what

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.040 
render settings just so we see what
we're<00:02:50.000> working<00:02:50.240> on

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
we're working on

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:59.630 
we're working on

to generate change the type to triangle

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.270 
to generate change the type to triangle
and<00:03:18.960> that<00:03:19.950> will<00:03:20.280> do<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.460> trick<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
and that will do the trick so for the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.530 
and that will do the trick so for the
final<00:03:23.490> render

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
final render

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.580 
final render
make<00:03:24.930> sure<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.980> crank<00:03:26.310> up<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:28.320> hair

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
make sure you crank up the the hair

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.430 
make sure you crank up the the hair
count<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.980> doesn't<00:03:32.280> look<00:03:32.490> ugly<00:03:33.260> or<00:03:34.260> stupid

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
count so it doesn't look ugly or stupid

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:50.400 
count so it doesn't look ugly or stupid
or<00:03:35.030> unrealistic

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.940 

that's<00:03:50.980> not<00:03:51.250> enough<00:03:51.520> you<00:03:52.090> really<00:03:52.450> need<00:03:52.660> to

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
that's not enough you really need to

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.310 
that's not enough you really need to
crank<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.130> up<00:03:54.250> that's<00:03:54.580> when<00:03:55.330> you<00:03:55.840> might<00:03:56.050> have

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
crank it up that's when you might have

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.760 
crank it up that's when you might have
some<00:03:56.560> problems<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:58.060> have<00:03:58.600> three<00:03:58.840> gigs<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.410> RAM

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
some problems I have three gigs of RAM

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.490 
some problems I have three gigs of RAM
and<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.850> think<00:04:01.180> that's<00:04:01.630> not<00:04:01.870> enough<00:04:02.170> -<00:04:03.630> well<00:04:04.630> the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
and I think that's not enough - well the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.090 
and I think that's not enough - well the
your<00:04:05.830> computer<00:04:06.430> will<00:04:06.700> suffer<00:04:07.710> during<00:04:08.710> the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
your computer will suffer during the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.090 
your computer will suffer during the
rendering<00:04:09.310> because<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.990> needs<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.590> load<00:04:11.800> all

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
rendering because it needs to load all

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.910 
rendering because it needs to load all
the<00:04:12.280> geometry<00:04:12.970> on<00:04:13.210> the<00:04:13.750> carpet<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.740> RAM

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
the geometry on the carpet to the RAM

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.110 
the geometry on the carpet to the RAM
and<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.880> gets<00:04:16.390> really<00:04:16.570> slow<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:18.280> just<00:04:18.730> copied

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
and it gets really slow so I just copied

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.750 
and it gets really slow so I just copied
the<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.870> carpet<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.100> scene<00:04:21.400> right<00:04:21.700> here

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
the the carpet to this scene right here

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.250 
the the carpet to this scene right here
that<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.330> already<00:04:22.590> made<00:04:24.420> we<00:04:25.420> will<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.780> will<00:04:25.900> play

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
that I already made we will I will play

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.930 
that I already made we will I will play
with<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.560> second<00:04:26.980> with<00:04:27.130> these<00:04:27.340> settings<00:04:27.580> a

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
with the second with these settings a

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.790 
with the second with these settings a
little<00:04:28.060> bit<00:04:28.300> more<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:29.610> then<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.670> will<00:04:30.970> do<00:04:31.180> a

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
little bit more and then I will do a

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:49.189 
little bit more and then I will do a
region<00:04:32.800> render<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.990> show<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.260> how<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.770> looks

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.709 

again<00:04:50.009> make<00:04:50.340> sure<00:04:50.370> that<00:04:50.849> you<00:04:51.150> crank<00:04:51.419> up<00:04:51.569> the

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
again make sure that you crank up the

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:55.159 
again make sure that you crank up the
hair<00:04:51.900> count<00:04:52.669> in<00:04:53.669> your<00:04:53.849> final<00:04:54.330> render<00:04:54.509> do

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
hair count in your final render do

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:03.399 
hair count in your final render do
something<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:56.219> you<00:04:56.430> think<00:04:57.680> looks<00:04:58.680> decent

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.679 

and<00:05:04.409> it<00:05:04.770> takes<00:05:04.979> a<00:05:05.129> while<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.370> render<00:05:05.759> the

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 
and it takes a while to render the

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.839 
and it takes a while to render the
shadows<00:05:07.289> between<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.979> hairs<00:05:08.219> here<00:05:08.550> is<00:05:08.699> the

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
shadows between the hairs here is the

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.339 
shadows between the hairs here is the
final<00:05:09.060> result<00:05:10.069> I<00:05:11.069> hope<00:05:11.699> you<00:05:11.849> liked<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.569> see

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
final result I hope you liked it and see

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.060 
final result I hope you liked it and see
you<00:05:13.379> in<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.680> next<00:05:13.979> one<00:05:14.129> peace
