00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.650
 very good guys and welcome to a 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.400
 new review of a mod 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.349
 in kraft 7.10 let's see a mod that the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.349
 it's really funny and the 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.769
 time it's a bit weird, well, because what 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:32.300
 we do is add worse swords or is 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.859
 for doris hores espadines I do not know how 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.710
 tell them the truth the question adds 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.719
 swords now and well so there what 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.640
 said with everything of blows but first 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.679
 we're going to have to kraft already from team 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.620
 here is the hit that I do not know exactly 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.870
 it's like the handle of the sword that is 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.760
 makes with three sticks and a gold ingot 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.269
 and from this we will be able to do 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.820
 the swords these rare worst in total 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.289
 There are eight well we have them here already in 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.969
 the inventory and be created to the 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.980
 next form the first the coal 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.559
 which is why it is done with two mines of 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.380
 coal and an agile and well as you can see 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.150
 has 132 uses below you can see it and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.980
 take 5 and let's try it with this one 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.080
 defense pig excuse me pig but it's 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.940
 which is that there are no pigs alive 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.280
 complete please 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.900
 I know they do not like that I killed pigs but 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.480
 but is that if not with what I try it 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.300
 dies good pig takes away 6 well in the 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.560
 issue takes away 6 life and is not so 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.960
 powerful that we say well the question 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.570
 remove 6 and well it's just a 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.370
 sword that removes 6 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.070
 the next is that we grabbed about 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.320
 how many there is the next is the iron 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.150
 ore short that has 132 uses and it 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.550
 character with 2 less and one agile 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.470
 torn we are going to record the estaquitas 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.750
 7 well it's a little stronger because 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.660
 our normal to be gold then 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.310
 we have the gold goal because of that 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.410
 two mirage what remains or are identical 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.390
 well simply that it has very few 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.250
 use and died the pig has very 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.590
 few uses actually has 26 points 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.510
 but no no not worth it is that we go 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.250
 let's throw it to the cliff there 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.890
 caés the next thing we have is to 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.960
 rex get that of rex with second 2 - of 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.009
 rest and one of hit and well let's 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.929
 try it because the truth that does not have 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.750
 much mystery removes seven and then it has 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.700
 132 uses is pretty good then 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.550
 we have the lapis lazuli with 2 - of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.640
 lapis lazuli and an agile and it seems to me 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.410
 that removes exactly that since it does not 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.170
 they remove a lot of good and in the next one that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.180
 we have is the fourth reason for that rare 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.830
 that is sung with less than four so 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.560
 we have to go to the limit and what it does 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.640
 because it also kills super rap in fact I 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.230
 it seems that I am wrong does not remove 8 removed 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.840
 do not kill wolverine remove 8 this from 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.519
 done removes a lot and well if this 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.709
 it's pretty good that's the same 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.450
 strong with the diamond and it has 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.720
 by with your feces the bad then we have 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.760
 the gold diamond that is has a 1200 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.799
 uses and this one logically ballasting with 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.320
 less of diamond like that more going to 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.830
 do not antonio please remove 8 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.239
 also like that of the quartz and 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.010
 it kills the pigs fast enough 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.900
 excuse me for killing so many pigs 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.220
 I do not really want to do it but it's 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.260
 only one review so guys 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.420
 quiet please and finally 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.860
 we have the emerald why that grace 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.019
 with two emerald mines that is more 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.500
 difficult but it has eight attack damage 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.150
 that means he's going to take away 9 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.099
 exactly here is a little bit more 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.739
 strong of all but to get by 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.209
 the generals is a bit complicated like that 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.720
 that we got this from the motorcycle is a mod 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.819
 well super short I know but it is that 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.890
 It was interesting and I think it called me 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.439
 the attention to review the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.420
 true because that is or is 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.849
 making greater encounter of swords of 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.650
 please pray this this this is new 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.930
 that he has never seen me before is a 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.519
 of the most original ideas that seen 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.109
