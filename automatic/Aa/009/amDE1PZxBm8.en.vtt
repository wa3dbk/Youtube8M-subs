 to

 Y 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.270
 hi friends for this job we are going to 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:32.960
 need newspaper a skewer 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:37.070
 of 7 millimeters and another normal scissors 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:42.129
 a plastic bag glue snaps 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.129
 silicon paint to taste and varnish 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.629
 let's start by cutting half of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 a sheet of newspaper and we rolled up with 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.600
 a 7 mm wooden stick for 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.320
 that the tubes are wide and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.320
 flexible 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:10.659
 we take eight tubes and join them with one 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.659
 league this is the spike tissue 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.490
 we put them in the form of a fan to the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.090
 right we will always have four to the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.450
 left three and in the center one that does not 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.619
 is going to move from its place we started with 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.619
 the tube on the bottom right 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.320
 we bring it in front around the tube 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.520
 from the center and we form it on the right 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.520
 above others 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.120
 now the lower left him 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.790
 We carry the back surrounding the tube 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.710
 center and we form it on the left 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.710
 also above others 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.100
 we continue with the one on the bottom right 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.590
 we surround in the center and we train it to the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.060
 right on the same side as it was but 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.060
 now above the others 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.940
 we continue with the one below to the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:27.300
 left we surround the back of the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.150
 center and we form it to the left of 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.330
 same side that was but now up 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.700
 from others we continue weaving the 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.870
 same way until we have two 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.020
 strips of 57 centimeters each one that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.900
 let's join with silicon giving the shape 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.510
 of heart we hold with a bag of 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.269
 plastic at both ends and if it is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.530
 necessary with snaps while we give 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.530
 three layers of glue on both sides 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.160
 letting dry between layer and layer this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.459
 heart measures 33 centimeters high by 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.800
 33 centimeters wide 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.470
 once dry we cut the ends 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.319
 leftovers and stick on several strips 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.720
 of the paper tubes that will serve us 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.540
 stand to stick the flowers we're going 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.840
 to do with the normal skewer and the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.430
 quarter of a sheet of newspaper I'm going to 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.239
 make two flowers with the petals 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.000
 round one big and another girl to 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.970
 these petals are going to roll a tube 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.450
 of crushed paper previously remember 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.450
 that my tubes measure 53 centimeters 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.580
 then let's drop a little so that 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.740
 unravel controlling the size we put 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.900
 glue on the final end and 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.590
 we press so that it is in the form of 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:02.340
 peak the other part we will leave it in 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:07.330
 round shape and hold with a clasp 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.930
 let's make six petals for each flower 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.230
 for the leaves I'm going to make 11 sheets 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.440
 of this type we wind a paper tube 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.810
 in the same way as for the petals 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.140
 we put glue on the end let's go 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.470
 so that it unravels a little we crush 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.600
 from both ends and we hold with a 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.930
 brooch so that it retains the shape of 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.930
 sheet 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.070
 I'm going to make a flower with petals 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440
 triangular we take and roll a 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.640
 paper tube just like we did with the 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.640
 previous petals 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.390
 we put glue and crush to 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.390
 form the first angle 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.590
 then we crush with the thumb and 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.310
 we shape the two remaining angles 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:10.130
 we make four petals for each flower 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.890
 for this other kind of leaves I'm going to 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.260
 do two join two tubes the 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.650
 crush and we are doubling this 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.650
 way 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.509
 so that it acquires the fan shape 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:26.949
 putting glue in the center and 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.949
 holding with a clasp 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.090
 let's give a layer of glue for 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.860
 both sides to all the pieces and already 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.860
 we dry the flowers 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.069
 when all the pieces are dry 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.970
 let's start to paste the leaves and 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.970
 then the flowers 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.410
 Look how nice it looks even unpainted 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.130
 and all 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.460
 I know you will understand why you did not give him 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.790
 the sound in my grandson singing my 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.790
 worship 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.220
 painted one color is also 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.220
 great this is my favorite color 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.150
 but good as the quality control 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.370
 does my children are already tired of that 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:05.040
 everything paint the same color paint the 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.040
 flowers and leaves which they liked the most 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.800
 the recommendation is if they are going to paint the 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.289
 flowers of different color paint them 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.020
 before gluing 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:18.749
 I hope you like this work and 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.819
 encourage me to do it is super easy and me 

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:22.819
 I do not just like it, I love it 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:31.350
 do not leave me alone I'll see you in the next
