00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.580 
it yes I know I so anyone like this the
keyboard<00:00:32.950> of<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.550> main<00:00:33.760> focus<00:00:34.510> on<00:00:34.840> key<00:00:34.989> but<00:00:35.469> it

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
keyboard of the main focus on key but it

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.950 
keyboard of the main focus on key but it
would<00:00:35.710> be<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:36.100> sous<00:00:36.550> cream<00:00:36.730> oil<00:00:36.879> so<00:00:37.660> search

would be the sous cream oil so search

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.619 
would be the sous cream oil so search
for<00:00:38.140> using<00:00:38.379> facebook<00:00:38.829> type<00:00:39.039> on<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.629> basically

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
for using facebook type on it basically

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.500 
for using facebook type on it basically
in<00:00:40.690> this<00:00:40.780> has<00:00:40.989> 10<00:00:41.680> adaptive<00:00:42.520> keys<00:00:42.760> right<00:00:43.449> here

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
in this has 10 adaptive keys right here

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.750 
in this has 10 adaptive keys right here
basically<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:44.620> means<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.070> keys<00:00:45.280> can<00:00:45.489> change

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
basically this means the keys can change

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.369 
basically this means the keys can change
there's<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.390> screen<00:00:46.629> below<00:00:46.780> that<00:00:47.109> actually

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
there's a screen below that actually

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.250 
there's a screen below that actually
protects<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.850> images<00:00:48.850> on<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.000> screen<00:00:49.090> so<00:00:49.989> I'm

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
protects the images on the screen so I'm

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.400 
protects the images on the screen so I'm
basically<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:51.129> keys<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:52.660> more<00:00:52.809> power<00:00:52.960> module

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
basically the keys for more power module

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.500 
basically the keys for more power module
and<00:00:53.710> there's<00:00:53.980> also<00:00:54.160> a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
and there's also a

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.319 
and there's also a
five<00:00:55.690> inch<00:00:55.920> LCD<00:00:56.920> black<00:00:57.160> men<00:00:57.339> touch<00:00:57.910> screen<00:00:58.149> oh

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
five inch LCD black men touch screen oh

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.049 
five inch LCD black men touch screen oh
it's<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.019> big<00:00:59.280> screen<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.430> a<00:01:00.460> trackpad<00:01:00.670> at<00:01:00.940> all

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
it's a big screen and a trackpad at all

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.310 
it's a big screen and a trackpad at all
so<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:02.850> concept<00:01:03.850> is<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.030> like<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.420> keys<00:01:04.780> can

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
so the concept is that like the keys can

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.370 
so the concept is that like the keys can
I<00:01:05.409> actually<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:06.630> lot<00:01:07.630> better<00:01:07.689> you<00:01:08.020> can<00:01:08.200> bind

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
I actually a lot better you can bind

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.780 
I actually a lot better you can bind
your<00:01:08.590> abilities

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
your abilities

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.520 
your abilities
and<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.360> can<00:01:11.510> choose<00:01:11.690> a<00:01:11.720> picture<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.260> put<00:01:12.410> in

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
and you can choose a picture and put in

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.200 
and you can choose a picture and put in
the<00:01:12.650> screen<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.490> basically<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.990> can<00:01:15.170> change

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
the screen so basically you can change

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.090 
the screen so basically you can change
how<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:17.330> looks<00:01:17.510> like<00:01:17.690> you<00:01:18.650> can<00:01:18.800> bind<00:01:18.980> a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
how it looks like you can bind a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.920 
how it looks like you can bind a
firewall<00:01:19.550> to<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.150> then<00:01:20.330> one<00:01:20.450> can<00:01:20.690> choose

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
firewall to it and then one can choose

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.250 
firewall to it and then one can choose
an<00:01:21.050> icon<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.530> put<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:21.920> as<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.820> 50<00:01:23.240> icon<00:01:23.570> you

trackpad just now you have a browser via

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.620 
trackpad just now you have a browser via
player<00:01:39.979> giving<00:01:40.490> more<00:01:40.670> background<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:41.479> so

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
player giving more background so on so

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.200 
player giving more background so on so
forth<00:01:41.660> so<00:01:42.500> actually<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.280> catered<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.790> a

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
forth so actually this is catered to a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.870 
forth so actually this is catered to a
wide<00:01:44.540> range<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.930> things<00:01:45.290> not<00:01:46.190> just<00:01:46.250> leaving

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
wide range of things not just leaving

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.490 
wide range of things not just leaving
can<00:01:47.060> use<00:01:47.210> for<00:01:47.360> productivity<00:01:47.780> suites<00:01:48.170> as<00:01:48.290> well

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
can use for productivity suites as well

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.330 
can use for productivity suites as well
so<00:01:49.930> we<00:01:50.930> actually<00:01:51.050> trying<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.470> redefine<00:01:51.800> really

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340
