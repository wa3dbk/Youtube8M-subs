water the fun to be had in water but
more<00:00:35.160> importantly<00:00:35.820> his<00:00:36.600> own<00:00:37.190> capabilities<00:00:38.190> in

the water he needs to be supervised in
and<00:00:42.390> around<00:00:42.630> water<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.640> taught<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.090> swim

learning<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.130> paddle<00:00:48.410> from<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.560> observations

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
learning to paddle from my observations

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.770 
learning to paddle from my observations
I<00:00:50.460> mean<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.910> he's<00:00:51.030> doing<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> water<00:00:51.600> in

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I mean what he's doing the water in

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
I mean what he's doing the water in
terms<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.170> his<00:00:52.290> breath<00:00:52.530> control<00:00:52.740> and<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
terms of his breath control and all that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.570 
terms of his breath control and all that
it's<00:00:54.060> absolutely<00:00:54.300> fantastic<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.560> think<00:00:56.070> he

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
it's absolutely fantastic I think he

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.490 
it's absolutely fantastic I think he
needs<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.240> more<00:00:57.450> mobility<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.200> the<00:00:58.290> water

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
needs to get more mobility on the water

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.450 
needs to get more mobility on the water
now<00:00:58.740> because<00:00:59.460> real<00:01:00.260> that<00:01:01.260> real<00:01:01.560> independent

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
now because real that real independent

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.990 
now because real that real independent
mobility

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
mobility

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
mobility
is<00:01:03.510> what's<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:03.930> save<00:01:04.170> his<00:01:04.379> life<00:01:04.559> isn't<00:01:05.160> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
is what's gonna save his life isn't it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000 
is what's gonna save his life isn't it
so<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.300> is<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.780> you've<00:01:07.080> got<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
so what is what you've got to do as a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.790 
so what is what you've got to do as a
teacher<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> parent<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:10.020> every<00:01:10.470> time<00:01:10.680> it

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
teacher and as a parent is every time it

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.870 
teacher and as a parent is every time it
comes<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
comes to you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330 
comes to you
you've<00:01:12.390> got<00:01:12.600> showing<00:01:12.870> something<00:01:13.190> because<00:01:14.190> how

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you've got showing something because how

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
you've got showing something because how
else<00:01:14.370> is<00:01:14.730> he<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:15.000> learn<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.050> at<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
else is he can learn it's just at the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.800 
else is he can learn it's just at the
moment<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.520> lesson<00:01:17.760> away<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> seven

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
moment it's one lesson away and seven

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.970 
moment it's one lesson away and seven
times<00:01:19.760> exploring<00:01:20.760> so<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.440> teach<00:01:22.620> so

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
times exploring so you want to teach so

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.470 
times exploring so you want to teach so
you've<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> take<00:01:23.550> his<00:01:23.730> hands<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
you've got to take his hands and when it

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.950 
you've got to take his hands and when it
comes<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.550> paddle<00:01:26.550> paddle<00:01:27.030> paddle<00:01:27.450> or

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
comes to you paddle paddle paddle or

whatever you want to say your paddle
let's<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.670> ten<00:01:29.940> patters<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.720> two<00:01:31.290> three<00:01:31.890> four

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
let's do ten patters one two three four

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
let's do ten patters one two three four
five<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> incidental<00:01:34.260> learning<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.770> his

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
five so you incidental learning of his

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.820 
five so you incidental learning of his
counting<00:01:35.370> is<00:01:35.490> happening<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.180> oh<00:01:36.830> you

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
counting is happening as well oh you

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.200 
counting is happening as well oh you
know<00:01:37.950> how<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> show<00:01:38.370> him<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.550> kick<00:01:38.760> his<00:01:38.970> kick

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
know how to show him the kick his kick

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
know how to show him the kick his kick
is<00:01:39.240> quite<00:01:39.690> good<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.560> grab<00:01:40.770> him<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> go

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
is quite good you grab him and you go

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
is quite good you grab him and you go
kick<00:01:41.520> kick<00:01:41.729> kick<00:01:41.760> kick<00:01:41.970> kick<00:01:42.150> kick<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.780> ten

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
kick kick kick kick kick kick and ten

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.469 
kick kick kick kick kick kick and ten
kicks<00:01:43.260> so<00:01:44.250> every<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.820> he<00:01:44.880> comes<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.450> he

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
kicks so every time he comes to you he

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.890 
kicks so every time he comes to you he
gets<00:01:45.780> some<00:01:45.930> instruction<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:47.010> just<00:01:47.310> pure

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
gets some instruction it's not just pure

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.670 
gets some instruction it's not just pure
