core chaos progression system and just

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.940 
core chaos progression system and just
allow<00:02:16.510> players<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.020> destroy<00:02:17.440> them<00:02:17.650> as<00:02:17.770> many

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950

you jump out onto the plane you can

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.640 
you jump out onto the plane you can
actually<00:05:15.390> walk<00:05:15.600> around<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.110> plane<00:05:16.380> wings

itself can be used as a means of
destruction<00:05:20.480> maybe<00:05:21.480> we<00:05:21.630> should<00:05:21.780> get<00:05:21.870> off<00:05:22.020> the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
destruction maybe we should get off the

destruction maybe we should get off the
plane<00:05:22.350> first

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.610
