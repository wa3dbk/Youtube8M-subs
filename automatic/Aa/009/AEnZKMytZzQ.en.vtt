00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.410
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.390
 let today's guitar 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.869
 Today, I always want to make new ones 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 Introduce our handle report 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.429
 was a bit refill again 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.769
 and I wish you much fun with 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.029
 this video 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 The new handle learn today 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.130
 means dur 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.140
 I actually recommend that in the beginning 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.760
 I always think it is easiest 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.380
 when he took the ard pm 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.810
 Reinspielt tries him first from 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.960
 understood the lids from the sea already 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.000
 once learned so the st 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.610
 and now we just do it 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.290
 starts with the forefinger one page 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.180
 high in the second lives on the the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.220
 then we go with the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.470
 middle finger high in the second bunch 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.330
 below it directly below the gesture 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.610
 a guarantee for a bit after 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.100
 push back and then take the 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.159
 third finger and place it in the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.960
 second lives on the b side than it 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.869
 Hot see on the b side on the b 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.719
 page and on the b-side in the second 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.020
 Bund shod the whole from the US 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.020
 page on 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.380
 this is our brand 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.579
 That's why I go out of the lid 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 because it's easy to find the old one 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.030
 The simplest is because you already have one 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.590
 finger by only a small one 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.110
 movement makes a side namely 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.189
 up the index finger, you really 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.520
 already the fingers say a good stop 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.369
 so inferior if you completely new 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.920
 It's just so index fingering 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.810
 two of the federal middle finger 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.250
 second reason g the ring finger on 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.750
 the second point on the b-side 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.750
 just one after the other 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.220
 so I would recommend we resorted 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.810
 to practice a little so that he is the easy one 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.160
 we already have the change and lg 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.160
 somehow easier form 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.350
 a back and forth playing at the beginning is 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.490
 take a while 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.600
 tries the leyen stain with four 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:37.010
 strokes so de 123 then flow 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.010
 First of all , it was back to the old days 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.960
 and g 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.270
 only approx 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.620
 place completion 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.690
 yes let yourself a little something 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.020
 come in a bit creative 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.230
 a bit out with the chords and yes 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.020
 important is that the change right 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.640
 running smoothly and no big breaks 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.709
 arise between the different species 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.800
 well then I wish you much fun 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:16.590
 so busy and see you again 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.590
