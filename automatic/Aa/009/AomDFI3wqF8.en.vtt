00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
reflex sight which you don't really see

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.229 
reflex sight which you don't really see
a<00:00:25.410> lot<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:26.220> that's<00:00:26.340> gonna<00:00:26.550> help<00:00:26.700> you<00:00:26.880> picking

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
a lot but that's gonna help you picking

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
off people and I'll show you a couple

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.650 
off people and I'll show you a couple
areas<00:00:28.770> where<00:00:28.950> that<00:00:29.099> will<00:00:29.309> come<00:00:29.520> in<00:00:29.640> handy<00:00:29.849> now

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
areas where that will come in handy now

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.389 
areas where that will come in handy now
right<00:00:30.930> away<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.169> like<00:00:31.410> coming<00:00:31.680> into<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.009> area

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
right away I like coming into this area

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.799 
right away I like coming into this area
and<00:00:32.489> throwing<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.820> rocket<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.360> down<00:00:33.570> there

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and throwing a rocket right down there

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.720 
and throwing a rocket right down there
probably<00:00:34.170> would<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.620> gotten<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.950> triple<00:00:35.370> if

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
probably would have gotten a triple if

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.549 
probably would have gotten a triple if
PABs<00:00:36.059> wouldn't<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.480> shot<00:00:36.630> two<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.170> but

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
PABs wouldn't have shot two of them but

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.500 
PABs wouldn't have shot two of them but
that<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.950> great<00:00:38.280> place<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> throw<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.210> rocket

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
that is a great place to throw a rocket

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.270 
that is a great place to throw a rocket
down<00:00:39.810> right<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> begin<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.160> like

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
down right to begin with then I like

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.890 
down right to begin with then I like
coming<00:00:41.460> over<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.880> this<00:00:41.970> outside<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.720> usually

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
coming over to this outside now usually

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.570 
coming over to this outside now usually

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
they're gonna be to my left sure enough

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.310 
they're gonna be to my left sure enough
there<00:00:44.790> they<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.780> able<00:00:45.900> to<00:00:46.080> pick<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
there they are and I'm able to pick a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320 
there they are and I'm able to pick a
couple<00:00:46.590> off<00:00:46.830> now<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.460> should<00:00:47.820> still<00:00:48.210> be

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
couple off now they should still be

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.910 
couple off now they should still be
spawning<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.140> garage<00:00:49.290> so<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:49.830> to

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
push forward a little bit harder and try

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.870 
push forward a little bit harder and try
to<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:52.560> this<00:00:52.950> is<00:00:53.130> a<00:00:53.160> great<00:00:53.610> place

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
to get in there this is a great place

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.970 
to get in there this is a great place
for<00:00:53.910> c4<00:00:54.570> unfortunately<00:00:55.200> didn't<00:00:55.470> get<00:00:55.590> any<00:00:55.770> but

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
for c4 unfortunately didn't get any but

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.500 
for c4 unfortunately didn't get any but
here<00:00:56.130> you<00:00:56.220> can<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.490> them<00:00:56.670> still<00:00:57.030> coming<00:00:57.420> up

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
here you can see them still coming up

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
here you can see them still coming up
this<00:00:57.720> area<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.680> once<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.310> to<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.550> point

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this area now once I get to this point

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.610 
this area now once I get to this point
they're<00:01:00.120> probably<00:01:00.150> gonna<00:01:00.960> switch<00:01:01.380> their

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
they're probably gonna switch their

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
they're probably gonna switch their
spawns<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:02.820> least<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.210> you're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
spawns that is at least if you're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.520 
spawns that is at least if you're
playing<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.690> some<00:01:03.899> people<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
playing with some people that like to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
playing with some people that like to
rush<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.519> doing<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.210> cut

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
rush and that's what I'm doing now I cut

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.090 
rush and that's what I'm doing now I cut
out<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> part<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.259> I<00:01:07.439> could<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.740> find

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
out this part because I could not find

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
out this part because I could not find
anybody<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.729> they<00:01:09.149> were<00:01:09.210> actually<00:01:09.630> ended<00:01:09.900> up

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
anybody and they were actually ended up

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750 
anybody and they were actually ended up
starting<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.560> leave<00:01:10.800> so<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.430> got<00:01:11.550> a<00:01:11.580> host

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
starting to leave so we got a host

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
starting to leave so we got a host
migration<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.840> had<00:01:12.930> some<00:01:13.110> people<00:01:13.140> join<00:01:13.620> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
migration and we had some people join in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.860 
migration and we had some people join in
so<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.580> where<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.820> picking<00:01:15.120> up<00:01:15.180> still

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
so this is where I'm picking up still

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.990 
so this is where I'm picking up still
five<00:01:16.140> zero<00:01:16.470> haven't<00:01:16.950> got<00:01:17.100> any<00:01:17.280> kill<00:01:17.550> any<00:01:17.850> more

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
five zero haven't got any kill any more

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.550 
five zero haven't got any kill any more
kills<00:01:18.330> or<00:01:18.510> haven't<00:01:18.810> died<00:01:18.930> anymore<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.500> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
kills or haven't died anymore so I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.080 
kills or haven't died anymore so I
didn't<00:01:19.770> cut<00:01:19.890> off<00:01:20.040> anything<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
didn't cut off anything like that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
didn't cut off anything like that
now<00:01:21.690> after<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.110> done<00:01:22.260> with<00:01:22.440> my<00:01:22.560> opening<00:01:22.920> route

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
now after I'm done with my opening route

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.830 
now after I'm done with my opening route
and<00:01:23.340> things<00:01:23.610> start<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:23.970> settle<00:01:24.360> down<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.690> like

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and things start to settle down I like

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.380 
and things start to settle down I like
to<00:01:24.990> patrol<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> outside<00:01:26.070> I'll<00:01:26.610> kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.120> stay

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to patrol the outside I'll kind of stay

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.780 
to patrol the outside I'll kind of stay

if those are near some common spawn

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.600 
if those are near some common spawn
points<00:02:06.780> kind<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.380> rush<00:02:07.590> towards<00:02:07.920> them<00:02:08.129> now

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
normally I'd run over to this other side

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.080 
normally I'd run over to this other side
over<00:02:10.530> here<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.189> I'm<00:02:11.280> gonna<00:02:11.400> put<00:02:11.580> my<00:02:11.730> stealth

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

chopper over there I noticed a couple of
my<00:02:13.889> teammates<00:02:14.189> were<00:02:14.430> kind<00:02:14.609> of<00:02:14.669> watching<00:02:15.029> that

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:17.959 
area so I don't think I'm gonna get a

it for kills this area right here is one

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.140 
it for kills this area right here is one
of<00:02:31.710> those<00:02:31.890> areas<00:02:32.100> where<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.490> really<00:02:32.790> comes<00:02:33.000> in

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
of those areas where it really comes in

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
of those areas where it really comes in
handy<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.480> have<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.750> reflex<00:02:34.170> sight<00:02:34.350> usually

handy to have a reflex sight usually

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.350 
handy to have a reflex sight usually
there's<00:02:35.190> somebody<00:02:35.460> up<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.090> building

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
there's somebody up in that building

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.030 
there's somebody up in that building
sniping<00:02:37.080> out<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.470> or<00:02:37.590> there's<00:02:37.770> somebody

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
headglitching right down in this area so

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.110 
headglitching right down in this area so
this<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:40.980> where<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.490> helps<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.000> have

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
this is where it really helps to have

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.150 
this is where it really helps to have
that<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.690> know<00:02:42.810> accuracy<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.710> can<00:02:43.950> pick

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
that you know accuracy that you can pick

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
gonna switch to my small because I think

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.510

somebody might be up in the bedroom or

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.670 
somebody might be up in the bedroom or
still<00:03:30.240> down<00:03:30.450> there<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.959> some<00:03:31.140> guy<00:03:31.260> jumps<00:03:31.560> up

through the reload animation because I

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.110
