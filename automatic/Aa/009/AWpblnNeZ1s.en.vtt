00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
reformulation that was released I think

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.979 
reformulation that was released I think
in<00:00:58.500> January<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.160> 2013<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.300> been<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.719> for

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
in January of 2013 so it's been out for

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.959 
in January of 2013 so it's been out for
almost<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.350> year<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> reformulation<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
almost a year now the reformulation and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.640 
almost a year now the reformulation and
it<00:01:03.059> looks<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.420> similar<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.320> other<00:01:04.350> one

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it looks so similar to the other one

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.590 
it looks so similar to the other one
packaging<00:01:05.250> wise<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> might<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.479> even

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
packaging wise that you might not even

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780 
packaging wise that you might not even
know<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.110> reformulated<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.310> use

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
know that it was reformulated if you use

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.030 
know that it was reformulated if you use
this<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.330> said<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> four<00:01:10.320> weeks<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.799> was<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this it said in four weeks it was going

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.940 
this it said in four weeks it was going
to<00:01:11.100> make<00:01:11.310> me<00:01:11.520> look<00:01:11.760> ten<00:01:12.479> years<00:01:12.510> younger<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.409> up

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
to make me look ten years younger or up

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
to make me look ten years younger or up
to<00:01:14.369> ten<00:01:14.729> years<00:01:15.000> younger<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> suppose<00:01:16.080> it

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to ten years younger so I suppose it

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
to ten years younger so I suppose it
could<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.409> between<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.340> minute<00:01:17.820> younger<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
could be between a minute younger and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.289 
could be between a minute younger and
ten<00:01:19.350> years<00:01:19.560> younger<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:21.210> excited

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
ten years younger so I was all excited

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.179 
ten years younger so I was all excited
about<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.990> although<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:23.009> always

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
about that although you know I'm always

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
about that although you know I'm always
kind<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.520> skeptical<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> big<00:01:24.720> claims

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
kind of skeptical about the big claims

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.190 
kind of skeptical about the big claims
and<00:01:25.970> what<00:01:26.970> else<00:01:27.119> did<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.360> say<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.990> skin

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and what else did it say that my skin

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
and what else did it say that my skin
was<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.619> moisturized<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> was

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
was going to be moisturized that I was

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
was going to be moisturized that I was
going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.329> fewer<00:01:30.659> fine<00:01:30.960> lines<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
going to see fewer fine lines and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.249 
going to see fewer fine lines and
wrinkles<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.030> my<00:01:33.030> skin<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.990> be

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
wrinkles and my skin was going to be

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.359 
wrinkles and my skin was going to be
firmer<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.070> more<00:01:35.130> lifted<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.619> decided<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
firmer and more lifted so I decided that

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
firmer and more lifted so I decided that
I<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:38.579> use<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.970> every<00:01:39.390> day<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.810> 30<00:01:40.049> days<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
I would use it every day for 30 days and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
I would use it every day for 30 days and
put<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> test<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.630> actually

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
put it to the test and see if I actually

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
what my glycolic acid does but I have to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.130 
what my glycolic acid does but I have to
say<00:02:54.610> using<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.240> 3<00:02:55.420> like<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.660> do<00:02:55.720> retina

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
say using the 3 like I do retina

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.560 
say using the 3 like I do retina
glycolic<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.860> vitamin<00:02:57.430> C<00:02:57.640> my<00:02:58.150> skin<00:02:58.390> is<00:02:58.480> very

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
glycolic and vitamin C my skin is very

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.450 
glycolic and vitamin C my skin is very
sensitive<00:02:58.870> all<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.440> time<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:00.100> would

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
sensitive all the time and so I would

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.940 
sensitive all the time and so I would
kind<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.030> drop<00:03:01.540> my<00:03:01.750> glycolic<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
kind of like to drop my glycolic and I

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.530 
kind of like to drop my glycolic and I
think<00:03:03.190> now<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.210> has<00:03:04.390> been

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
think now that this has been

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.240 
think now that this has been
reformulated<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.620> helps<00:03:05.920> with<00:03:06.070> this

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
reformulated and it helps with this

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.970 
reformulated and it helps with this
cells<00:03:07.030> turnover<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.080> surface<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.920> I

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
cells turnover on the surface that I

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.850 
cells turnover on the surface that I
might<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:09.430> use<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:09.850> instead<00:03:10.320> because<00:03:11.320> well

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
might just use this instead because well

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.740 
might just use this instead because well
I<00:03:11.890> noticed<00:03:12.490> that<00:03:12.640> this<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:12.970> very<00:03:13.390> much<00:03:13.600> the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
I noticed that this is very much the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.480 
I noticed that this is very much the
same<00:03:13.780> as<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.200> original<00:03:14.560> formulation<00:03:14.980> let<00:03:15.400> me

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
of fragrance added it's a little flowery

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.810 
of fragrance added it's a little flowery
but<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.530> dissipates<00:03:33.160> right<00:03:33.430> away<00:03:33.610> when<00:03:33.790> you

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
but it dissipates right away when you

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.330 
but it dissipates right away when you
put<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.150> on<00:03:34.270> and<00:03:34.570> as<00:03:35.170> far<00:03:35.320> as<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.590> consistency

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
put it on and as far as the consistency

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.120 
put it on and as far as the consistency
goes<00:03:36.580> now<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.360> like<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:38.110> thick<00:03:38.500> cream

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
goes now this like it's a thick cream

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.530 
goes now this like it's a thick cream
and<00:03:39.340> that's<00:03:39.459> why<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.670> think<00:03:39.790> it's<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.300> jar

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
and that's why I think it's in the jar

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.970 
and that's why I think it's in the jar
even<00:03:40.720> though<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.020> air<00:03:41.170> can<00:03:41.380> get<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:41.680> because

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
even though the air can get in because

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.190 
even though the air can get in because
it's<00:03:42.250> hard<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.580> get<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.390> thicker<00:03:43.720> cream<00:03:44.020> out<00:03:44.170> of

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
it's hard to get a thicker cream out of

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.290 
it's hard to get a thicker cream out of
a<00:03:44.320> pump<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.739> know<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.489> lot<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.060> ends<00:03:46.180> up

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
a pump you know you a lot of it ends up

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.610 
a pump you know you a lot of it ends up
staying<00:03:46.570> in<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.870> jar<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.320> end<00:03:47.470> up

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
staying in the jar and you end up

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.110 
staying in the jar and you end up
wasting<00:03:47.800> half<00:03:48.160> your<00:03:48.310> money<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.910> kind<00:03:49.090> of

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
wasting half your money so I kind of

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.580 
wasting half your money so I kind of
like<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.600> can<00:03:49.780> get<00:03:49.870> every<00:03:50.170> drop<00:03:50.350> out

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
like this that I can get every drop out

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.160 
like this that I can get every drop out

and<00:05:10.750> soft<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.259> supple<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.830> not<00:05:11.979> dried<00:05:12.250> out

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
and soft and supple and not dried out

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.520 
and soft and supple and not dried out
looking<00:05:12.759> all<00:05:12.910> winter<00:05:13.479> long<00:05:13.810> and<00:05:13.990> I<00:05:14.199> used<00:05:14.380> it

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
looking all winter long and I used it

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.230 
looking all winter long and I used it
every<00:05:14.740> night<00:05:14.889> when<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.190> noticed<00:05:15.580> first<00:05:15.940> thing

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
every night when I noticed first thing

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.700 
every night when I noticed first thing
right<00:05:16.389> away<00:05:16.570> when<00:05:16.810> I<00:05:16.840> started<00:05:17.169> using<00:05:17.349> it<00:05:17.590> is

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
right away when I started using it is

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.080 
right away when I started using it is
that<00:05:17.830> when<00:05:17.949> I<00:05:17.979> woke<00:05:18.190> up<00:05:18.220> in<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.550> morning<00:05:18.760> my

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
that when I woke up in the morning my

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.659 
that when I woke up in the morning my
skin<00:05:19.150> was<00:05:19.870> soft<00:05:20.289> like<00:05:20.470> a<00:05:20.590> baby's<00:05:20.919> bottom<00:05:21.039> and

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
skin was soft like a baby's bottom and

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.240 
skin was soft like a baby's bottom and
you<00:05:22.360> know<00:05:22.479> it<00:05:22.930> was<00:05:23.110> really<00:05:23.440> great<00:05:23.590> so<00:05:24.010> now<00:05:24.130> that

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
you know it was really great so now that

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.909 
you know it was really great so now that
I<00:05:24.370> got<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.699> one<00:05:24.940> I<00:05:25.229> continue<00:05:26.229> to<00:05:26.409> use<00:05:26.440> it<00:05:26.740> only

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
I got this one I continue to use it only

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.250 
I got this one I continue to use it only
I<00:05:27.070> switched<00:05:27.760> it<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.030> the<00:05:28.300> morning<00:05:28.810> which<00:05:29.110> is

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
I switched it to the morning which is

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.080 
I switched it to the morning which is
when<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.470> would<00:05:29.710> use<00:05:29.889> my<00:05:29.919> glycolic<00:05:30.909> and<00:05:31.030> I

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
when I would use my glycolic and I

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.939 
when I would use my glycolic and I
dropped<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.449> glycolic<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:32.380> I<00:05:32.500> have<00:05:32.620> to<00:05:32.740> say

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
dropped the glycolic and I have to say

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.110 
dropped the glycolic and I have to say
this<00:05:33.250> really<00:05:33.340> is<00:05:33.909> quite<00:05:34.599> a<00:05:34.750> bit<00:05:35.020> more<00:05:36.120> active

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
this really is quite a bit more active

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.700 
this really is quite a bit more active
than<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:38.500> older<00:05:39.280> version<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:39.789> older<00:05:40.150> version

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
than the older version the older version

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.469 
than the older version the older version
was<00:05:41.710> you<00:05:42.130> know<00:05:42.280> more<00:05:42.580> of<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.699> passive<00:05:43.120> cream<00:05:43.330> you

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
was you know more of a passive cream you

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:44.879 
was you know more of a passive cream you
would<00:05:43.599> put<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.900> on<00:05:44.050> it<00:05:44.320> would<00:05:44.380> moisturize

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
would put it on it would moisturize

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.379 
would put it on it would moisturize
nicely<00:05:45.340> it<00:05:45.460> would<00:05:45.580> puff<00:05:45.789> up<00:05:45.940> your<00:05:46.000> skin<00:05:46.360> a

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
nicely it would puff up your skin a

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.089 
nicely it would puff up your skin a
little<00:05:46.449> bit<00:05:46.750> on<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.960> surface<00:05:47.139> and<00:05:47.590> that's

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
little bit on the surface and that's

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.390 
little bit on the surface and that's
about<00:05:48.250> it<00:05:48.520> it<00:05:48.699> certainly<00:05:49.090> did<00:05:49.780> not<00:05:50.400> micro

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
about it it certainly did not micro

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.890 
about it it certainly did not micro
sculpt<00:05:51.849> my<00:05:52.360> skin<00:05:52.720> or<00:05:53.050> lift<00:05:53.620> anything<00:05:54.580> but<00:05:55.060> it

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
sculpt my skin or lift anything but it

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.080 
sculpt my skin or lift anything but it
was<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:56.050> great<00:05:56.320> moisturizer<00:05:56.740> this<00:05:57.400> one<00:05:57.729> also

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
was a great moisturizer this one also

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.370 
was a great moisturizer this one also
provides<00:05:58.930> the<00:06:00.270> skin<00:06:01.270> cell<00:06:01.510> turnover<00:06:01.539> and<00:06:02.349> it

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
provides the skin cell turnover and it

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.250 
provides the skin cell turnover and it
really<00:06:03.070> does<00:06:03.400> that<00:06:03.669> well<00:06:03.909> so<00:06:04.419> with<00:06:04.720> this<00:06:05.050> when

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
really does that well so with this when

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.810 
really does that well so with this when
you<00:06:05.289> first<00:06:05.650> start<00:06:05.919> using<00:06:06.159> it<00:06:06.400> you're<00:06:06.550> going<00:06:06.760> to

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
you first start using it you're going to

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.159 
you first start using it you're going to
notice<00:06:07.030> that<00:06:07.330> you're<00:06:07.479> going<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.690> have<00:06:07.900> some

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
notice that you're going to have some

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.140 
notice that you're going to have some
flaking<00:06:08.470> it<00:06:09.070> doesn't<00:06:09.490> mean<00:06:09.610> that<00:06:09.639> your<00:06:09.880> skin

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
flaking it doesn't mean that your skin

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.000 
flaking it doesn't mean that your skin
is<00:06:10.180> dry<00:06:10.510> per<00:06:10.930> se<00:06:11.139> it<00:06:11.409> just<00:06:11.590> means<00:06:11.770> that<00:06:11.830> you're

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
is dry per se it just means that you're

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.730 
is dry per se it just means that you're
having<00:06:12.159> a<00:06:12.280> lot<00:06:12.400> more<00:06:12.460> surface<00:06:13.229> turnover<00:06:14.229> but

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
having a lot more surface turnover but

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.800 
having a lot more surface turnover but
because<00:06:15.070> it<00:06:15.250> causes<00:06:15.460> the<00:06:15.639> splitting<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:16.659> know

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
because it causes the splitting you know

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.450 
because it causes the splitting you know
it<00:06:17.289> kind<00:06:17.530> of<00:06:17.560> gives<00:06:17.710> the<00:06:17.830> illusion<00:06:18.010> of<00:06:18.250> drying

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
it kind of gives the illusion of drying

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.860 
it kind of gives the illusion of drying
but<00:06:18.669> really<00:06:18.880> it's<00:06:19.000> not<00:06:19.180> it's<00:06:19.360> turning<00:06:19.779> over

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
but really it's not it's turning over

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.680 
but really it's not it's turning over
those<00:06:20.169> surface<00:06:20.740> dead<00:06:21.460> skin<00:06:21.760> cells<00:06:22.029> which<00:06:22.510> is

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
those surface dead skin cells which is

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.950 
those surface dead skin cells which is
great<00:06:22.930> and<00:06:23.169> I'm<00:06:23.349> thinking

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
great and I'm thinking

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.990 
great and I'm thinking
that<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.500> glycolic<00:06:25.009> is<00:06:25.130> too<00:06:25.370> harsh<00:06:25.610> to<00:06:25.820> use

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
that the glycolic is too harsh to use

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.390 
that the glycolic is too harsh to use
every<00:06:26.479> day<00:06:26.630> or<00:06:26.660> even<00:06:26.930> every<00:06:27.410> other<00:06:27.590> day<00:06:27.830> this

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
every day or even every other day this

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.040 
every day or even every other day this
is<00:06:28.639> a<00:06:28.669> great<00:06:28.850> option<00:06:29.120> so<00:06:29.419> that<00:06:29.539> I<00:06:29.570> can<00:06:29.780> drop

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
is a great option so that I can drop

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.990 
is a great option so that I can drop
that<00:06:30.259> out<00:06:30.320> of<00:06:30.500> my<00:06:30.590> routine<00:06:31.009> and<00:06:31.039> use<00:06:31.460> something

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
that out of my routine and use something

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.600 
that out of my routine and use something
that<00:06:32.180> is<00:06:32.500> moisturizing<00:06:33.500> and<00:06:33.860> works<00:06:34.190> just<00:06:34.310> as

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
that is moisturizing and works just as

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.420 
that is moisturizing and works just as
well<00:06:34.789> to<00:06:34.910> get<00:06:35.030> that<00:06:35.199> surface<00:06:36.199> dead<00:06:36.889> skin<00:06:37.190> off

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
well to get that surface dead skin off

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.969 
well to get that surface dead skin off
there<00:06:37.729> so<00:06:38.330> I<00:06:38.750> am<00:06:38.900> very<00:06:39.110> pleased<00:06:39.560> with<00:06:39.740> the<00:06:39.860> new

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
there so I am very pleased with the new

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.770 
there so I am very pleased with the new
formulation<00:06:40.580> it<00:06:40.820> makes<00:06:41.090> me<00:06:41.210> a<00:06:41.240> little<00:06:41.360> nervous

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
formulation it makes me a little nervous

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.420 
formulation it makes me a little nervous
when<00:06:41.900> they<00:06:42.020> reformulate<00:06:42.620> because<00:06:42.889> you<00:06:43.340> know

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
when they reformulate because you know

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.340 
when they reformulate because you know
it<00:06:43.520> could<00:06:43.699> take<00:06:43.850> a<00:06:43.880> great<00:06:44.210> product<00:06:44.509> and<00:06:44.900> it

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
it could take a great product and it

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.469 
it could take a great product and it
could<00:06:45.470> suddenly<00:06:45.620> be<00:06:45.800> junk<00:06:46.160> that<00:06:46.280> I<00:06:46.340> hate<00:06:46.639> or<00:06:46.970> it

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
could suddenly be junk that I hate or it

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.420 
could suddenly be junk that I hate or it
could<00:06:47.690> suddenly<00:06:47.870> be<00:06:48.169> great<00:06:48.830> but<00:06:49.039> not<00:06:49.190> what<00:06:49.340> I'm

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
could suddenly be great but not what I'm
