incredible<00:01:47.220> i<00:01:47.340> actually<00:01:47.850> was<00:01:47.970> very<00:01:48.149> skeptical

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
incredible i actually was very skeptical

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.630 
incredible i actually was very skeptical
that<00:01:48.960> they'd<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.259> able<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> true<00:01:50.100> fisheye

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that they'd be able to do a true fisheye

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160 
that they'd be able to do a true fisheye
i<00:01:50.880> thought<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.329> would<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.479> try<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> squeeze

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
i thought they would just try to squeeze

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.289 
i thought they would just try to squeeze
the<00:01:52.829> image<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> make<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.549> look<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> fish

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the image and make it look like a fish

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.230 
the image and make it look like a fish
eye<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.659> man<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.290> does<00:01:55.590> capture

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
eye but man this really does capture

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
eye but man this really does capture
everything<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.750> frame<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:59.250> does<00:01:59.460> give

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
everything in frame it really does give

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
everything in frame it really does give
you<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.939> fish<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.360> distortion<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.560> when

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
you that fish I distortion you want when

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.709 
you that fish I distortion you want when
you<00:02:01.979> want<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.219> fisheye<00:02:02.640> effect<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.450> big

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you want that fisheye effect the big

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.170 
you want that fisheye effect the big
problem<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.500> fish<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
problem with this fish I that I see is

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.930 
problem with this fish I that I see is
it's<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.140> circular<00:02:07.649> fisheye<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.129> you'll<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.670> up

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
it's a circular fisheye so you'll see up

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.449 
it's a circular fisheye so you'll see up
here<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.989> comes<00:02:10.259> around<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.400> gets

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
here it comes around and then it gets

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.760 
here it comes around and then it gets
cut<00:02:11.790> off<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.750> iphones<00:02:13.170> asks

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
cut off here because the iphones asks

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.860 
cut off here because the iphones asks
ratio<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.730> because<00:02:14.970> they<00:02:15.540> didn't<00:02:15.750> really

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
ratio and because they didn't really

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.690 
ratio and because they didn't really
concentrate<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> line<00:02:16.800> as<00:02:16.920> well<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.310> also

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
concentrate the line as well and also

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.270 
concentrate the line as well and also
over<00:02:18.030> here<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.300> gets<00:02:18.390> cut<00:02:18.690> off<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.950> crop

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
over here it gets cut off so the crop

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.270 
over here it gets cut off so the crop
the<00:02:20.670> crappiness<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.320> photo<00:02:22.770> when<00:02:23.160> you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the crappiness of the photo when you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.270 
the crappiness of the photo when you
take<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> photo<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.480> kind<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.320> bad<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
take a photo with it is kind of bad I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.650 
take a photo with it is kind of bad I
mean<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.610> terrible<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.240> mean<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.510> fact

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
mean this is terrible I mean the fact

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.750 
mean this is terrible I mean the fact
that<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.020> cropped<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.980> mean<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that it's cropped like that I mean the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.730 
that it's cropped like that I mean the
real<00:02:29.910> solution<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.690> problem<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.350> make<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
real solution to this problem is make it

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.520 
real solution to this problem is make it
into<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> square<00:02:32.550> photo<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.750> cut<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.110> down<00:02:34.290> to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
into a square photo so cut it down to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.290 
into a square photo so cut it down to
about<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.640> then<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.850> lose<00:02:36.090> your

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
about here but then you lose your

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.360 
about here but then you lose your
fisheye<00:02:36.690> effect<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:37.350> little<00:02:37.680> bit<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.160> lose

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
fisheye effect a little bit you lose

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.370 
fisheye effect a little bit you lose
that<00:02:38.550> 180<00:02:38.940> degree<00:02:39.360> angle<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.080> more<00:02:40.320> of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that 180 degree angle now it's more of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.830 
that 180 degree angle now it's more of
like<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.530> 160<00:02:41.430> degree<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.360> that's<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.630> big

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
like a 160 degree so that's a big

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.290 
like a 160 degree so that's a big
problem<00:02:43.200> with<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.220> fisheye<00:02:44.670> lens<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.150> that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
problem with this fisheye lens is that

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.570 
problem with this fisheye lens is that
it's<00:02:45.420> not<00:02:45.540> fitted<00:02:46.080> perfectly<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.220> phone

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
it's not fitted perfectly to the phone

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.880 
it's not fitted perfectly to the phone
it<00:02:47.910> doesn't<00:02:48.420> give<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.720> exactly<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.260> circular

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
it doesn't give you exactly the circular

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.250 
it doesn't give you exactly the circular
look<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.400> want<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.000> wouldn't<00:02:51.810> mind<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.140> being

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
look you want I wouldn't mind it being

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.020 
look you want I wouldn't mind it being
cut<00:02:52.530> here<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:52.980> here<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.460> should<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:53.820> more

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
cut here but here it should be more

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.930 
cut here but here it should be more
circular<00:02:54.570> for<00:02:54.930> sure<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.380> might<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.430> here<00:02:56.820> it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
circular for sure I might have here it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.720 
circular for sure I might have here it
should<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.180> more<00:02:57.300> circular<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:57.960> sure<00:02:58.140> um<00:02:58.980> as

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
should be more circular for sure um as

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.430 
should be more circular for sure um as
far<00:02:59.970> as<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.660> know<00:03:00.690> adding<00:03:01.170> color

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
far as like you know adding color

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.530 
far as like you know adding color
fringing<00:03:01.860> which<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.550> any<00:03:02.760> sort<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.270> weird

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
fringing which is any sort of like weird

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.260 
fringing which is any sort of like weird
colorations<00:03:04.470> I'm<00:03:04.770> lines<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.940> things<00:03:05.970> like

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
colorations I'm lines and things like

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.120 
colorations I'm lines and things like
that<00:03:06.330> usually<00:03:07.230> fish<00:03:07.410> eyes<00:03:07.620> tend<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.100> a

that usually fish eyes tend to have a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.590 
that usually fish eyes tend to have a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
lot of weird colorations around the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.690 
lot of weird colorations around the
edges<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.560> could<00:03:10.710> see<00:03:10.980> some<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.370> blue

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
edges and you could see some like blue

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.450 
edges and you could see some like blue
over<00:03:12.600> here<00:03:12.630> that's<00:03:12.960> kind<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.380> weird<00:03:13.590> but

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
over here that's kind of weird but

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.310 
over here that's kind of weird but
around<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.910> lens<00:03:15.090> itself<00:03:15.300> there's<00:03:15.960> actually

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
around the lens itself there's actually

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.380 
around the lens itself there's actually
no<00:03:16.470> weird<00:03:16.740> colorations<00:03:17.520> which<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.820> surprising

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
no weird colorations which is surprising

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.180 
no weird colorations which is surprising
because<00:03:18.420> even<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:18.870> SLR<00:03:19.380> cameras<00:03:19.890> more

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
because even on SLR cameras more

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.190 
because even on SLR cameras more
expensive<00:03:20.610> cameras<00:03:21.060> you'll<00:03:21.600> see<00:03:21.870> with<00:03:22.020> fish

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
expensive cameras you'll see with fish

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.140 
expensive cameras you'll see with fish
eyes<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> lot<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.890> weird<00:03:23.070> fringing<00:03:23.820> there's<00:03:24.030> not

much<00:03:24.300> fringing<00:03:24.690> going<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.050> here<00:03:25.230> now<00:03:25.709> in<00:03:25.800> terms

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
much fringing going on here now in terms

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.680 
much fringing going on here now in terms
of<00:03:26.100> sharpness<00:03:26.459> you'll<00:03:26.850> notice<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.330> photo<00:03:27.600> is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
of sharpness you'll notice this photo is

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.500 
of sharpness you'll notice this photo is
very<00:03:28.380> dull<00:03:29.070> especially<00:03:29.820> when<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.030> zoom<00:03:30.240> in

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
very dull especially when you zoom in

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.260 
very dull especially when you zoom in
you<00:03:30.540> crop<00:03:30.900> in<00:03:31.140> from<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.250> wider<00:03:32.459> standpoint<00:03:32.910> it

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
you crop in from the wider standpoint it

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.210 
you crop in from the wider standpoint it
isn't<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.810> not<00:03:34.530> sharp<00:03:34.950> it's<00:03:35.160> a

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
isn't really that not sharp it's a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.470 
isn't really that not sharp it's a
little<00:03:35.400> grainy<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.940> that's<00:03:36.090> probably<00:03:36.240> cuz

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
little grainy and that's probably cuz

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.300 
little grainy and that's probably cuz
I'm<00:03:36.600> indoors<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.380> was<00:03:37.470> bad<00:03:37.620> lighting<00:03:37.980> ah

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
I'm indoors and it was bad lighting ah

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.340 
I'm indoors and it was bad lighting ah
but<00:03:38.910> man<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.390> cool<00:03:39.630> little<00:03:39.780> photo<00:03:40.080> so

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
but man this is a cool little photo so

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.330 
but man this is a cool little photo so
the<00:03:40.500> other<00:03:40.620> thing<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.830> could<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.010> with<00:03:41.160> fish

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the other thing you could do with fish

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.920 
the other thing you could do with fish
shot<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:41.610> course<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.660> can<00:03:42.750> get<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
shot of course is you can get the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.660 
shot of course is you can get the
close-up<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.530> dog<00:03:43.770> with<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.280> know<00:03:44.400> is

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
close-up of a dog with the you know is

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.880 
close-up of a dog with the you know is
his<00:03:45.000> nose<00:03:45.270> in<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.570> face<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.500> didn't<00:03:46.709> focus

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
his nose in the face now it didn't focus

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.740 
his nose in the face now it didn't focus
because<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.490> close<00:03:47.700> focus<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.420> iphone

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
because the close focus on the iphone

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.680 
because the close focus on the iphone
isn't<00:03:48.930> good<00:03:49.200> enough<00:03:49.230> um<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.459> focuses<00:03:51.060> about<00:03:51.360> I

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
isn't good enough um it focuses about I

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.510 
isn't good enough um it focuses about I
would<00:03:51.930> say<00:03:52.140> anywhere<00:03:52.500> from<00:03:52.650> six<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.190> twelve

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
would say anywhere from six to twelve

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.120 
would say anywhere from six to twelve
inches<00:03:53.640> away<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:55.590> know<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.800> wasn't<00:03:56.070> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
inches away so you know it wasn't the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.800 
inches away so you know it wasn't the
best<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.520> obviously<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.240> is<00:03:57.390> meant<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.720> be

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
best of obviously this is meant to be

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.570 
best of obviously this is meant to be
blurred<00:03:58.140> that's<00:03:58.440> kind<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.770> the<00:03:58.920> concept<00:03:59.459> here

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
blurred that's kind of the concept here

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.730 
blurred that's kind of the concept here
um<00:03:59.880> but<00:04:00.870> everything<00:04:01.170> looks<00:04:01.200> pretty<00:04:01.410> good<00:04:01.680> I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
um but everything looks pretty good I

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.710 
um but everything looks pretty good I
mean<00:04:02.010> it's<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.430> little<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.850> does<00:04:03.030> lack<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.360> little

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
mean it's a little it does lack a little

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.840 
mean it's a little it does lack a little
bit<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.900> sharpness<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.560> detail<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:05.250> will

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
bit of sharpness and detail I will

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.390 
bit of sharpness and detail I will
notice<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.330> that's<00:04:06.390> because<00:04:06.630> it's<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:06.930> wide

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
notice that that's because it's so wide

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.190 
notice that that's because it's so wide
when<00:04:08.400> something's<00:04:08.700> really<00:04:08.880> why'd<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:10.080> have

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
when something's really why'd you have

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.350 
when something's really why'd you have
to<00:04:10.230> zoom<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.739> further<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.250> see<00:04:11.459> things<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.300> you

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
to zoom in further to see things so you

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.880 
to zoom in further to see things so you
don't<00:04:12.540> get<00:04:12.600> as<00:04:12.720> much<00:04:12.870> detail<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.650> would<00:04:13.770> be<00:04:13.860> a

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
don't get as much detail this would be a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.940 
don't get as much detail this would be a
really<00:04:14.100> good<00:04:14.310> lens<00:04:14.550> for<00:04:15.169> doing<00:04:16.169> video<00:04:16.530> because

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
really good lens for doing video because

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.830 
really good lens for doing video because
in<00:04:17.040> video<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.520> don't<00:04:17.669> need<00:04:17.850> as<00:04:17.970> much<00:04:18.000> detail<00:04:18.419> I

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
in video you don't need as much detail I

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.099 
in video you don't need as much detail I
mean<00:04:18.989> 720p<00:04:19.680> 1080p<00:04:20.220> does<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.700> job<00:04:20.910> now<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:21.960> is

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
mean 720p 1080p does the job now this is

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.380 
mean 720p 1080p does the job now this is
the<00:04:22.140> macro<00:04:22.800> end<00:04:23.040> of<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.250> lens<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.760> on<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.240> on

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
the macro end of the lens so on the on

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.420 
the macro end of the lens so on the on
the<00:04:24.419> five<00:04:24.720> s<00:04:24.750> version<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.440> get<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.620> macro<00:04:26.250> and

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
the five s version you get a macro and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.970 
the five s version you get a macro and
most

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
most

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.430 
most
of<00:04:27.070> their<00:04:27.220> line<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.490> on<00:04:27.580> macros<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.060> boy<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.930> did

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
of their line is on macros and boy I did

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.110 
of their line is on macros and boy I did
not<00:04:29.530> expect<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:30.010> much<00:04:30.340> sharpness<00:04:30.940> and

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
not expect this much sharpness and

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.840 
not expect this much sharpness and
clarity<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.780> depth<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.560> field<00:04:32.890> as<00:04:33.130> well<00:04:33.310> with

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
clarity and depth of field as well with

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.670 
clarity and depth of field as well with
this<00:04:34.030> macro<00:04:34.360> lens<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.840> mean<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.080> really<00:04:35.320> get<00:04:35.650> a

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
this macro lens I mean you really get a

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.260 
this macro lens I mean you really get a
nice<00:04:35.980> sharp<00:04:36.370> image<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:36.820> obviously<00:04:37.090> if<00:04:37.180> you

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
nice sharp image and obviously if you

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.580 
nice sharp image and obviously if you
zoom<00:04:37.300> in<00:04:37.600> it's<00:04:37.720> an<00:04:37.810> iphone<00:04:38.140> image<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:38.500> it's

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
zoom in it's an iphone image so it's

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.870 
zoom in it's an iphone image so it's
gonna<00:04:38.680> look<00:04:38.740> terrible<00:04:39.220> but<00:04:39.310> this<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.610> very

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
gonna look terrible but this is very

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.320 
gonna look terrible but this is very
sharp<00:04:40.300> um<00:04:40.710> here's<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.770> really<00:04:42.310> sharp<00:04:42.550> macro<00:04:43.120> and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
sharp um here's a really sharp macro and

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.120 
sharp um here's a really sharp macro and
they<00:04:43.450> look<00:04:43.690> at<00:04:43.780> this<00:04:43.990> thing<00:04:44.290> this<00:04:44.920> is

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
they look at this thing this is

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.860 
they look at this thing this is
extremely<00:04:45.580> sharp<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.360> even<00:04:46.540> get<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.690> bit<00:04:46.840> of

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
extremely sharp you even get a bit of

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.050 
extremely sharp you even get a bit of
Boca<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:47.470> can<00:04:47.590> see<00:04:47.740> some<00:04:47.770> boca<00:04:48.190> circles<00:04:48.880> over

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
Boca you can see some boca circles over

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.960 
Boca you can see some boca circles over
here<00:04:49.300> um<00:04:49.770> it<00:04:50.770> is<00:04:50.950> incredible<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.640> mean<00:04:51.670> this<00:04:51.910> is

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
here um it is incredible I mean this is

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.840
