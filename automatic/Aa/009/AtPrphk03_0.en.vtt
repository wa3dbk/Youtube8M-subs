00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:22.670
 tutorial and I'll show you how to download 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:25.300
 the record display in it 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.300
 this 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.560
 in four dotcom web sites 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.460
 so 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.460
 the descriptions 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.280
 in those moments the applications that 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.980
 these all who are here with the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.640
 little camera that says cuts with the record 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:56.020
 of streep in the min 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:56.020
 they are so much more 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.090
 because good in the video is shown as 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.090
 I'm recording 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.000
 the flop 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.390
 she has shown has shown how 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.530
 they give him 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.400
 good 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.409
 it sounds like it 's over 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.340
 well here we are 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:41.170
 we do not select and you would give 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.170
 as I am recording 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.770
 good 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.619
 agreements that must put the date in 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.780
 the year 2012 but the application will have 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.000
 a fault and it will not be downloaded 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.600
 then also if we take the plan 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.420
 and I remove this 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.189
 by carelessness that I have 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.860
 has no options none 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.080
 any 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.680
 then what you have to go would be these 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.570
 just 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.420
 and canada record i'm in it would be a 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.130
 little bit down and then they put audio 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.950
 monkey or something like that from the audio 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.380
 and elevate him even though he has the double move 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.990
 so that it can be recorded in a case of 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.830
 clipping we write right there in settings 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.990
 same in audio the same moves him though 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.780
 whether or not it is moving you and almost stays in 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.420
 blue to more good this is all this 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.480
