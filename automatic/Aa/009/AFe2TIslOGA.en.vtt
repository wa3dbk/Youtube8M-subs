hence the good condition got a few

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.810 
hence the good condition got a few
little<00:00:34.480> extras<00:00:34.870> on<00:00:35.050> it<00:00:35.079> it's<00:00:35.350> got<00:00:35.530> a<00:00:35.559> worn<00:00:35.920> 2500

is a good shape again no no bins or
brakes<00:01:15.070> or<00:01:15.430> anything<00:01:15.610> like<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:16.600> does

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
brakes or anything like that it does

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.470 
brakes or anything like that it does
have<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.080> little<00:01:17.290> 2<00:01:17.500> inch<00:01:17.530> receiver<00:01:18.250> hitch<00:01:19.180> on

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
have a little 2 inch receiver hitch on

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:28.300 
have a little 2 inch receiver hitch on
it<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:22.330> full<00:01:22.600> full<00:01:22.870> boards

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.609 

these<00:01:28.909> are<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.180> fully<00:01:29.600> independent<00:01:30.470> suspension

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
these are a fully independent suspension

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.880 
these are a fully independent suspension
so<00:01:31.549> it's<00:01:31.700> got<00:01:31.850> independent<00:01:32.479> rear<00:01:32.689> suspension

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
so it's got independent rear suspension

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.980 
so it's got independent rear suspension
and<00:01:35.290> independent<00:01:36.290> front<00:01:36.470> suspension<00:01:37.869> uses<00:01:38.869> a

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
and independent front suspension uses a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.580 
and independent front suspension uses a
dual<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.470> arm<00:01:40.539> suspension<00:01:41.539> system<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.380> back

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
dual a arm suspension system in the back

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.260 
dual a arm suspension system in the back
the<00:01:43.280> other<00:01:43.399> thing<00:01:43.640> that's<00:01:43.729> pretty<00:01:43.939> cool<00:01:44.060> about

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
the other thing that's pretty cool about

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.380 
the other thing that's pretty cool about
these<00:01:44.720> is<00:01:45.080> when<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:45.320> look<00:01:45.470> at<00:01:45.649> these<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:47.179> rear

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
these is when you look at these the rear

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.389 
these is when you look at these the rear
brake<00:01:47.689> on<00:01:47.899> these<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.289> a<00:01:48.320> multi-disc<00:01:48.979> wet<00:01:49.220> rear

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
brake on these is a multi-disc wet rear

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.980 
brake on these is a multi-disc wet rear
brake<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:49.850> there's<00:01:50.030> not<00:01:50.149> a<00:01:50.210> rear<00:01:50.509> brake<00:01:50.659> here

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
brake so there's not a rear brake here

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.169 
brake so there's not a rear brake here
at<00:01:51.079> this<00:01:51.200> tire<00:01:51.530> there's<00:01:52.490> not<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.759> rear<00:01:53.030> brake

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
at this tire there's not a rear brake

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.779 
at this tire there's not a rear brake
over<00:01:53.509> here<00:01:53.659> at<00:01:53.720> this<00:01:53.899> tire<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.439> rear<00:01:54.649> brake<00:01:57.789> is

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
over here at this tire the rear brake is

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.139 
over here at this tire the rear brake is
actually<00:01:59.479> right<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.319> here<00:02:00.709> and<00:02:00.909> it's<00:02:01.909> built

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
actually right in here and it's built

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.539 
actually right in here and it's built
into<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.600> rear<00:02:02.840> housing<00:02:03.190> that<00:02:04.190> holds<00:02:04.490> the

into this rear housing that holds the
rear<00:02:04.610> end<00:02:04.909> gears<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:06.409> because<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:07.369> a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
rear end gears and because and it's a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.309 
rear end gears and because and it's a
wet<00:02:07.700> brake<00:02:08.030> mean<00:02:08.269> it<00:02:08.390> rides<00:02:08.600> in<00:02:08.810> an<00:02:08.929> oil<00:02:09.110> bath

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
wet brake mean it rides in an oil bath

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.160 
wet brake mean it rides in an oil bath
same<00:02:09.709> as<00:02:09.860> those<00:02:10.039> gears<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.640> what<00:02:11.450> we<00:02:11.569> found<00:02:11.810> is

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
same as those gears and what we found is

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.750 
same as those gears and what we found is
since<00:02:12.470> we've<00:02:12.590> been<00:02:12.709> using<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.190> style<00:02:13.519> rear

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
since we've been using that style rear

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.809 
since we've been using that style rear
brake<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.890> not<00:02:15.890> only<00:02:16.040> do<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.310> brakes<00:02:16.549> work

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
brake is not only do the brakes work

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.920 
brake is not only do the brakes work
really<00:02:17.060> well<00:02:17.330> but<00:02:18.250> they<00:02:19.250> last<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.730> long<00:02:19.849> time<00:02:20.150> we

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
really well but they last a long time we
