on<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.379> I<00:03:04.409> looked<00:03:04.650> through<00:03:04.769> all<00:03:04.859> the<00:03:04.920> models

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
on it so I looked through all the models

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.589 
on it so I looked through all the models
and<00:03:05.579> I<00:03:05.640> look<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.030> one<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.180> had<00:03:06.420> like

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
and I look for the one that had like

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.240 
and I look for the one that had like
super<00:03:06.930> tight<00:03:07.170> around<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.530> arms<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.950> that

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
super tight around the arms and that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.670 
super tight around the arms and that
also<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> cool<00:03:08.970> shirt<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.480> yeah<00:03:10.379> I<00:03:10.409> picked

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
also is a cool shirt and yeah I picked

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.170 
also is a cool shirt and yeah I picked
this<00:03:10.859> one<00:03:11.040> out<00:03:11.099> when<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.430> do<00:03:11.549> put<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.030> though

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
this one out when I do put it on though

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.729 
this one out when I do put it on though
it<00:03:12.299> does<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.629> a<00:03:12.659> little<00:03:12.959> extra<00:03:13.200> Flair<00:03:13.470> I

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
it does have a little extra Flair I

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.020 
it does have a little extra Flair I
guess<00:03:13.890> that's<00:03:14.099> probably<00:03:14.370> because<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.730> model

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
guess that's probably because the model

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.460 
guess that's probably because the model
on<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.269> website<00:03:15.659> was<00:03:15.810> actually<00:03:16.170> extremely

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
on the website was actually extremely

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.530 
on the website was actually extremely
jacked<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.519> course<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.940> would<00:03:18.060> look<00:03:18.180> title

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
jacked and of course it would look title

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.789 
jacked and of course it would look title
on<00:03:18.630> his<00:03:18.750> armor<00:03:19.049> didn't<00:03:19.230> really<00:03:19.410> take<00:03:19.650> that

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
on his armor didn't really take that

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.740 
on his armor didn't really take that
into<00:03:20.040> consideration<00:03:20.069> so<00:03:21.000> yeah<00:03:21.209> I'm<00:03:21.419> not<00:03:21.599> as

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
into consideration so yeah I'm not as

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.629 
into consideration so yeah I'm not as
jacked<00:03:22.049> as<00:03:22.230> he<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:22.980> still<00:03:23.220> fits<00:03:23.400> kind

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
jacked as he is but it still fits kind

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.379 
jacked as he is but it still fits kind
of<00:03:23.819> nice<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.180> guess

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
of nice I guess

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.089 
of nice I guess
so<00:03:24.630> next<00:03:24.930> pick<00:03:25.049> up<00:03:25.139> we<00:03:25.260> got<00:03:25.380> here<00:03:25.620> was<00:03:25.769> honestly

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
so next pick up we got here was honestly

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.770 
so next pick up we got here was honestly
kind<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.519> gamble<00:03:26.700> for<00:03:27.030> me<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.359> felt<00:03:27.599> like
