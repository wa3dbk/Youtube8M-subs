00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
that and we just never played in the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.559 
that and we just never played in the
first<00:03:40.440> half<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.919> mean<00:03:40.950> not<00:03:41.760> soft<00:03:42.090> rice<00:03:42.329> but

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
first half I mean not soft rice but

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.650 
first half I mean not soft rice but
three<00:03:42.780> tries<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.739> could<00:03:43.859> have<00:03:43.950> been<00:03:44.010> easily

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
three tries that could have been easily

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.030 
three tries that could have been easily
defended<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.230> we<00:03:46.319> just<00:03:46.470> never<00:03:46.560> defended

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
defended and we just never defended

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.920 
defended and we just never defended
particular<00:03:47.459> owner<00:03:47.669> for<00:03:47.819> stuff<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.480> think

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
particular owner for stuff and I think

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.050 
particular owner for stuff and I think
there<00:03:49.200> was<00:03:49.379> some<00:03:49.590> very<00:03:49.799> exciting

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
there was some very exciting

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.360
