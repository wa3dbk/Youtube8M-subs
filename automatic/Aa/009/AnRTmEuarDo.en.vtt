00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
a progression so we're going to start

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.850 
a progression so we're going to start
off<00:00:27.290> with<00:00:27.320> just<00:00:27.980> an<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:28.250> minor<00:00:28.550> chord<00:00:29.680> going<00:00:30.680> to

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
a G going to an F or if you want to hold

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.459 
a G going to an F or if you want to hold
your<00:00:36.559> f<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:36.920> this<00:00:37.010> easier<00:00:37.609> way<00:00:37.989> that's<00:00:38.989> ok<00:00:39.350> as

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
your f in this easier way that's ok as

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.540 
your f in this easier way that's ok as
well<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:39.859> then<00:00:40.190> we<00:00:40.280> have<00:00:40.309> an<00:00:40.519> E<00:00:41.739> so<00:00:42.739> we<00:00:43.100> already

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
well and then we have an E so we already

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.430 
well and then we have an E so we already
have<00:00:43.789> quite<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:44.359> flamenco<00:00:44.870> sounding

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
have quite a flamenco sounding

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.319 
have quite a flamenco sounding
progression<00:00:45.649> there<00:00:46.190> with<00:00:46.460> just<00:00:46.699> those<00:00:46.819> basic

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
progression there with just those basic

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.000 
progression there with just those basic
chords<00:00:47.629> alone

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.069 

but<00:00:55.010> we<00:00:55.130> can<00:00:55.310> enhance<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:56.390> strength<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:56.960> that

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
but we can enhance the strength of that

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.170 
but we can enhance the strength of that
flamenco<00:00:57.620> flavor<00:00:57.950> quite<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.520> lot<00:00:58.760> just<00:00:58.970> by

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
flamenco flavor quite a lot just by

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.420 
flamenco flavor quite a lot just by
making<00:00:59.360> some<00:00:59.809> small<00:01:00.170> adjustments<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:01.100> those

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
making some small adjustments to those

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.819 
making some small adjustments to those
chords<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.720> we're<00:01:02.840> going<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.050> keep<00:01:03.200> our<00:01:03.440> a

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
chords so we're going to keep our a

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.450 
chords so we're going to keep our a
minor<00:01:04.129> as<00:01:04.400> it<00:01:04.640> is<00:01:04.760> for<00:01:04.940> now<00:01:05.650> but<00:01:06.650> for<00:01:06.710> G<00:01:07.250> we're

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
minor as it is for now but for G we're

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.870 
minor as it is for now but for G we're
going<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.700> go<00:01:07.820> instead<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.450> g7<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:10.640> that's

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
going to go instead to g7 and that's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.400

first<00:02:02.750> finger<00:02:02.990> goes<00:02:03.020> here<00:02:03.650> on<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.220> first<00:02:04.820> fret

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
first finger goes here on the first fret

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.660 
first finger goes here on the first fret
of<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.330> third<00:02:05.720> string<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:07.009> gives<00:02:07.340> us<00:02:07.490> an

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
of the third string and that gives us an

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.220 
of the third string and that gives us an
E<00:02:07.880> flat<00:02:08.060> nine<00:02:10.269> you<00:02:11.269> can<00:02:11.420> hear<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.750> flat<00:02:11.989> nine

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
E flat nine you can hear the flat nine

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.890 
E flat nine you can hear the flat nine
tonality<00:02:12.910> upsetting<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> consonants<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
tonality upsetting the consonants of the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.960 
tonality upsetting the consonants of the
chord

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.160 

so<00:02:20.970> now<00:02:21.180> let's<00:02:21.420> put<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.720> progression

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
so now let's put the progression

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.070 
so now let's put the progression
together<00:02:22.500> again<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:23.010> minor<00:02:23.930> g7

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.190 

if

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.949 

you<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.220> how<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.819> instantly<00:02:33.240> get<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.720> much

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
you see how we instantly get a much

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:44.600 
you see how we instantly get a much
stronger<00:02:34.380> Spanish<00:02:35.069> guitar<00:02:35.400> flavor

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.070 

for<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.730> next<00:02:45.880> progression<00:02:46.150> we're<00:02:46.660> going<00:02:46.870> to

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
for this next progression we're going to

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.980 
for this next progression we're going to
apply<00:02:47.830> an<00:02:48.040> even<00:02:48.190> stronger<00:02:48.690> flamenco<00:02:49.690> flavor

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
apply an even stronger flamenco flavor

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.230 
apply an even stronger flamenco flavor
to<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> chords<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.370> basic<00:02:51.730> progression

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
to the chords so the basic progression

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.200 
to the chords so the basic progression
would<00:02:52.390> be<00:02:52.540> going<00:02:52.750> from<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.140> D<00:02:53.320> minor<00:02:54.390> down<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.660> C

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
would be going from a D minor down to C

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.110 
would be going from a D minor down to C
into<00:02:58.210> a<00:02:58.240> b-flat<00:02:59.460> we<00:03:00.460> could<00:03:00.640> hold<00:03:00.820> your<00:03:00.940> B<00:03:01.090> flat

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
into a b-flat we could hold your B flat

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.210 
into a b-flat we could hold your B flat
this<00:03:01.480> way

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
this way

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.150 
this way
and<00:03:03.310> then<00:03:03.640> into<00:03:03.970> an<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.370> once<00:03:06.550> again<00:03:06.670> D<00:03:07.060> minor

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
and then into an a so once again D minor

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.640 
and then into an a so once again D minor
C<00:03:10.170> B<00:03:11.170> flat

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.460 

now<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.950> order<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.400> really<00:03:17.640> give<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.629> a

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
now in order to really give that a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.130 
now in order to really give that a
stronger<00:03:20.160> flamenco<00:03:20.819> tonality<00:03:21.480> we're<00:03:21.959> going

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
stronger flamenco tonality we're going

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.470 
stronger flamenco tonality we're going
to<00:03:22.200> change<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.650> chord<00:03:22.890> shapes<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.489> our<00:03:24.300> D

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
to change the chord shapes and our D

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.300 
to change the chord shapes and our D
minor<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.989> now<00:03:25.200> going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.980> open

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
minor is now going to be just the open

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.559 
minor is now going to be just the open
fourth<00:03:26.610> string<00:03:26.720> with<00:03:27.720> 3<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.290> 3<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.940> 3rd

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
fourth string with 3 and 3 on the 3rd

string and the 2nd string and the first

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.880 
string and the 2nd string and the first
string<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.879> just<00:03:33.209> going<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.420> be<00:03:33.540> left<00:03:33.810> open<00:03:34.080> so

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
string is just going to be left open so

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.150 
string is just going to be left open so
we<00:03:35.010> have<00:03:35.160> from<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.400> fourth<00:03:35.640> string<00:03:35.940> down

we have from the fourth string down
that's<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.549> our<00:03:38.700> D<00:03:38.940> minor<00:03:39.209> shape

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
that's going to be our D minor shape

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.479 
that's going to be our D minor shape
from<00:03:42.080> their<00:03:42.319> foresee<00:03:42.950> you're<00:03:43.129> just<00:03:43.280> going<00:03:43.459> to

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.839 
from their foresee you're just going to
place<00:03:43.730> your<00:03:44.030> second<00:03:44.930> finger<00:03:45.110> on<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.849> third

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
place your second finger on the third

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.960 
place your second finger on the third
fret<00:03:46.879> of<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.360> fifth<00:03:47.659> string<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:49.730> going<00:03:49.819> to

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
fret of the fifth string it's going to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.710 
fret of the fifth string it's going to
be<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:51.190> c4<00:03:52.190> b-flat<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:53.060> take<00:03:53.269> away<00:03:53.420> your

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
be the c4 b-flat you take away your

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.360 
be the c4 b-flat you take away your
second<00:03:54.080> finger<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.560> put<00:03:54.799> your<00:03:54.920> first<00:03:55.220> finger

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.970 
second finger and put your first finger
here<00:03:55.819> on<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.360> first<00:03:56.690> fret<00:03:56.959> again<00:03:57.769> on<00:03:57.890> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
here on the first fret again on the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.300 
here on the first fret again on the
fifth<00:03:58.250> string<00:03:59.170> so<00:04:00.170> so<00:04:00.379> far<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:00.950> see<00:04:01.129> how

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
fifth string so so far can you see how

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.699 
fifth string so so far can you see how
we've<00:04:01.489> kept<00:04:01.760> fingers<00:04:02.150> three<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.540> four<00:04:02.810> as<00:04:03.080> an

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
we've kept fingers three and four as an

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.380 
we've kept fingers three and four as an
anchor<00:04:04.069> point<00:04:04.099> throughout<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.700> progression

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.370 

and<00:04:10.440> now<00:04:11.440> finally<00:04:11.920> we<00:04:12.040> go<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.730> flatline<00:04:13.480> so

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
and now finally we go to a flatline so

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.570 
and now finally we go to a flatline so
here<00:04:14.650> you're<00:04:14.770> going<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.010> leave<00:04:15.130> your<00:04:15.250> third

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
here you're going to leave your third

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.150 
here you're going to leave your third
finger<00:04:15.819> as<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.720> connector<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.410> you're<00:04:18.040> going

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
finger as the connector and you're going

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.250 
finger as the connector and you're going
to<00:04:18.220> place<00:04:18.400> your<00:04:18.579> second<00:04:18.880> finger<00:04:19.150> here<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:20.109> your

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
to place your second finger here so your

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.960 
to place your second finger here so your
first<00:04:20.500> finger<00:04:20.799> on<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.040> second<00:04:21.489> fret<00:04:21.519> of<00:04:21.880> the

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
first finger on the second fret of the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.670 
first finger on the second fret of the
fourth<00:04:22.360> string<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.780> your<00:04:23.290> second<00:04:23.650> finger

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
fourth string and your second finger

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.060 
fourth string and your second finger
here<00:04:23.919> on<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:25.270> second<00:04:25.990> fret<00:04:26.139> of<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.410> second

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
here on the second fret of the second

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.129 
here on the second fret of the second
string<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.120> get<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.510> mysterious

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
string and so you get a mysterious

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.620 
string and so you get a mysterious
flatline<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:32.970> turn<00:04:33.970> allottee<00:04:34.330> coming

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
flatline that turn allottee coming

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
flatline that turn allottee coming
through<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.150> progression<00:04:37.660> it<00:04:37.870> sounds

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
through so in the progression it sounds

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.379 
through so in the progression it sounds
like<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:39.100> final<00:04:39.460> chord<00:04:39.700> should<00:04:39.970> be<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.120> place

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
like the final chord should be a place

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.980 
like the final chord should be a place
