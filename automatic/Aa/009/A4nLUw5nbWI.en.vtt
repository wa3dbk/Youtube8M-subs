00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
prepared you for this moment you know

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.290 
prepared you for this moment you know
it's<00:00:49.950> hard<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.280> say<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> without<00:00:51.149> offending

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it's hard to say this without offending

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.000 
it's hard to say this without offending
people<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.140> try<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.350> put<00:00:52.590> together<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
people but we try to put together the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
people but we try to put together the
toughest<00:00:53.370> schedule<00:00:53.760> around<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.960> state

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
toughest schedule around so the state

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
toughest schedule around so the state
tournaments<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.590> easiest<00:00:55.829> tournament<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
tournaments are easiest tournament and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.160 
tournaments are easiest tournament and
um<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> how<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
um so that's just kind of how it is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.650 
um so that's just kind of how it is
whether<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.489> or<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.910> isn't<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.270> easiest

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
whether it is or it isn't or easiest

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.240 
whether it is or it isn't or easiest
tournament<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.680> idea<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
tournament we just have that idea and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
tournament we just have that idea and
that's<00:01:02.399> our<00:01:02.579> preparation<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.329> year<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.989> try

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that's our preparation all year we try

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.270
