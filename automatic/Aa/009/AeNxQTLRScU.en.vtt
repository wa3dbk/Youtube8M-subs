00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.950
 good morning today we are going to do some 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.720
 cod grills 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.080
 and here we have the ingredients 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 we have flour 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.480
 fresh cod 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.059
 a clear to the point of snow oil 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.400
 Extra virgin olive oil a little 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.280
 salt dye and cold water from the 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.250
 refrigerator 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.309
 The first thing we are going to do is take 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.780
 three tablespoons of flour we have thrown 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:56.130
 here and now we are going to add cold water 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.760
 let's go making a mass 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.290
 It is a mass that is not too thick 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.550
 not very clear 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.880
 can make the dough 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.250
 what's left 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.509
 with water it has to be very cold I 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.039
 I've put him in a little bit is in the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.230
 freezer even because you have to 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:19.290
 the water is very cold 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.290
 to make this gabardine maxim 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.960
 let's undo the flour well 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.560
 Well now we put a little salt 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.510
 to the dough and a little dye 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.190
 we are going to throw him also so that they take 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.190
 the little color that takes 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.700
 of the mass of the gabardine 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.490
 and we will also make a cherry 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.220
 extra virgin olive oil although a 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.220
 little bit to soften it there's a little bit 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.650
 there state 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.440
 and now we are going to add the clear 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.340
 point of snow that we have here already 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.440
 smoothie 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.370
 now let's mix 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.370
 in masita 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.819
 let's mix with the clear to point of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.209
 snow well mixing like this 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.209
 wrap around so you do not lower the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.209
 the volume 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.120
 the cod like the fresco of which 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.580
 we have to teach then you throw him a 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.190
 little bit of salt also because if it's 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.750
 salty because he does not need it 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.590
 Point of salt but this is going to be fresh 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.700
 It has no salt 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.770
 then you have to throw a little bit of 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.890
 salt too 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.620
 good you see is more and this has to 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.560
 to be 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:05.250
 to be able to put 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.250
 the fish the cod and fry them 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.000
 there is 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.709
 now we are going to throw in the accounts with 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 the oil to heat that is already 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.129
 prepared 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.170
 well let's go now to catch the cod and 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.260
 we're going to be overflowing like this 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.650
 picking up like this and you have been throwing 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.760
 in the oil 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.760
 there is this city 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.940
 that it is not oil or very cold and 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.410
 neither very hot very hot because 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.410
 you have to make the cod inside 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.450
 it's the point 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.870
 crossing in the pot and inside 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.700
 Y 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.909
 I keep turning it around as I am 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.909
 walking 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.280
 well look how they are crying 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.780
 the cod beaches these are typical 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:06.250
 of santa marÃ­a door cadiz 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.250
 hello with is terrific 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.680
 at each site they lay a way these 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.210
 Of course this batter is 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.770
 very easy to do because you can see that 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.220
 they are independent leads us to elevate 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.810
 one or nothing only 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.810
 the clear to the point of snow 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.380
 in what makes it take volume 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.380
 the 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.169
 look a pint now we're going to serve 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.650
 a little bit on an absorbent paper for 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:43.960
 that it was good to do these works 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.960
 and then you show them the dish 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.140
 Well, here they are 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.140
 the authentic pariahs of cod 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.539
 I hope there are, because the recipe is 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:03.159
 very easy and you can do it with cod 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.960
 fresh with desalted cod finally 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.479
 dough you also use to make prawns 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.820
 the raincoat and for any any 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.670
 fish that you want to make you worth 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.370
 It is a very simple and very tasty recipe 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.210
 I believe that when you do it you go to 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.319
 to repeat it come 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:26.130
 that the one you get to do it is easy and 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.130
 take advantage
