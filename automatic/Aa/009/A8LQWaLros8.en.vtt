00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.180
 enjoyed hello and welcome 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.460
 my name is dennis and today 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.240
 I introduce you to the stg 44 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.770
 she is also known as the assault rifle 44 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.450
 Let's start with the 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.580
 you can get the dot distribution from 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.190
 me a strength of 6 and one 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.560
 agility of four runs explanation 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.559
 she is a storm rifle like the name 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.140
 Storm Rifle 44 definitely says 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.370
 for ammunition she has 30 to 180 shot 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.620
 and a reload newspaper 215 seconds 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.050
 still not completely empty and 28 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.510
 seconds in when it is completely empty for 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.059
 damage cause damage of 70 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.339
 to 100 if you have the zombie on the head 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.970
 there is a multiplier of may 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.909
 4 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.440
 that means there is a maximum of 400 losses 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.750
 if you then hit the head more 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.570
 when you hit the construction or the legs 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.489
 is there a multiplier of x 1 that 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.250
 It is also called the normal numbers of 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.200
 70 to 100 it all depends on how 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.150
 far away from the zombie the better 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.090
 the closer the more damage the farther 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.750
 the less damage they had away 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.240
 previously rate of 588 rpm and of course 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.100
 automatically we now times 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.590
 to get it you get at the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.280
 wall on the cards crazy shi no numa 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.119
 and the giant for every 1200 points 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.539
 now it comes 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.240
 the sparrow 447 plus she gets me one 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.520
 Strength of 7 and agility of 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.820
 six to the weapons declaration she has now 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.969
 ammo from 60 dead to 300 so that 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.799
 magazine has doubled from 30 to 60 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.079
 I think it's all right that the 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.649
 weapon now has something of one 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.439
 small mg or sole hk or rpk 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.719
 I think it's cool that the 60 now 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.539
 shot I like to use too 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.810
 if you lose money if so 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.810
 she panics but still she is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.560
 very good if you had 60 shot one 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.610
 Magazine to reload time you need 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.370
 215 seconds if they are not quite 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.770
 is empty and 28 seconds if it is completely 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.850
 So let's go after a long time 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.980
 not changed 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.920
 to harm now she makes one 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.950
 hurt by 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.900
 cause damage from 100 to 150 and if 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.370
 man hits the zombie on the head 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.330
 a multiplier of x 53 750 damage 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.330
 that is a little more than before and about 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.239
 350 damage more so it's okay 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.190
 said if you are in zombie then 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.380
 still on the belly or on the leg meets 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.390
 it always also in the multiplier of x 1 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.819
 the 100 to 150 damage 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.000
 it depends on how far you go 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.950
 is therefore the fire mode is natural 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.500
 vollautomatisch and panschen you can 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.239
 get on crazy and track that number 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.140
 It was the first time until the next 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.140
 video and cher
