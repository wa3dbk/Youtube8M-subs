start flowering out you do have to let

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.439 
start flowering out you do have to let
them<00:00:19.350> grow<00:00:19.609> after<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> while<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.359> have

and i decided instead of having a
laneway<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.940> was<00:02:53.120> quite<00:02:53.510> light<00:02:53.870> if<00:02:54.050> they

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
laneway that was quite light if they

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.870 
laneway that was quite light if they
needed<00:02:54.350> i<00:02:54.530> expand<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.010> garden<00:02:55.459> for<00:02:55.610> my<00:02:55.730> wife

down<00:03:28.040> over<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.610> years<00:03:28.820> with<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.150> vehicles

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
down over the years with the vehicles

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.920 
down over the years with the vehicles
and<00:03:30.640> it's<00:03:31.640> been<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:31.820> dry<00:03:32.150> lately<00:03:32.510> like<00:03:32.780> we

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and it's been so dry lately like we

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.630 
and it's been so dry lately like we
haven't<00:03:33.110> really<00:03:33.200> had<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.440> lot<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:34.010> think

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
haven't really had a lot of I think

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.180 
haven't really had a lot of I think
overall<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:35.209> year<00:03:35.269> we've<00:03:35.570> had<00:03:35.720> good

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
overall this year we've had good

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.990 
overall this year we've had good
precipitation<00:03:37.190> but<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.459> last<00:03:37.610> few<00:03:37.730> weeks

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
precipitation but the last few weeks

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000 
precipitation but the last few weeks
were<00:03:38.150> pretty<00:03:38.360> dry<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.870> think<00:03:39.110> honestly<00:03:39.920> I

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
were pretty dry and I think honestly I

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.110 
were pretty dry and I think honestly I
think<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.280> air<00:03:40.430> has<00:03:40.610> been<00:03:40.640> dry<00:03:40.940> so

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
think the air has been dry so

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.759 
think the air has been dry so
everything's<00:03:41.390> drying<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:41.780> faster<00:03:42.230> after<00:03:42.380> rain

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
everything's drying it faster after rain

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.970 
everything's drying it faster after rain
to<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.190> noticing<00:03:44.350> but<00:03:45.350> all<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.739> first

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
just bouncing off the ground all it did

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.150 
just bouncing off the ground all it did
was<00:03:50.060> cut<00:03:50.630> up<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.810> bit<00:03:50.959> of<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.080> grass<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.620> i

way which we have to weed because this

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.619 
way which we have to weed because this
was<00:04:42.800> from<00:04:42.919> last<00:04:43.159> year<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:44.270> never<00:04:44.449> got

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 
was from last year and I never got

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:45.760 
was from last year and I never got
around<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.960> digging<00:04:45.259> them<00:04:45.379> up<00:04:45.470> because<00:04:45.590> they

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
around to digging them up because they

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.610 
around to digging them up because they
didn't<00:04:45.979> actually<00:04:46.099> grow<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.580> good<00:04:46.789> last<00:04:47.000> year

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
didn't actually grow that good last year

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.629 
didn't actually grow that good last year
part<00:04:48.620> of<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.860> reason<00:04:48.889> is<00:04:49.340> because<00:04:49.430> this

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
part of that reason is because this

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.570 
part of that reason is because this
garden<00:04:50.000> is<00:04:50.060> very<00:04:50.120> fertile<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:50.750> spread<00:04:51.289> I<00:04:51.580> must

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.399 
garden is very fertile I spread I must

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
was hitting roots and rocks every time I

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.149 
was hitting roots and rocks every time I

was telling it was the worst so I

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.159 
was telling it was the worst so I
actually<00:05:01.400> built<00:05:01.819> up<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.150> back<00:05:02.330> almost<00:05:02.599> a<00:05:02.870> foot

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
actually built up the back almost a foot

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.499 
actually built up the back almost a foot
and<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:04.370> left<00:05:04.669> that<00:05:04.819> city<00:05:05.090> year<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.449> I

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
and I left that city year and I

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.290 
and I left that city year and I
basically<00:05:05.659> composted<00:05:06.560> in<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.740> garden<00:05:07.300> but

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
basically composted in the garden but

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.469 
basically composted in the garden but
because<00:05:08.599> it's<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:08.960> fertile<00:05:09.969> root<00:05:10.969> crops<00:05:11.240> like

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
because it's so fertile root crops like

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.209 
because it's so fertile root crops like
onions<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.020> radishes<00:05:12.380> don't<00:05:12.800> do<00:05:12.919> well<00:05:13.099> up

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
onions and radishes don't do well up

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.010 
onions and radishes don't do well up
here<00:05:13.430> we<00:05:13.819> grew<00:05:14.030> radishes<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.599> leaves<00:05:14.780> were

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
here we grew radishes the leaves were

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.930 
here we grew radishes the leaves were
huge<00:05:15.289> and<00:05:15.469> the<00:05:15.590> bulbs<00:05:15.860> for<00:05:16.039> any<00:05:16.430> many<00:05:16.699> things

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
huge and the bulbs for any many things

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.869

doing a lot of nice green shoots on them
yeah<00:05:28.219> they're<00:05:28.460> doing<00:05:28.729> really<00:05:29.000> well<00:05:29.210> so<00:05:29.479> far

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509

yeah they're doing really well so far
yep<00:05:30.050> needs<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.770> do<00:05:30.979> of<00:05:31.039> course<00:05:31.190> with<00:05:31.340> the

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
yep needs to do of course with the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.149 
yep needs to do of course with the
fertility<00:05:32.090> comes<00:05:32.529> extra<00:05:33.529> food<00:05:33.680> for<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.949> weeds

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
fertility comes extra food for the weeds

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.939 
fertility comes extra food for the weeds
but<00:05:34.840> once<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.930> dries<00:05:36.139> up<00:05:36.380> we<00:05:36.529> can<00:05:36.680> get<00:05:36.830> that

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
but once it dries up we can get that

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.499 
but once it dries up we can get that
done<00:05:37.009> but<00:05:38.710> yeah<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:39.889> was<00:05:40.039> really<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.759> used<00:05:41.389> to

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
done but yeah it was really that used to

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.890 
done but yeah it was really that used to
downslope<00:05:42.020> oh<00:05:42.169> yeah<00:05:42.349> your<00:05:42.919> foot<00:05:43.219> down<00:05:43.449> so<00:05:44.449> but
