and then broke like it's on ice but I

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.140 
and then broke like it's on ice but I
want<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.130> try<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.400> send<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.670> again<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:46.090> time

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
want to try and send it again this time

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.480 
want to try and send it again this time
I'm<00:02:46.360> gonna<00:02:46.480> heat<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.690> up<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:47.230> think<00:02:48.100> this<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
I'm gonna heat it up I think this is the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.290 
I'm gonna heat it up I think this is the
right<00:02:48.640> way<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> do<00:02:49.000> it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
right way to do it

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.960 
right way to do it
we<00:02:49.570> shot<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> real<00:02:50.170> torch<00:02:51.730> brulee

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
we shot a real torch brulee

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.530 
we shot a real torch brulee
torch<00:02:52.180> I'm<00:02:52.720> using<00:02:52.930> for<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:55.330> know<00:02:55.420> what

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
torch I'm using for this you know what

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.170 
torch I'm using for this you know what
brulee<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:57.160> like<00:02:57.400> stuff<00:02:57.790> they<00:02:57.910> put<00:02:58.090> on

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
brulee is that like stuff they put on

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.150 
brulee is that like stuff they put on
the<00:02:58.300> pie<00:02:58.510> let's<00:02:59.410> try<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.680> stop<00:02:59.830> me

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the pie let's try and stop me

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.550 
the pie let's try and stop me
oh<00:03:00.900> yeah<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.080> set<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.380> there<00:03:02.560> real<00:03:02.710> nice

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
oh yeah it's set in there real nice

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.560 
oh yeah it's set in there real nice
that's<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.740> time<00:03:06.610> for<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.910> fun<00:03:07.090> part

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
that's it time for the fun part

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.700 
that's it time for the fun part
assemble<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:09.900> Titan<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:10.990> in<00:03:11.200> there<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.620> it

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
assemble it Titan is in there so it

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:21.290 
assemble it Titan is in there so it
doesn't<00:03:11.890> come<00:03:12.130> out<00:03:12.250> accidentally<00:03:13.530> that's<00:03:14.530> set

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.090 

okay<00:03:22.300> so<00:03:22.810> we're<00:03:22.900> gonna<00:03:22.990> put<00:03:23.200> this<00:03:23.350> one<00:03:23.410> only<00:03:24.070> a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
okay so we're gonna put this one only a

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:41.920 
okay so we're gonna put this one only a
nut<00:03:24.630> since<00:03:25.630> I<00:03:25.750> broke<00:03:25.990> the<00:03:26.140> t-handle

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.440 

these<00:03:42.930> shoulder<00:03:43.380> bolts<00:03:43.710> now<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:45.090> shoulder

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
these shoulder bolts now the shoulder

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.350 
these shoulder bolts now the shoulder
bolt<00:03:45.660> goes<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.050> just<00:03:46.080> like<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.880> looks<00:03:47.880> pretty

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
bolt goes in just like this looks pretty

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:59.120 
bolt goes in just like this looks pretty
sweet<00:03:55.730> smooth<00:03:57.140> this<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.320> kind<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.680> big<00:03:58.890> dolly

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
sweet smooth this is kind of a big dolly

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.310 
sweet smooth this is kind of a big dolly
and<00:03:59.460> I<00:03:59.580> made<00:03:59.790> versus<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.300> real<00:04:00.660> like<00:04:00.990> small

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
and I made versus a real like small

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.970 
and I made versus a real like small
pickle<00:04:01.650> dolly

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
pickle dolly

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.800 
pickle dolly
but<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.640> made<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.850> big<00:04:03.090> because<00:04:03.270> I<00:04:03.450> want<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.660> use

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
but I made it big because I want to use

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.480 
but I made it big because I want to use
it<00:04:03.960> with<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.200> big<00:04:04.380> camera<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.070> monitors

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
it with the big camera and the monitors

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.280 
it with the big camera and the monitors
so<00:04:06.030> that's<00:04:06.210> kind<00:04:06.420> of<00:04:06.450> why<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.600> picked<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.020> size

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
so that's kind of why I picked this size

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.390 
so that's kind of why I picked this size
but<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:07.770> pretty<00:04:07.920> big

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
but it's pretty big

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.000 
but it's pretty big
the<00:04:08.970> Dolly's<00:04:09.360> footprint<00:04:09.900> measures<00:04:10.260> 12<00:04:10.680> by<00:04:10.860> 8

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
the Dolly's footprint measures 12 by 8

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.940 
the Dolly's footprint measures 12 by 8
inches<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:12.480> wave<00:04:12.660> capacity<00:04:13.320> is<00:04:13.440> around<00:04:13.590> a

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
inches and the wave capacity is around a

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.360 
inches and the wave capacity is around a
hundred<00:04:13.980> pounds<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.350> concludes<00:04:16.680> my<00:04:17.010> Pico

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
hundred pounds so that concludes my Pico

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.890 
hundred pounds so that concludes my Pico
dolly<00:04:17.580> build<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:18.120> hope<00:04:18.270> you<00:04:18.390> enjoyed<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.750> video

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
dolly build I hope you enjoyed the video

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.840 
dolly build I hope you enjoyed the video
I<00:04:19.170> just<00:04:19.650> wanted<00:04:19.860> to<00:04:20.010> mention<00:04:20.160> really<00:04:20.520> quickly

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
I just wanted to mention really quickly

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.790 
I just wanted to mention really quickly
that<00:04:21.570> in<00:04:21.930> this<00:04:22.230> bill

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
that in this bill

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.640 
that in this bill
I<00:04:22.830> use<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.610> unidirectional<00:04:24.570> swivel<00:04:25.500> head

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
I use this unidirectional swivel head

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.270 
I use this unidirectional swivel head
just<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.400> keep<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.670> cost<00:04:26.880> down<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:28.620> mounted

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
just to keep the cost down and I mounted

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.690 
just to keep the cost down and I mounted
this<00:04:30.140> nylon<00:04:31.140> washer<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:32.220> what<00:04:32.370> that's<00:04:32.550> going

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
this nylon washer and what that's going

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.070 
this nylon washer and what that's going
to<00:04:32.760> do<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.240> creates<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.720> little<00:04:33.840> bit<00:04:34.020> of

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
to do is that creates a little bit of

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.650 
to do is that creates a little bit of
resistance<00:04:34.410> through<00:04:35.340> about<00:04:35.550> 180<00:04:36.240> degrees<00:04:36.630> of

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
resistance through about 180 degrees of

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.780 
resistance through about 180 degrees of
motion<00:04:37.050> from<00:04:37.590> right<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:37.890> left<00:04:38.070> more<00:04:38.760> than

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
motion from right to left more than

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.280 
motion from right to left more than
likely<00:04:39.120> I'm<00:04:39.330> going<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.510> swap<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:39.930> out<00:04:40.080> with<00:04:40.260> a

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
likely I'm going to swap this out with a

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.020 
likely I'm going to swap this out with a
bi-directional<00:04:40.500> head<00:04:41.280> just<00:04:41.700> because<00:04:41.820> I'm

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
bi-directional head just because I'm

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.900 
bi-directional head just because I'm
gonna<00:04:42.180> use<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:42.510> little<00:04:42.660> dolly<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.110> lot<00:04:43.320> and

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
gonna use this little dolly a lot and

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
gonna use this little dolly a lot and
makes<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:45.000> lot<00:04:45.150> easier<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.570> use<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.870> more

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
makes a lot easier to use and more

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.990 
makes a lot easier to use and more
reliable<00:04:46.470> so<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.130> I'm<00:04:47.310> gonna<00:04:47.430> buy<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.580> new<00:04:47.700> tee
