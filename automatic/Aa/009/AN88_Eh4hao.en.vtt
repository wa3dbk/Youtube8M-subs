00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
and easily if you find is going on tight

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.840 
and easily if you find is going on tight
then<00:02:46.140> take<00:02:46.740> it<00:02:46.860> up<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.130> try<00:02:47.280> putting<00:02:47.520> on<00:02:47.580> again

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
then take it up and try putting on again

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.070 
then take it up and try putting on again
because<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.090> might<00:02:48.240> cross<00:02:48.480> threaded<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.959> and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
because you might cross threaded it and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.270 
because you might cross threaded it and
that<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.260> wheel<00:02:49.380> damaged<00:02:49.740> theme<00:02:49.950> yet<00:02:50.130> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
that the wheel damaged theme yet the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.190 
that the wheel damaged theme yet the
crank<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.630> grab<00:02:54.890> pedal<00:02:55.890> spanner

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
crank so you can just grab pedal spanner

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.580 
crank so you can just grab pedal spanner
then<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:58.520> tighten<00:02:59.520> them<00:02:59.850> up<00:02:59.940> there<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.590> just

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
then just tighten them up there I just

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.990 
then just tighten them up there I just
do<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.800> same

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.960 

so<00:03:10.870> again<00:03:11.050> just<00:03:11.080> put<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.130> ice<00:03:12.670> with<00:03:12.880> your

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
fingers for the first few threads and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.150 
fingers for the first few threads and
just<00:03:15.280> back<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.390> pedal<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:18.070> winds<00:03:18.400> itself<00:03:18.670> up

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
just back this pedal it winds itself up

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:31.620 
just back this pedal it winds itself up
and<00:03:21.160> again<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:23.320> snip<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.590> up<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:31.360> your<00:03:31.480> bike
