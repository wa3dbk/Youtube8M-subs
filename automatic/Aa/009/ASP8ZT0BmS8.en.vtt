00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.259
 temperature + 22 plus 24 degrees at night 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.520
 it is desirable to reduce the temperature on 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.979
 several degrees 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.560
 orchids do not like drafts and direct 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.340
 sun rays otherwise 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.520
 quite often 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.310
 moisture burns on leaves 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.380
 air need 60-70 percent so 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.879
 it is desirable to purchase a humidifier 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.849

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.600
 rot if watering in the center of the outlet 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.610
