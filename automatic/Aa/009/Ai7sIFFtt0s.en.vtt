00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.940
 i 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.530
 hello very good to all friends 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.970
 from fifa 13 today I bring you the second 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.800
 tutorial of the channel that many of

 you have asked me today 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.820
 I will teach to throw the new faults 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.079
 tactics includes this fifa 13 but before 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.550
 to start with the tutorial I wanted to

 video do not hesitate to put them in the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.770
 comments 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.770
 Let's go there 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.220
 the first practical fault we're going to 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.020
 see in this tutorial the launch with 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.660
 the first pitcher from the right side 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.489
 of the something basic area that we should know 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.080
 is that both to launch and to 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.330
 Aim with the second and third caster 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.800
 is that we must press the button with the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.920
 that we call him to execute the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.930
 action 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.240
 I am going to teach you how to throw this fault 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 with two threats but you can throw it alone 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 with one or throw it directly 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.820
 The first thing we should do is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.710
 call the three pitchers and then 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.700
 put the shoulder of the first defense of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.700
 barrier next to the stick 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.860
 then turn off with the second 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.340
 pitcher like we would in a sub match 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.340
 more pass 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.399
 then we will do the same with the third 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.399
 pitcher 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.140
 and finally we loaded two bars 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.680
 power while we put the joystick 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.680
 as in the video 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.860
 in this way we will have achieved 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.530
 cheat the barrier and score a goal with 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.060
 pretty good effect as you see in this 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.570
 example can also be done with a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.570
 single magician 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.320
 now we will see the simplest fault the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.080
 we will launch with the second pitcher from 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.240
 the right side with a single feint what 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.400
 first thing to do is call the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.600
 second pitcher and leave a gap between 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.600
 the stick and the last defense 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.040
 then off with the first launcher 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.270
 and finally we loaded two bars 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.690
 power while we keep the joystick 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.690
 straight 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.080
 the lack that we're going to see now is a 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.140
 simple lack fast and accurate that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.670
 comes executed ensures a great goal 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.380
 to execute this fault the first thing that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.540
 we should do is call the second 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.370
 pitcher and put the head of the defense 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.860
 on the stick this usually happens 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.310
 automatically so surely not 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.240
 we have to move the defense 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.250
 then off with the first launcher 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.170
 finally we put together two bars 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.100
 power while we keep the gesture 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.100
 straight up 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.069
 with this lack we will score great goals 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.569
 since the precision it has is very 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.569
 hard to stop for the goalkeeper 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.220
 and to finish the last fault that 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.320
 let's see in this tutorial is the one 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.210
 The most you asked me is the one that came out 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.150
 the fifa 13 trailer where a player 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.070
 he raised the ball and another one was a 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.990
 it's quite difficult since it depends on 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.530
 the definition of the launcher but if 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.330
 we will not get an amazing goal 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.330
 let's see how to perform this fault 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.770
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.770
 call the three pitchers 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.110
 then we will make the third mother 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.860
 now we will give you with the second a little 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.680
 the center button if we passed and we 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.139
 will go to the second of auctioneer that is another 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.320
 shooting option 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.800
 and now we will try 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.500
 if we are lucky we will just put a 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.230
 golazo 'made in' fifa 13 although as already 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.720
 I said it depends on the definition of 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.330
 pitcher 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.170
 with lefties for me it is much more 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.860
 difficult to mark but good to the best they are 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.080
 only my things 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.580
 for the next video I will try 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.509
 bring a kind of newsletter 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.509
 informative with 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.860
 future series that I have thought a series 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.680
 of tutorials and 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.650
 and the thank you video that 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.650
 I said if you have any questions or 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.419
 suggestion you can put it or in the 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.310
 comments from youtube or send me a 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.280
 tweet to my twitter that leaves it in the 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:32.030
 description please subscribe to give you 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.030
