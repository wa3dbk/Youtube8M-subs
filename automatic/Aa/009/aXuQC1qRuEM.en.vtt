scientist from the University of New
South<00:00:20.160> Wales<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.390> episode<00:00:21.810> we're

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
South Wales and in this episode we're

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140 
South Wales and in this episode we're
going<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.140> focus<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.650> breaking<00:00:22.920> waves<00:00:23.340> what

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
going to focus on breaking waves what

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.820 
going to focus on breaking waves what
happens<00:00:24.570> two<00:00:24.689> ways<00:00:24.900> when<00:00:25.289> they<00:00:25.470> come<00:00:25.680> into

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
happens two ways when they come into

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.189 
happens two ways when they come into
shallow<00:00:26.099> water<00:00:26.250> how<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.300> slow<00:00:27.599> down<00:00:27.840> how

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
shallow water how do they slow down how

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.570 
shallow water how do they slow down how
do<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.380> change<00:00:28.619> their<00:00:28.859> shape<00:00:29.160> how<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.429> they

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
do they change their shape how do they

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.519 
do they change their shape how do they
start<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.880> bend<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.420> when<00:00:30.510> they<00:00:30.599> break<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:31.470> do

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
start to bend and when they break how do

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
start to bend and when they break how do
they<00:00:31.890> break<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.489> curl<00:00:32.730> over<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.090> crash

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
they break then they curl over and crash

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.750 
they break then they curl over and crash
do<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.050> roll<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.440> gently<00:00:34.829> these<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.520> some<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
do they roll in gently these are some of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.160 
do they roll in gently these are some of
the<00:00:35.820> answers<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> explain

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the answers that we're going to explain

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.920 
the answers that we're going to explain
today<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> way<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> waves<00:00:45.000> finally<00:00:45.450> break

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
today the way the waves finally break

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.389 
today the way the waves finally break
really<00:00:46.260> depends<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.890> what's<00:00:47.129> underneath

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
really depends on what's underneath

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.250 
really depends on what's underneath
what's<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> shape<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> bottom<00:00:48.780> there's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
what's the shape of the bottom there's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
what's the shape of the bottom there's
three<00:00:49.530> basic<00:00:49.649> types<00:00:50.039> he's<00:00:50.309> punching<00:00:50.730> waves

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
three basic types he's punching waves

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.959 
three basic types he's punching waves
spilling<00:00:51.870> waves<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.410> surging<00:00:53.100> waves<00:00:53.280> now

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
spilling waves and surging waves now

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.639 
spilling waves and surging waves now
today<00:00:54.239> behind<00:00:54.660> me<00:00:54.840> we've<00:00:55.020> got<00:00:55.170> some<00:00:55.320> classic

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
today behind me we've got some classic

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.010 
today behind me we've got some classic
spilling<00:00:56.219> waves<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.300> bottom<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> beach

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
spilling waves the bottom of the beach

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500 
spilling waves the bottom of the beach
of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> ocean<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.920> fairly<00:00:59.309> flat<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> waves

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
of the ocean is fairly flat so the waves

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.450 
of the ocean is fairly flat so the waves
come<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:01.350> slow<00:01:01.710> down<00:01:01.739> gently

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
come in they slow down gently

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.549 
come in they slow down gently
they<00:01:02.789> steep<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.329> gently<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.899> when<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.260> break

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
they steep in gently and when they break

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
they steep in gently and when they break
they<00:01:04.949> break<00:01:05.280> gently<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.210> top<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
they break gently and the top of the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.450 
they break gently and the top of the
waves<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.409> spill<00:01:07.710> down<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> front<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
waves just spill down the front of the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
waves just spill down the front of the
wave<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.390> call<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> spilling

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
wave that's what we call it a spilling

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.280 
wave that's what we call it a spilling
wave<00:01:10.310> now<00:01:11.310> another<00:01:12.180> common<00:01:12.479> type<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> called<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
wave now another common type is called a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
wave now another common type is called a
plunging<00:01:13.740> wave<00:01:13.890> these<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.280> called<00:01:14.400> dumpers

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
plunging wave these are called dumpers

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
plunging wave these are called dumpers
or<00:01:15.119> barrels<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.689> tubes<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.650> these<00:01:16.799> happen

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
or barrels or tubes and these happen

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
or barrels or tubes and these happen
when<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> waves<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.570> deep<00:01:18.780> water<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
when the waves go from deep water to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.260 
when the waves go from deep water to
shallow<00:01:19.470> water<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.400> quickly<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.060> they

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
shallow water really quickly and they

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
shallow water really quickly and they
slow<00:01:21.540> down<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.990> fast<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.040> start<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> get

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
slow down so fast that you start to get

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
slow down so fast that you start to get
this<00:01:23.700> curl<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.390> motion<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> water<00:01:25.110> curling

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
this curl or motion of water curling

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.160 
this curl or motion of water curling
over<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.100> crashing<00:01:26.790> down<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.840> that's<00:01:28.020> not

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
over and crashing down now that's not

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200 
over and crashing down now that's not
happening<00:01:28.650> today<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.220> waters<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:29.970> deep

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
happening today the waters not deep

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.530 
happening today the waters not deep
enough

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
enough

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
enough
when<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.020> gets<00:01:31.200> deep<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.680> waves<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:32.040> start

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
when it gets deep the waves will start

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
when it gets deep the waves will start
to<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:34.079> third<00:01:34.350> type<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.680> called<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
to do that the third type is called a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
to do that the third type is called a
surging<00:01:35.400> wave<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.850> these<00:01:35.939> ones<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.240> also

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
surging wave and these ones are also

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
surging wave and these ones are also
very<00:01:36.720> common<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.200> they're<00:01:37.320> totally

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
very common but they're totally

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.060 
very common but they're totally
different

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
different

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010 
different
they<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:38.520> curl<00:01:38.759> over<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.150> plunge<00:01:39.450> they

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
they don't curl over and plunge they

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080 
they don't curl over and plunge they
don't<00:01:40.200> spill<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.460> sort<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.640> form<00:01:41.939> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
don't spill they just sort of form this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
don't spill they just sort of form this
bows<00:01:42.479> near<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> shore<00:01:43.290> line<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.950> when<00:01:44.100> they

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bows near the shore line and when they

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370 
bows near the shore line and when they
break<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.909> rush<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:45.780> fast<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
break they just rush up really fast and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
break they just rush up really fast and
they<00:01:46.470> surge<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.159> fast<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:48.060> they

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
they surge up really fast and then they

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030 
they surge up really fast and then they
rush<00:01:48.360> back<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.229> they<00:01:49.350> tend<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> happen<00:01:49.829> when

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
rush back and they tend to happen when

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.539 
rush back and they tend to happen when
beaches<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.700> fairly<00:01:50.970> steep<00:01:52.310> well<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> whole

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
beaches are fairly steep well the whole

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.310 
beaches are fairly steep well the whole
reason<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.240> surfing<00:01:54.509> waves<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.140> because

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
reason we get surfing waves is because

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.899 
reason we get surfing waves is because
when<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> waves<00:01:55.770> come<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.189> from<00:01:56.520> deep<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
when the waves come in from deep to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.940 
when the waves come in from deep to
shallow<00:01:56.939> water<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.659> slow<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.439> they

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
shallow water they slow down and they

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.469 
shallow water they slow down and they
interact<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> shape<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.030> bottom

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
interact with the shape of the bottom

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.240 
interact with the shape of the bottom
and<00:02:00.630> sometimes<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.229> bend<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.860> that's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and sometimes they can bend and that's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.340 
and sometimes they can bend and that's
called<00:02:02.490> wave<00:02:02.729> refraction<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:04.049> let's<00:02:04.229> say

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
called wave refraction so let's say

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
called wave refraction so let's say
you've<00:02:04.530> got<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.710> rock<00:02:05.219> headland<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.030> out<00:02:06.600> here

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
you've got a rock headland and out here

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
you've got a rock headland and out here
the<00:02:06.930> waves<00:02:07.110> are<00:02:07.350> coming<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.740> nice

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the waves are coming in nice

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
the waves are coming in nice
Strait<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.700> crest<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.299> parallel<00:02:09.780> straight

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
Strait the crest of parallel straight

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.949 
Strait the crest of parallel straight
and<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.519> wave<00:02:11.730> starts<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.599> get<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
and then the wave starts to get in the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.899 
and then the wave starts to get in the
shallower<00:02:13.349> water<00:02:13.590> at<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.860> headland<00:02:14.220> well

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
shallower water at the headland well

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.240 
shallower water at the headland well
this<00:02:15.030> part<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> wave<00:02:15.569> slows<00:02:16.019> down<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.980> part

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
this part of the wave slows down is part

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.490 
this part of the wave slows down is part
of<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> wave<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.670> still<00:02:17.940> going<00:02:18.150> fast<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.049> you

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
of the wave is still going fast so you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.940 
of the wave is still going fast so you
start<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.950> get<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.310> bending<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.900> way<00:02:22.049> and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
start to get this bending of the way and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.890 
start to get this bending of the way and
that<00:02:23.010> bending<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:24.060> called<00:02:24.360> wave<00:02:24.569> refraction

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
that bending is called wave refraction

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.899 
that bending is called wave refraction
that's<00:02:25.769> why<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:26.069> jump<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.430> wave<00:02:26.579> here

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
that's why you can jump in a wave here

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:35.030 
that's why you can jump in a wave here
and<00:02:26.940> surf<00:02:27.269> all<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.569> way<00:02:27.840> around

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.230 

well<00:02:36.040> we've<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.340> talked<00:02:36.490> about<00:02:36.670> why<00:02:36.880> waves

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
well we've just talked about why waves

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.760 
well we've just talked about why waves
breaking<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.900> ocean<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.500> different

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
breaking the ocean and the different

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.680 
breaking the ocean and the different
types<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.100> breaking<00:02:39.490> waves<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.450> next

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
types of breaking waves in the next

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.810 
types of breaking waves in the next
episode<00:02:41.020> we'll<00:02:41.170> focus<00:02:41.200> on<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.740> tie<00:02:41.950> believe

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
episode we'll focus on the tie believe

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.550 
episode we'll focus on the tie believe
it<00:02:42.910> or<00:02:43.000> not<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.240> tide<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.720> wave<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.470> a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
it or not the tide is a wave and it's a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.910 
it or not the tide is a wave and it's a
lot<00:02:44.740> more<00:02:44.770> complex<00:02:45.370> than<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.640> might<00:02:45.880> think
