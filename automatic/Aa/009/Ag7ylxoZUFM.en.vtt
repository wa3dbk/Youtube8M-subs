 the products that has also caused 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 a lot of interest in stadiums maybe not so much 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.530
 but by a lot of international press 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.540

 you can take pictures in 360 degrees and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.980
 in this way let's say something much 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.140
 simpler is to capture perhaps a 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.940
