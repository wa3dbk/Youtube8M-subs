momentum<00:03:59.370> down<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> line<00:04:02.480> but<00:04:03.480> first<00:04:03.870> they

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
momentum down the line but first they

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.490 
momentum down the line but first they

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
having fun flying down the line it was a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.910 
having fun flying down the line it was a
great<00:04:09.780> joke<00:04:10.760> well<00:04:11.760> usually<00:04:12.030> we<00:04:12.450> have<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.920> they

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
told each other and to make matters

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.900 
told each other and to make matters
worse<00:04:16.350> they<00:04:16.739> tell<00:04:16.890> her<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.070> go<00:04:17.190> faster

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
worse they tell her to go faster

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.950
