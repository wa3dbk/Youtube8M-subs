cutting up wild game meat is actually
this<00:01:22.680> kubera<00:01:23.250> over<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:24.330> Westin<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
this kubera over here from Westin and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.469 
this kubera over here from Westin and
this<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.229> basically<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.369> same<00:01:26.640> thing<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this is basically the same thing just a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.450 
this is basically the same thing just a
little<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.080> aggressive<00:01:28.740> than<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
little bit more aggressive than what the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.580 
little bit more aggressive than what the
needle<00:01:29.729> tenderizer<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.409> just

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
needle tenderizer is and we can just

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.170 
needle tenderizer is and we can just
drop<00:01:31.860> these<00:01:32.100> steaks<00:01:32.430> right<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:32.909> through

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
drop these steaks right down through

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
drop these steaks right down through
here<00:01:33.270> put<00:01:34.020> them<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.470> through<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
here put them right down through the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
here put them right down through the
cuber<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.299> how<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.659> cuts<00:01:36.990> those

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
cuber you can see how it cuts those

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
cuber you can see how it cuts those
vertical<00:01:37.829> slits<00:01:38.220> right<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> meat<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
vertical slits right in the meat and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
vertical slits right in the meat and
this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.780> basically<00:01:40.229> doing<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.770> thing

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
this is basically doing the same thing

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
this is basically doing the same thing
it's<00:01:41.430> tenderizing<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.270> almost<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
it's tenderizing it almost just like a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.710 
it's tenderizing it almost just like a
Swiss<00:01:43.770> steak<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.610> we'll<00:01:44.850> crisscross<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
Swiss steak now we'll crisscross the
