00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi it's valve I hope you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.810
 be fine since me yes that my 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.790
 company to commit central on the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.040
 skateboard demo 3 we did not want to go 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.130
 on the newspaper on the demo I do not know 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.420
 why do not ask me so finally 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.449
 small size tito video for you 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.340
 explain the party that fringes as 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.300
 So you want to come home here 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.660
 so we have to make our beds and after the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.600
 gesture of the ghost and the paper so gr b 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.079
 with where they lt and do the game stick 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.690
 from left to right, we have to do well 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.770
 quite quickly the gap in flat that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.649
 it means that there is not much 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.180
 authors but otherwise that's so it's 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.960
 easy but when the page is its 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.940
 policy 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 so I specify we can not do a game 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.160
 white it must be done that at the stop and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 so it's pretty short and I specify 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.610
 so you have to be easy because 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.550
 normal they are not fast enough advanced 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.100
 and that make it easy for you to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.439
 the circle so here I was turning 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.990
 central parking meters that handles pretty well 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.840
 backflip on the floor that makes backflip 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.939
 crisis air bag was crisis is there 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.900

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.250
 comet 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.250
 go ahead my name 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.420

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.420
 that it is true that it is not bad hard 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:46.840

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:49.120
