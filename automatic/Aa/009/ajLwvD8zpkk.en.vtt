to<00:00:25.380> look<00:00:25.560> at<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.859> top<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.400> Jordan<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.090> I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
to look at the top for the Jordan and I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.089 
to look at the top for the Jordan and I
picked<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.199> let's<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.500> started<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:29.010> this

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
picked so let's get started now this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.030 
picked so let's get started now this
first<00:00:29.250> entry<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:29.789> HSC<00:00:30.390> hash<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.869> really<00:00:31.830> well

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
first entry by HSC hash is really well

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.620 
first entry by HSC hash is really well
laid<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> fact<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.480> he

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
laid out I like the fact that he

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
laid out I like the fact that he
actually<00:00:33.780> took<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> time<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.620> draw<00:00:34.860> XDA<00:00:35.520> in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
actually took the time to draw XDA in

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.819 
actually took the time to draw XDA in
the<00:00:36.090> code<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.989> let's<00:00:37.170> run<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.739> what

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the code so let's run this and see what

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.860 
the code so let's run this and see what
it<00:00:38.010> comes<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.570> we

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it comes up with and as you can see we

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.290 
it comes up with and as you can see we
got<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> nice<00:00:43.170> bar<00:00:43.469> code<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:45.030> bar

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
got a nice bar code there and this bar

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.010 
got a nice bar code there and this bar
code<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.690> scandal<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.940> tried<00:00:47.940> once<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.989> was

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
code is scandal I tried once and it was

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.360 
code is scandal I tried once and it was
kind<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.320> difficult<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> work<00:00:50.309> but

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
kind of difficult to get it to work but

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.800 
kind of difficult to get it to work but
let's<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:52.079> now

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.470 

alright<00:00:59.470> and<00:00:59.830> after<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.580> little<00:01:01.210> bit<00:01:01.390> of

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
alright and after a little bit of

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.150 
alright and after a little bit of
trickery<00:01:01.780> i<00:01:02.050> was<00:01:02.290> able<00:01:02.470> to<00:01:02.620> actually<00:01:02.740> get<00:01:03.070> it

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
trickery i was able to actually get it

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.310 
trickery i was able to actually get it
to<00:01:03.280> scan<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:03.940> came<00:01:04.090> up<00:01:04.300> with<00:01:04.540> XDA

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
to scan and it came up with XDA

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.880 
to scan and it came up with XDA

entry<00:01:33.460> by<00:01:33.670> mr<00:01:34.210> c<00:01:34.479> ln<00:01:34.990> FS<00:01:35.830> was<00:01:36.430> an<00:01:36.640> extremely

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
entry by mr c ln FS was an extremely

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.000 
entry by mr c ln FS was an extremely
long<00:01:37.540> one<00:01:37.869> he<00:01:38.080> had<00:01:38.170> actually<00:01:38.350> put<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.740> into<00:01:38.830> a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
long one he had actually put it into a

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.920 
long one he had actually put it into a
zip<00:01:39.310> file<00:01:39.520> because<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.030> was<00:01:40.150> so<00:01:40.479> darn<00:01:40.720> long

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
zip file because it was so darn long

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.840 
zip file because it was so darn long
let's<00:01:41.740> take<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.920> look<00:01:42.100> at<00:01:42.190> this<00:01:42.310> one<00:01:42.550> he<00:01:42.700> also

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
let's take a look at this one he also

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.820 
let's take a look at this one he also
included<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.390> video<00:01:43.660> in<00:01:43.840> his<00:01:43.960> entry<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.470> well<00:01:44.650> to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
included a video in his entry as well to

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.859 
included a video in his entry as well to
show<00:01:45.010> how<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.520> script<00:01:46.119> worked<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.690> is

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
show how the script worked this is

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.090 
show how the script worked this is
pretty<00:01:47.050> interesting<00:01:47.140> because<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:47.950> actually

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
pretty interesting because it actually

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.590 
pretty interesting because it actually
tells<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.729> change<00:01:49.000> your<00:01:49.150> screen

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
tells you to change your screen

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.930 
tells you to change your screen
resolution<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:51.009> let's<00:01:51.310> make<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.550> same<00:01:51.759> full

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
resolution so let's make the same full

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.670 
resolution so let's make the same full
screen

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 

now<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.370> tried<00:01:56.490> several<00:01:56.880> things<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.510> but<00:01:57.720> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
now I tried several things on this but I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.930 
now I tried several things on this but I
could<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.530> QR<00:01:58.890> code<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.220> scan<00:01:59.460> this

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
could not get this QR code to scan this

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.240 
could not get this QR code to scan this
