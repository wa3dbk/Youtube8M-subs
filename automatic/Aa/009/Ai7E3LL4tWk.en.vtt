unboxed<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.490> Ventus<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.329> we're<00:01:48.840> amazed<00:01:49.200> at

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
unboxed a Ventus one and we're amazed at

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.999 
unboxed a Ventus one and we're amazed at
the<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.770> powerful<00:01:50.250> g-power<00:01:51.079> 950<00:01:52.079> g<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.829> we

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the very powerful g-power 950 g so we

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.560 
the very powerful g-power 950 g so we
expect<00:01:53.369> good<00:01:53.610> things<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.420> as

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
game from the very beginning he can it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.479 
game from the very beginning he can it
be<00:03:26.570> part<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.049> initial<00:03:27.410> team<00:03:27.620> he<00:03:28.190> has<00:03:28.340> to

be part of the initial team he has to

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.789 
be part of the initial team he has to
evolve<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.900> card<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.290> called<00:03:30.500> quake

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
evolve so this card is called quake

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.550 
evolve so this card is called quake
Dragonoid<00:03:31.310> evolution<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.720> says<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.380> this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
Dragonoid evolution it says that this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.710 
Dragonoid evolution it says that this
