the back of the valve cover has got
issues<00:02:50.430> with<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.010> straighten

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
issues with it so have to straighten

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.020

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
forward but I would assume that moves

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:53.100 
forward but I would assume that moves
forward<00:03:01.100> ties<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> way<00:03:02.520> out<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.670> alignment<00:03:04.790> cool
