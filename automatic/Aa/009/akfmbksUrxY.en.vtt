00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.080
 looking for 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.820
 from the extra 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.990
 sony already have the first discovery 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.730
 Made remembered last year 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.380
 we exclusively had the xperia as 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.840
 can show solar and now we can 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.820
 you new halfway exclusively the xperia 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.010
 spz gets closer 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.870
 this is sort of a middle class device 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.090
 that was done a bit on style 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.860
 sony ever good to you have 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.970
 down here and live right here 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.950
 I can not believe that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.200
 here also this transparent one 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.700
 flashing led bar very chic otherwise 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.500
 I was also supple smart 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.110
 Watch was also explaining that to me 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
 is a middle class device that is 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.680
 just on style worth so we shall nice 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.619
 with the aluminum frame and something have what 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.090
 otherwise we have 46 inch screen with 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.560
 720p HD resolution the whole weighs 155 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.410
 gram if I could lose weight here 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.590
 has 8 GB of internal memory 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.619
 Qualcomm Snapdragon 1.7GHz Dual-core 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.960
 otherwise you see here is the soloist 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.130
 on it so you also from the xperia z 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.229
 Of course this is common to all 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.729
 Devices are not the case 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.710
 what do we look at the back of an 8 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.210
 megapixel camera as said a pity that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.950
 I'm not losing weight here right now 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.020
 I can but I watch the sticks her 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.549
 really tight there was now with 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.960
 Violence so or can on the back 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.909
 is the battery cover off because of it 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.479
 So you have framed nicely here 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.740
 camera nfc is of course on board around too 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.019
 times the side look loud-rocker 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.760
 the now typical xperia woman 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.190
 discounts of us very much unfortunately 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.810
 usually no dedicated camera triggers 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.370
 function is there for it is here namely 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.350
 here there is a camera button so 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.959
 Whom the z lacks the economy 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.070
 maybe at the xperia reski find something 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.019
 the left side we have as good as 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.660
 not interesting at all here 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.040
 lateral so rivets 1 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.450
 are the one also looks so with it 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.920
 one seems to take the frame off 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.980
 You can then open the device 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.030
 up here the jack connection we so 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.750
 that the sony xperia sp 419 euro should there 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.840
 the price point for a dual-core 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.430
 4.6 inches with 720p resolution of the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.510
 People nexteer on the droidcon with the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.510
