00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
objective of this mission and I almost

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.700

thought this would be cool if that thing

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
thought this would be cool if that thing
that<00:01:21.720> cutting<00:01:22.259> blade<00:01:22.530> would<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.159> dropped

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that cutting blade would have dropped

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.050 
that cutting blade would have dropped
down<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> did<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:25.729> I<00:01:26.729> don't

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
down right there but it did not I don't
know<00:01:27.119> why<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.330> has<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> speed<00:01:27.990> at<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> bottom

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
know why it has the speed at the bottom

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.870
