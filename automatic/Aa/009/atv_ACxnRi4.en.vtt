00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.810
 It is naive to believe that after such statements 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.370
 secrecy was over 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.620
 and in the us and we have similar photos 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.059
 where else with the official 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.239
 giro print comments will not meet 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.109
 getting them in the archives is also not easy 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.099
 especially large-scale 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.109
 snapshots 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.390
 Well, no, you will not refuse 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.439
 just ask for the number of the snapshot 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.759
 but we will make a copy of it 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.099
 and since we don't know the numbers anyway 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.499
 it means one thing 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.439
 you were politely refused 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.230
 that the attack is more interesting 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.900
 you want to get around everything and 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.470
 still design 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.710
 recall photos or he 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.180
 and they are expensive 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.330
 but you can't even buy the right shot. 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.790
 be sure that it matches 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.670
 original source 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.539
 the most interesting details 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.710
 may be curlicues 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 this has repeatedly come across 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970
 american investigators who 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.940
 were familiar with the original 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.350
 similar fraud 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.840
 the workers themselves admitted 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.950
 photo labs nasa 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.980
 we have an order going photos 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.050
 before publishing them all that may cause 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.510
 unwanted questions 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.710
 in such concealment nothing surprising 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.470
 after all the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.140
 promises new strategic 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.260
 advantages in engineering and economics and 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.570
 politics 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.840
 all the more strange anything and leading 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.320
 space power 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.210
 rub as it once lost interest in 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.500
 expeditions to 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.720
 For more than thirty years, humans have not 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.460
 its surface is disturbing 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.740
 Hall 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.979
 such a wave for a long time 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.549
 extremely small environments on objects not very 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.370
 fly a little 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.360
 at least officially they are very 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.750
 fly a little 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.290
 percent 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.010
 why all the plans to build some 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.440
 smart base 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.549
 we at least 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.090
 the flames of regular flights there are some 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.140
 probes 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.560
 let for purity so for example why they 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.160
 remain relevant 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.550
 not so long ago it became known shocking 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.570
 recognition designer 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.729
 US military 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.060
 shock wave 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.759
 bronze did it shortly after 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.440
 stopping the lunar program 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.940
 but they have us options 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.780
 and the commander for lunch 10 years after 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.349
 flight in one of the private conversations allegedly 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.529
 of companies 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.239
 at the slightest detail 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.519
 I'll just say that 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.290
 ships are far superior to our days 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.619
 size and technology 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.979
 they let us know that the place is taken 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.959
 after this for twenty years but were silent about 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.819
 flights to the moon 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.469
 in 90 second year I was at the conference with them 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.889
 he has five this new mexico state 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:44.979
 America 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.589
 and met with the former senator 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.629
 Clifford Stone which had 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.629
 very curious information 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.509
 clifford that he invited me over 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.589
 m 8 talked for a long time Tomsk Tom 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.919
 talked all night 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.639
 he showed me some unique 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.529
 price shots straight fragments 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.529
 sessions of the us senate 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.309
 once again 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.389
 passed the information 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.459
 here by in the voiced population of the moon 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.329
 by unknown reason about work 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.659
 this unknown mind where there was 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.789
 decision made seems to me that this 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.889
 influenced by what the Americans turned 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.639
 its new program 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.369
 total decision was made temporarily 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:34.109
 suspend 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.509
 here 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.769
 flying american ships apollo 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.599
 naumov 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.699
 I do not exclude that one of the reasons 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.379
 winding up a visa 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.579
 soviet main program 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.519
 not everywhere an anomalous phenomenon with which we 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.359
 concentrate on the ground 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.469
 in shallow with a friend 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.309
 what happens 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.009
 name Chechnya was expelled from London and 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.519
 we are forced to watch her 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.929
 south bank 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:04.479
 may be really true 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.769
 fear powerful 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.069
 aliens which is unequivocally 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.319
 pointed us to the door 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.009
 data center what a big risk 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.699
 too much is not clear 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.979
 too much unclear 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.509
 as people who probably fell for us 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.039
 their fragile devices 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.520
 resisted 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.139
 unknown i mighty a 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.139
 reasonable of all 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.699
 today in different countries but being built in 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.189
 flight plans convoy 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.279
 moscow police technique that 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.700
 developed projects of st 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.920
 new settlements i'm not a word mysterious 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.840
 objects that feel new 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.860
 apartment buildings as if they were not and what is not 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.390
 it is hoped to agree or already 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.940
 agreed because 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.480
 no one really needs 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.890
 and not going for this regular bluff 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.520
 to knock out the state 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.539
 research money 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.680
 and along with the countries that have become budgets 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 finished recklessly a couple of hours but 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.490
 so it was in the previous wave of the program so 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.850
 was with strategic 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.229
 defense initiative with a chance 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.949
 pc delays associated with service too 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.289
 lot 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.729
 at the expense of 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.129
 e 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.550
 the soil 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.689
 6 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.120
 I'm happy 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.240
 m 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.680
 I'm happy 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.939
 6 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.219
 e 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.759
 fearfully 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:36.870
 everything 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.220
