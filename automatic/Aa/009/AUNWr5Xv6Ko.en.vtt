00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
to be the gurus on it on how to pull one

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.360 
to be the gurus on it on how to pull one
of<00:00:54.040> these<00:00:54.130> out<00:00:54.310> my<00:00:55.120> first<00:00:55.390> thought<00:00:55.660> was<00:00:56.370> pull

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
of these out my first thought was pull

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.910 
of these out my first thought was pull
the<00:00:57.550> back<00:00:57.760> pull<00:00:58.450> back<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.900> apart<00:00:59.230> but<00:00:59.590> then<00:00:59.770> if

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
the back pull back and apart but then if

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.940 
the back pull back and apart but then if
you<00:01:00.010> look<00:01:00.329> cut<00:01:01.329> out<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.750> frame<00:01:02.020> the<00:01:02.680> brakes

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
you look cut out in the frame the brakes

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.349 
you look cut out in the frame the brakes
will<00:01:03.190> prohibit<00:01:03.400> that<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.970> then<00:01:04.059> you<00:01:04.119> got<00:01:04.269> to

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:04.359 
will prohibit that and then you got to

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:05.819 
will prohibit that and then you got to
strip<00:01:04.569> out<00:01:04.749> the<00:01:04.780> tires<00:01:05.079> and<00:01:05.319> the<00:01:05.379> axles<00:01:05.740> and

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
strip out the tires and the axles and

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.859 
strip out the tires and the axles and
everything<00:01:06.189> and<00:01:06.369> brake<00:01:06.999> system<00:01:07.390> that's<00:01:07.630> just

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
everything and brake system that's just

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:08.669 
everything and brake system that's just
a<00:01:08.049> big<00:01:08.289> deal

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
he said pulled motor Ford I thought at

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.800 
he said pulled motor Ford I thought at
first<00:01:11.049> that's<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.799> big<00:01:11.979> deal<00:01:12.249> but<00:01:13.179> really<00:01:13.569> it

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.869 
back onto the roof back onto the
transmission<00:02:28.859> so<00:02:29.859> I<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.099> them<00:02:30.310> set<00:02:30.549> off<00:02:30.700> to

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
transmission so I have them set off to

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.129 
transmission so I have them set off to
the<00:02:30.909> side<00:02:31.000> separately<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.810> what<00:02:35.019> it

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
the side separately this is what it

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.929 
the side separately this is what it
looked<00:02:35.379> like<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:35.859> is<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.159> damage<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.519> was

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
looked like this is the damage that was

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.039 
looked like this is the damage that was
done<00:02:36.969> to<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.689> bottom<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:39.849> can<00:02:39.879> hear

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
done to the bottom you can hear

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.039 
done to the bottom you can hear
rattling<00:02:41.319> out<00:02:41.590> there's<00:02:42.400> my<00:02:42.609> pile<00:02:42.939> of<00:02:43.180> gears

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
rattling out there's my pile of gears

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.409 
rattling out there's my pile of gears
that<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.379> stuck<00:02:44.680> back<00:02:44.859> in<00:02:44.920> there<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.459> right

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:46.419 
that I stuck back in there and right

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.099 
that I stuck back in there and right
there

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
there

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.550 
there
cracked<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.799> there<00:02:49.049> hairline<00:02:50.049> crack<00:02:50.379> right

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
cracked it there hairline crack right

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.710 
cracked it there hairline crack right
there<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:53.760> cracked<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.909> up<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.209> busted<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.569> up

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
there and cracked it up and busted it up

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.330 
there and cracked it up and busted it up
right<00:02:55.900> there<00:02:56.139> too<00:02:57.090> so<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:01.290> if<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.560> seems<00:03:03.129> like<00:03:03.219> a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
right there too so if if it seems like a

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.309 
right there too so if if it seems like a
pain<00:03:03.669> the<00:03:03.909> but<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.510> same<00:03:04.719> tricks<00:03:05.079> and

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
pain the but the same tricks and

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.500 
pain the but the same tricks and
changing<00:03:05.739> out<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.310> these<00:03:06.579> gears<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.239> stick

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
changing out all these gears and stick

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.670

them<00:03:07.659> in<00:03:07.810> new<00:03:07.989> housing

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
them in new housing

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.720 
them in new housing
I'll<00:03:09.489> throw<00:03:10.359> together<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.750> video<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.730> anything

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
I'll throw together a video of anything

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.990 
I'll throw together a video of anything
that<00:03:12.849> might<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.359> pain<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:16.000> pretty<00:03:16.450> much

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that might be a pain but pretty much

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.180 
that might be a pain but pretty much

it really wasn't bad 30 minutes but of

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.110 
it really wasn't bad 30 minutes but of
course<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.159> already<00:03:51.370> had<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.639> channel<00:03:51.970> off

course I already had the channel off
trying<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.599> see<00:03:52.870> how<00:03:53.049> what<00:03:53.379> the<00:03:53.470> condition<00:03:53.859> of

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.009 
trying to see how what the condition of

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.839 
trying to see how what the condition of
the<00:03:55.259> transmission<00:03:56.259> was<00:03:56.379> in<00:03:56.560> anyways<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:57.729> I've

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
the transmission was in anyways and I've

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.610 
the transmission was in anyways and I've
gotten<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.299> down<00:03:58.509> to<00:03:58.689> a<00:03:58.750> science<00:03:59.019> because<00:03:59.590> I

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
gotten that down to a science because I

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.969 
gotten that down to a science because I
had<00:03:59.919> that<00:04:00.430> shifter<00:04:01.180> handle<00:04:01.359> problem<00:04:02.049> the

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
had that shifter handle problem the

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.939 
had that shifter handle problem the
shifter<00:04:03.400> hand<00:04:03.639> the<00:04:03.970> end<00:04:04.180> of<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:04.949> shifter

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
shifter hand the end of the shifter

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:13.420 
shifter hand the end of the shifter
handle<00:04:05.979> fits<00:04:06.579> down<00:04:06.790> into<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:09.069> yolks

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.159 

and<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:15.590> can<00:04:15.739> see<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:17.090> little<00:04:17.750> shifter

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
and you can see the little shifter

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.740 
and you can see the little shifter
handle<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:19.009> end<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.400> gets<00:04:19.940> too<00:04:20.239> small<00:04:20.540> and

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
handle the end of it gets too small and

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
handle the end of it gets too small and
it<00:04:20.810> gets<00:04:20.959> caught<00:04:21.199> back<00:04:21.440> behind<00:04:21.789> that<00:04:22.789> top<00:04:23.770> to

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
it gets caught back behind that top to

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.610 
it gets caught back behind that top to
the<00:04:24.919> left<00:04:27.400> like<00:04:28.400> whatever<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.270> call<00:04:29.479> them

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
the left like whatever you call them

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.550 
the left like whatever you call them
those<00:04:30.820> those<00:04:31.820> dogs<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.660> some<00:04:32.870> sort<00:04:33.259> they<00:04:33.410> look

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
those those dogs of some sort they look

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.070 
those those dogs of some sort they look
like<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.220> pitcher<00:04:34.490> here<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.960> gets

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
like a you and the pitcher here it gets

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.770 
like a you and the pitcher here it gets
caught<00:04:36.350> back<00:04:36.560> behind<00:04:36.740> there<00:04:37.130> did<00:04:37.699> they<00:04:38.479> wear

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
caught back behind there did they wear

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.300 
caught back behind there did they wear
out<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.169> they<00:04:39.229> come<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.590> point<00:04:39.860> from

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
out and they come to a point from

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.980 
out and they come to a point from
getting<00:04:40.699> from<00:04:41.000> getting<00:04:41.270> smashed<00:04:41.539> between

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
getting from getting smashed between

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.320 
getting from getting smashed between
them<00:04:42.169> all<00:04:42.259> the<00:04:42.410> time<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.729> slips<00:04:44.090> right

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
them all the time and it slips right

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.890 
them all the time and it slips right
back<00:04:44.509> behind<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:45.710> pretty<00:04:46.010> much<00:04:46.539> second<00:04:47.539> gear

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
back behind so pretty much second gear

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.710 
back behind so pretty much second gear
is<00:04:47.930> your<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.699> one<00:04:49.850> that's<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.240> real<00:04:50.389> bitch

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
is your is the one that's the real bitch

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.939 
is your is the one that's the real bitch
where<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.080> can<00:04:51.229> get<00:04:51.350> caught
