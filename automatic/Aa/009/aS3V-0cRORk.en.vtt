a<00:00:42.629> little<00:00:42.870> hard<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.500> spend<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
a little hard to spend like you can do a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.720 
a little hard to spend like you can do a
little<00:00:45.239> flicks<00:00:45.860> unlike<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.070> rubik's<00:00:47.460> cube

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
little flicks unlike my rubik's cube

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.080 
little flicks unlike my rubik's cube
which<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.850> lot<00:00:50.850> harder

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
which is just like that so a lot harder

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.569 
which is just like that so a lot harder
but<00:00:51.899> still<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:52.800> isn't<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> big<00:00:53.250> part<00:00:53.520> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
but still there isn't a big part of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
but still there isn't a big part of
solving<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:54.809> corners<00:00:55.289> so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
solving it it's just a little corners so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.150 
solving it it's just a little corners so

makes<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.850> could<00:01:29.970> rule<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
makes it work but you could rule it you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.310 
makes it work but you could rule it you
could<00:01:31.079> fold<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:32.939> spin<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:37.110> can

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
could fold it you could spin it we can

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.170 
could fold it you could spin it we can
break<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.650> which<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.250> wouldn't<00:01:38.460> recommend<00:01:38.640> i'd
