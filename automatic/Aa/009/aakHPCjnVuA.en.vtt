technology's<00:01:38.590> been<00:01:38.799> developed<00:01:39.460> as<00:01:39.939> a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
technology whose identities to talk love

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.910 
technology whose identities to talk love
it<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:45.820> operates<00:01:46.210> like<00:01:46.450> an<00:01:46.630> LCD<00:01:46.960> but<00:01:47.740> its

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
it and it operates like an LCD but its

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.240 
it and it operates like an LCD but its
next<00:01:48.700> times<00:01:48.939> more<00:01:49.270> efficient<00:01:49.780> than<00:01:49.899> n<00:01:50.259> LG<00:01:50.590> so

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
next times more efficient than n LG so

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.010 
next times more efficient than n LG so
it's<00:01:51.549> it's<00:01:51.939> when<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.600> when<00:01:52.780> there's<00:01:52.960> a

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
it's it's when it when there's a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.020 
it's it's when it when there's a
backlight<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.590> basically<00:01:53.950> like<00:01:53.979> an<00:01:54.220> LCD<00:01:54.520> yes

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
backlight is basically like an LCD yes

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.109 
backlight is basically like an LCD yes
exactly<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.979> there's<00:01:57.189> no<00:01:57.310> backlight<00:01:57.759> sit

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
exactly when there's no backlight sit

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.300 
exactly when there's no backlight sit
perform<00:01:58.570> performs<00:01:59.350> just<00:01:59.530> like<00:01:59.860> color<00:02:00.100> would

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
perform performs just like color would

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.550 
perform performs just like color would
just<00:02:00.880> like<00:02:01.030> magazine<00:02:01.570> color<00:02:01.899> would<00:02:02.110> it's<00:02:02.350> a

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
just like magazine color would it's a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.120 
just like magazine color would it's a
stacking<00:02:03.250> colors<00:02:03.549> on<00:02:03.670> top<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:04.000> each<00:02:04.450> other<00:02:04.600> so

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
stacking colors on top of each other so

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.139 
stacking colors on top of each other so
this<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.280> going<00:02:06.429> to<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:06.579> on<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:06.850> back<00:02:06.970> end

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
this is going to be on the back end

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.880 
this is going to be on the back end
we're<00:02:07.899> going<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.289> have<00:02:08.380> this<00:02:08.560> on<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.860> market

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
we're going to have this on the market

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.039 
we're going to have this on the market
by<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.489> end<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.880> this<00:02:09.970> year<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.479> first<00:02:10.780> kind<00:02:11.019> of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
by the end of this year so first kind of

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.750 
by the end of this year so first kind of

basically<00:04:44.810> LCD<00:04:45.289> technology<00:04:45.500> so<00:04:46.160> it<00:04:46.280> still

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
basically LCD technology so it still

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.629 
basically LCD technology so it still
uses<00:04:46.840> polarized<00:04:47.840> light<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.650> create<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.979> shutter

we<00:04:50.419> don't<00:04:50.660> we<00:04:50.840> don't<00:04:51.050> require<00:04:51.410> polarizers<00:04:52.010> so

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
we don't we don't require polarizers so

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.060

along<00:05:24.680> is<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.699> develop<00:05:25.940> a<00:05:26.150> manufacturing

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
along is to develop a manufacturing

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.920 
along is to develop a manufacturing

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
of an LCD manufacturing process there's

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.750 
of an LCD manufacturing process there's
only<00:05:32.630> one<00:05:32.960> different<00:05:33.470> process<00:05:34.160> in<00:05:34.639> a

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
only one different process in a

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.310 
only one different process in a
manufacturing<00:05:34.970> process<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:35.960> that's<00:05:36.110> where

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
manufacturing process and that's where

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.810 
manufacturing process and that's where
we<00:05:36.440> put<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:36.710> liquids<00:05:37.099> into<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.460> display

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
we put the liquids into the display

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.610 
we put the liquids into the display
that's<00:05:38.419> because<00:05:38.750> they're<00:05:38.930> different<00:05:39.050> liquids

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
that's because they're different liquids

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.400 
that's because they're different liquids
air<00:05:40.099> liquid<00:05:40.580> crystals<00:05:41.030> one<00:05:41.240> type<00:05:41.780> of<00:05:41.810> material

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
air liquid crystals one type of material

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.790 
air liquid crystals one type of material
we<00:05:42.800> use<00:05:42.830> oil<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:44.120> water<00:05:44.330> like<00:05:44.599> materials<00:05:45.229> so

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
we use oil and water like materials so

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.320 
we use oil and water like materials so
requires<00:05:46.280> a<00:05:46.460> diff<00:05:46.610> different<00:05:47.060> piece<00:05:47.180> of

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
requires a diff different piece of

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.939 
requires a diff different piece of
equipment<00:05:47.750> otherwise<00:05:48.020> it's<00:05:48.380> exactly<00:05:48.770> the

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
equipment otherwise it's exactly the

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.790 
equipment otherwise it's exactly the
same<00:05:49.099> and<00:05:49.520> that's<00:05:49.699> part<00:05:49.940> of<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.210> minified

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
same and that's part of the minified

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.369 
same and that's part of the minified
is<00:05:51.240> that<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.360> behind<00:05:52.509> to<00:05:52.810> get<00:05:52.930> that<00:05:53.080> changed

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379 
is that you behind to get that changed

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.409 
is that you behind to get that changed
or<00:05:53.590> how<00:05:53.680> do<00:05:53.740> you<00:05:53.860> plan<00:05:54.039> to<00:05:54.099> it<00:05:54.550> so<00:05:54.729> H<00:05:54.909> it's<00:05:55.240> a

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
or how do you plan to it so H it's a

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.879 
or how do you plan to it so H it's a
single<00:05:55.750> piece<00:05:55.900> of<00:05:55.930> equipment<00:05:56.500> and<00:05:56.710> it's<00:05:56.800> a

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
single piece of equipment and it's a

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.309 
single piece of equipment and it's a
very<00:05:56.919> very<00:05:57.370> low<00:05:57.610> cost<00:05:57.789> piece<00:05:58.090> of<00:05:58.240> equipment<00:05:58.690> so

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
very very low cost piece of equipment so

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.800 
very very low cost piece of equipment so
being<00:05:59.770> able<00:05:59.889> to<00:06:00.099> supply<00:06:00.340> that<00:06:00.460> 22<00:06:01.090> LCD<00:06:01.240> fab

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
being able to supply that 22 LCD fab

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.879 
being able to supply that 22 LCD fab
that's<00:06:02.080> something<00:06:02.409> that<00:06:02.440> we're<00:06:02.680> already

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
that's something that we're already

ebook interface team in man and you

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.270 
ebook interface team in man and you
didn't<00:06:17.409> measure<00:06:17.500> resin<00:06:17.979> all<00:06:18.099> these

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
didn't measure resin all these

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.580 
didn't measure resin all these

yeah<00:06:21.009> this<00:06:21.580> doesn't<00:06:21.789> have<00:06:21.970> a<00:06:22.000> touch<00:06:22.210> panel<00:06:22.479> on

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
yeah this doesn't have a touch panel on

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.619 
yeah this doesn't have a touch panel on
in<00:06:22.810> any<00:06:22.960> moment<00:06:23.199> the<00:06:23.919> idea<00:06:24.729> is<00:06:24.789> to<00:06:24.940> take<00:06:25.120> all<00:06:25.569> of

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:25.629 
in any moment the idea is to take all of
