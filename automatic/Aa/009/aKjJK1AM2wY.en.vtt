00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
so this is the electric acoustic deluxe

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.490 
so this is the electric acoustic deluxe
but<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.470> plugged<00:03:23.010> into<00:03:23.340> my<00:03:24.030> iPad<00:03:24.380> using<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
but I plugged into my iPad using the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.240 
but I plugged into my iPad using the
iRig<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.520> put<00:03:27.150> Jack<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.470> can<00:03:28.770> compose

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
iRig and put Jack so that I can compose

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.550 
iRig and put Jack so that I can compose
and<00:03:29.700> write<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.240> be<00:03:30.270> really<00:03:30.570> creative<00:03:30.900> with<00:03:31.260> my

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
and write and be really creative with my

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.680 
and write and be really creative with my
violin<00:03:32.100> because<00:03:32.760> not<00:03:33.000> only<00:03:33.030> could<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.390> use<00:03:33.540> it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
violin because not only could I use it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.050 
violin because not only could I use it
as<00:03:33.870> an<00:03:33.960> acoustic<00:03:34.200> experience<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:35.340> also<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.760> can

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
as an acoustic experience but also I can

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.450 
as an acoustic experience but also I can
plug<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.380> sequence<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.220> put

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
plug it in so the sequence that I put

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.120 
plug it in so the sequence that I put
together<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:39.300> an<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.630> minor<00:03:39.900> figure<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.680> then

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
together is an a minor figure and then

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.850 
together is an a minor figure and then
it<00:03:41.220> goes<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.400> an<00:03:41.700> F<00:03:41.910> chord<00:03:41.940> over<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.230> then<00:03:43.680> we

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
it goes to an F chord over a and then we

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.610 
it goes to an F chord over a and then we
have<00:03:44.010> an<00:03:44.100> E<00:03:44.310> major<00:03:44.550> turnaround<00:03:45.180> with<00:03:46.020> an<00:03:46.140> A<00:03:46.350> in

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
have an E major turnaround with an A in

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.460 
have an E major turnaround with an A in
the<00:03:46.710> bass<00:03:46.920> also<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.850> will<00:03:48.210> give<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.660> more<00:03:49.290> or

right now I just want to show you a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.870 
right now I just want to show you a
quick<00:03:52.940> tutorial<00:03:53.940> on<00:03:54.600> how<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:55.020> record<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.280> Wood

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
quick tutorial on how to record the Wood

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.680 
quick tutorial on how to record the Wood
electric<00:03:57.720> acoustic<00:03:57.959> deluxe<00:03:58.500> onto<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.430> iPad

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
electric acoustic deluxe onto the iPad

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.150 
electric acoustic deluxe onto the iPad
so<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.810> tempo<00:04:01.230> we're<00:04:01.320> going<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.560> count<00:04:01.890> if<00:04:02.040> we

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
so the tempo we're going to count if we

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:28.300 
so the tempo we're going to count if we
get<00:04:02.370> going<00:04:02.670> right<00:04:02.850> here<00:04:03.150> here<00:04:03.450> we<00:04:03.570> go

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.520 

so<00:04:28.940> that's<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.540> sequence<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.230> then<00:04:30.290> we<00:04:30.410> go

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
so that's the sequence and then we go

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.830 
so that's the sequence and then we go
back<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.950> beginning<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.639> can<00:04:31.790> see<00:04:32.120> the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
back the beginning and you can see the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.320 
back the beginning and you can see the
waveform<00:04:33.170> that<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.770> just<00:04:34.100> did<00:04:34.310> right<00:04:34.580> here<00:04:35.150> and

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
waveform that I just did right here and

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:53.520 
waveform that I just did right here and
then<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:35.930> press<00:04:36.230> play

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.550 

thank<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:54.650> for<00:04:54.830> listening<00:04:54.980> and<00:04:55.430> watching
