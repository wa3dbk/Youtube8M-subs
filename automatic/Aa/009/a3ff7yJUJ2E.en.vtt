00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.330
 learn to make this fantastic plane 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.680
 of paper at the end of the video I show how 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.769
 flies the truth is that it's pretty good 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.660
 all we need is a sheet 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.179
 rectangular paper the typical sheet 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.930
 rectangular dina4 that we all have nothing 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.630
 more then said that we started here I have 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
 this fantastic rectangular sheet color 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.010
 fire red the first thing we do is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.039
 divide in half over here along 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.050
 well let's do it do not say I'm going to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 do it well because you already know that in 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.079
 planes 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.660
 symmetry is very important, not because 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.100
 if it does not start flying then in circles and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.230
 these things so we're going to try 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.780
 do it very carefully we unfold 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.250
 and now we have this line here 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.910
 it seems very good we are going to carry this 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.620
 little eyelash to the center 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.160
 A) Yes 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.350
 effect and we do the same thing here at 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.620
 center is also a simple design that 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.030
 this plane is done in a couple of minutes 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.520
 well perfect very well now we have this 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.070
 line that remains here defined then 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.490
 we are going to bend over there very carefully 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.200
 it's worth just for this line we're going to 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.060
 try to do it very well right where 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 finish the paper where the paper ends 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.130
 sorry that it is no longer talk we go down 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.350
 that there is just in the perfect middle line 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.690
 we are dividing and dividing you see here 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 it was perfect and here it was perfect 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.400
 also how it has to be this is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.160
 of course we turn the paper around because 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 I'm tired of doubling here and now 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.420
 I bring all this to the center line 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.390
 again 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.370
 so very well and we came to this also 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.480
 to the center line 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.030
 so a perfect one and we give it back 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.479
 back because I do not say 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.000
 we have here this role dancing so what 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.860
 we are here with the compaÃ±era no 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.790
 We put the corner pieces together very well 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.780
 we put a little bit the zoom because we're going 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.780
 to work in this area 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.110
 what are we going to do then let's go down 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.940
 this tip here we upload it and now the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.720
 we go down but well nothing happens we do 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.930
 well it's very good 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.740
 and now we are going to double from here 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.400
 up here a line that links these two 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.160
 points I do it and we see it still the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.819
 division starts here at this point and 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.249
 come up to this one here it would be worth something 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.970
 let's do it well something like that more or 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:44.900
 no less 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.600
 You see it starts right here and ends here 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.250
 this is the master division and we do what 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 same for the other part I'm going to leave 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.700
 the paper here a little bit so I 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.710
 be more comfortable we start to bend 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.510
 here and we got right up to this point 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.240
 ok we do it carefully we do not have 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.650
 no hurry let's see I do not have yo 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.450
 here I do it a little fast but 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.300
 let's do things right then 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.520
 you do not fly, you see how good it is for the 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.250
 perfect because we are already we are 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.130
 ending we have this because we are going to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.200
 divide here we make a sandwich 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.880
 so perfect this is hidden worth 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.490
 locked in the structure that is not 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.170
 unfold very well and now here 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.330
 well, good 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.190
 we can try different things it's worth 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.810
 you know with the rooms we can do 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.030
 different things I'm going to fold more or 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.880
 except here I'm sorry here, I'm not under 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.850
 is 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.940
 ok we do it we do it straight 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.650
 it's worth without any angle I say we have 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.420
 freedom is worth we can make them more 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.010
 big smaller I like it 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.540
 make them so much better you see 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.200
 I have left an approximate distance 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.120
 this is not accurate 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.290
 we turn it around and do the same thing 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.599
 what is important is that both are 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.760
 the same is true so that circles do not fly 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.980
 so we take the reference of the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.299
 the other of the companion 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.370
 let's do it this well and now the 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.040
 last the last detail not also 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.450
 we talk again here and as before 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.400
 we can make it bigger smaller 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.810
 we can do it with a certain angle is 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.610
 question of proving worth I do so 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.650
 because I like it, I just raise a 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.959
 little bit like that 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.519
 ok and I do the same for the other part or 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.270
 be that I turn it around to take the 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.030
 reference we do like this and we have this 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.280
 it's perfect now we have our 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.490
 finished plane we give you a little bit of 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.979
 so not just because it is so of 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.780
 come to the world and it's a little bent not 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.960
 we give it a little bit of shape we do like this 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.020
 well you know and nothing would be 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:51.850
 finished let's see how it flies 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:51.850
 [Music] 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.650
 yes 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.319
 [Music] 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:15.410
 [Music] 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.330
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.040
 I have flown the plane well and how 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.040
 we always see each other
