00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.370
 good morning that we are with all the information of the tropic and 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.170
 we currently have two tropical storms hosteria fair continues its 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.570
 travel north further away from the entire arch of the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.520
 Lesser Antilles 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.840
 and we also have to continue to define 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.570
 which continues moving towards the northwest west very very slowly and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.260
 you are if later we will be united and the ministry is not very close 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.199
 since he would stay watching 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.599
 practically the same position that the state does during the last 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:29.119
 days 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.410
 and stuck between two systems of high pressures so a lot 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.199
 caution for now there's nothing to worry about a portion of the 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.960
 arch of the lesser Antilles, much less on the entire east coast of the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.690
 American nation the conditions will remain fairly stable towards the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.420
 portion of the arch of the lesser Antilles since we noticed that fair 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.280
 It will continue its journey to the north and by how it follows 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.399
 felip continues moving towards the northwest west at a rate of 13 miles 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.510
 hour meanwhile in all the south of florida some showers and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.719
 drizzle very very dispersed in the early hours of the morning these give that they have 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.790
 stopped and temperatures remain the high range of the seven integrated to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 situations of the interior to the low range of the 80s and degrees a little more towards the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.040
 coastal portion meanwhile there is a band plant which remains just 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.920
 towards our north and we notice the temperature change being temperatures in the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.050
 range of the 60 degrees so to the whole lot of the workshop and hopefully I too 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.619
 in temperatures in the low range of the seventies and the southeast of the nation and 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.450
 we continue with these temperatures in high range of which 70 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.250
 early in the morning but everything will be changing the fear of feeling the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.899
 late 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.460
 for now about it continued to dominate we are not for that yes 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.290
 the sea breeze would be causing some very very scattered showers such 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.880
 as we were yesterday, like portions of the interior, but yes 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.729
 also that they were facing clean about six of our time will be 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.880
 increasing more instability in the atmosphere and of course it will be 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.409
 bringing these showers a little more pronounced already for this one per month and 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.820
 also for Saturday mostly the maritime traffic to the wind will be 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 be east-northeast reason 6 to 9 knots 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.679
 the sea up to 12 feet 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.250
 the varied this afternoon 89 degrees 32 degrees Celsius the wind will 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.520
 will keep following this ratio of five 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.039
 at ten miles per hour and it is possible if there is 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.609
 the areas very well are not heard from a little more towards the interior of the state 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.279
 bring your umbrella soda spokespersons of that range moby very lakes 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.829
 at six entities ten in the morning 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.559
 the ladies the conditions in the transit 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.489
 and on there are 75 in both directions everything flows normally that we do see a little 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.619
 more than car and movement since many people go to their 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.450
 jobs or universities 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.339
 the rest of canada now all of them without setbacks in the tandem emits 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:47.119
 the express roads or express ones on which 95 heading north by the height of 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.879
 the street 119 northwest are blocked by an accident that if also brought 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.290
 injured and another accident also power and 2 are the don chila expressed and the street 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:59.199
 72 the southwest by establishing some roads so many precautions 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:04.779
 when driving since cc oo a very happy Thursday and I send 2 that you feel andes
