00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
did was install windows on parallels 7

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.760 
did was install windows on parallels 7
which<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.840> virtual<00:01:22.020> machine<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.619> then

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
which is a virtual machine and then

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.340 
which is a virtual machine and then
still<00:01:23.400> deal<00:01:23.580> worse<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.939> top<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.350> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
still deal worse on top of that the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.240 
still deal worse on top of that the
gameplay<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.950> ok<00:01:26.600> was<00:01:27.600> about<00:01:27.780> 15<00:01:28.229> frames<00:01:29.040> per

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
gameplay was ok was about 15 frames per

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.719 
gameplay was ok was about 15 frames per
second<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.790> most<00:01:30.979> usually<00:01:31.979> around<00:01:32.070> 12<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.460> 15

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
second and most usually around 12 to 15

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
second and most usually around 12 to 15
frames<00:01:32.880> per<00:01:32.970> second<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.659> bit<00:01:33.869> choppy<00:01:34.140> but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
frames per second it was bit choppy but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
frames per second it was bit choppy but
it's<00:01:35.130> still<00:01:35.310> playable<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.240> ideal<00:01:36.390> it's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it's still playable it's not ideal it's

I saw Windows via bootcamp with that the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.690 
I saw Windows via bootcamp with that the
framerate<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.320> excellent<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.100> got<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.430> 30

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
framerate was excellent I got about 30

what<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.770> problem<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.430> took<00:01:50.700> up

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
what the problem with that was I took up

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.420 
what the problem with that was I took up
a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> harder<00:01:51.570> space<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.470> had<00:01:53.399> a

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.250 
there's one inherent problem this is the
heat<00:04:22.729> it's<00:04:23.729> blistering<00:04:24.180> heat<00:04:24.630> come<00:04:25.110> from

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
heat it's blistering heat come from

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.050 
heat it's blistering heat come from
under<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.680> keyboard

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
under the keyboard

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.720 
under the keyboard
it's<00:04:27.830> sometimes<00:04:28.830> it's<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.310> point<00:04:29.460> where<00:04:29.610> I

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
it's sometimes it's to the point where I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.160 
it's sometimes it's to the point where I
can't<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.210> need<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.450> know<00:04:30.570> what<00:04:30.660> my<00:04:30.750> hands<00:04:30.990> where

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
can't I need to know what my hands where

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.120 
can't I need to know what my hands where
I'll<00:04:31.260> get<00:04:31.770> burned

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
I'll get burned

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.460 
I'll get burned
that's<00:04:32.340> how<00:04:32.430> hot<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.760> gets<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.290> that

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
that's how hot it gets and so that

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.830 
that's how hot it gets and so that
that's<00:04:34.650> why<00:04:35.000> whenever<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.120> play<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.420> game<00:04:36.630> now

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
that's why whenever I play this game now

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.780 
that's why whenever I play this game now
I<00:04:37.140> said<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> best<00:04:37.920> performance<00:04:38.490> which<00:04:38.670> is

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
I said to the best performance which is

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.570 
I said to the best performance which is
said<00:04:38.970> everything<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.570> lowest<00:04:39.900> possible

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
said everything to the lowest possible

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.780 
said everything to the lowest possible
resolution<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.930> frame<00:04:43.200> rate<00:04:43.230> it<00:04:44.220> says<00:04:44.490> 30

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
resolution and the frame rate it says 30

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.650 
resolution and the frame rate it says 30
and<00:04:45.180> believe<00:04:46.080> me<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.440> not<00:04:47.070> 30<00:04:47.460> still<00:04:48.360> choppy

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
and believe me is not 30 still choppy

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.110 
and believe me is not 30 still choppy
look<00:04:49.230> at<00:04:49.320> that

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
look at that

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.900 
look at that
it's<00:04:51.740> it's<00:04:52.740> better<00:04:53.040> than<00:04:53.280> play<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.760> the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
it's it's better than play on the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.990 
it's it's better than play on the
parallels<00:04:54.450> you<00:04:55.380> know<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:55.530> still<00:04:55.830> stuck<00:04:56.520> still

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
parallels you know I still stuck still

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.970 
parallels you know I still stuck still
better<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.450> play<00:04:57.570> on<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.900> worst<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:58.920> the

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
better and play on the worst of the

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.650 
better and play on the worst of the
virtual<00:04:59.310> machine<00:04:59.580> install<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:01.640> it's<00:05:02.660> nothing

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
virtual machine install and it's nothing

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.000 
virtual machine install and it's nothing
compared<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.140> what<00:05:04.230> it<00:05:04.410> was<00:05:04.560> when<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.830> was

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
compared to what it was when I was

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.470 
compared to what it was when I was
playing<00:05:05.190> on<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.400> Windows<00:05:05.820> that<00:05:06.360> was

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
playing on the Windows that was

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.230 
playing on the Windows that was
installed<00:05:06.720> via<00:05:06.930> boot<00:05:07.320> camp<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:08.340> this<00:05:09.090> is

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
installed via boot camp so this is

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.920 
installed via boot camp so this is
tolerable<00:05:09.720> this<00:05:10.290> is<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.920> beta<00:05:11.190> as<00:05:11.940> said<00:05:12.750> right

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
tolerable this is the beta as said right

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.130 
tolerable this is the beta as said right
here<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.260> Mac<00:05:13.500> beta<00:05:13.800> client

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
here the Mac beta client

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.470 
here the Mac beta client
well<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:17.370> moment<00:05:17.700> the<00:05:17.790> Back<00:05:17.940> Bay<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.150> came<00:05:18.360> out

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
well the moment the Back Bay I came out

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.810 
well the moment the Back Bay I came out
I<00:05:18.690> quickly<00:05:19.169> believe<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.770> windows<00:05:20.280> partitions

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
I quickly believe the windows partitions

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.010 
I quickly believe the windows partitions
so<00:05:20.910> I<00:05:21.120> can<00:05:21.300> free<00:05:21.540> up<00:05:21.660> another<00:05:21.870> 60<00:05:22.500> gigs<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:24.020> you

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
so I can free up another 60 gigs and you

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.390 
so I can free up another 60 gigs and you
know<00:05:25.110> what<00:05:25.290> I<00:05:25.470> will<00:05:25.680> even<00:05:25.860> put<00:05:25.890> up<00:05:26.130> with<00:05:26.250> this

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
know what I will even put up with this
