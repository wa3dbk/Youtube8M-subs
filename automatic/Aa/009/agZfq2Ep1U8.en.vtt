 hi and welcome to this new video 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.020
 today 's channel on this kidsday 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 I am a guest I am Denise 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.369
 on the internet especially instagram and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.289
 youtube bit known as groin and end 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.150
 I like to give you a video this today 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.970
 channel show two weeks ago 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.830
 my channel made a video about one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.170
 very special piece of my hair 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.910
 namely this 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.489
 you see i made the blood you can 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.730
 I do with more curled but how can you 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.410
 now this is the best part 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.140
 do justice to my right there I have 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.809
 today a recovery and it is not 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.000
 prevents me from making a video every week 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.600
 wave and I have a whole for you too 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.520
 small advice videos yes the end so me 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.170
 say get started 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.329
 you need a little rubber band for that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.670
 the braid and a somewhat larger elastic 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.280
 we will see how to make later for the bun 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.629
 you work with this recovery upside down 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.640
 if you have thrown your hair forward 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.869
 take a pick with you to join the braid 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.400
 to start 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.010
 every time you braid further but 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.840
 Grab a new piece of hair and stuff 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 or lay your hair further 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.950
 I work under along which the only 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.780
 a little more rise body so he falls 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 better with the end result 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.049
 it may seem awkward upside down 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.640
 in braids 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.430
 but if you can do it in the normal way 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.080
 you will probably succeed if the place is up to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.299
 you make about the top of your head 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.860
 fasten it with a rubber band 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.600
 then you pull this whole 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.820
 Carefully a little bit apart 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.799
 because forests rt and then you grab the rest 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.890
 from your hair to finish the bun completely 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.270
 to make 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.220
 I make most sanne button through my hair 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.340
 turn around and then on 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.340
 roll 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.480
 I am now pulling apart a little and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.260
 ready to go to the matching 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.260
 outfit 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.160
 thank you so much for watching 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.320
 this video 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.640
 if you see more behind, take a look 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.470
 in the description below 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.450
 there is a link to my channel me 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.970
 especially make videos about to leave 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.570
 I travel often and my name is next to it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.330
 channel 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.580
 packed with the latest music in the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.950
 deuce in music lab so hopefully till 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.440
 anyway until the next video 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.540
 by fan bye I 'm probably not the only one 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.700
 which is always a smartphone used to 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.080
 take pictures and it is natural 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.770
 very handy that you just have one 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.770
