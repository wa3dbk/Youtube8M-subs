little<00:00:06.629> trouble<00:00:07.049> classifier<00:00:08.690> just<00:00:09.690> made<00:00:09.840> a

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
little trouble classifier just made a

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.320 
little trouble classifier just made a
PVC<00:00:10.590> frame<00:00:12.080> the<00:00:13.080> tub<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:15.150> old

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
PVC frame the tub here is just an old

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.840 
PVC frame the tub here is just an old
loom<00:00:15.839> stockpot<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.070> picked<00:00:17.340> up<00:00:17.550> or

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
loom stockpot that I picked up or

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.300 
loom stockpot that I picked up or
nothing<00:00:18.920> and<00:00:20.029> sister<00:00:21.029> 12-volt<00:00:21.600> drives<00:00:21.960> us<00:00:22.310> I'm

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
nothing and sister 12-volt drives us I'm

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
nothing and sister 12-volt drives us I'm
using<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:24.060> windshield<00:00:24.480> washer<00:00:25.050> or<00:00:25.410> windshield

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
using a windshield washer or windshield

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.650 
using a windshield washer or windshield
wiper<00:00:26.130> motor<00:00:28.970> I'm<00:00:29.970> using<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:30.449> little

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
wiper motor I'm using these little

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
wiper motor I'm using these little
batteries<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> moment<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.040> run<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.910> thing

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
batteries at the moment I run this thing

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.020 
batteries at the moment I run this thing
for<00:00:33.300> about<00:00:33.480> 45<00:00:34.140> minutes<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.680> an<00:00:35.130> hour<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.790> these

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
for about 45 minutes to an hour on these

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.910 
for about 45 minutes to an hour on these
little<00:00:36.239> batteries<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:39.379> as<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.649> it's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
little batteries so as you can see it's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.049 
little batteries so as you can see it's
a<00:00:41.040> little<00:00:41.340> different<00:00:41.670> than<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> traditional

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
a little different than a traditional

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.560 
a little different than a traditional
chromo<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.110> actually<00:00:43.710> got<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> back<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.570> so

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
chromo is actually got a back on it so

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
chromo is actually got a back on it so
the<00:00:45.780> material<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.460> end<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the material is not going in one end and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.799 
the material is not going in one end and
coming<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> other<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:50.600> put<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> little

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
coming out the other I put a little

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.130 
coming out the other I put a little
auger<00:00:52.199> system<00:00:52.649> inside<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> come<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:08.779 

throw<00:00:58.489> material<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.640> it

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.109 

straight<00:01:09.450> wires<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:10.109> there<00:01:10.350> yet<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.969> will

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
straight wires on there yet and it will

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.169 
straight wires on there yet and it will
just<00:01:12.299> wash<00:01:12.569> the<00:01:13.369> flawless<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.640> through<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
just wash the flawless up through the

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.999 
just wash the flawless up through the
screen<00:01:17.090> was<00:01:18.090> about<00:01:18.299> 1800<00:01:19.079> holes<00:01:19.289> I<00:01:19.530> drilled<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
screen was about 1800 holes I drilled in

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.480 
screen was about 1800 holes I drilled in
that<00:01:20.159> pot<00:01:21.149> so<00:01:21.569> cuz<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.439> allowed<00:01:22.679> to<00:01:22.709> do<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.219> I

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that pot so cuz we allowed to do that I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.130 
that pot so cuz we allowed to do that I
haven't<00:01:23.759> left<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.969> spray<00:01:24.240> bar<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.689> right<00:01:24.959> now

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
haven't left a spray bar on right now

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
haven't left a spray bar on right now
it's<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.099> a<00:01:26.399> lot<00:01:26.880> easier<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.329> work<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's just a lot easier to work on it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.199 
it's just a lot easier to work on it
without<00:01:28.049> spray<00:01:28.469> bar<00:01:28.709> on<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:31.219> it's<00:01:32.219> a<00:01:32.459> good

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
without spray bar on it but it's a good

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.779 
without spray bar on it but it's a good
work<00:01:33.420> doc<00:01:33.719> too<00:01:33.899> bad<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.439> light<00:01:34.740> only<00:01:35.459> weighs

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
work doc too bad it's light only weighs

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.330 
work doc too bad it's light only weighs
about<00:01:35.819> 15<00:01:36.539> pounds<00:01:37.039> so<00:01:38.039> I<00:01:38.099> can<00:01:38.369> run<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.009> tub

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
about 15 pounds so I can run it in a tub

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.429 
about 15 pounds so I can run it in a tub
or<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.239> pick<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> put<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.289> in

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
or I can just pick it up and put it in

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.459 
or I can just pick it up and put it in
the<00:01:43.649> hopper<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.849> highbanker<00:01:45.539> you<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
the hopper of a highbanker you want a

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.819 
the hopper of a highbanker you want a
dry<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:46.829> wet<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:48.079> it<00:01:49.079> should<00:01:49.319> be<00:01:49.349> interesting

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
dry or wet so it should be interesting

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.830 
dry or wet so it should be interesting
want<00:01:50.219> to<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.429> it<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.700> done<00:01:50.969> I<00:01:53.299> can<00:01:54.299> vary<00:01:54.569> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
want to get it all done I can vary the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.369 
want to get it all done I can vary the
speed<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> bit<00:01:55.679> a<00:01:55.739> little<00:01:56.780> variable<00:01:57.780> resistor

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:58.379 
speed a bit a little variable resistor

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:04.009 
speed a bit a little variable resistor
on<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.709> power<00:01:58.920> supply<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:03.019> step

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:04.019 
on the power supply so that I can step

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:14.020 
on the power supply so that I can step
along<00:02:05.090> with<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:08.720> feed<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:11.180> tub<00:02:12.180> turn

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
along with you know feed the tub turn

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.410 
along with you know feed the tub turn
and<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.620> don't<00:02:15.740> need<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.100> very<00:02:16.400> long<00:02:16.730> table<00:02:17.150> I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
and so I don't need a very long table I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.930 
and so I don't need a very long table I
can<00:02:17.630> slow<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.840> down<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.380> like<00:02:18.560> one<00:02:19.370> hour<00:02:19.550> p.m.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
can slow it down to like one hour p.m.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.070 
can slow it down to like one hour p.m.
per<00:02:20.209> minute<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.780> want<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:22.540> speed<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.569> up<00:02:23.840> to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
per minute if I want to speed it up to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.980 
per minute if I want to speed it up to
about<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.350> hundred<00:02:24.440> rpm<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.730> I've<00:02:26.540> got<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.720> quite

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
about a hundred rpm so I've got a quite

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.540 
about a hundred rpm so I've got a quite
a<00:02:27.020> bit<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.350> variation<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:28.130> there

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
a bit of variation in there

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.860 
a bit of variation in there
and<00:02:30.220> hoping<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.520> done<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.270> next<00:02:32.569> couple

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
and hoping get it done the next couple

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.100 
and hoping get it done the next couple
of<00:02:32.930> days<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.500> can<00:02:33.680> set<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.520> up<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.940> run<00:02:35.900> some

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
of days I can set it up and run some

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.580 
of days I can set it up and run some
water<00:02:36.140> through<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:38.050> it'll<00:02:39.050> be<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.170> month<00:02:39.440> or

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
water through it and it'll be a month or

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.140 
water through it and it'll be a month or
so<00:02:39.770> before<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.130> can<00:02:40.220> get<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.459> down<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.910> river

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
so before I can get it down to the river
