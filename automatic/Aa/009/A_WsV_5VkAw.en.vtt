I'm<00:00:33.019> having<00:00:33.409> the<00:00:33.530> chance<00:00:33.769> to<00:00:33.949> be<00:00:34.280> always

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
like every Sun that can meet have a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.389 
like every Sun that can meet have a
relationship<00:00:39.199> with<00:00:39.589> her<00:00:39.710> dad<00:00:39.920> that<00:00:39.949> close

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
that you're always together with him

00:00:41.809 --> 00:01:01.040 
that you're always together with him
he's<00:00:42.019> gay<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.719> yeah<00:00:44.719> I<00:00:44.750> mean<00:00:45.039> it's<00:00:46.039> amazing

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.930 

it's<00:01:01.590> gotten<00:01:02.010> they<00:01:02.130> have<00:01:02.340> their<00:01:02.550> own<00:01:02.580> style

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
it's gotten they have their own style

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.600 
it's gotten they have their own style
and<00:01:03.600> there's<00:01:04.110> no<00:01:04.620> other<00:01:04.830> place<00:01:05.160> in<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.400> world

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I think that has the same style of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.660 
I think that has the same style of the
parts<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.190> Brazil<00:01:08.990> but<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.710> sure<00:01:10.890> us<00:01:11.370> parts

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
parts in Brazil but for sure us parts

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:23.260 
parts in Brazil but for sure us parts
are<00:01:11.790> way<00:01:11.910> better
