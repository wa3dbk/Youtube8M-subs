wire<00:00:04.710> harness<00:00:05.160> just<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.910> little<00:00:06.270> explanation

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
wire harness just a little explanation

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.900 
wire harness just a little explanation
for<00:00:07.140> guys<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.589> install<00:00:07.710> them<00:00:08.069> it's<00:00:08.670> very

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
for guys to install them it's very

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.330 
for guys to install them it's very
simple<00:00:09.300> very<00:00:10.080> similar<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.650> installing<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
simple very similar to installing the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.610 
simple very similar to installing the
regular<00:00:11.670> harness<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.269> retros

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
regular harness for the retros

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.680 
regular harness for the retros
except<00:00:14.460> you're<00:00:14.580> not<00:00:14.639> installing<00:00:15.089> ballasts

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
except you're not installing ballasts

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.170 
except you're not installing ballasts
ballast<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> 2013<00:00:17.640> headlights<00:00:18.029> are

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
ballast on the 2013 headlights are

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.630 
ballast on the 2013 headlights are
mounted<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> headlight<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.650> basically

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
mounted on the headlight so basically

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.370 
mounted on the headlight so basically
you're<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.390> plugging<00:00:21.630> into<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> back<00:00:22.230> of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
you're just plugging into the back of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.950 
you're just plugging into the back of
the<00:00:22.439> headlight<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:23.760> run<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> power<00:00:24.210> there's<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the headlight you run a power there's a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.910 
the headlight you run a power there's a
ground<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.560> an<00:00:26.400> input<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.230> in<00:00:28.230> my<00:00:28.439> other<00:00:28.590> video

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
ground and an input so in my other video

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.620 
ground and an input so in my other video
it's<00:00:29.519> about<00:00:29.609> 10<00:00:29.820> degrees<00:00:29.910> outside<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.449> now

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it's about 10 degrees outside right now

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
it's about 10 degrees outside right now
so<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.080> not<00:00:31.199> gonna<00:00:31.380> show<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.099> where<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> mount

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
so I'm not gonna show you where I mount

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.049 
so I'm not gonna show you where I mount
everything<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.809> other<00:00:33.960> video<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.350> have

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
everything but in the other video I have

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.420

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
halogen headlights I mean the 2030s are

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.899 
halogen headlights I mean the 2030s are
still<00:01:02.789> coming<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.090> them<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:05.430> basically

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
still coming with them so and basically

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.210 
still coming with them so and basically
it's<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> same<00:01:07.140> same<00:01:07.619> deal<00:01:07.799> you're<00:01:08.040> just

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it's the same same deal you're just

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's the same same deal you're just
rubbing<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.670> power<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> your<00:01:10.020> battery<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
rubbing up power up to your battery and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
rubbing up power up to your battery and
then<00:01:11.340> there's<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> ground<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.180> each<00:01:12.420> side<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
then there's a ground on each side of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.289 
then there's a ground on each side of
the<00:01:13.049> wire<00:01:13.409> harness<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.040> show<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.610> again<00:01:15.000> in

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the wire harness I show you again in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.630 
the wire harness I show you again in
that<00:01:15.479> other<00:01:15.600> video<00:01:15.960> where<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> ground<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that other video where to ground to it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
that other video where to ground to it's
where<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.270> ballast<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:19.229> not

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
where I'm not the ballast and you're not

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.899 
where I'm not the ballast and you're not
mounting<00:01:19.650> ballasts<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.670> use<00:01:20.790> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
mounting ballasts but you can use that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.730 
mounting ballasts but you can use that
same<00:01:21.119> point<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.509> ground

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
same point to ground

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
same point to ground
I<00:01:22.770> recommend<00:01:23.700> grinding<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.509> bare<00:01:24.689> metal

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I recommend grinding down to bare metal

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.570 
I recommend grinding down to bare metal
there<00:01:25.170> you'll<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> supply

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
there you'll just need to supply

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.660 
there you'll just need to supply
yourself<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:27.720> nut<00:01:28.680> bolt<00:01:28.950> washer<00:01:29.250> lock

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
yourself with some nut bolt washer lock

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.980 
yourself with some nut bolt washer lock
washer<00:01:29.909> whatever<00:01:30.329> you're<00:01:30.540> gonna<00:01:30.659> use<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
washer whatever you're gonna use to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.460 
washer whatever you're gonna use to
attach<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.290> find

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
attach it there you know if you can find

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.999 
attach it there you know if you can find
anywhere<00:01:34.770> solid<00:01:35.369> frame<00:01:35.579> ground<00:01:35.909> use<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
anywhere solid frame ground use a

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.990 
anywhere solid frame ground use a
self-tapping<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:38.700> whatever<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
self-tapping bit or whatever a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
self-tapping bit or whatever a
self-tapping<00:01:39.450> screw<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.890> do

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
self-tapping screw you know you can do

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.690 
self-tapping screw you know you can do
that<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.369> whatever<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.240> easy<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.710> so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that to whatever is easy and then so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.020 
that to whatever is easy and then so
you've<00:01:45.270> got<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.540> power<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:46.110> input<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you've got your power your input the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
you've got your power your input the
grounds<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.659> each<00:01:48.810> side<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.590> basically

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
grounds on each side and then basically

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.319 
grounds on each side and then basically
you<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.250> plug<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:50.729> into<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> back<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
you just plug right into the back of the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.950 
you just plug right into the back of the
headlight<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.579> then<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> passenger

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
headlight and then this is the passenger
