not as strong as I'd like it to be so I

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.270 
not as strong as I'd like it to be so I
usually<00:04:25.509> add<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.900> little<00:04:26.229> bit<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.410> hairspray<00:04:26.770> so

just in between where you're like where

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.339

because that's better it's hardest to

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.189 
because that's better it's hardest to
stay<00:04:38.349> up<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.979> I<00:04:39.759> like<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.060> hairspray<00:04:40.449> this

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
stay up and I like to hairspray this

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.749 
stay up and I like to hairspray this
side<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.740> this<00:04:41.949> side<00:04:42.009> again<00:04:42.280> just<00:04:42.639> to

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
side and this side again just to

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.779 
side and this side again just to
reinforce<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:44.500> know<00:04:44.770> hair<00:04:45.280> sticking<00:04:45.580> out

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
reinforce you know hair sticking out

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:56.490 
reinforce you know hair sticking out
pause<00:04:50.490> besides<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:55.050> how's<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.199> bit<00:04:56.320> close

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
pause besides and so how's it bit close

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.820 
pause besides and so how's it bit close
shouldn't<00:04:57.400> do<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:57.580> close<00:04:57.820> but<00:04:58.409> and<00:04:59.409> then<00:04:59.530> for

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
shouldn't do that close but and then for

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.290 
shouldn't do that close but and then for
your<00:04:59.919> back<00:05:00.130> hair<00:05:00.310> because<00:05:00.580> sometimes<00:05:00.970> mind

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
starts going up again for no reason at

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:13.100 
starts going up again for no reason at
all<00:05:04.740> like<00:05:05.740> here<00:05:10.409> in<00:05:11.409> that<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:11.830> style<00:05:12.099> guys

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.790 

and<00:05:22.539> I<00:05:23.020> know<00:05:23.139> something<00:05:23.500> I<00:05:23.560> said<00:05:23.800> like

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
and I know something I said like

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.529 
and I know something I said like
comb-over<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:27.070> mean<00:05:27.610> like<00:05:27.789> I<00:05:27.970> like<00:05:28.120> mine<00:05:28.330> a<00:05:28.360> bit

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
comb-over I mean like I like mine a bit

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.540 
comb-over I mean like I like mine a bit
airy<00:05:28.750> but<00:05:29.050> sometimes<00:05:29.530> like<00:05:30.280> throughout<00:05:30.490> the

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
airy but sometimes like throughout the

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.670 
airy but sometimes like throughout the
day<00:05:30.759> I'll<00:05:30.940> go<00:05:31.060> back<00:05:31.210> down<00:05:31.270> so<00:05:31.840> actually<00:05:32.470> looked

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
day I'll go back down so actually looked

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.640 
day I'll go back down so actually looked
like<00:05:32.830> this<00:05:33.009> I<00:05:33.750> just<00:05:34.750> like<00:05:35.050> putting<00:05:35.289> up<00:05:35.440> now

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.010 
like this I just like putting up now
because<00:05:35.949> then<00:05:36.099> I<00:05:36.310> know<00:05:36.370> eventually<00:05:36.780> like<00:05:37.780> my

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
because then I know eventually like my

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.719 
because then I know eventually like my
hair<00:05:38.229> doesn't<00:05:38.500> defy<00:05:38.860> gravity<00:05:38.919> cuz<00:05:39.460> of<00:05:39.580> its

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
hair doesn't defy gravity cuz of its

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.399 
hair doesn't defy gravity cuz of its
length<00:05:39.960> eventually<00:05:40.960> throughout<00:05:41.139> the<00:05:41.289> day

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
length eventually throughout the day

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.050 
length eventually throughout the day
I'll<00:05:41.650> actually<00:05:41.800> go<00:05:42.130> down<00:05:42.310> down<00:05:42.759> down<00:05:43.030> down

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
I'll actually go down down down down

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.850 
I'll actually go down down down down
another<00:05:44.050> look<00:05:44.289> like<00:05:44.440> this<00:05:46.620> whereas<00:05:47.620> if<00:05:47.770> I

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
another look like this whereas if I

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.100 
another look like this whereas if I
started<00:05:48.190> from<00:05:48.280> this<00:05:48.490> i<00:05:48.789> if<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.690> styled<00:05:49.900> my<00:05:50.050> hair

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
started from this i if I styled my hair

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.980 
started from this i if I styled my hair
like<00:05:50.440> not<00:05:51.039> too<00:05:51.250> puffy<00:05:51.729> I<00:05:51.940> figured<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.870> day

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
like not too puffy I figured the day

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.040 
like not too puffy I figured the day
I'll<00:05:53.110> get<00:05:53.349> super<00:05:53.889> fat<00:05:54.099> I'll<00:05:54.430> just<00:05:54.639> be<00:05:54.789> like

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
I'll get super fat I'll just be like

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.629 
I'll get super fat I'll just be like
that<00:05:56.050> so<00:05:56.409> that's<00:05:56.560> why<00:05:56.710> I<00:05:56.740> like<00:05:56.919> styling

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
that so that's why I like styling

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.750 
that so that's why I like styling
upwards

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
upwards

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.330 
upwards
because<00:05:59.540> then<00:05:59.720> I<00:06:00.140> take<00:06:00.590> into<00:06:00.770> account<00:06:01.070> of

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
because then I take into account of

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.990 
because then I take into account of
gravity<00:06:02.410> at<00:06:03.410> negative<00:06:03.950> 9.8<00:06:04.460> meters<00:06:04.970> per

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
gravity at negative 9.8 meters per

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.050 
gravity at negative 9.8 meters per
second<00:06:05.600> by<00:06:05.750> Newton's<00:06:06.110> law<00:06:06.670> in<00:06:07.670> the<00:06:07.820> account

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
second by Newton's law in the account

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.320 
second by Newton's law in the account
for<00:06:08.180> how<00:06:08.450> much<00:06:08.630> I<00:06:08.780> walk<00:06:08.960> all<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.380> vibrations

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
for how much I walk all the vibrations

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.390 
for how much I walk all the vibrations
that<00:06:11.330> stuff<00:06:11.660> so<00:06:11.930> no<00:06:12.410> that's<00:06:12.800> just<00:06:12.950> something<00:06:13.220> I

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
that stuff so no that's just something I

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.070 
that stuff so no that's just something I
think<00:06:13.460> about<00:06:13.880> it's<00:06:14.600> probably<00:06:14.690> don't<00:06:14.990> you

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
think about it's probably don't you

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.720 
think about it's probably don't you
think<00:06:15.290> about<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.680> yeah<00:06:16.370> what<00:06:16.640> we're

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
think about that yeah what we're

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.060 
think about that yeah what we're
thinking<00:06:16.880> about<00:06:17.120> it<00:06:17.420> yeah<00:06:18.260> I'm<00:06:18.500> just<00:06:18.800> centered

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
thinking about it yeah I'm just centered

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.300 
thinking about it yeah I'm just centered
