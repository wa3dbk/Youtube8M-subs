absolutely everywhere so let's go again

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.950 
absolutely everywhere so let's go again
what<00:04:42.070> it's<00:04:43.070> called<00:04:43.250> like<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.400> few<00:04:43.730> tornadoes

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960

then I need to climb back up there so
let's<00:05:05.750> see<00:05:05.930> what<00:05:06.350> you<00:05:06.620> like<00:05:07.100> effectives<00:05:07.790> are

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
let's see what you like effectives are

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.820 
let's see what you like effectives are
mountains<00:05:08.900> now<00:05:09.080> of<00:05:09.169> course<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.500> will<00:05:09.620> like

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
mountains now of course it will like

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.469 
mountains now of course it will like
book<00:05:10.010> out<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.250> it'll<00:05:10.880> send<00:05:11.120> everything

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
book out and it'll send everything

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.230 
book out and it'll send everything
flying<00:05:11.930> all<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.140> way<00:05:12.260> across<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.740> map

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
flying all the way across the map

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.909 
flying all the way across the map
so<00:05:14.240> we're<00:05:14.479> let's<00:05:15.020> go<00:05:15.140> try<00:05:15.350> out<00:05:15.500> on<00:05:15.710> like<00:05:15.890> a

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
so we're let's go try out on like a

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.150 
so we're let's go try out on like a
mountain<00:05:16.610> something<00:05:17.450> like<00:05:17.570> that<00:05:17.720> so<00:05:18.530> oops

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
mountain something like that so oops

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:30.129 
mountain something like that so oops
normal<00:05:19.669> string
