00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 and hello to everyone falcon and yes yes I'll be back 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.940
 immediately apologize for my 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.019
 a little district voice yo I decided 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.240
 getting sick like that just came 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.800
 watch the video to the end because in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.439
 the end of the video will be very important 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.619
 information which is not desirable 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.990
 skip for you so yes I mean 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.990
 back I could not fix all my 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.150
 troubles in a rational way therefore 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.120
 and just rearranged windows all kind of 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.340
 helped and works fine and so 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.230
 so today will be pretty cool 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.200
 the plant choir he majesty is so long 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.329
 big I do not know for someone serves for 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.399
 someone easy 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.829
 let's start with the very primitive self 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.420
 I think some of you should know the mod 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.670
 called treecapitator 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.210
 what is he doing when tearing the bottom 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.809
 block tree hits the whole trunk ie 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.660
 this is not the way with cutting trees 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.359
 was implemented in terraria and rubbed it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 two demoyan only about other creators 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.700
 so forth well and one american stoner 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.979
 and under the nickname for forland farlands 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.340
 he implemented such a system minecraft 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.650
 where are you tearing down just the bottom block and the whole 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.770
 actually explodes but this mechanism 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.680
 there were two minuses two huge minuses 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.540
 which I really liked 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.240
 down and whom I decided to make my 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.460
 version 1 minus and the body was in that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.990
 what about from cutting trees 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.360
 tree blocks scattered into different 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.140
 parties and could hurt others 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 buildings to eat blocks did not break 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.750
 only trees still any walls 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.340
 cable land and so on also if 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.840
 bubbles and became a tree put abs 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.250
 ideal or bedrock more accurate at all 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.390
 committed google o put i then this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.050
 the treecapitator mechanism will break it 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.810
 before you break it a little bit go down 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.760
 that is, it doesn't work very well 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.119
 so I decided to create my own if 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.970
 mechanism which is slightly different in 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.160
 principle of action but works like me 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.700
 I understood without bugs as I want not yet 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.060
 found 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.120
 mean we have four great relief 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.650
 they work seven thousand work mechanism 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.260
 four kinds but he say so what 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.010
 there is a sapling of acacia sapling of dark 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.920
 trees but they don't work for them like that 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.980
 as there they have other they are completely 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.620
 I will become an oak saplings and grow 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.070
 well, I will only break it if god is nothing 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.060
 happens but if we throw tapas and under 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:52.000
 tree it will sue you 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.310
 seedlings spruce particle means breaking lower 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.760
 block 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.540
 we throw curled everything is fine sapling 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:07.090
 birch on the lower block 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.370
 We throw our Spaniard 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.269
 tropical tree on between will 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.180
 we throw it kerf with normal 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.880
 running paddle smiles only tree 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.880
 loans are very beautiful and so mean how 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.160
 are working 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.640
 we do not have an ordinary generator block on 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.980
 knees fil also can anyone carry block 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.950
 no matter the faster the hla generator 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.510
 higher to be works the body I reprimanded 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.780
 found team scoreboard 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:42.910
 oh d d bee doom her and you even 30 in 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:48.250
 the team that you have worked start further 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:52.370
 when I throw then throwing on my land 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.600
 diamond ax when i land you to him 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.620
 this command block 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.410
 each type adds one team points 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.110
 on more precisely in parameter hid what that is 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.830
 prescribe a scoreboard 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.260
 cellar disclosure chop that is a river fucking 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.330
 throw an ax in color at the bottom line 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.530
 most we have to the resident is added with an ax 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.910
 one point and daughter in this board soon and 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:27.260
 next we have a number of team blocks 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.140
 mean too adex and drink with us in 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.590
 the time when these points are 15, we have 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.660
 Maykroft block is tested for one block 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.270
 up that is and staples this here 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.540
 here are two trees tested here here 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.460
 i.e 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.980
 about she tested and to the boards gives 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.540
 signal and this tree using the parameter 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.550
 exclude and team website blog 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.970
 just cut down how fast with parameter 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.970
 Destroy 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.319
 also everything else is just with us 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.470
 there is here here here was a tilde height 1 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:11.380
 that is, tilde + 1 that is with us 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.770
 It turns out on one side above and already on 2 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.120
 block above and so on and also changing 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.449
 parameter with adblock 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.780
 the height is exactly the same as in the team 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.330
 you can adjust the target yourself with 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.759
 height until the moment I made up to 11 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.740
 blocks you with 11 block just knock out not 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:35.849
 let's build 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:38.680
 one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.880
 according to the bottom block right here we have 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.479
 12 blocks 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.009
 has vertices just 11 fall down 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.220
 smiles all the moisture on like i said 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.919
 because it is not designed for 12 blocks 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.080
 up you can yourself regulate this 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.770
 with height you can build more 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.669
 distant play play break last 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.979
 you had to be soala add this 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.530
 such live link only to change height with 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.169
 10 on 11 and here 10 on 11 that is 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.270
 add time one and you will have everything 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.909
 work well important watch out for 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.020
 power 1 what's on since it can 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:17.500
 go out 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:22.229
 More precisely the diet husband extinguish it to work 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.229
 you will mean nothing and 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.930
 from the video as I told you the assessment 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.610
 pupils of two or three days on my 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.210
 the channel will release an important podcast about 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.700
 changes on my channel you should 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.920
 allow for changes as if 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:46.540
 miss refusal there will be some 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:49.690
 some misunderstandings and so on well 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.020
 and there his joy i will come back i tried 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:57.220
 for you windows myself here i washed
