00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.550
 hello to everyone and like that 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.320
 without it 240 for a new top so 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.869
 in this video I show you how 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.410
 do an update on his bios from the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.720
 motherboard 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.640
 so for those who do not know and ben the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.310
 bios is a little what manages the touch 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.989
 your motherboard and it is necessary to lower the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.430
 still shareholder new because 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.530
 that it corrects stability during 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.329
 games for more than curly games plant 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.640
 it increases performance were in 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.540
 function updates so there me me there 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.160
 must be easy so I'm going to have to 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.390
 that there is one who has not gone out 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.120
 very long time but since I was not 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.649
 of kyoto on the site I the sphere so 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.600
 already you go on the internet 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.629
 you are looking on great if you have a 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.769
 notice of death at the site at gites.com and 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.239
 you are looking for your motherboard 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.059
 if you type on google or your map 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.470
 mother so I typed asus motherboard 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.000
 m 5-78 that is the bin and update 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.890
 bio it's rains fell on the site where 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.810
 everything depends on your motherboard 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.900
 so it's a girl on the box you 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.190
 buy it so I try it so 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.260
 you then look in his 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.880
 exploitation if you ask you put 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.520
 your system 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.620
 so windows 7 vista all that changes 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.570
 know if you have it against for the 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.650
 32-bit 64- bit for those who do not know 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.590
 make life difficult for a computer 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.490
 property and there you see here that there is 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:44.490
 writing 64 bits or 32.8 of antibes from 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 system here is eating it 1,64 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.730
 now to and in bios utility 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.380
 or bio I think it's bio here is there 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.190
 a news that came out on December 4 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.200
 2012 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.420
 here it is necessary I have not done yet 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.530
 so I'm going to do it so there you see 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.570
 a short description 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.010
 so if you do not have an aj if you 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.470
 are not semester me I think I want 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.800
 so that's it but the stability of the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.890
 system and the compatibility of the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.330
 memory so you make you click 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.410
 on global or download a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.210
 world does not work 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.550
 if it works also makes it record 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.600
 under so I advise you to create a 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.270
 new folder on your desk you 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.860
 name kind update bios like me 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.330
 that's how you recorded 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.090
 in but the voice the update of the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.870
 bios and you do not change anything to the title or 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.540
 leave it like that you 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.460
 save 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.910
 so it's instantaneous now 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.620
 you can close internet 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.810
 you're going to have his teeth made you 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.920
 right click 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.090
 so you need a rare I am very 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.160
 well their description for the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.960
 download made extract write now 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.940
 now you have to delete 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.700
 the archi him a rare remains only 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.900
 so that's a point to rome so you 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.220
 do not try to open it and no software 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.910
 that opens up is during the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.860
 pc startup 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.420
 I want to show it right away 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.590
 directly filming the screen because 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.940
 that she can not record with hit 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.970
 so I restart the computer and I 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.260
 so film right away 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.340
 this is his second part of which I 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.320
 will show you how to install the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.170
 update so I tell you everything from 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.240
 continuation before continuing that in fact there 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.230
 a moment ago they will ask you to 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.340
 do some way you 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.440
 will only have a few seconds to 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.000
 do that depends on the motherboards so 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.970
 often it will be written down to the left 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.400
 or right whaou anywhere will 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.690
 just find where it is so I 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.880
 do not know too much if I have to support 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.540
 but I'm going to look so now he 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.540
 have to start the computer 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.940
 here you are displaying the bio so this is the 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.340
 farga the goods in bar the spleen 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.770
 yes so there you tell me stop more f24 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.680
 f2 for the z flash that's it opens me 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.510
 so that blows you a wages of 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.820
 cat here is these similar measures 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.560
 it's good otherwise it will surely be a 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.810
 other presentation 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.920
 so there you have to look on the if 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.560
 you did it on the hard disk it's 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.640
 so on the record of your office by 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.919
 example it will be on the local disk 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.470
 so you can change with 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.300
 this key there to change left 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.350
 right 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.780
 So here you are if you know it we 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.930
 is back here now his right 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.020
 for target and get off 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.259
 with the arrow keys you go 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.669
 search in the air where 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:41.370
 users it depends on entered there you 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.330
 go on the stuff of your name 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.650
 of user so me these supermen 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.729
 incident you are looking for scop 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.740
 these desk flyers if you're looking so 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.289
 there back if you screamed what these 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.850
 updates via does enter and there you 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.490
 go see your little file a point 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.979
 rome so during creation and everything so 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.530
 there it is necessary to enter the charge a 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.759
 little trick there to rioz especially a date 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.710
 on news actually went in there you 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.090
 wait for the little loading down so 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.849
 there I cut the video while waiting for it 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.800
 be finished the children after that there they 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.610
 told me so much too late I took my 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.169
 camera 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.490
 but they told me that the system was going 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.410
 restart after 5 seconds you will 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.759
 let restart the bio is so 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.979
 normally I do not believe they 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.180
 displayed a mine while two per 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.780
 month it does not matter it's your ticket 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.270
 has been updated 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:38.159
 so if you have problems with your 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.800
 pc games jory curly low is that it 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.909
 is there a problem with the bios or so 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.460
 that it is not up to date 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.380
 up to date after that will work a lot better 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.520
 and then it would be good for me 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.380
 to say here I think 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.000
 I was precise enough to tell you that 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.970
 we do a volte face we have nothing 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.280
 complicated just knowing how to open the trick of 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.740
 saved flashes of files then 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.150
 go get and open it so I believe 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.669
 it works also for usb keys you 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.229
 put on a usb stick you choose 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.259
 the usb key so we take him the disk 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.970
 local c is you open it here is there 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.470
 it's the end of the video I say 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.970
 thank you for watching put a small 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.289
 several suns have pleased subscribe to mach 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.289
