00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.200
 - Hello, I am Thomas, 15 years old - I am Jenny, 15 years old. 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.840
 I am Franceska, 15 years old. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 This is our "Space Lab" entry film. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.840
 We are going to experiment with the effect of microgravity on the human body in Space Lab. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.120
 The nature of the space laboratory can cause serious health problems 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.560
 Such as muscle consumption, physical weakness 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.960
 Environmental stress and insomnia caused by nervous tension 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.960
 In Asia and the current American countries 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.280
 There is a special mushroom called Ganoderma Lucidum 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.160
 Chemical constituents of erythromycin in Ganoderma lucidum 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.280
 Much like steroid hormones 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.640
 That might help astronauts 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.840
 Muscle adaptation in a microgravity environment 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.880
 Or a zero-gravity environment for future space travel 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.960
 Know how Ganoderma lucidum grows in this environment 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.680
 Can provide methods 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 Solve the problem in this regard 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.280
 Helping long-distance space travel 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.800
 Because of weight restrictions 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.680
 May not be able to bring some drugs 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.760
 1G gravity environment on earth 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360
 Ganoderma lucidum's sub-layer position has the function of preventing atrophy 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.400
 That is to say, the sub-solid layer is opposite to the gravity source. 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.680
 Is on the right 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.400
 We ask questions 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.080
 How does microgravity affect? 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.760
 Where is the real layer of Ganoderma lucidum? 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.840
 Want to know the answer, we have experimental hypothesis 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.440
 In the microgravity environment, the real layer of Ganoderma lucidum 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840
 Will grow in a direction other than the original setting... 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.880
 Stem growth compared with Ganoderma lucidum on Earth 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.480
 Asymmetry 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.320
 In order to do experiments, we have to plant spores of specific species. 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.200
 Eastern United States hemlock 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.280
 Or hemlock 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.320
 That is in the human environment 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.680
 This natural growth mode of Ganoderma lucidum 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.560
 To understand the growth pattern of Ganoderma lucidum 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.320
 Understand the effects of microgravity 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.120
 Must take photos continuously 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.360
 Observe the growth pattern of Ganoderma 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.320
 We believe that the No. 1 habitat 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 Best for this experiment 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.000
 We want to remove the effects of labor 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.280
 Monitoring environment control 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.640
 We predict that Ganoderma lucidum will grow in an asymmetric way. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.760
 Unable to predict direction because of lack of gravity
