biologically chemically and physically
now<00:00:12.660> I've<00:00:12.719> come<00:00:12.990> too<00:00:13.139> near<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.440> my<00:00:13.559> yard<00:00:13.769> which

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
now I've come too near in my yard which

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.730 
now I've come too near in my yard which
is<00:00:14.450> somewhat<00:00:15.450> shaded<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.199> pretty<00:00:16.590> much

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
is somewhat shaded it's pretty much

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.349 
is somewhat shaded it's pretty much
always<00:00:16.980> moist<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.789> there's<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.060> lot<00:00:18.240> of

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
always moist and there's a lot of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.019 
always moist and there's a lot of
decaying<00:00:18.859> vegetation<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.820> would

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
decaying vegetation here so this would

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.640 
decaying vegetation here so this would
be<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> likely<00:00:21.510> environment<00:00:22.289> where<00:00:22.410> I'm<00:00:22.500> going

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
be a likely environment where I'm going

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.870 
be a likely environment where I'm going
to<00:00:22.740> find<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.670> earthworm<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:25.789> we're<00:00:26.789> just

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to find the earthworm and we're just

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.200 
to find the earthworm and we're just
going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> gently<00:00:28.369> move<00:00:29.369> some<00:00:29.640> soil<00:00:29.939> around

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
going to gently move some soil around

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.790 
going to gently move some soil around
here<00:00:30.539> find<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.869> nice<00:00:31.019> form<00:00:31.260> after<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.710> a

to find out some basic characteristics

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.119 
to find out some basic characteristics
of<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:38.280> earthworm<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.059> common<00:00:39.450> invertebrate

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
of the earthworm a common invertebrate

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.160 
of the earthworm a common invertebrate
very<00:00:41.129> beneficial<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> plant<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> animal

very beneficial to the plant and animal
kingdom<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.640> two<00:00:44.879> earthworms<00:00:45.450> here

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
kingdom so I have two earthworms here

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.110 
kingdom so I have two earthworms here
this<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> found<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
this is the one that I found just in the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.840 
this is the one that I found just in the
soil<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.200> other<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.489> second

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
soil here and this other one the second

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.220 
soil here and this other one the second
earthworm<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.719> what's<00:00:51.930> called<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
earthworm I have is what's called a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.279 
earthworm I have is what's called a
night<00:00:52.440> crawler<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> buy<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.079> at

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
night crawler and you can buy these at

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.160 
night crawler and you can buy these at
bait<00:00:55.620> stores<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.489> most<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.629> them<00:00:57.750> happen<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
bait stores and most of them happen to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.900 
bait stores and most of them happen to
come<00:00:58.350> from<00:00:58.559> Canada<00:00:58.829> perform<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.789> an

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
come from Canada perform is an

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.610 
come from Canada perform is an
invertebrate<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:01.020> means<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.440> has<00:01:01.590> no

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
invertebrate which means it has no

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.910 
invertebrate which means it has no
backbone<00:01:02.129> very<00:01:02.850> basic<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.930> anatomy<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
backbone very basic and it's anatomy it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.350 
backbone very basic and it's anatomy it
has<00:01:05.610> five<00:01:06.570> hearts<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.640> breathes<00:01:08.640> through<00:01:09.150> its

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
has five hearts it breathes through its

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.390 
has five hearts it breathes through its
skin<00:01:09.570> therefore<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.530> always<00:01:10.740> has<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
skin therefore it always has to be in

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.670 
skin therefore it always has to be in
moist<00:01:11.790> conditions<00:01:12.390> however<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.290> doesn't<00:01:13.439> like

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
moist conditions however it doesn't like

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
moist conditions however it doesn't like
too<00:01:13.920> much<00:01:14.130> water<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> soil<00:01:15.060> otherwise<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
too much water in the soil otherwise it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.640 
too much water in the soil otherwise it
will<00:01:15.990> drown<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.180> mouth<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.780> an<00:01:19.500> anus

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
will drown it has a mouth and an anus

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.969 
will drown it has a mouth and an anus
and<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.240> easiest<00:01:21.240> way<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.570> detect<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.740> mouth

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and the easiest way to detect the mouth

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.399 
and the easiest way to detect the mouth
is<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:24.270> you'll<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:24.840> tiny<00:01:25.049> tongue

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
is then you'll see a little tiny tongue

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.230 
is then you'll see a little tiny tongue
coming<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> mouth<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:27.000> course

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
coming out of the mouth and of course

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.429 
coming out of the mouth and of course
the<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:27.570> end<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.110> anus<00:01:29.810> our<00:01:30.810> homes<00:01:31.200> are

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the other end is the anus our homes are

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.710 
the other end is the anus our homes are
hermaphrodites<00:01:32.159> meaning<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.420> both

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
hermaphrodites meaning they have both

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.819 
hermaphrodites meaning they have both
sexes<00:01:34.229> however<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.909> need<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.829> second

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
sexes however they do need a second

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.910 
sexes however they do need a second
earthworm<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.610> order<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> exchange<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.590> sperm

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
earthworm in order to exchange the sperm

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
earthworm in order to exchange the sperm
major<00:01:41.400> benefits<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> her<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.509> activity<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
major benefits of her from activity to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.620 
major benefits of her from activity to
the<00:01:43.320> soil<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:44.070> biological<00:01:44.939> chemical<00:01:45.509> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the soil are biological chemical and
