00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
in this build video I show you how to

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.190 
in this build video I show you how to
assemble<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.870> new<00:00:04.830> one<00:00:05.130> 250<00:00:05.790> frame<00:00:06.750> from

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
assemble the new one 250 frame from

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.350 
assemble the new one 250 frame from
hobbyking<00:00:07.859> first<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.849> need<00:00:09.440> 22<00:00:10.440> standoffs<00:00:11.360> 28

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
hobbyking first you need 22 standoffs 28

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.440 
hobbyking first you need 22 standoffs 28
rods<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.840> use<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:14.009> three<00:00:14.250> LED<00:00:14.790> diffusers

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.870 

show<00:00:20.570> you<00:00:20.630> where<00:00:21.230> to<00:00:21.260> put<00:00:21.440> the<00:00:21.950> standoffs<00:00:22.580> but

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
show you where to put the standoffs but

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.000 
show you where to put the standoffs but
you<00:00:23.270> can<00:00:23.450> also<00:00:23.630> see<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.170> in<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.590> diagram

description<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:28.010> this<00:00:28.640> video

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.200 

so<00:00:33.719> let's<00:00:34.199> get<00:00:34.320> started<00:00:34.530> let's<00:00:34.969> speed<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so let's get started let's speed it up a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.360 
so let's get started let's speed it up a
bit

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.310 

I<00:00:40.050> score<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.649> standoffs<00:00:42.520> in<00:00:42.730> place<00:00:43.000> only<00:00:43.809> by

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
I score the standoffs in place only by

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.700 
I score the standoffs in place only by
hand<00:00:44.559> after<00:00:45.010> completing<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.820> build<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.269> were

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
hand after completing the build I were

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.020 
hand after completing the build I were
fast<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:47.890> all<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.610> schools

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
fast in all the schools

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.549 
fast in all the schools
but<00:00:49.300> for<00:00:49.989> now<00:00:50.110> this<00:00:50.649> should<00:00:50.890> do<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:53.230> can<00:00:53.379> also

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
but for now this should do you can also

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.439 
but for now this should do you can also
use<00:00:53.980> Loctite<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.800> secure<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.339> schools<00:00:57.640> but<00:00:58.420> I

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
use Loctite to secure the schools but I

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.189 
use Loctite to secure the schools but I
think<00:00:59.170> there<00:00:59.379> are<00:00:59.530> so<00:00:59.800> many<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.370> them<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:01.199> they

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
think there are so many of them and they

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.850 
think there are so many of them and they
probably<00:01:02.860> don't<00:01:03.309> come<00:01:03.909> loose<00:01:04.089> but<00:01:04.680> when<00:01:05.680> they

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
probably don't come loose but when they

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:14.860 
probably don't come loose but when they
will<00:01:06.040> I<00:01:06.220> will<00:01:06.550> do<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.390> later

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.760 

you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.450 

so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
so

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.800 
so
those<00:01:24.760> are<00:01:24.970> done<00:01:25.270> let's<00:01:26.229> move<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:28.090> LED

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
those are done let's move on to the LED

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.370 
those are done let's move on to the LED
diffusers<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:31.080> took<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.440> screwdriver<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:34.140> food

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
diffusers I took a screwdriver and food

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.480 
diffusers I took a screwdriver and food
some<00:01:35.710> schools<00:01:36.070> into<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.950> diffusers<00:01:38.950> since

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
some schools into the diffusers since

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.270 
some schools into the diffusers since
there<00:01:39.610> are<00:01:39.700> no<00:01:39.880> school<00:01:40.390> words<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.650> should<00:01:41.860> use

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
there are no school words you should use

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.070 
there are no school words you should use
the<00:01:42.759> screw<00:01:43.000> tap<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.590> if<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.830> don't<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:46.450> take

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
the screw tap but if you don't just take

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.880 
the screw tap but if you don't just take
a<00:01:47.110> screw<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:48.149> screw<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.210> in

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:00.420 

do<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.369> all<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> light<00:01:53.820> diffusers

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:12.339 

you

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.839 

now<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.159> you're<00:02:13.310> done<00:02:13.459> with<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.819> first

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
now that you're done with the first

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.160 
now that you're done with the first
layer<00:02:14.420> let's<00:02:14.959> move<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.519> next<00:02:16.989> we<00:02:17.989> need

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
layer let's move on for the next we need

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.740 
layer let's move on for the next we need
the<00:02:19.099> top<00:02:19.939> spacers<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.879> third<00:02:23.120> layer<00:02:23.329> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the top spacers and the third layer and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.830 
the top spacers and the third layer and
the<00:02:24.049> top<00:02:24.260> layer<00:02:24.819> all<00:02:25.819> together<00:02:26.269> since<00:02:26.689> they

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
the top layer all together since they

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.990 
the top layer all together since they
are<00:02:26.989> only<00:02:27.409> secured<00:02:27.829> by<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.189> same<00:02:28.459> screws

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
are only secured by the same screws

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.880 
are only secured by the same screws

this video only shows you how to
assemble<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> frame<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.350> want<00:02:35.560> to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
assemble the frame but if you want to

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.800 
assemble the frame but if you want to
put<00:02:35.950> your<00:02:36.100> ear<00:02:36.310> sees<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:37.180> want<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.720> do

put your ear sees and you want to do
this<00:02:38.050> before<00:02:39.300> adding<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.570> top<00:02:40.750> plate<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:42.160> if

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
this before adding the top plate so if

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.170 
this before adding the top plate so if
you<00:02:43.000> want<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.330> add<00:02:43.660> your<00:02:44.670> electronics<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.940> your

you want to add your electronics to your
quadcopter<00:02:46.660> do<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.470> after<00:02:47.890> adding<00:02:48.459> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
quadcopter do this after adding the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:57.340 
quadcopter do this after adding the
standoff<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.450> light<00:02:49.630> diffusers

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.940 

as<00:02:58.130> already<00:02:58.310> mentioned<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:59.060> find<00:02:59.950> detailed

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the last thing to do is at the middle

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.780 
the last thing to do is at the middle
played<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.980> main<00:03:20.250> top<00:03:20.519> played<00:03:22.489> spaces<00:03:23.489> for

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
played the main top played spaces for

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.180 
played the main top played spaces for
them

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.850

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
after you've done this you can also add

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.810 
after you've done this you can also add
the<00:03:31.160> battery<00:03:31.940> cage<00:03:32.240> on<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.870> button<00:03:33.370> for<00:03:34.370> this

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
the battery cage on the button for this

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.550 
the battery cage on the button for this
you<00:03:35.240> will<00:03:35.390> need<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:36.880> hex<00:03:37.880> standoffs<00:03:38.870> not<00:03:39.380> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
you will need the hex standoffs not the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.470
