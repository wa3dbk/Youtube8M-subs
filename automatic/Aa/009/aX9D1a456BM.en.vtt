00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.250
 show you how you do to 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.930
 be able to get her the medal of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:28.640
 technical order 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:28.640
 a gringo friend here explaining to him 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.329
 First I'll play because I have friends. 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.329
 there plane 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:01:17.190
 He'll tell you what happened the week is over. 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:17.190
 surviving to lower the volume is frank 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.130
 so he went there died here while 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 he does not survive you're going to kill like this 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.390
 It's here to make money. 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:46.420
 take care of us and even the box is 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:50.369
 asking with the medal of the video is 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.369
 teaching the undertaker medal 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.680
 and you're going to use the script there 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.500
 does not survive 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.750
 the training is reborn, I do not know how to kill 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.320
 Be careful not to hit the box more 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.320
 once 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.459
 Here you go and make some money. 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.640
 power the role life 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.590
 this position is perfect for those who have the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.440
 hatchet 59 is not for those who have only 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.190
 the gun is only for those who have a gun 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.319
 white 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.870
 I already think that even a parang already saw 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.390
 to do a little bit a little bit 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.660
 more complicated but you can make a 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.690
 normal knife does not feel too much 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.500
 so already your rock 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.500
 then there 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.480
 Now he's going to play there. 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:16.540
 Do you want to appear a bastard? 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:25.560
 so here it is I did not 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:25.560
 now it has not been too strong 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.410
 will not return to ask to wait 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.850
 sometimes it happens you have to take a little 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.850
 of care 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.050
 so what to do while good even though 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.170
 Since I die, I 'll be able to show 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.030
 For you, only you will jump. 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.920
 in that box as soon as you jump 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.560
 in that box you will activate your 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.610
 Click author is the muricy I'll leave 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.070
 here in the video description and when you 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.600
 activate a monk if he counts a 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.090
 series of things I 'm going to teach for 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.330
 You in the second video are in the second 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.220
 video and will make another quince of ct 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.540
 which will also be in the second video of the 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.120
 tekke medal 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.400
 done that you will stop it 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.950
 he will stay the whole night with the pc 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.760
 connected on Sunday there was television going 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.460
 we dined to be doing what you want and 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.200
 will make your medal while the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.920
 It's important not to touch the computer. 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.710
 no one can move or in your damn 'the 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.220
 medal consists of you killing 1 million 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.790
 says a bug masters so let's go there 1 of 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:52.560
 I'm going to take advantage of this so far 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:58.320
 life and let's buy a neighbor's vest 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.330
 to help and we will try again to 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.610
 does not happen here, the ideal is to stay with 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.090
 you jump sideways 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:10.020
 so I'm going to thank that spencer who 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.440
 He has to leave and I will continue with 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.440
 you 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.900
 He already left here, whoever he wants 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.130
 make you will get here will stay 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.580
 in this corner here in this corner here ok 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.970
 this corner here with the blame amg 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.180
 hatchet things worth ax 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.870
 Long knives will give you the first hit 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.240
 here is going to let your tight button is 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.520
 to make a better appointment, see 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.680
 here it has a kind of hole in the 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.650
 ground at the beginning of the yellow curve 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.380
 which is a straight line and will find this 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.070
 hole here you will leave it marked here 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.370
 O 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:01.920
 and here you will leave the button 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.570
 to put as a t medal that goes 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.690
 Let's squeeze here and you'll be doing 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:12.600
 here even God knows when they are usually 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:16.800
 36 or 38 thousand do not have certainties an enc 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.810
 map of the twin is 36 to 38 thousand 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.010
 The important thing is, do you connect here? 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.260
 here's a zombie killing the box 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:30.480
 continues with 24,993 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:33.050
 I will not keep hammering will 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.060
 continue the same with the same total 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.100
 God is wrong ax here 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.870
 so this is important you do not take 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.610
 life of this box that is here that goes 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:46.890
 keep you alive 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:50.220
 ok done this threw up if you leave until the 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:53.190
 At the end, and then you 're going to play there 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.960
 zombie along and if you do this a 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.270
 every day to see if I go to sleep 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.150
 will let you do this in approximately 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:04.200
 a month a little more you already have 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:07.530
 game you never killed many unb one 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.140
 a little more you play in a position of 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.750
 often a little - you already 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.850
 will be able to have his t medal that 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.530
 there are 50 of very nice slag 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.270
 only the people who do it 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.210
 too bad for a zombie 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.200
 but the medal does not come as it is in my case I 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.280
 killed 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.490
 I think about 8 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.560
 hundreds 900,000 and nothing's doing the 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.470
 accounts here the medal did not come by I 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.320
 So I decided to do it here, help. 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.570
 and I think I killed about 30,000 in the 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.830
 maximum and see the medal gives an appearance that 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.010
 I thought 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.660
 So how can I not tell a way? 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.810
 trams do so 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.850
 Okay, I'll make another recording and I'll leave. 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:52.010
 you with her and along with this video 

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.010
 same folks a hug around
