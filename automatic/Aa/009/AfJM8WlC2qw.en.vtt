come that will enable that feature

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.759 
come that will enable that feature
that's<00:03:21.090> what<00:03:21.390> I'm<00:03:21.480> thinking<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.140> can't<00:03:22.440> I

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
that's what I'm thinking of I can't I

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.520 
that's what I'm thinking of I can't I
don't<00:03:23.670> think<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.209> completely<00:03:24.750> disregard

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
don't think that completely disregard

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.850 
don't think that completely disregard
that<00:03:25.769> whole<00:03:26.040> set<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.880> people<00:03:27.330> who<00:03:27.570> have<00:03:27.600> 3d<00:03:28.350> TVs

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
that whole set of people who have 3d TVs

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.479 
that whole set of people who have 3d TVs
and<00:03:29.100> have<00:03:29.310> all<00:03:29.489> them<00:03:29.670> 3d<00:03:30.120> blu-rays<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.489> but

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
and have all them 3d blu-rays and but

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.740 
and have all them 3d blu-rays and but
then<00:03:32.880> again<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.150> think<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:33.510> quite

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
then again I think it's quite

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.289 
then again I think it's quite
interesting<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:35.070> really<00:03:35.459> don't<00:03:35.580> think<00:03:35.700> 3d

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
interesting so I really don't think 3d

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.360 
interesting so I really don't think 3d
is<00:03:36.540> going<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.959> big<00:03:37.380> big<00:03:37.799> thing<00:03:38.160> this

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
is going to be a big big thing this

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.750 
is going to be a big big thing this
generation<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:40.290> can't<00:03:40.769> see<00:03:40.950> Sony<00:03:41.370> pushing

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
generation and I can't see Sony pushing
