doesn't<00:01:59.179> work<00:01:59.420> too<00:01:59.569> well<00:01:59.599> when<00:01:59.899> you're<00:02:00.020> trying

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
doesn't work too well when you're trying

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.380 
doesn't work too well when you're trying
to<00:02:00.349> do<00:02:00.469> it<00:02:00.560> with<00:02:00.649> one<00:02:00.860> hand<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:01.670> really<00:02:02.270> do

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
to do it with one hand so I really do

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.130 
to do it with one hand so I really do
need<00:02:02.539> that<00:02:02.719> tripod<00:02:03.140> but

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
need that tripod but

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
need that tripod but
so<00:02:04.380> kind<00:02:04.650> of<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:04.980> in<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.340> closer<00:02:05.520> all

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
so kind of get me in a little closer all

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.730 
so kind of get me in a little closer all
right<00:02:06.360> basically<00:02:06.720> I'm<00:02:07.080> just<00:02:07.110> taking<00:02:07.530> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
right basically I'm just taking that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.290 
right basically I'm just taking that
string<00:02:08.960> moving<00:02:09.960> it<00:02:10.050> through<00:02:11.060> coming<00:02:12.060> over

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
string moving it through coming over

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.960 
string moving it through coming over
here

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.100 

for<00:02:18.300> having<00:02:18.480> that

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
for having that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.080 
for having that
and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.420 
and
we're<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.720> run<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.170> up

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.930 

get<00:02:26.000> this<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.239> little<00:02:26.420> bit<00:02:26.629> better

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.800 

all<00:02:31.240> right

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.860 

run<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.260> through<00:02:34.440> here<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.540> know<00:02:36.599> I've

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
run it through here and I know I've

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.720 
run it through here and I know I've
missed<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.620> eye<00:02:37.650> hooks<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.640> know

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
missed one of the eye hooks but you know

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.400 
missed one of the eye hooks but you know
I'm<00:02:38.970> gonna<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.300> back<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.510> I'll<00:02:39.900> uh<00:02:39.930> I'll

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I'm gonna go back and I'll uh I'll

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.170 
I'm gonna go back and I'll uh I'll
restring<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.160> other<00:02:41.280> side<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:41.760> tie<00:02:42.120> it

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
restring the other side and just tie it

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.770 
restring the other side and just tie it
off<00:02:42.390> there<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:43.800> just<00:02:44.790> pull<00:02:45.330> some<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.660> it

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
off there but then just pull some of it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.710 
off there but then just pull some of it
out

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
out

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.380 
out
squeaking<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.340> just<00:02:49.550> take<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.940> here

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.930 

run<00:02:53.540> now<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.620> can<00:02:54.800> see<00:02:55.010> you've<00:02:55.760> got<00:02:55.790> a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
run now and you can see you've got a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.130 
run now and you can see you've got a
nice<00:02:56.180> little<00:02:56.770> little<00:02:57.770> trellis<00:02:58.959> going<00:02:59.959> and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
nice little little trellis going and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.260 
nice little little trellis going and
I'll<00:03:00.620> finish<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.130> all<00:03:01.340> right<00:03:01.370> here<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.240> go

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
I'll finish this all right here we go

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.150 
I'll finish this all right here we go
here's<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.900> wide<00:03:03.140> shot<00:03:03.530> although<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:04.010> wide

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
here's a wide shot although the wide

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.030 
here's a wide shot although the wide
shot<00:03:04.400> doesn't<00:03:04.730> really<00:03:05.000> give<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:06.310> good<00:03:09.040> idea

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
shot doesn't really give you a good idea

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.580 
shot doesn't really give you a good idea
so<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.940> can<00:03:11.600> get<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.900> little<00:03:12.020> closer<00:03:12.260> but

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
so you can get in a little closer but

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.960 
so you can get in a little closer but
that's<00:03:13.580> uh<00:03:14.030> that's<00:03:14.840> basically<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:15.970> you

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
that's uh that's basically it so you

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.340 
that's uh that's basically it so you
just<00:03:17.000> run<00:03:17.390> them<00:03:17.480> through<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:18.290> see

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
just run them through and you can see

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.740 
just run them through and you can see
that<00:03:18.680> there's<00:03:18.950> B<00:03:19.190> goes<00:03:20.060> from<00:03:20.239> one<00:03:20.420> hook<00:03:20.600> to

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
that there's B goes from one hook to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.199 
that there's B goes from one hook to
that<00:03:20.930> hook<00:03:21.110> all<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.440> way<00:03:21.709> across<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.430> so

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
that hook all the way across and so

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.260 
that hook all the way across and so
forth<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.569> off<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:24.739> forth<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.910> can<00:03:26.060> kind

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
forth it's off so forth and you can kind

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.590 
forth it's off so forth and you can kind
of<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:27.020> know<00:03:27.310> loop<00:03:28.310> them<00:03:28.520> through<00:03:28.820> one<00:03:29.120> by<00:03:29.300> one

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
of you know loop them through one by one

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.240 
of you know loop them through one by one
if<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:29.900> want<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.230> or<00:03:30.410> skip<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.860> couple<00:03:31.040> I

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
if you want to or skip a couple I

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.660 
if you want to or skip a couple I
skipped<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.150> couple<00:03:32.300> sometimes<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:34.580> know

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
skipped a couple sometimes and you know

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.190 
skipped a couple sometimes and you know
you<00:03:34.730> don't<00:03:35.209> even<00:03:35.300> really<00:03:35.570> have<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.810> loop<00:03:36.080> them

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
you don't even really have to loop them

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.360 
you don't even really have to loop them
through<00:03:36.410> if<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.560> don't<00:03:36.739> want<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.010> I'm<00:03:37.190> just

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
through if you don't want to I'm just

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.400 
through if you don't want to I'm just
you<00:03:38.330> know<00:03:38.420> if<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.690> do<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.959> would<00:03:39.110> make<00:03:39.380> sure

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.440 
the stringing of the trellis and
I<00:03:51.470> look<00:03:52.160> forward<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.460> talking<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.300> you<00:03:53.360> guys
