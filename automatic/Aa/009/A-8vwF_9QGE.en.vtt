kind of clueless on what you guys are
liking<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.109> guys<00:00:28.289> aren't<00:00:29.189> really

caring<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.890> in<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.070> tutorial<00:00:32.780> little

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
caring for so in this tutorial little

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.869 
caring for so in this tutorial little
simple<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.840> hard<00:00:36.840> or

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
simple one but it can be hard or

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
simple one but it can be hard or
confusing<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.030> begin<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.140> how<00:00:40.980> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
confusing to begin and that is how to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.869 
confusing to begin and that is how to
make<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.640> rubberband<00:00:42.420> ball<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:43.700> just<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
make a rubberband ball now just to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.689 
make a rubberband ball now just to
compare<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:48.800> CD<00:00:49.800> here<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:52.460> here's<00:00:53.460> my

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
compare I have a CD here and here's my

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.619 
compare I have a CD here and here's my
CD<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.500> as<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> pretty<00:00:57.270> big

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
CD and as you see it is a pretty big

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.610 
CD and as you see it is a pretty big
rubber<00:00:57.960> band<00:00:58.289> ball<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.600> one<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.050> I

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
rubber band ball and I have one here I

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500 
rubber band ball and I have one here I
have<00:01:02.370> another<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.940> that's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.210> little<00:01:03.390> bit

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
have another one that's a little bit

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.620 
have another one that's a little bit
smaller<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.220> reason<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.729> two<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:05.970> one

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
smaller and the reason I have two is one

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.190 
smaller and the reason I have two is one
isn't<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.700> legitimate<00:01:08.700> rubber<00:01:09.420> band<00:01:09.689> ball<00:01:09.990> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
isn't a legitimate rubber band ball it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
isn't a legitimate rubber band ball it
wasn't<00:01:10.619> started<00:01:10.920> properly<00:01:11.310> some<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
wasn't started properly some in the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.580 
wasn't started properly some in the
process<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:13.650> transferring<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.590> so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
process of transferring these to this so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.520 
process of transferring these to this so
um<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.700> started<00:01:18.030> off<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.540> you're<00:01:19.200> gonna<00:01:19.290> do

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
um just started off all you're gonna do

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.109 
um just started off all you're gonna do
is<00:01:19.560> you're<00:01:19.920> gonna<00:01:19.979> need<00:01:20.100> some<00:01:20.610> rubber<00:01:20.850> bands

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
is you're gonna need some rubber bands

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
is you're gonna need some rubber bands
so<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.170> ahead<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.350> take<00:01:22.890> some

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
so I'm just gonna go ahead and take some

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.969 
so I'm just gonna go ahead and take some
off<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:27.439> process<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:29.070> be

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
off of this and this process can be

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.730 
off of this and this process can be
really<00:01:31.979> hard<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.790> confusing<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:34.020> some<00:01:34.320> points

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
really hard and confusing at some points

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.289 
really hard and confusing at some points
but<00:01:35.810> once<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.220> start<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.670> should<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.180> able

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
but once you start it you should be able

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.340 
but once you start it you should be able
to<00:01:40.369> do<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> lot<00:01:41.790> easier<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.600> let<00:01:43.079> me<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
to do it a lot easier so let me get a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.230 
to do it a lot easier so let me get a
couple<00:01:43.590> more<00:01:43.799> rubber<00:01:44.040> bands<00:01:44.310> off<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.820> you

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.350 

and<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:49.680> should<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.890> enough<00:01:50.009> alright<00:01:50.939> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and that should be enough alright so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.960 
and that should be enough alright so
what<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.750> gonna<00:01:51.810> want<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.970> you're

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
what you're gonna want to do is you're

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
what you're gonna want to do is you're
just<00:01:54.210> gonna<00:01:54.360> ball<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:55.229> some<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> these<00:01:55.799> rubber

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
just gonna ball up some of these rubber

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.200 
just gonna ball up some of these rubber
bands<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.170> then<00:01:58.170> you're<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.210> take

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
bands and then you're going to take

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.050 
bands and then you're going to take
another<00:02:00.600> rubber<00:02:01.350> band<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:04.670> yeah<00:02:05.670> what's<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
another rubber band and yeah what's the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.900 
another rubber band and yeah what's the
easiest<00:02:06.270> way<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.479> explain<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.789> were

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
easiest way to explain it it if you were

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
easiest way to explain it it if you were
to<00:02:08.970> loop<00:02:09.270> something<00:02:09.629> around<00:02:10.110> maybe<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to loop something around maybe like a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.750 
to loop something around maybe like a
deck<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.860> cards<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.940> were<00:02:12.000> to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
deck of cards if you were to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.790 
deck of cards if you were to
loop<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.510> rubber<00:02:13.599> band<00:02:14.080> around<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.440> deck<00:02:14.620> of

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
loop a rubber band around the deck of

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.080 
loop a rubber band around the deck of
cards<00:02:15.069> you<00:02:15.160> won't<00:02:15.340> just<00:02:15.489> put<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:15.879> this

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
cards you won't just put it like this

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.470 
cards you won't just put it like this
you<00:02:16.780> double<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:18.430> make<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.790> smaller<00:02:19.180> and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
you double it to make it smaller and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.100 
you double it to make it smaller and
tighter

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
tighter

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.449 
tighter
that's<00:02:20.500> essentially<00:02:20.860> what<00:02:21.129> you're<00:02:21.220> going<00:02:21.400> to

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
that's essentially what you're going to

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.650 
that's essentially what you're going to
do<00:02:21.550> except<00:02:21.879> you're<00:02:22.030> going<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> double<00:02:22.540> this

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
do except you're going to double this

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.750 
do except you're going to double this
around<00:02:23.129> four<00:02:24.129> times<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:26.680> you're<00:02:27.580> going

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
around four times and then you're going

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.900 
around four times and then you're going
to<00:02:27.940> put<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.390> around<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:29.530> tiny<00:02:30.840> blotted<00:02:31.840> up

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
to put it around this tiny blotted up

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.820 
to put it around this tiny blotted up
rubber<00:02:33.910> bands<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.599> if<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.900> too<00:02:35.140> small<00:02:35.440> you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
rubber bands and if it's too small you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.160 
rubber bands and if it's too small you
just<00:02:36.040> guard<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.489> twist<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.750> put<00:02:38.080> it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
just guard this twist it and put it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.800 
just guard this twist it and put it
around<00:02:38.260> again<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.010> then<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:40.299> should<00:02:40.599> hold

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
around again and then it should hold

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.039 
around again and then it should hold
together<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.349> little<00:02:41.769> bit<00:02:42.010> like<00:02:42.370> -<00:02:42.900> make<00:02:43.900> you

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
together a little bit like - make you

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.330 
together a little bit like - make you
see<00:02:44.200> how<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.379> holding<00:02:44.530> together<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.099> little

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
see how it's holding together a little

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.070 
see how it's holding together a little
bit<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.849> then<00:02:46.360> you're<00:02:46.540> just<00:02:46.720> gonna<00:02:46.840> take

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
bit and then you're just gonna take

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.270 
bit and then you're just gonna take
another<00:02:47.380> rubber<00:02:47.620> band<00:02:48.599> double<00:02:49.599> that<00:02:49.780> up<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
another rubber band double that up and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.759 
another rubber band double that up and
maybe<00:02:51.610> even<00:02:53.160> quad<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.400> again<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:55.650> put<00:02:56.650> it

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
maybe even quad it again and then put it

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.120 
maybe even quad it again and then put it
around<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.220> rubber<00:02:57.370> band<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.680> see<00:02:59.920> that

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
around the rubber band and you see that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.819 
around the rubber band and you see that
sort<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.390> being<00:03:01.780> grouped<00:03:02.170> together<00:03:02.380> and

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
sort of being grouped together and

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.440 
sort of being grouped together and
you're<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:02.950> gonna<00:03:03.160> do<00:03:03.519> that<00:03:03.549> as<00:03:03.880> much<00:03:04.120> as<00:03:04.299> you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
you're just gonna do that as much as you

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.300 
you're just gonna do that as much as you
can<00:03:04.660> until<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:08.110> starts<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.530> take<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.799> spherical

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
can until it starts to take a spherical

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.460 
can until it starts to take a spherical
shape<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.239> can<00:03:10.660> just<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:10.989> kind<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.260> push

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
shape and you can just like kind of push

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.870 
shape and you can just like kind of push
the<00:03:11.709> rubber<00:03:11.829> band<00:03:12.160> since<00:03:12.400> there's<00:03:12.579> not<00:03:12.730> that

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
the rubber band since there's not that

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.380 
the rubber band since there's not that
many<00:03:13.319> as<00:03:14.319> you're<00:03:14.769> going<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.579> mold<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.120> into<00:03:16.239> a

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
many as you're going to mold it into a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.410 
many as you're going to mold it into a
sphere<00:03:16.690> looking<00:03:17.380> shape<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.889> then<00:03:18.609> after<00:03:19.180> that

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
sphere looking shape and then after that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.110 
sphere looking shape and then after that
when<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.380> get<00:03:20.590> when<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.519> gets<00:03:21.700> bigger<00:03:21.970> and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
when you get when it gets bigger and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.870 
when you get when it gets bigger and
bigger<00:03:22.329> like<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.980> depending<00:03:23.980> on<00:03:24.310> how<00:03:24.489> big<00:03:24.730> it

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
bigger like this depending on how big it

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.910 
bigger like this depending on how big it
is<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.030> can<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:25.780> go<00:03:26.170> like<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.470> wrap<00:03:26.769> it

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
is you can just go like this and wrap it

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.879 
is you can just go like this and wrap it
around<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.310> leave<00:03:27.489> it<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:27.850> or<00:03:28.889> you're

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
around and leave it like that or you're

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.340 
around and leave it like that or you're
going<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.310> want<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.720> double<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.870> like<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:33.310> and

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
going to want to double it like this and

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.670 
going to want to double it like this and
then<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:37.150> don't<00:03:37.299> want<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.510> double<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.049> like<00:03:38.560> I

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
then you don't want to double it like I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.190 
then you don't want to double it like I
have<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:38.980> here<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.400> then<00:03:40.239> put<00:03:40.569> it<00:03:40.660> around<00:03:40.930> to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
have it here and then put it around to

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.590 
have it here and then put it around to
get<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.380> more<00:03:41.980> tighter<00:03:42.700> fit<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.239> don't<00:03:43.269> think

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
get a more tighter fit I don't think

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.509 
get a more tighter fit I don't think
this<00:03:43.750> will<00:03:43.930> go<00:03:44.079> around<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.889> just<00:03:45.220> snapped

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
this will go around it it just snapped

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.440 
this will go around it it just snapped
on<00:03:45.730> me<00:03:45.910> but<00:03:46.859> yeah<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.100> then<00:03:48.370> as<00:03:48.760> soon<00:03:49.030> as<00:03:49.180> you

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
on me but yeah and then as soon as you

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.920 
on me but yeah and then as soon as you
get<00:03:50.410> this<00:03:50.590> formed<00:03:51.010> in<00:03:51.160> as<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.400> ball<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:52.060> tight

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
get this formed in as a ball a tight

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.080 
get this formed in as a ball a tight
ball<00:03:53.170> then<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.100> can<00:03:54.220> just<00:03:54.400> keep<00:03:54.519> wrapping

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
ball then you can just keep wrapping

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.120 
ball then you can just keep wrapping
around<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.660> may<00:03:55.810> need<00:03:55.930> double<00:03:56.349> it<00:03:56.470> triple<00:03:56.769> it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
around you may need double it triple it

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.410 
around you may need double it triple it
but<00:03:57.660> yeah<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.720> just<00:03:58.900> keep<00:03:59.170> going<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.709> gets

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
but yeah you just keep going it gets

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.030 
but yeah you just keep going it gets
larger<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.810> larger<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.349> larger<00:04:02.380> and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
larger and larger and larger and

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.819 
larger and larger and larger and
eventually<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.930> may<00:04:05.049> have<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.380> biggest<00:04:05.680> in

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
eventually you may have the biggest in

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.720 
eventually you may have the biggest in
the<00:04:05.859> world<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:07.000> thanks<00:04:07.900> for<00:04:07.989> watching<00:04:08.700> be<00:04:09.700> sure
