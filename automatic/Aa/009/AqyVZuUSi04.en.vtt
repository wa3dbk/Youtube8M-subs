00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.790 
for a couple of reasons one its fun um
but<00:00:17.279> that's<00:00:17.430> just<00:00:17.580> me<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:18.840> making

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
but that's just me I really like making

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.429 
but that's just me I really like making
my<00:00:19.890> own<00:00:19.920> stuff<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.460> kitchen<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:21.380> keeping<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
my own stuff in the kitchen of keeping a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.810 
my own stuff in the kitchen of keeping a
house<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.949> all<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.220> kind<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.490> nonsense

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
house and all that kind of nonsense

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670 
house and all that kind of nonsense
method<00:00:24.480> i<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.750> i<00:00:24.930> don't<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.410> other<00:00:25.590> things

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
method i don't i don't do other things

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.700 
method i don't i don't do other things
but<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.090> me<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.539> fun<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:28.260> able<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
but to me it's just fun to be able to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.609 
but to me it's just fun to be able to
come<00:00:29.010> up<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.160> ways<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.880> things<00:00:30.060> myself

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
come up with ways to do things myself

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.860 
come up with ways to do things myself
the<00:00:31.619> second<00:00:31.920> benefit<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.660> it's<00:00:33.660> just

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the second benefit is that it's just

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.990 
the second benefit is that it's just
another<00:00:34.200> way<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.530> kind<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.010> cut<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.430> core<00:00:35.790> or

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
another way to kind of cut your core or

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.670 
another way to kind of cut your core or
the<00:00:36.090> commercial<00:00:36.630> food<00:00:36.840> system<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.559> we

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the commercial food system because we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.610 
the commercial food system because we
can<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.100> dependent<00:00:38.610> upon<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
can get really dependent upon that and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.290 
can get really dependent upon that and
sometimes<00:00:40.620> there's<00:00:40.890> no<00:00:41.010> reason<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.579> while

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
sometimes there's no reason for it while

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.020 
sometimes there's no reason for it while
sourdoughs<00:00:42.960> work<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.920> well<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.579> baking

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
sourdoughs work just as well for baking

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.119 
sourdoughs work just as well for baking
bread<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.629> biscuits<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.260> anything<00:00:46.590> else<00:00:46.710> as

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
bread and biscuits and anything else as

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.799 
bread and biscuits and anything else as
something<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> would<00:00:48.120> buy<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> store

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
something you would buy in the store

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.290 
something you would buy in the store
there<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.890> definitely<00:00:50.399> differences<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.180> if

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
there are definitely differences like if

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.410 
there are definitely differences like if
I'm<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> make<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.250> pastry<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.460> chocolate

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I'm going to make a pastry or chocolate

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.090 
I'm going to make a pastry or chocolate
babka<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.870> something<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.890> go

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
babka or something like that I will go

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
babka or something like that I will go
and<00:00:56.340> get<00:00:56.430> commercial<00:00:56.789> yeast<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.570> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and get commercial yeast because it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
and get commercial yeast because it's
more<00:00:57.899> consistent<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.430> nice

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
more consistent and that can be nice

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.939 
more consistent and that can be nice
sometimes<00:00:59.670> but<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.629> regular<00:01:01.230> bread<00:01:01.469> baking

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
sometimes but for regular bread baking

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.119 
sometimes but for regular bread baking
soft<00:01:02.219> pretzels<00:01:02.760> bagels<00:01:03.359> whatever<00:01:03.660> i<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.680> my
