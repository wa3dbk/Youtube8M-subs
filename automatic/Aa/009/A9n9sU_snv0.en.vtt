00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.160
 very good all welcome to the new 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.410
 skills one more day on my channel and sorry 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.969
 that inactivity but he had some 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.130
 complicated days of maxam in digital 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.620
 but well let's go to the middle and fast this 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.230
 a review I suppose super special for me 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.970
 francesco totti really software that 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.769
 I admire very much in real life has 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.480
 an and end I wanted to try it I wanted to bring 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.490
 you see him go see a little bit 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.410
 what are these that I have with the 6 matches 9 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.260
 goals is fucking mother has a price 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.670
 fucking mother and well there you see the team 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.640
 where you used it for me is the best 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 formation for toti is at 43 35 as 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.430
 false front not as false 9 goes very 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.160
 very very very well square is the water and 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 well one would be like that more and well let's 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.470
 see the stats in game of totti that are 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.740
 a bitch happened there let's see first 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.080
 those totti traits for real skate 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.940
 gunboat player franchise player 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.550
 team and distant shooter that stands out from 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.000
 all kind is that shot that power of 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.640
 shot seems brutal really brutal 5 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.470
 of bad leg 3 of fibers that have only 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.090
 uploaded you say 3 go fuck because the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.469
 last year I had 2 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.359
 for worse here as to what is the 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.590
 physical is a slow player I'm not going to 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:18.369
 cheat is slow 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.649
 totti is slow but there you see that 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.369
 shooting power that accuracy of lack 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.560
 the definition is the host and here already 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.600
 we start with the colors with the good 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.200
 there you see how relative a little bit with 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.050
 totti as well as dribbled or exaggerated 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 because it moves 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.890
 and good is that it is a bit can be 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.510
 do too much with three in filigree 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.530
 You can honestly alter such 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.570
 It is not a game he knows 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.520
 specifically to portray more for 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.130
 that tottil is not a shearing and never what 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.930
 is going to be that is obvious remember this 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.180
 first place I liked quite the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.550
 ball control that has how it moves 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.220
 it's slow but certain agility for that 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.320
 40 rhythm they say oysters that slow and 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.150
 I do not know the truth this goal is a little bit 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.580
 most regrettable is a point the rebound 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.440
 but for you to see how it defines me they take 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.960
 which one collects with the right those 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.590
 five bad leg well powerful positions 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:21.030
 five really it's five and I do 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.710
 you can play the fifa if we do not 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.480
 the slow players despair if not 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.700
 you are going to run 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.350
 really and that they are of recommendations 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.120
 that you try to fix here in this 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.460
 connectivity that volley look at what 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.530
 preciousness 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.530
 and I am beard makes it less not 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.540
 and it was that I entered all 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.720
 note that aesthetics is how it takes off 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.519
 as the cross really enjoyed it a lot 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.050
 playing with all kinds is for is like 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.870
 play with a legend do not look like 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.660
 play a classic maybe it's your last 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.250
 year I believe and here what I like the most 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.250
 of the tour and you are going to see a few 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.739
 every lack was a real candy 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.620
 every foul was for me half goal with your 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.540
 money this is one of the faults that most 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.459
 It's hard for me to put this year that is 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.950
 power simply above the water 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.690
 reality and how much do you have I did not have any 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.209
 problem and see how the inside 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.010
 how nice he hit it by zero impossible 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.590
 impossible you see 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.600
 the holy barrier jumps and what follows 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.110
 saying 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.150
 I insist you can try this 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.950
 if my opponent is seeing me sorry for 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.750
 this is to say is a player who deserves 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.640
 very much, it seems very, very 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.010
 fun and especially in different 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.630
 flat what are you going to find I do not no 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.400
 not at least he has never confronted me 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.800
 the entrance these days and what they have 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.260
 kicked out and that's why it's so cheap 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.020
 the last year the totti wafer varies but 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.020
 set to system please 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.140
 look what effect was stuck with the left 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.550
 with the third pitcher but yes that is 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:15.700
 very for unstoppable look is another way 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.620
 If I'm in love, it's just that 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.090
 justito and pegadito del palo is a foul 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.130
 Far distant enough 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.690
 and that a simple penalty has everything 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.139
 penalty of the host and 93-94 and here another 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.139
 Need more 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.880
 three faults are plugged in and three faults are 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.370
 with totti and this one 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.470
 this is not left behind once again with 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.360
 that third pitcher in addition to the same 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.280
 rival if I do it again I do not go back 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.240
 between exactly is not the same goal 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.800
 but yes the same technique there you see it 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.870
 as the third pitcher that if you do not know 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.350
 how a tutorial is handled is the 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.240
 effect of roberto carlos and look for 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.610
 inside the barrier and how is it going 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.130
 opening perhaps Alicante a little more 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.680
 the doorman can be can be do not say 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.830
 that does not but still does not seem like a 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.320
 authentic golazo and the last of the 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.360
 goals and to convince them to try 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.010
 this fact against me friend panzares of 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.640
 there I am seeing it with supposed equipment 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.260
 with the shield of the lion to fix then 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.390
 to set the toti please set the 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.390
 madness this gesture again so much zero 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.130
 with the left foot with the left foot with the leg 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.170
 bad in theory because I already say to the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:36.270
 bad leg is nothing is the whore 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:39.870
 justice and holy golazo holy arm 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.460
 I liked a lot of touch and in summary it's not 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.490
 a competitive player is not a 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.350
 practical player but he is a player 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.210
 which is very fun to use that is a 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.580
 legend fuck that is francesco totti that 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.630
 is the boy in love with Rome and what if 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.630
 you can buy it
