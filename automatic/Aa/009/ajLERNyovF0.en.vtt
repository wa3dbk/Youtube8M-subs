00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
hard is that just got to make it so they

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060 
hard is that just got to make it so they
act<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> path<00:00:43.020> fighting<00:00:43.469> acts<00:00:43.739> like

week<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.960> tweet<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:46.800> anything<00:00:47.039> about

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
week a tweet I don't know anything about

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.010 
week a tweet I don't know anything about
coding<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.210> thought<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:48.960> be

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
coding but I thought that would be

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.860 
coding but I thought that would be
pretty<00:00:49.260> easy<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.190> don't<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:51.629> kind

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
pretty easy but I don't know that's kind

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.020 
pretty easy but I don't know that's kind
of<00:00:51.899> disappointing<00:00:53.780> no<00:00:54.780> caves<00:00:55.489> no<00:00:56.489> plans<00:00:56.850> for

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
of disappointing no caves no plans for

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.000 
of disappointing no caves no plans for
them<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> mod<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.829> very

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
them there is a mod but it's not very

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.209 
them there is a mod but it's not very
good<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.789> only<00:01:00.030> spawns<00:01:00.390> caves<00:01:00.809> above<00:01:01.140> level<00:01:01.590> 63

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
good it only spawns caves above level 63

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.070 
good it only spawns caves above level 63
so<00:01:02.730> that's<00:01:02.910> only<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.239> mountains<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.930> not

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
so that's only in mountains so it's not

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100 
so that's only in mountains so it's not
that<00:01:04.140> good<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.549> maybe<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.479> from<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that good but so maybe but from that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.420 
that good but so maybe but from that
looks<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:07.860> won't<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.390> um<00:01:09.560> la<00:01:10.560> seconde

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
looks like there won't be um la seconde

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.600 
looks like there won't be um la seconde
last<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:13.500> guy's<00:01:13.710> asking<00:01:13.890> about<00:01:14.430> all

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
last one is this guy's asking about all

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.340 
last one is this guy's asking about all
the<00:01:14.700> performance<00:01:15.210> issues<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.780> they're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the performance issues will they're

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
the performance issues will they're
stopping<00:01:16.740> updates<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.580> he<00:01:18.090> says<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.330> think

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
stopping updates and he says I think

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.660 
stopping updates and he says I think
it's<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:18.900> probably<00:01:19.439> it'll<00:01:19.619> evolve<00:01:20.159> more

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it's more probably it'll evolve more

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.340 
it's more probably it'll evolve more
away<00:01:20.909> from<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> regular<00:01:21.360> minecraft<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> will

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
excited about that because is it if it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.819 
excited about that because is it if it
goes<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> little<00:01:29.610> bit<00:01:30.020> off<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> beaten<00:01:31.350> trail

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
goes a little bit off the beaten trail

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.580 
goes a little bit off the beaten trail
of<00:01:32.100> Minecraft<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.240> too<00:01:33.479> much<00:01:33.590> it'll

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
