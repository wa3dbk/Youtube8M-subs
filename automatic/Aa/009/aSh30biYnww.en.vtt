00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello girls welcome today I bring you 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.520
 this makeup inspired by this 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.139
 beautiful woman was shaking and so this 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.300
 Makeup he used in his latest video 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.250
 like you there are not two I hope you like it 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.929
 to all of you and this video is dedicated 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.929
 especially for my cousin of mine 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.170
 let's start by passing a fixative 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.750
 of shadow all over our eyelid now 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.460
 I am going to use this nickel palette 1 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.960
 if you did not have this I'm going to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.810
 use any other that is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.369
 look and well girls where are you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.290
 complicate because I do not know what 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.199
 that really the makeup used from 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.720
 italy good let's start happening 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.370
 a very light brownish tone all over 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.160
 our basin and we're going to blur it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.710
 after that we will go with a color 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.320
 darker than it would be now this little black 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.010
 that has some flashes and we're going to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.379
 mark our entire basin 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.910
 and this we will do with a brochita 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.640
 very small angular 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.739
 and that's how a gradient is formed in 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.879
 our eyes concentrating more the color 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.879
 on the outer edge 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.670
 i 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.510
 Now we are going to apply for our 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.190
 mobile eyelid a tonality copper this 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.860
 it's a satiny shadow we find it 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.780
 also in the palette so we're going to 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.780
 apply it with a flat brush 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.670
 now girls this color is not found 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.280
 in the palette and so I'm using 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.120
 a vanilla color for the lower part of 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.120
 our eyebrows 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.750
 Now let's moisten our brush and 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.780
 we are going to put limits in all our 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.220
 mobile eyelid we are using one that 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.190
 is of the brand and its a key 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.270
 Now we are going to delineate 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.150
 to do an outline 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.780
 very classic and we are using gel 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.780
 for this 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 now we are going to apply false eyelashes 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.790
 I saw that in the video she is 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.920
 using very dramatic and beautiful 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.110
 so I'm applying these from the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.880
 mark fed up in a lazio I'm also going to 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.370
 clarify the water line a little 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.989
 using a vanilla color then we're going 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.510
 to offer a little bit to our body 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.459
 lower a brown hue and then 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.590
 very close to our eyelashes we are going to 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.590
 put a little black shadow 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.270
 let's also give a little light 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.220
 using a pearlite shade that 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.020
 find in the same palette simply 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.610
 in the animal's area and then to 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.950
 finish with our eyes we are going to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.640
 use mascara for the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.640
 lower part 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.800
 for the lips I'm going to use this one 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.220
 the city colors brand is a very pink 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.530
 strong and then we're also going to give it 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.989
 a few strokes of brightness since in the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.819
 video already shows his lips very very 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.070
 juicy so I'm using 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.810
 El Secreto de Victoria 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.370
 and so ends our what the day of 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.650
