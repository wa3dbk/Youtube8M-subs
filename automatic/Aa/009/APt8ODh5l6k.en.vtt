the play map feature does it's a pretty
cool<00:02:17.730> feature<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.510> want<00:02:18.690> to

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
cool feature if you just want to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.020 
cool feature if you just want to
practice<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.260> specific<00:02:19.769> hole<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.459> know

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
practice a specific hole and you know

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.430 
practice a specific hole and you know
maybe<00:02:21.239> increase<00:02:21.600> some<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.989> your<00:02:22.080> scores

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
maybe increase some of your scores

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.620 
maybe increase some of your scores
although<00:02:23.250> once<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.549> get<00:02:23.700> all<00:02:23.880> golds<00:02:24.420> and

although once you get all golds and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.390 
although once you get all golds and
that's<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.260> pretty<00:02:25.470> much<00:02:25.680> no<00:02:25.830> reason<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.250> do

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
that's just pretty much no reason to do

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.729 
that's just pretty much no reason to do
that<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.850> still<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.989> have<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.380> if<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.590> want

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.970 

what<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.739> giant<00:02:52.550> mechanical<00:02:52.849> ddd<00:02:53.680> that's<00:02:54.680> not

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
what a giant mechanical ddd that's not

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.380 
what a giant mechanical ddd that's not
right<00:02:57.400> basically<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.640> what<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.120> final

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
right basically this is what the final

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.680 
right basically this is what the final
boss<00:02:59.629> of<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.959> game<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:01.690> keep

hitting ddd with down shots and ground

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.229 
hitting ddd with down shots and ground
shots<00:03:05.239> that's<00:03:05.540> really<00:03:05.840> all<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.970> also

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
shots that's really all this is you also

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.339 
shots that's really all this is you also
want<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.480> watch<00:03:08.599> out<00:03:08.810> for<00:03:09.019> those<00:03:09.110> little

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.890 
want to watch out for those little
miniature<00:03:10.160> dvds<00:03:10.640> because<00:03:11.090> they<00:03:11.269> can<00:03:11.540> coach

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
miniature dvds because they can coach

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.009 
miniature dvds because they can coach
you<00:03:15.280> yeah<00:03:16.280> that's<00:03:16.489> basically<00:03:16.670> all<00:03:17.060> there<00:03:17.209> all

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
you yeah that's basically all there all

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.380 
you yeah that's basically all there all
this<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.799> i<00:03:19.700> believe<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.180> difference

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
this is and i believe the difference

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.559 
this is and i believe the difference
between<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.530> extra<00:03:21.950> course<00:03:22.220> ddd<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.269> the

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
between the extra course ddd and the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.830 
between the extra course ddd and the
normal<00:03:24.079> course<00:03:24.319> DVD<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:25.190> an<00:03:26.000> extra<00:03:26.450> mode<00:03:26.630> he

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
normal course DVD is an extra mode he

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.229 
normal course DVD is an extra mode he
takes<00:03:27.079> a<00:03:27.200> lot<00:03:27.380> more<00:03:27.410> hits<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.700> he's<00:03:28.849> also<00:03:29.060> a

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
takes a lot more hits and he's also a

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.509 
takes a lot more hits and he's also a
lot<00:03:29.480> faster<00:03:29.720> but<00:03:30.319> otherwise<00:03:30.560> that's<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.190> only

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
lot faster but otherwise that's the only

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.449 
lot faster but otherwise that's the only
difference<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.349> you<00:03:33.349> can<00:03:33.500> pretty<00:03:33.709> much<00:03:33.829> beat

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
difference so you can pretty much beat

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.940 
difference so you can pretty much beat
this<00:03:34.700> on<00:03:34.940> either<00:03:35.329> difficulty<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.709> want<00:03:36.860> to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
this on either difficulty you want to

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.250 
this on either difficulty you want to
actually<00:03:37.040> beat<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.549> game<00:03:37.879> so<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.840> know<00:03:38.959> since

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
actually beat the game so you know since

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.119 
actually beat the game so you know since
I<00:03:39.440> took<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.310> time<00:03:40.730> actually<00:03:41.090> do<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.629> entire

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
I took the time actually do the entire

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.309 
I took the time actually do the entire
project<00:03:43.150> even<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.299> extra<00:03:44.599> horses<00:03:44.959> have<00:03:45.170> made

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
project even the extra horses have made

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.069 
project even the extra horses have made
more<00:03:45.500> sense<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:46.129> beat<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.239> harder<00:03:47.660> version<00:03:47.690> I

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
more sense to beat the harder version I

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:55.470 
more sense to beat the harder version I
ddd<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.099> that<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.459> exactly<00:03:49.730> what<00:03:50.000> I'm<00:03:50.120> doing

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.000 

and<00:03:56.480> yeah<00:03:56.659> I<00:03:56.719> basically<00:03:56.959> keep<00:03:57.349> doing<00:03:57.889> this

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
and yeah I basically keep doing this

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.580 
and yeah I basically keep doing this
until<00:03:58.069> he<00:03:58.459> dies<00:03:58.670> or<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.629> run<00:04:00.560> out<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.739> one<00:04:00.980> ups

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
until he dies or you run out of one ups

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.839 
until he dies or you run out of one ups
stupid<00:04:03.590> mint<00:04:03.769> repeated<00:04:04.249> he<00:04:04.340> got<00:04:04.519> me<00:04:04.670> right

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
stupid mint repeated he got me right

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.490 
stupid mint repeated he got me right
there<00:04:07.180> he<00:04:08.180> better<00:04:08.569> not<00:04:08.719> get<00:04:08.930> used<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.290> winning

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
there he better not get used to winning

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.920 
there he better not get used to winning
because<00:04:09.769> he's<00:04:10.069> not<00:04:10.340> gonna<00:04:10.549> love<00:04:10.790> us<00:04:10.969> because

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
because he's not gonna love us because

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.819 
because he's not gonna love us because
he<00:04:12.349> is<00:04:12.469> gone<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.430> game<00:04:13.639> is<00:04:14.030> over<00:04:17.829> haha

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
he is gone and the game is over haha

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.430 
he is gone and the game is over haha
take<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:20.079> hey<00:04:21.079> run<00:04:21.440> away<00:04:22.990> no<00:04:23.990> but<00:04:24.169> he's<00:04:24.259> still

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
take that hey run away no but he's still

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.830 
take that hey run away no but he's still
exploded<00:04:25.599> so<00:04:26.599> I<00:04:26.630> guess<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:27.169> doesn't<00:04:27.410> matter

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
exploded so I guess it doesn't matter

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.070 
exploded so I guess it doesn't matter
and<00:04:30.280> here<00:04:31.280> is<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.580> credit<00:04:31.910> sequence<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.630> this

constellations in the sky which is

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.890 
constellations in the sky which is
pretty<00:04:39.830> cool<00:04:40.449> that<00:04:41.449> was<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.599> hammer<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:44.360> we'll

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
pretty cool that was a hammer and we'll

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.600 
pretty cool that was a hammer and we'll
see<00:04:45.020> gonna<00:04:45.139> build<00:04:45.440> next<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.130> kind<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.430> figure

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
see gonna build next and kind of figure

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.370 
see gonna build next and kind of figure
it<00:04:46.820> out<00:04:46.940> if<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.150> look<00:04:47.300> carefully<00:04:47.599> at<00:04:48.020> some<00:04:48.229> of

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
it out if you look carefully at some of

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.430 
it out if you look carefully at some of
them<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:48.680> not<00:04:49.300> all<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.660> time<00:04:50.840> this<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.139> like<00:04:51.410> a

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
them but not all the time this is like a

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.920 
them but not all the time this is like a
maximum<00:04:51.830> tomato<00:04:52.250> or<00:04:52.750> just<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.810> normal<00:04:54.020> tomato

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
maximum tomato or just a normal tomato

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.450 
maximum tomato or just a normal tomato
any<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.050> guess<00:04:57.349> while<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.800> going<00:04:57.860> on<00:04:58.220> I'll

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
any I guess while this is going on I'll

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.189 
any I guess while this is going on I'll
just<00:04:58.699> you<00:04:59.060> know<00:04:59.210> give<00:04:59.509> my<00:04:59.659> thoughts<00:04:59.870> about

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
just you know give my thoughts about

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.070 
just you know give my thoughts about
this<00:05:00.380> project<00:05:01.599> overall<00:05:02.599> I<00:05:02.750> thought<00:05:02.930> this

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
this project overall I thought this

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.450 
this project overall I thought this
project<00:05:03.560> went<00:05:03.710> very<00:05:03.919> well<00:05:04.039> I<00:05:06.039> probably<00:05:07.039> bit

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
project went very well I probably bit

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.040 
project went very well I probably bit
off<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.639> little<00:05:07.789> more<00:05:08.030> than<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.389> could<00:05:08.449> chew<00:05:08.570> by

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
off a little more than I could chew by

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.779 
off a little more than I could chew by
playing<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.500> extra<00:05:09.860> courses<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:10.310> hadn't<00:05:10.639> had

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
playing the extra courses I hadn't had

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.480 
playing the extra courses I hadn't had
much<00:05:11.030> practice<00:05:11.330> with<00:05:11.720> those<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.259> a<00:05:13.130> few<00:05:13.370> of

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
much practice with those and a few of

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.810 
much practice with those and a few of
them<00:05:13.610> actually<00:05:13.789> kicked<00:05:14.360> my<00:05:14.539> butt<00:05:14.780> pretty<00:05:15.139> hard

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
them actually kicked my butt pretty hard

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.409 
them actually kicked my butt pretty hard
but<00:05:16.820> I<00:05:17.150> got<00:05:17.720> through<00:05:17.930> them<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:20.270> know<00:05:20.389> i

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
but I got through them and you know i

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.140 
but I got through them and you know i
don't<00:05:20.630> think<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.680> videos<00:05:22.009> were<00:05:22.310> that<00:05:22.669> like

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
don't think the videos were that like

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.029 
don't think the videos were that like
slow<00:05:23.509> paced<00:05:23.840> or<00:05:24.050> anything<00:05:24.440> i<00:05:24.680> mean<00:05:24.889> i<00:05:24.979> know

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
slow paced or anything i mean i know

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.879 
slow paced or anything i mean i know
some<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.400> them<00:05:25.580> were<00:05:25.820> but<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:27.590> know<00:05:27.710> that's

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
some of them were but you know that's

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.710 
some of them were but you know that's
the<00:05:28.009> kind<00:05:28.220> of<00:05:28.280> game<00:05:28.490> this<00:05:28.759> is<00:05:29.000> you<00:05:29.389> can't

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
the most part of this project went very

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.170

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.050 
thankfully there's not another game like
this<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:44.949> I<00:05:44.979> won't<00:05:45.190> have<00:05:45.280> to<00:05:45.400> do<00:05:45.699> this<00:05:45.850> again
