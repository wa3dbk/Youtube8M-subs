know I enjoyed the length that I was
achieving<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:48.149> gonna<00:00:48.360> say<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.980> 99%<00:00:49.980> of

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
achieving but I'm gonna say about 99% of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
achieving but I'm gonna say about 99% of
the<00:00:50.160> time<00:00:50.340> my<00:00:50.550> hair<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.879> tucked<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.570> ends

were completely tucked up and away and
it<00:00:54.780> paid<00:00:55.110> off<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.649> my<00:00:55.949> hair<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.280> way<00:00:56.670> down

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

can see how much growth I've gotten from
2010<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.250> present<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.820> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
2010 and then this is present this is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.950 
2010 and then this is present this is
2013<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:20.130> hair<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.369> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.659> kind<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
2013 and my hair is kind of it's kind of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.980 
2013 and my hair is kind of it's kind of
damp<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.770> started<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> UM<00:01:23.990> shrink

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
damp there so it's started to UM shrink

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.140 
damp there so it's started to UM shrink
because<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> lot<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> shrinkage<00:01:26.460> but

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
because I do get a lot of shrinkage but

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030 
because I do get a lot of shrinkage but
if<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> pulled<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> little

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
if you pulled it down it was a little

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.730 
if you pulled it down it was a little
past<00:01:29.220> waist<00:01:29.579> length<00:01:29.939> actually<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.380> next

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
past waist length actually and this next

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.640 
past waist length actually and this next
shot<00:01:31.920> coming<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.520> um<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> blowout<00:01:34.020> along

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
shot coming up um it was a blowout along

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.399 
shot coming up um it was a blowout along
the<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.189> wanted<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the way I just wanted to I think that

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
the way I just wanted to I think that
was<00:01:37.560> probably<00:01:37.740> about<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.189> year<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> half<00:01:38.970> ago

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
was probably about a year and a half ago

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.080 
was probably about a year and a half ago
and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.680> want<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.009> where<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.880> as

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and I just want to see where I was as

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.399 
and I just want to see where I was as
far<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.360> length<00:01:42.570> goes<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.290> quite

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
far as length goes and I was quite

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.109 
far as length goes and I was quite
surprised<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.189> almost<00:01:44.460> two<00:01:44.939> waist

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
surprised that it was almost two waist

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.800 
surprised that it was almost two waist
length<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.369> shot<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
length and then this shot here is I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
length and then this shot here is I
would<00:01:48.930> wear<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> lot<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.680> twists<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.939> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
would wear a lot of twists and if I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.399 
would wear a lot of twists and if I
wasn't<00:01:51.210> wearing<00:01:51.420> twists<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.200> wearing

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.900 
and looks like it it's about the same
length<00:02:30.080> maybe<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.440> little<00:02:30.530> bit<00:02:30.709> longer<00:02:30.920> but

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
length maybe a little bit longer but

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.120 
length maybe a little bit longer but
that<00:02:32.660> was<00:02:32.810> my<00:02:32.959> progress<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.680> last<00:02:33.860> three
