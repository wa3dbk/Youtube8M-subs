00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.560
 and welcome to one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 new cultivation xing video from the test winner de 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.549
 This time we are still right 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.350
 exciting device namely the itv or 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:19.160
 the htw of the company elgato and so on 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.780
 you can on his smartphone or 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.770
 watch tv and like that 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.310
 that works , let's see 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.920
 at times 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.430
 this is a mobile tv hotspot 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.600
 has integrated a wifi module and so 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.279
 you can connect to the smartphone 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.230
 build and then Freeview tv 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.129
 Now let's see what's inside 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.960
 the pack is looking and maybe 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.149
 short times grab the before because here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.399
 you can already see the first special feature 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.530
 here on ipad iphone android that stands 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.539
 basically means you should go up 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.850
 tablets or smartphones from apple or 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.909
 with an android operating system that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.409
 can watch television sometimes the 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.229
 look at the pack on the other side 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.210
 then we do not see support here 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:01.819
 equipment and then the whole thing is already 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.229
 not so impressive ios off 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.540
 16.1.2009 is relative 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.870
 the selection relatively limited we have 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.170
 the amazon kindle fire from google that 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.360
 nexus four the nexus 7 the target htc that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.260
 htc evo ix and from samsung the galaxy 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.490
 note 2 s2 s3 s4 and tab 2 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.590
 there are a lot of things left over 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 android users outside so everything so 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.150
 the users or something works there 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.770
 that's not the whole thing then 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.970
 who once has the equipment can 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 really looking forward to a very nice 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.520
 ketchup friends 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.760
 Now let's have a look at something 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.760
 pack open up 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.750
 quite as full as wonderful here 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:53.200
 small carton and open we have 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.390
 once dancing and advertising against him 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.670
 just you make even a video capture 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.480
 Devices lady that advertising for is now 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:06.460
 first unimportant as we have the 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.270
 the module the look and later 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.370
 take a closer look 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.620
 you sit here to have the pack 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.900
 we also have a parabolic antenna at that time 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.870
 equal again later here we have a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.680
 micro usb cables in the first place there 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.330
 to charge the team the power supply 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.390
 lacks probably the most 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.090
 at home as I said only in may 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.440
 primarily about the device charge 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.360
 he says with integrated battery of the hero 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.600
 so up to four hours so for 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.510
 train rides but actually sufficient 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.630
 if they are not too long 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.180
 what have and we have the bar 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.950
 Nice if you are in the first place right now 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.510
 line for binding areas or 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.060
 deep drive with him not quite as good 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.880
 it can only be a rod antenna, the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.830
 parabolic antenna is then rather for lead 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.090
 understandable areas of metropolitan areas 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.940
 or dvb t reception is better then 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.500
 we have a stand here exactly 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.040
 and more is no longer in the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.010
 pack 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.600
 Here are some hints 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.400
 Here's what gets all this can one of 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.970
 switch and how to do the whole in 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.970
 operation takes 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.900
 so we have the equipment out here 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.319
 switch so then you can see here 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.569
 Here is the battery ad we have 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.599
 here a mtx connection for the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.250
 antennas and down here one 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.239
 micro-usb connection to the device 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.680
 to charge and search that was it first 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.379
 to grow what's in the pack 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.970
 and then we take a break and 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.840
 then connect via the device link 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.670
 We'll have it again and again 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.220
 and now let's take a closer look 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.790
 like the wonderful piece of technology 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.590
 First of all you have to work 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.250
 download an app and that 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.569
 who have already done the iwf 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.599
 that is a prerequisite then you need 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.799
 no more internet and land I take 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.939
 then you connect the ipad directly with 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.049
 the ip and that works 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.239
 like this we have the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.769
 settings so we have every ipad 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.710
 the new ipad mini with retina display 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.979
 mentioned it first without problems 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.240
 We now here under wlan go 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.710
 Of course not because it's not 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.710
 you should do that beforehand 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.470
 exactly as you can see now find it here 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:50.139
 instantly www and connect 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.030
 hopefully that went 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.090
 without any problems it is really total 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.439
 the connection works absolutely 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.870
 really really without real 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:01.779
 at least here and now 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.090
 Let's start with tv again and it 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:06.819
 I can see him here 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.319
 first the whole program at the 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.610
 about the first with commissioning so 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.789
 that as we tried the first time 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.999
 have made first channel search in 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:20.349
 We found 24 stations in munich 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:21.550
 so now let's have a look 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.650
 here about different possibilities 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.300
 watch a live tv movie archive 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.379
 you can also record 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.500
 programs epg different transmitters what 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:34.210
 everything will come in the next few weeks and 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.439
 different and settings here to 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.360
 For example synonymous timeshift a very 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.669
 nice function means you can 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.840
 Stop the TV picture and take some time 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.409
 take a long break and later again 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.360
 take up 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.930
 to give a small conclusion is really 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.949
 a nice device just when you 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.360
 maybe no tv has so 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.509
 what only his tablet can do then 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.129
 that really likes to lay that down 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.870
 single small criticism that just 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:57.759
 not quite as many devices 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.169
 are compatible but if you directly it 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.629
 Compatible is the whole function 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.300
 absolutely smooth and really does 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.500
 fun yes that's it, I hope you a 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.389
 a bit of fun a little video 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.189
 if you liked it then you should
