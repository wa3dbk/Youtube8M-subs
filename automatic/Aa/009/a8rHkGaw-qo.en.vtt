you can't get folate into your brain

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.280 
you can't get folate into your brain
unless<00:03:37.610> it's<00:03:38.000> methylated<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> won't<00:03:38.990> cross

unless it's methylated it won't cross

the blood-brain barrier so it won't do

the blood-brain barrier so it won't do
your<00:03:41.780> brain<00:03:42.080> any<00:03:42.350> good

your brain any good
it<00:03:43.400> won't<00:03:43.610> help<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:43.940> make<00:03:44.180> the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
it won't help you make the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.390 
it won't help you make the
neurotransmitters<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.320> you<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.250> you

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
neurotransmitters that you you that you

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.520 
neurotransmitters that you you that you
need<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.420> serotonin<00:03:48.410> and

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
need that is serotonin and

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.430 
need that is serotonin and
norepinephrine<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:49.550> dopamine<00:03:50.260> unless<00:03:51.260> it

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
can cross into the blood-brain barrier

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.589 
can cross into the blood-brain barrier
so<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.880> an<00:03:56.030> exciting<00:03:56.950> idea
