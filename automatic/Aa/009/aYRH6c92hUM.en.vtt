00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 play a crash crash you will be 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.240
 get in the first stick the ball enters 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.940
 and the 10 after lucas ischuk with some 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.719
 complications can not stop it from well 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 right when you want to put the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.340
 zurdazo almost steals the villa team 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.990
 ramallo that in this some archer 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.250
 surely after I had 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.609
 practically a new mistake 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.340
 but he managed to solve it to the last 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.619
 instantly but after doing it is possible 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.720
 find the goals and especially the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.609
 answers from your archer in this too 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.610
 he almost messed up but then he was going to have 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.100
 two very important saves at closing 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.360
 of this first part here the goal in 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 frank but he got it right that he hits 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.860
 outside of the area with left-handed puts it together 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.520
 a stick to celebrate the number 8 of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.160
 Cáceres look how good it is that the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.739
 hooked as we said frank think 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.870
 like to put in that moment the one to 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.530
 one and workshops when they attack you do is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.329
 can really make you generate many 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.960
 problems and that's what he did in this 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.690
 match 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.850
 for tireless right is also true 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.470
 arrived at the 2 to 1 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.910
 of palito ortega 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.920
 thus workshops gave it back 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.390
 exactly how good this is that the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.430
 kids can play and do not mind 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.110
 because it did not weigh Pablo Pablo Ortega 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.700
 that the player started doing his 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.860
 first weapons in the last tournament in a 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.140
 Cáceres that was quite complicated 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.670
 began to be his first weapons and today in 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.680
 day was a starter and it did not weigh them at all 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.230
 here what we said lucas ischuk that the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.070
 practically spider the ball look 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.200
 with the top of touching the ball 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.649
 boroughs closed 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.659
 look at this beraldi madness how many times 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.060
 beraldi bait pressing so up is 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.219
 impressive the lungs of víctor that 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.380
 achieved that situation that clearly 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.789
 sent by the workshop technician to do 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.500
 this because now he does not give 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.600
 physically to calero you will see that it is 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.939
 press is in open stream and is 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.740
 I found it the truth that is the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.590
 I butted my hand that said no 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.770
 I had a clear professional intention 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.719
 exactly up to a year later the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.520
 neighborhood center not what arrived in 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.519
 those that I could not in little bothered by 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.769
 the defender the free kick by ezequiel 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.760
 barrionuevo that again gone up the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.530
 they pulled very well above the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.590
 crossbar 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.510
 this is barrionuevo 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 the center really came to us 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.670
 neither did palito ortega 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.050
 and we ended up taking rubén out there 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.700
 one of the two that the team had 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.140
 defender of truth more with franco 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.680
 Colonel arriving by the side 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.240
 left free and bocha then well what 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.400
 who lay down taking it with both hands 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.440
 in the free kick we said when I say 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.140
 He also left a gap and that's what 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.760
 who will have to improve workshops with 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.420
 relays especially the complete ones that do not 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.330
 I could top again frank with him 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.800
 integrated in this case and without 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.390
 concerns not for this totally and 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.550
 after I sweep you look 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.130
 for one side it is exquisitely put 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.690
 so that the fine extra fine 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.600
 best way they stay good offside 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.820
 the defenders of the step and of 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.980
 beraldi was very good and the definition of 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.300
 snow track man was even better but 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.850
 look together for the camera 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.770
 practically green and extra as in that 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.780
 it does not get nervous at all the first 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.640
 ball he played for the 3 sure he is 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.710
 discarded you do is they are wrong 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.840
 lamented in the clock and davis the judge of 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.580
 line to see just in case it did not come to 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.020
 celebrate the vice and the first defined 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.950
 He made friends a kilometer to say 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.739
 excuse me do not bother me 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.490
 finally the match was going to end 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.420
 the talisman 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:41.980
 well fenced by said 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.170
 free kick by juan pablo france 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.360
 I had left to think that if you do 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.430
 fix the problems you had in the 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.830
 fund in the first time and by the moment 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.390
 when that has been put three to one 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.130
 will be the third is that we all want that 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.300
 workshop is that it hurts you a lot when you 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.300
 attacks and a workshops
