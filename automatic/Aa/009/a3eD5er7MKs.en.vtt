00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.710 
we're going to slowly add the water to
the<00:03:02.010> top<00:03:02.510> some<00:03:03.510> using<00:03:03.870> my<00:03:03.960> Vitamix<00:03:05.360> eyelid<00:03:06.360> now

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the top some using my Vitamix eyelid now

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:17.170 
the top some using my Vitamix eyelid now
I'm<00:03:07.590> going<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.830> pour<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.130> liquid<00:03:08.220> in

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.390 

-<00:03:18.180> consistency

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
- consistency

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.699 
- consistency
so<00:03:20.909> that's<00:03:21.180> about<00:03:22.220> half<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.400> cup<00:03:23.750> which<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.780> the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
so that's about half a cup which is the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:33.119 
so that's about half a cup which is the
least<00:03:26.280> amount<00:03:26.610> they<00:03:26.819> sent<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.180> lady

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:48.540 

okay<00:03:34.129> so<00:03:34.190> let's<00:03:34.550> start<00:03:34.790> with<00:03:34.849> that<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.269> yeah

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.150 

good<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.840> actually<00:03:51.350> depending<00:03:51.770> on<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:51.980> blood

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
good and actually depending on the blood

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.820 
good and actually depending on the blood
eater<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.460> have<00:03:52.700> or<00:03:53.120> food<00:03:53.480> processor<00:03:54.110> and

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
eater you have or food processor and

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.320 
eater you have or food processor and
since<00:03:55.070> I<00:03:55.130> don't<00:03:55.280> have<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.430> food<00:03:55.610> processor<00:03:55.790> and

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
since I don't have a food processor and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.440 
since I don't have a food processor and
make<00:03:56.480> everything<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:57.020> my<00:03:57.140> Vitamix<00:03:58.300> it's<00:03:59.300> not

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
make everything in my Vitamix it's not

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.630 
make everything in my Vitamix it's not
the<00:03:59.600> all-purpose<00:04:00.040> what<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.130> want<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.340> do<00:04:01.490> is

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
the all-purpose what you want to do is

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.990 
the all-purpose what you want to do is
you<00:04:01.790> want<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.920> wipe<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.520> stuff<00:04:04.820> from

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
you want to just wipe the stuff from

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.120 
you want to just wipe the stuff from
around<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.390> sides<00:04:05.660> there<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:06.770> that's

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
around the sides there you go that's

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.060 
around the sides there you go that's
better<00:04:07.460> you<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.820> see<00:04:08.050> so<00:04:09.050> they<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.920> know<00:04:09.950> you

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
make sure it's getting all the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.210 
make sure it's getting all the
ingredients<00:04:11.840> thoroughly<00:04:12.080> mixed<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.530> you

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
ingredients thoroughly mixed so and you

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.699 
ingredients thoroughly mixed so and you
can<00:04:16.400> do<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.030> know<00:04:17.120> once<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> couple

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
can do this you know once to a couple

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.770 
can do this you know once to a couple
times<00:04:18.920> depending<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.670> it's<00:04:20.150> also<00:04:20.299> going<00:04:20.630> to

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
times depending and it's also going to

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.990 
times depending and it's also going to
start<00:04:21.049> checking<00:04:21.230> your<00:04:21.500> consistency<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:22.850> let's

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
start checking your consistency so let's

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.160 
start checking your consistency so let's
just<00:04:23.210> give<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> good<00:04:24.110> stir<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.900> it's

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
just give that a good stir so it's

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.250 
just give that a good stir so it's

the<00:06:08.210> consistency<00:06:08.779> that<00:06:08.899> I<00:06:08.960> made<00:06:09.319> which<00:06:09.710> is

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
the consistency that I made which is

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.110 
the consistency that I made which is
about<00:06:11.289> 3/4<00:06:12.289> cup<00:06:12.469> water<00:06:12.499> altogether<00:06:13.430> you<00:06:13.999> know

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
about 3/4 cup water altogether you know

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.709 
about 3/4 cup water altogether you know
using<00:06:14.360> 1/2<00:06:14.569> to<00:06:15.349> begin<00:06:15.620> with<00:06:15.830> and<00:06:16.009> then<00:06:16.129> slowly

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
using 1/2 to begin with and then slowly

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.579 
using 1/2 to begin with and then slowly
adding<00:06:17.719> some<00:06:17.930> more<00:06:18.080> together<00:06:18.349> this

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:18.589 
adding some more together this

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.079 
adding some more together this
consistency<00:06:19.129> you<00:06:19.309> want<00:06:19.370> this<00:06:19.729> would<00:06:19.879> be<00:06:19.969> like

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:20.089 
consistency you want this would be like

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:22.899 
consistency you want this would be like
a<00:06:20.149> dip<00:06:21.009> you<00:06:22.009> can<00:06:22.039> let<00:06:22.309> it<00:06:22.339> set<00:06:22.580> up<00:06:22.729> in<00:06:22.819> the

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
a dip you can let it set up in the

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.010 
a dip you can let it set up in the
fridge<00:06:23.180> I'm<00:06:23.419> guessing<00:06:23.949> stiffer<00:06:24.949> you<00:06:25.460> could

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
fridge I'm guessing stiffer you could

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.449 
fridge I'm guessing stiffer you could
use<00:06:27.020> this<00:06:27.289> in<00:06:27.620> some<00:06:28.219> mac<00:06:28.639> and<00:06:28.819> cheese<00:06:29.120> or<00:06:29.749> I

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:30.459 
use this in some mac and cheese or I

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:32.889 
use this in some mac and cheese or I
don't<00:06:31.459> know<00:06:31.550> you<00:06:31.639> know<00:06:32.029> like<00:06:32.240> it<00:06:32.360> did<00:06:32.870> for

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:32.899 
don't know you know like it did for

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:37.360 
don't know you know like it did for
crackers<00:06:33.529> or<00:06:34.360> veggies<00:06:35.740> all<00:06:36.740> kinds<00:06:37.129> of<00:06:37.189> fun
