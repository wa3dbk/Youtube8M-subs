00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.829
 more than the norm to get six for the year 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.640

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.250

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.310
 losing is not in numbers and not 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.100
 volume how much weight did you drop 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.960
 the main current you felt we want 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.260
 make your life better though decrease 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.770
 weight does not always make life happier 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.670
 but the main thing is your life I can say two 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.870
 today's life is self-destruction and 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.200
 she will lead you to where better not 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:20.980
 give up on the version we have a lot 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.980
 work but everything will be fine up 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.340
 but their share is now very excited one 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.880
 of the main things in her life relationship 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.940
 eat they can have sex on it 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.340
 your seriously she is not satisfied with herself and from 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.690
 it is hard for her to feel 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.520
 helpless here and sentenced when 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.860
 she talks about her weight then in her voice 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:58.640
 hears despair and is very hard now 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:01.980
 it seems that is able to give me 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.450
 change I know she has wish but 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:09.440
 can she reach the end 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.440
 my whole life will change
