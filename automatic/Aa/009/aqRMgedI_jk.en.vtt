00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:29.400
 regulator 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:31.199
 this video configuring and being already has 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.140
 worked 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:50.780
 it plays and application here when the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:56.039
 google can type in the forum's headquarters 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 digital in the 4shared boot that appears here 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.590

 below the group already the game but has a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.400
 however 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 you will need patience to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.140
 find the game has joined that name 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.380
 close by and look for 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.770
 so she has a games that are world 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.670
 not to space and exactly them and not 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.140
 is there is not it because because 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.570
 he has a game that does not catch and we have the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.970
 heavier you take and if you have 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:58.680
 configuration good configuration is good 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:02:26.250

 I thought that says the state of today is the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.260
 concentration and how is the young 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:40.070
 must recover if the state has 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.070
 it was also cultural here 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.600
 but I think I did it badly and only 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.080
 I expect one little it takes 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.080
 together 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.260
 There is no fear of more but that's it 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.470
 according to the internet concierge 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.019
