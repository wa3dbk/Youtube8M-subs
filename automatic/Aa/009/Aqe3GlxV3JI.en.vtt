worldwide implications that all should
be<00:01:22.530> aware<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:23.840> well<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.500> called

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
be aware of well you know it's called

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
be aware of well you know it's called
bioaccumulation<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.299> what<00:01:27.540> will<00:01:27.659> happen<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
bioaccumulation and what will happen is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.980 
bioaccumulation and what will happen is
the<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.340> radioactivity<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.270> releasing<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the the radioactivity the releasing is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.319 
the the radioactivity the releasing is
going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.409> absorbed<00:01:32.040> by<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> ground<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
going to be absorbed by the ground and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630 
going to be absorbed by the ground and
then<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.829> grasses<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.860> then<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.220> little<00:01:35.340> fish

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
then the grasses and then a little fish

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.499 
then the grasses and then a little fish
in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.939> bigger<00:01:36.119> fish<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
in the bigger fish so as you get up the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.370 
in the bigger fish so as you get up the
food<00:01:39.750> chain<00:01:39.780> those<00:01:40.470> fish<00:01:40.829> swim<00:01:41.250> much<00:01:41.579> further

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
food chain those fish swim much further

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.990 
food chain those fish swim much further
so<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> could<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.490> hundreds<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
so you know you could be hundreds of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.020 
so you know you could be hundreds of
miles<00:01:45.240> away<00:01:45.509> from<00:01:45.899> Fukushima<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.759> catch

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
miles away from Fukushima and and catch

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.139 
miles away from Fukushima and and catch
a<00:01:48.149> fish<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.159> feeding<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
a fish that was that was feeding at the

a fish that was that was feeding at the
at<00:01:51.450> Fukushima<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.040> don't<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
at Fukushima so I I don't see it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.810 
at Fukushima so I I don't see it
extending<00:01:55.200> across<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> Pacific<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.310> but

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
extending across the Pacific now but
certainly<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> down<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> coast<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.409> Japan

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
certainly up and down the coast of Japan

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.880 
certainly up and down the coast of Japan
it<00:01:59.610> should<00:01:59.850> be<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> concern<00:02:00.560> all<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.740> let's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it should be a concern all right let's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.440 
it should be a concern all right let's
let's<00:02:02.130> talk<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.610> cleanup<00:02:03.210> issues

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
let's talk about the cleanup issues

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
let's talk about the cleanup issues
going<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:03.960> at<00:02:04.079> Japan<00:02:04.350> has<00:02:04.469> asked<00:02:04.710> for

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
going on here at Japan has asked for

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.859 
going on here at Japan has asked for
Russia's<00:02:05.369> assistance<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.030> disposing<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
Russia's assistance in disposing of a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.229 
Russia's assistance in disposing of a
radioactive<00:02:07.409> waste<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> special<00:02:08.580> type<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
radioactive waste with a special type of

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.119 
radioactive waste with a special type of
floating<00:02:09.720> facility<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.679> sounds<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:10.890> Russia

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
floating facility it sounds like Russia

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.340 
floating facility it sounds like Russia
could<00:02:11.370> play<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> crucial<00:02:12.180> role<00:02:12.420> amid<00:02:13.020> this

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
could play a crucial role amid this

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.570 
could play a crucial role amid this
the<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:13.890> disaster<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:15.710> think<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.490> know

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
the this disaster I think so you know

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.200 
the this disaster I think so you know
the<00:02:17.730> problem<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.700> amount<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.910> water

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
the problem is that the amount of water

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.870 
the problem is that the amount of water
is<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.780> astronomical<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.400> tainted

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
is so astronomical and it's so tainted

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.720 
is so astronomical and it's so tainted
that<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:25.020> they<00:02:25.320> begin<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.920> clean<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.520> water

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that as they begin to clean the water

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.390 
that as they begin to clean the water
they're<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.020> get<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.500> filters<00:02:29.040> will

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
they're going to get the filters will

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.580 
they're going to get the filters will
become<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.030> radioactive<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:31.200> will<00:02:31.320> be<00:02:31.440> very

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
become so radioactive it will be very

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.870 
become so radioactive it will be very
difficult<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:32.460> approach<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.750> filters<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.980> you

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
difficult to approach the filters so you

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.320 
difficult to approach the filters so you
know<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> problem<00:02:36.480> becomes<00:02:36.690> one<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:38.330> keeping

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
know the problem becomes one of keeping

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.060 
know the problem becomes one of keeping
it<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.690> tanks<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.470> stuff<00:02:40.710> will<00:02:40.890> stay

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
it in tanks and this stuff will stay

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.610 
it in tanks and this stuff will stay
radioactive<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:41.940> 300<00:02:42.510> years<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.410> they're

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
radioactive for 300 years so they're

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.650 
radioactive for 300 years so they're
between<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> rock<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.760> hard<00:02:44.790> place<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.540> it's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
between a rock and a hard place and it's

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.600 
between a rock and a hard place and it's
heartening<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
heartening to know that the that the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.140 
heartening to know that the that the
Russians<00:02:48.090> have<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.570> capability<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:50.430> to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
Russians have that capability to to to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.840 
Russians have that capability to to to
clean<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.930> water<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.400> still<00:02:53.640> not

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
clean this water but it's still not

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.330 
clean this water but it's still not
going<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.120> be<00:02:54.210> easy<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.900> at<00:02:55.650> what<00:02:56.040> point<00:02:56.070> does

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
going to be easy so at what point does

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.640 
going to be easy so at what point does
it<00:02:56.400> stop<00:02:56.700> those<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.240> we<00:02:57.360> have<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:57.660> have<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.960> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
it stop those so we have we have the the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.200 
it stop those so we have we have the the
contamination<00:02:59.250> effect<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.790> knocking<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
contamination effect and knocking on the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.670 
contamination effect and knocking on the
food<00:03:00.360> chain<00:03:00.600> then<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.350> have<00:03:01.500> the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
food chain then we have the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.290 
food chain then we have the
contamination<00:03:02.310> effect<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> filters<00:03:03.180> as

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
contamination effect on the filters as

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.330 
contamination effect on the filters as
you<00:03:03.390> are<00:03:03.480> saying<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:03.990> disposal<00:03:04.890> facility

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
you are saying of this disposal facility

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.230 
you are saying of this disposal facility
at<00:03:05.520> what<00:03:05.730> point<00:03:06.060> does<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.510> stop<00:03:08.000> that's<00:03:09.000> a

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
at what point does it stop that's a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.870 
at what point does it stop that's a
great<00:03:09.420> question<00:03:09.780> they<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:11.340> containment

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
great question they the containment

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.310 
great question they the containment
especially<00:03:12.660> on<00:03:12.780> unit<00:03:13.230> 2<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:14.280> leaking<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.570> they

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
especially on unit 2 is leaking and they

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.860 
especially on unit 2 is leaking and they
have<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.860> pump<00:03:17.100> water<00:03:17.430> into<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.330> reactor<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
have to pump water into the reactor to

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.050 
have to pump water into the reactor to
cool<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.320> but<00:03:19.950> it's<00:03:20.130> running<00:03:20.460> out<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.730> bottom

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
cool it but it's running out the bottom

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.720 
cool it but it's running out the bottom
of<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.240> reactor<00:03:21.360> into<00:03:21.930> these<00:03:22.230> trenches<00:03:22.730> some

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
of the reactor into these trenches some

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.160 
of the reactor into these trenches some
estimates<00:03:24.150> say<00:03:24.240> they're<00:03:24.450> pumping<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:25.050> much

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
estimates say they're pumping in as much

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.700 
estimates say they're pumping in as much
as<00:03:25.380> 50<00:03:25.710> tons<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:26.250> day<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.450> 50<00:03:28.260> tons<00:03:28.530> is

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
a day of radioactive material which

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.930 
a day of radioactive material which
means<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.410> we<00:03:37.680> haven't<00:03:38.070> seen<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.490> end<00:03:38.640> of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
means that we haven't seen the end of

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.720 
means that we haven't seen the end of
releasing<00:03:39.510> into<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.900> ocean<00:03:40.560> there<00:03:41.490> will<00:03:41.700> be

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
releasing into the ocean there will be

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.500 
releasing into the ocean there will be
no<00:03:42.410> alternative<00:03:43.410> because<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:44.160> they<00:03:44.760> have<00:03:45.240> to
