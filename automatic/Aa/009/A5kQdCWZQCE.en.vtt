00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
guys a really simple trick this is for

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.669 
guys a really simple trick this is for
anybody<00:00:07.950> who<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.570> recording<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:10.230> know<00:00:10.320> right

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
anybody who is recording you know right

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.459 
anybody who is recording you know right
at<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.040> top<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.880> project<00:00:12.450> window<00:00:13.019> right

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
at the top of the project window right

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.860 
at the top of the project window right
so<00:00:13.740> if<00:00:14.130> you're<00:00:14.519> using<00:00:14.700> GarageBand<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.570> you're

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
so if you're using GarageBand and you're

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.080 
so if you're using GarageBand and you're
using<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.710> countin<00:00:17.310> right<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.820> goes<00:00:17.940> one

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
using the countin right so it goes one

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.570 
using the countin right so it goes one
two<00:00:18.359> three<00:00:18.660> four<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.230> start<00:00:20.160> recording

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
two three four and you start recording

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.560 
two three four and you start recording
right<00:00:20.609> away

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
right away

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.120 
right away
but<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.320> happening<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.890> you're

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
but what is happening is that you're

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.880 
but what is happening is that you're
missing<00:00:23.730> your<00:00:24.150> cutting<00:00:24.869> off<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.109> very<00:00:25.650> very

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
missing your cutting off that very very

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.310 
missing your cutting off that very very
first<00:00:26.279> millisecond<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.269> your<00:00:27.480> recording<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
first millisecond of your recording and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.990 
first millisecond of your recording and
you<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> lot<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> people<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> solution

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
you know a lot of people have a solution

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
project somewhere else you know down the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.680 
project somewhere else you know down the
timeline<00:00:34.430> however<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> do

that so that's what's so awesome about

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.299 
that so that's what's so awesome about
you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> new<00:00:58.710> features<00:00:58.980> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
you know one of the new features of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.830 
you know one of the new features of
GarageBand<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.390> awesome

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
GarageBand that I think is so awesome

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
GarageBand that I think is so awesome
one<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> things<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> recommend<00:01:02.190> doing<00:01:02.520> is

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
one of the things I recommend doing is

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
one of the things I recommend doing is
just<00:01:02.850> shoving<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> drum<00:01:03.719> track<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
just shoving the drum track up to the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.310 
just shoving the drum track up to the
top<00:01:04.680> when<00:01:04.979> you're<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> move<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:06.320> files

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
top when you're going to move your files

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.530 
top when you're going to move your files
over<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.830> find<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.909> beginning<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.390> these

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
over to find the beginning of these

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.870 
over to find the beginning of these
clips<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
clips because you need to do it in a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.990 
clips because you need to do it in a
manner<00:01:12.659> where<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.439> drums<00:01:14.040> don't<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.729> if

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
manner where the drums don't get if

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.030 
manner where the drums don't get if
you're<00:01:15.330> using<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> drummer<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.530> important

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
you're using the drummer it's important

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
you're using the drummer it's important
for<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> move<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.880> inside<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.290> beat

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
for you to move it inside of the beat

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.740 
for you to move it inside of the beat
right<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> don't<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.600> this

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
right so if you don't know I have this

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.620 
right so if you don't know I have this
set<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.140> right<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:22.439> two<00:01:22.500> beats<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.630> project

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
set up right now two beats and project

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.200 
set up right now two beats and project
right<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.140> basically<00:01:25.860> each<00:01:26.189> one<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.000> from

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
right so basically each one of this from

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.100 
right so basically each one of this from
one<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.590> bar<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.820> we're<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.509> 4/4

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
one to two is one bar right we're in 4/4

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.289 
one to two is one bar right we're in 4/4
there<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.500> four<00:01:31.740> beats<00:01:31.920> per<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.369> bar<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.060> from

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
there are four beats per the bar so from

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.080 
there are four beats per the bar so from
1<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> 2<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.950> bar<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.430> mean<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> count

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
1 to 2 is one bar I mean you can count

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.510 
1 to 2 is one bar I mean you can count
it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.760 

now<00:01:42.520> it's<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.729> particularly<00:01:43.149> slow<00:01:43.840> for<00:01:44.320> for<00:01:44.590> cuz

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
now it's a particularly slow for for cuz

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.980 
now it's a particularly slow for for cuz
this<00:01:44.890> one<00:01:44.950> set<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.310> 45<00:01:45.700> however<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.600> is<00:01:46.780> where

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
this one set to 45 however that is where

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.620 
this one set to 45 however that is where
