by<00:01:00.520> this<00:01:00.970> cloud<00:01:01.270> Oct<00:01:01.690> feature<00:01:01.900> so<00:01:02.560> right<00:01:02.890> now

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
by this cloud Oct feature so right now

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.100 
by this cloud Oct feature so right now
I'm<00:01:03.250> using<00:01:03.370> an<00:01:03.700> iPad<00:01:04.119> ok<00:01:05.100> launch<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
I'm using an iPad ok launch the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.050 
I'm using an iPad ok launch the
applications<00:01:08.110> well<00:01:08.860> basically<00:01:09.070> this<00:01:09.399> is<00:01:09.460> a

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
applications well basically this is a

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.530 
applications well basically this is a
web-based<00:01:10.619> application<00:01:11.619> so<00:01:11.860> no<00:01:12.579> software<00:01:13.240> is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
web-based application so no software is

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.500 
web-based application so no software is
installed<00:01:13.780> in<00:01:14.470> any<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:15.040> your<00:01:15.190> device<00:01:15.550> so<00:01:16.180> here

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
installed in any of your device so here

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.560 
installed in any of your device so here
you<00:01:16.630> can<00:01:16.659> see<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:19.150> system

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
you can see is the the system

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.540 
you can see is the the system
information<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.380> what<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.920> system<00:01:21.100> right<00:01:21.520> now

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
information of what the system right now

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.750 
information of what the system right now
is<00:01:21.880> running<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.350> can<00:01:23.830> see<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.400> highway

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
is running so you can see the highway

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.370 
is running so you can see the highway
monitor<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.510> frequency<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.930> model<00:01:29.260> name

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
monitor the frequency the the model name

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.450 
monitor the frequency the the model name
so<00:01:30.010> every<00:01:30.870> status<00:01:31.870> is<00:01:32.110> similar<00:01:32.740> as<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.340> are

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
so every status is similar as you are

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.810 
so every status is similar as you are
seeing<00:01:33.670> on<00:01:33.850> easy<00:01:34.210> tune<00:01:34.570> six<00:01:34.840> sobe<00:01:35.799> clock<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
seeing on easy tune six sobe clock the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.140 
seeing on easy tune six sobe clock the
standard<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.360> 133<00:01:37.900> so<00:01:38.470> probably<00:01:39.250> i'll<00:01:39.520> add<00:01:40.090> it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
standard is 133 so probably i'll add it

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:49.560 
standard is 133 so probably i'll add it
up<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:41.280> 140<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:43.740> delete<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.070> lid<00:01:45.479> won<00:01:46.479> 40-0<00:01:48.570> ok

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
up to 140 so delete the lid won 40-0 ok

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.410 
up to 140 so delete the lid won 40-0 ok
press<00:01:50.560> go<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.390> see<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.810> over<00:01:53.740> here

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
press go and you can see that over here

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.830 
press go and you can see that over here
it<00:01:55.420> will<00:01:55.630> change<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.890> cpu<00:01:57.520> frico<00:01:58.330> big<00:01:58.630> clock

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
it will change the cpu frico big clock

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.460 
it will change the cpu frico big clock
to<00:01:59.110> 140<00:01:59.650> instantly<00:02:00.689> right<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:01.990> there's<00:02:02.260> no

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
to 140 instantly right so there's no

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.620 
to 140 instantly right so there's no
connection<00:02:02.979> while<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.909> only<00:02:04.150> connection

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
here on ipad to the x58 you deny it is

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.839 
here on ipad to the x58 you deny it is
true<00:02:10.179> wireless<00:02:10.629> so<00:02:11.080> by<00:02:11.439> this<00:02:11.500> cloud<00:02:12.159> OC<00:02:12.610> i'm

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
true wireless so by this cloud OC i'm

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.780 
true wireless so by this cloud OC i'm
able<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.720> do<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.260> overclocking<00:02:14.739> even<00:02:15.580> when

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
able to do the overclocking even when

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.039 
able to do the overclocking even when
i'm<00:02:16.030> not<00:02:16.829> beside<00:02:17.829> my<00:02:17.980> pc<00:02:18.370> besides<00:02:19.269> changing

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
i'm not beside my pc besides changing

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.490 
i'm not beside my pc besides changing
the<00:02:21.150> frequency<00:02:22.150> as<00:02:22.659> well<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.139> can

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the frequency as well I can

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.690 
the frequency as well I can
also<00:02:23.800> change<00:02:24.550> like<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.300> voltage<00:02:26.460> right<00:02:27.460> so

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
also change like the voltage right so

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.770 
also change like the voltage right so
the<00:02:28.630> voltage<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:30.280> any<00:02:30.580> voltage<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.240> drm

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
the voltage here any voltage to the drm

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.770 
the voltage here any voltage to the drm
the<00:02:32.500> CPU<00:02:33.100> as<00:02:33.400> well<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.750> CPU<00:02:35.350> PLL<00:02:36.000> IOH<00:02:37.000> okay

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
the CPU as well so the CPU PLL IOH okay

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.380 
the CPU as well so the CPU PLL IOH okay
so<00:02:38.380> basically<00:02:38.710> is<00:02:39.100> using<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.790> same<00:02:40.060> library

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
so basically is using the same library

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.160 
so basically is using the same library
of<00:02:40.900> easy<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.800> mix<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.370> most<00:02:43.270> important<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.900> all

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
of easy to mix and most important of all

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.410 
of easy to mix and most important of all
I<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:46.020> remotely<00:02:47.020> control<00:02:47.440> my<00:02:47.950> pc<00:02:48.459> by<00:02:49.150> turning

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
I can remotely control my pc by turning
