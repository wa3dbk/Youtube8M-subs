00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
pretty cool too but I feel like it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.560 
pretty cool too but I feel like it's
it's<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.880> weak<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.180> comes<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it's a little weak when it comes to the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.420 
it's a little weak when it comes to the
ARX<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> little<00:01:16.590> bit<00:01:16.680> stronger<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
ARX is a little bit stronger so that I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.960 
ARX is a little bit stronger so that I
roll<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> RX<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> how<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> roll<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.970> think
