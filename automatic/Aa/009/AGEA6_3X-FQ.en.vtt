00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
this I'm going to make crown molding so

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.910 
this I'm going to make crown molding so
I<00:00:09.510> had<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.780> cut<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.019> up<00:00:10.260> but<00:00:10.469> anyway<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.830> can

I had to cut it up but anyway you can
see<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> original<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.450> there's<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.259> cut<00:00:13.590> here

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
see the original here there's a cut here

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.450 
see the original here there's a cut here
but<00:00:14.099> originally<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.820> wasn't<00:00:15.210> cut<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.460> all

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
but originally that wasn't cut and all

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.620 
but originally that wasn't cut and all
it<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:18.560> that<00:00:19.560> Brown<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.300> original<00:00:21.300> crown

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
it is that Brown is original crown

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.310 
it is that Brown is original crown
molding<00:00:22.490> cut<00:00:23.490> at<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> 45<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.199> then<00:00:25.680> shaped<00:00:26.099> as

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
molding cut at a 45 and then shaped as

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.250 
molding cut at a 45 and then shaped as
the<00:00:28.320> block<00:00:28.590> would<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.859> shaped<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:32.719> now<00:00:33.719> here's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the block would be shaped and now here's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.000 
the block would be shaped and now here's
the<00:00:34.500> mold<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.480> resulted<00:00:36.480> from<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.980> can

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the mold that resulted from it you can

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.729 
the mold that resulted from it you can
see<00:00:38.399> right<00:00:38.640> there<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:42.270> way<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:43.050> make<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
see right there the way you make the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.220 
see right there the way you make the
mold<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.579> your<00:00:44.760> original<00:00:44.910> plug<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
mold is you get your original plug all I

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990 
mold is you get your original plug all I
did<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:46.739> take<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> crown<00:00:47.399> molding<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
did was take the crown molding and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
did was take the crown molding and
attitude<00:00:48.539> by<00:00:48.719> four<00:00:48.989> they<00:00:49.170> give<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> some<00:00:49.620> depth

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
attitude by four they give it some depth

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.549 
attitude by four they give it some depth
right<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:51.379> okay

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
right there okay

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.389 
right there okay
and<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:53.149> that<00:00:54.149> finishes<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> plug<00:00:58.399> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and then that finishes the plug it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.349 
and then that finishes the plug it
appears<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.149> also<00:01:01.309> added<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
appears that I also added some to the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.250 
appears that I also added some to the
bottom<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:05.119> because<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.689> crown

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
bottom there because that the crown

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.690 
bottom there because that the crown
molding<00:01:07.740> ended<00:01:09.200> right<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> added

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
molding ended right there so I added

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.690 
molding ended right there so I added
this<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.659> too<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
this on there too and you can see what a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.929 
this on there too and you can see what a
cross-section<00:01:15.540> looks<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.250> if<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
cross-section looks like if I can get it

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.840 
cross-section looks like if I can get it
right<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> 2x4<00:01:20.340> added<00:01:20.700> on

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
right there you can see the 2x4 added on

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.080 
right there you can see the 2x4 added on
top<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.270> piece<00:01:24.270> down<00:01:24.540> below<00:01:26.090> but

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
top and then the piece down below but

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.520 
top and then the piece down below but
anyway<00:01:27.360> that's<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.900> looks<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.259> before

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
anyway that's what it looks like before

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.749 
anyway that's what it looks like before
it's<00:01:28.860> cut<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:30.439> but<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.650> after<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
it's cut up but then after you get that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.480 
it's cut up but then after you get that
in<00:01:33.119> order<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> make<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> flanges<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:35.280> both

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
in order to make the flanges to both

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.090 
in order to make the flanges to both
this<00:01:35.729> together<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> flanges

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this together you can see the flanges

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
this together you can see the flanges
here<00:01:41.460> these<00:01:42.270> flanges<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.409> made<00:01:43.649> or

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
here these flanges have to be made or

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.600 
here these flanges have to be made or
there'd<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.250> no<00:01:44.430> way<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.590> bolt<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.890> pieces

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
there'd be no way to bolt the pieces

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.940 
there'd be no way to bolt the pieces
together<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.360> mold<00:01:48.829> there's<00:01:51.409> five<00:01:52.409> pieces

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
together of the mold there's five pieces

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.149 
together of the mold there's five pieces
to<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> mold<00:01:53.490> they're<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> two<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.540> pieces

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
to the mold they're the two in pieces

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.330 
to the mold they're the two in pieces
the<00:01:56.159> center<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.840> then<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.500> oak

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the center and then this is just oak

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.490 
the center and then this is just oak
board<00:01:59.759> on<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> side<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.630> complete<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.229> mold

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
board on the side to complete the mold

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.990 
board on the side to complete the mold
and<00:02:02.210> how<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:05.369> take<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> piece

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and how you do that is you take a piece

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
and how you do that is you take a piece
of<00:02:06.210> plexiglass<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.110> use<00:02:07.380> quarter<00:02:07.860> inch<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:09.020> you

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of plexiglass I use quarter inch and you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.309 
of plexiglass I use quarter inch and you
shape<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.770> this

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
shape it to this

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.699 
shape it to this
shape<00:02:11.980> at<00:02:12.219> a<00:02:12.249> 45<00:02:12.939> you<00:02:13.930> shave<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.409> to<00:02:14.560> this

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
shape at a 45 you shave it to this

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.649 
shape at a 45 you shave it to this
general<00:02:15.249> shape<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.760> doesn't<00:02:15.909> have<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.389> fit

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
general shape it doesn't have to fit

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.530 
general shape it doesn't have to fit
perfectly<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:18.730> then<00:02:18.999> you<00:02:19.120> can<00:02:19.299> bring

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
perfectly because then you can bring

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.789 
perfectly because then you can bring
back<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.170> clay<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.400> fill<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.060> voids<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:23.680> you

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
back in clay and fill the voids but you

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.440 
back in clay and fill the voids but you
want<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.040> make<00:02:24.219> a<00:02:24.249> sharp<00:02:24.639> corner<00:02:24.909> because<00:02:25.239> you

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
want to make a sharp corner because you

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.629 
want to make a sharp corner because you
don't<00:02:25.629> want<00:02:25.780> your<00:02:25.900> epoxy<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.769> leak<00:02:27.340> through

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
don't want your epoxy to leak through

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.610 
don't want your epoxy to leak through
there<00:02:28.439> okay

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
there okay

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.289 
there okay
so<00:02:30.489> what<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.879> have<00:02:31.120> here<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.719> a<00:02:31.750> shaped<00:02:32.260> 45<00:02:33.299> of

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
so what you have here is a shaped 45 of

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.179 
so what you have here is a shaped 45 of
Plexiglas<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:37.049> then<00:02:38.049> you<00:02:38.439> make<00:02:38.680> your<00:02:38.980> first

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
Plexiglas and then you make your first

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.099 
Plexiglas and then you make your first
part<00:02:39.579> which<00:02:39.819> would<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.419> you<00:02:40.569> do<00:02:40.719> the<00:02:40.870> same

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
part which would be that you do the same

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.949 
part which would be that you do the same
on<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.379> end<00:02:41.590> over<00:02:41.709> here<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.159> course<00:02:42.189> and<00:02:42.959> then

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
on the end over here of course and then

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.750 
on the end over here of course and then
you<00:02:44.109> make<00:02:44.319> your<00:02:44.349> first<00:02:44.799> part<00:02:45.159> which<00:02:45.430> will<00:02:45.700> be

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
you make your first part which will be

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.869 
you make your first part which will be
this<00:02:46.480> part<00:02:46.780> right<00:02:46.989> here<00:02:47.549> that's<00:02:48.549> what<00:02:48.760> it

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
this part right here that's what it

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.520 
this part right here that's what it
looks<00:02:49.090> like<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.629> outside<00:02:50.079> when<00:02:50.349> it's

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
looks like the outside when it's

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.089 
looks like the outside when it's
finished<00:02:51.870> okay<00:02:52.870> then<00:02:53.079> when<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.409> finished

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
finished okay then when it's finished

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.449 
finished okay then when it's finished
you<00:02:55.090> take<00:02:55.359> that<00:02:55.510> Plexiglas<00:02:56.199> off<00:02:56.560> it's<00:02:57.069> in<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
you take that Plexiglas off it's in the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.740 
you take that Plexiglas off it's in the
mold<00:02:57.730> now<00:02:59.489> it's<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.909> mold<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.449> you<00:03:01.569> have

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
mold now it's in the mold and you have

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.220 
mold now it's in the mold and you have
the<00:03:01.900> plans<00:03:02.199> down<00:03:02.620> there<00:03:03.000> okay<00:03:04.949> then<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:08.049> go

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the plans down there okay then you go

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.699 
the plans down there okay then you go
ahead<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:09.599> take<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.840> plastic<00:03:11.319> off<00:03:11.889> and<00:03:13.709> then

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
ahead and take the plastic off and then

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.319 
ahead and take the plastic off and then
you<00:03:15.040> make<00:03:15.219> this<00:03:15.430> part<00:03:16.979> on<00:03:17.979> the<00:03:18.129> outside<00:03:18.699> so

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
you make this part on the outside so

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.569 
you make this part on the outside so
there's<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.930> flange<00:03:20.229> made<00:03:20.650> by<00:03:20.919> your<00:03:21.099> plastic

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
there's the flange made by your plastic

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.960 
there's the flange made by your plastic
part<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.479> remove<00:03:23.099> so<00:03:24.099> anyway<00:03:24.519> you<00:03:24.579> end

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
part that you remove so anyway you end

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.179 
part that you remove so anyway you end
up<00:03:25.209> with<00:03:25.509> a<00:03:25.540> piece<00:03:25.870> like<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:26.409> on<00:03:26.709> this<00:03:26.889> side

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
up with a piece like this on this side

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.580 
up with a piece like this on this side
and<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.909> piece<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:28.389> that<00:03:28.689> on<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.109> other<00:03:29.259> side

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
and a piece like that on the other side

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.129 
and a piece like that on the other side
now<00:03:29.859> you<00:03:30.519> have<00:03:30.759> three<00:03:31.120> pieces<00:03:32.519> okay<00:03:33.959> then<00:03:34.959> of

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
now you have three pieces okay then of

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.710 
now you have three pieces okay then of
course<00:03:35.409> you<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:35.620> cut<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.849> boards<00:03:37.509> to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
course you just cut the the boards to

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.990 
course you just cut the the boards to
fit<00:03:37.959> on<00:03:38.109> either<00:03:38.259> side<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.949> then<00:03:39.519> bolt<00:03:39.819> them

fit on either side and then bolt them

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.610 
fit on either side and then bolt them
together<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.479> don't<00:03:40.750> know<00:03:40.810> how<00:03:40.930> many<00:03:40.989> bolts<00:03:41.500> I

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
together I don't know how many bolts I

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.129 
together I don't know how many bolts I
have<00:03:41.859> on<00:03:42.040> there<00:03:42.280> but<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.359> can<00:03:43.509> see<00:03:43.750> where<00:03:43.989> they

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:07.539 
here I'm putting making fiberglass crown

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.890 
here I'm putting making fiberglass crown
molding<00:04:08.109> over<00:04:08.439> the<00:04:08.560> outside<00:04:08.949> windows<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.780> make

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
molding over the outside windows to make

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.140 
molding over the outside windows to make
it<00:04:11.019> out<00:04:11.109> of<00:04:11.139> concrete<00:04:11.829> would<00:04:12.099> be<00:04:12.310> too<00:04:12.549> heavy<00:04:12.849> so

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
it out of concrete would be too heavy so

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.719 
it out of concrete would be too heavy so
I'm<00:04:13.269> making<00:04:13.449> them<00:04:13.659> out<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.900> fiberglass

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
I'm making them out of fiberglass

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.839 
I'm making them out of fiberglass
but<00:04:15.729> I<00:04:15.759> have<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.239> stretch<00:04:16.539> this<00:04:16.810> mold<00:04:17.139> out<00:04:17.849> but

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
but I have to stretch this mold out but

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.640 
but I have to stretch this mold out but
I'm<00:04:18.940> going<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.150> end<00:04:19.389> up<00:04:19.539> using<00:04:19.810> these<00:04:20.229> end

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
I'm going to end up using these end

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.670 
I'm going to end up using these end
pieces<00:04:20.859> for<00:04:21.430> part<00:04:21.699> of<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.909> mold<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.680> then

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
pieces for part of the mold and then

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.379 
pieces for part of the mold and then
here

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
here

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.659 
here
the<00:04:24.509> first<00:04:24.780> part<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.770> I've<00:04:26.129> made<00:04:26.310> out<00:04:26.550> of

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
the first part that I've made out of

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.689 
the first part that I've made out of
fiberglass<00:04:26.879> you<00:04:27.419> see<00:04:27.629> I<00:04:27.659> made<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.199> side<00:04:28.699> next

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
fiberglass you see I made this side next

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.730 
fiberglass you see I made this side next
I'm<00:04:29.999> going<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.270> make<00:04:30.449> that<00:04:30.810> side<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.469> then<00:04:31.620> I'm

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
I'm going to make that side and then I'm

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.909 
I'm going to make that side and then I'm
going<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:31.949> make<00:04:32.159> the<00:04:32.999> centerpiece<00:04:33.680> but<00:04:34.680> here's

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
going to make the centerpiece but here's

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.429 
going to make the centerpiece but here's
what<00:04:35.189> here's<00:04:35.639> what<00:04:35.819> the<00:04:36.240> fiberglass<00:04:36.900> piece

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:37.439 
what here's what the fiberglass piece

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.070 
what here's what the fiberglass piece
looks<00:04:37.800> like<00:04:38.419> one<00:04:39.419> side

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
looks like one side

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.050 
looks like one side
I<00:04:40.110> haven't<00:04:40.680> trended<00:04:41.099> yet<00:04:41.279> but<00:04:41.610> that's<00:04:41.729> what<00:04:41.969> it

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
I haven't trended yet but that's what it

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.399 
I haven't trended yet but that's what it
looks<00:04:42.270> like<00:04:42.830> okay<00:04:43.830> then<00:04:44.069> it<00:04:44.189> ends<00:04:44.550> there

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
looks like okay then it ends there

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.640 
looks like okay then it ends there
because<00:04:46.409> that's<00:04:46.650> that's<00:04:47.009> the<00:04:47.219> other<00:04:47.400> end<00:04:48.650> so

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
because that's that's the other end so

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.839 
because that's that's the other end so

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
what I'll end up with is one left one

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.119 
what I'll end up with is one left one
right<00:04:53.909> that<00:04:54.599> I<00:04:54.659> haven't<00:04:54.930> made<00:04:55.259> yet<00:04:55.529> and<00:04:55.800> then<00:04:56.009> a

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
right that I haven't made yet and then a

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.640 
right that I haven't made yet and then a
centerpiece<00:04:56.759> to<00:04:57.509> make<00:04:57.689> it<00:04:57.870> about<00:04:58.110> three<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.560> a

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
centerpiece to make it about three and a

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.559

half feet long I haven't done that yet

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.360 
half feet long I haven't done that yet
maybe<00:05:00.810> I'll<00:05:01.080> make<00:05:01.289> another<00:05:01.349> video<00:05:01.889> but<00:05:02.250> anyway

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
maybe I'll make another video but anyway

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.179 
maybe I'll make another video but anyway
I'd<00:05:03.120> show<00:05:03.449> you<00:05:03.479> how<00:05:03.810> how<00:05:04.229> this<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:04.680> done<00:05:04.949> you

here<00:05:31.069> is<00:05:32.069> a<00:05:32.240> dam<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.629> I<00:05:34.020> made<00:05:34.379> to<00:05:34.740> make<00:05:34.919> one

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
here is a dam that I made to make one

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.700 
here is a dam that I made to make one
section<00:05:35.669> this<00:05:35.879> I'm<00:05:36.120> going<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.270> fit<00:05:36.509> this<00:05:36.719> right

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
section this I'm going to fit this right

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.279 
section this I'm going to fit this right
back<00:05:37.979> in<00:05:38.279> there<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.759> will<00:05:38.879> fit<00:05:39.289> supposedly

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
back in there that will fit supposedly

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.219 
back in there that will fit supposedly
fit<00:05:40.529> right<00:05:40.740> in<00:05:40.979> there<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.360> see<00:05:42.719> that's<00:05:42.960> my

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
fit right in there and you see that's my

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.439 
fit right in there and you see that's my
square<00:05:43.589> flat<00:05:43.860> side<00:05:44.189> for<00:05:44.490> that<00:05:44.639> side<00:05:45.409> okay

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
square flat side for that side okay

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.170 
square flat side for that side okay
then<00:05:48.449> that'll<00:05:48.930> be<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.639> that'll<00:05:50.639> be<00:05:50.759> the<00:05:50.969> other

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
then that'll be the that'll be the other

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.519 
then that'll be the that'll be the other
the<00:05:51.449> counterpart<00:05:52.110> to<00:05:52.409> this<00:05:53.159> right<00:05:53.430> here<00:05:53.819> I

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:54.529 
the counterpart to this right here I

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.469 
the counterpart to this right here I
have<00:05:55.529> my<00:05:55.560> two<00:05:55.770> ends<00:05:56.219> then<00:05:56.639> then<00:05:57.120> I<00:05:57.149> make<00:05:57.449> a

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
have my two ends then then I make a

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.589 
have my two ends then then I make a
piece<00:05:57.899> okay<00:05:58.710> then<00:05:59.669> it<00:05:59.819> makes<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.089> long<00:06:00.270> piece

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
piece okay then it makes a long piece

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.329 
piece okay then it makes a long piece
that<00:06:00.899> will<00:06:00.990> end<00:06:01.139> up<00:06:01.259> like<00:06:01.469> a<00:06:01.500> plug<00:06:01.949> like<00:06:02.279> this

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:02.339 
that will end up like a plug like this

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.540 
that will end up like a plug like this
one<00:06:02.759> was<00:06:02.969> only<00:06:03.449> the<00:06:03.599> proper<00:06:03.990> length<00:06:04.199> and<00:06:04.550> then

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
one was only the proper length and then

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.769 
one was only the proper length and then
I<00:06:05.879> use<00:06:06.659> my<00:06:06.689> in<00:06:07.139> pieces<00:06:07.649> and<00:06:08.149> then<00:06:09.149> I<00:06:09.180> just<00:06:09.479> fill

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:09.779 
I use my in pieces and then I just fill

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:14.269 
I use my in pieces and then I just fill
in<00:06:10.129> the<00:06:11.129> Center<00:06:11.490> for<00:06:11.520> a<00:06:12.389> new<00:06:12.629> mold<00:06:13.069> the<00:06:14.069> mold

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279 
in the Center for a new mold the mold

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.429 
in the Center for a new mold the mold
will<00:06:14.639> look<00:06:15.149> like<00:06:15.360> what<00:06:15.779> you're<00:06:15.960> looking<00:06:16.289> at

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:16.439 
will look like what you're looking at

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:20.179 
will look like what you're looking at
right<00:06:16.680> there<00:06:18.050> but<00:06:19.050> three<00:06:19.620> and<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.800> half<00:06:19.979> feet

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
right there but three and a half feet

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.619 
right there but three and a half feet
long<00:06:20.250> and<00:06:20.520> I'll<00:06:21.509> have<00:06:21.689> to<00:06:21.839> make<00:06:22.020> two<00:06:22.319> new

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
long and I'll have to make two new

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.269 
long and I'll have to make two new
boards<00:06:24.629> here<00:06:25.050> obviously<00:06:25.830> because<00:06:26.009> it<00:06:26.129> won't

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
boards here obviously because it won't

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.089 
boards here obviously because it won't
be<00:06:26.370> able<00:06:26.490> to<00:06:26.669> as<00:06:26.969> long<00:06:27.210> but<00:06:28.199> what<00:06:28.680> that<00:06:28.860> does

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
be able to as long but what that does

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.600 
be able to as long but what that does
for<00:06:29.129> me<00:06:29.639> is<00:06:30.569> that<00:06:31.110> allows<00:06:31.439> me<00:06:31.830> to<00:06:32.099> use<00:06:32.129> the<00:06:32.310> in

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
for me is that allows me to use the in

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.119 
for me is that allows me to use the in
piece<00:06:32.819> I<00:06:32.969> don't<00:06:33.180> to<00:06:33.300> make<00:06:33.479> these<00:06:33.719> anymore<00:06:34.589> I

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
piece I don't to make these anymore I

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.719 
piece I don't to make these anymore I
use

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
use

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.420 
use
those<00:06:35.849> in<00:06:36.150> the<00:06:36.240> mold<00:06:36.479> both<00:06:37.379> of<00:06:37.620> these<00:06:37.770> and<00:06:38.189> then

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
those in the mold both of these and then

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.399 
those in the mold both of these and then
just<00:06:38.699> make<00:06:38.939> the<00:06:39.240> centerpiece<00:06:39.809> which<00:06:40.289> I

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409
