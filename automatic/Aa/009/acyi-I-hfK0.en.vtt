00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.630
 not able to quietly after that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.070

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.890
 business that nobody can use you 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.840
 do not need to use it with virtual machine 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.910

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.130
 for me for a client that I have 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.540

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.980
 because my camera broke, I'm 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.360
 using here a camera more or less but 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.390
 it's just you have an idea of â€‹â€‹what it is 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.390
