I'm<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.260> talk<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> little<00:00:01.650> bit<00:00:01.800> about<00:00:01.890> RAM

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
I'm going to talk a little bit about RAM

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.749 
I'm going to talk a little bit about RAM
disks<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.810> software<00:00:04.440> program<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.009> Mac<00:00:05.250> OS<00:00:05.520> X

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
disks and a software program on Mac OS X

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.460 
disks and a software program on Mac OS X
that<00:00:05.940> allows<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.540> make<00:00:07.049> them<00:00:07.170> on<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.319> fly

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
that allows you to make them on the fly

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.850 
that allows you to make them on the fly
very<00:00:07.680> quickly<00:00:08.189> which<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.150> called<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.809> temp<00:00:10.260> disk

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
very quickly which is called a temp disk

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.419 
very quickly which is called a temp disk
which<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.190> TMP<00:00:12.090> disk<00:00:12.420> that's<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.990> name<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.349> it

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
which is TMP disk that's the name of it

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.150 
which is TMP disk that's the name of it
Ram<00:00:14.790> disks<00:00:15.240> are<00:00:15.360> basically<00:00:15.870> seen<00:00:16.800> by<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
Ram disks are basically seen by the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
Ram disks are basically seen by the
operating<00:00:17.670> system<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> virtual<00:00:19.109> hard<00:00:19.260> drive

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
operating system as a virtual hard drive

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.920 
operating system as a virtual hard drive
that's<00:00:19.949> stored<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.520> RAM<00:00:20.820> or<00:00:21.270> random<00:00:21.689> access

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
that's stored in RAM or random access

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.470 
that's stored in RAM or random access
memory<00:00:23.480> which<00:00:25.340> can<00:00:26.340> actually<00:00:26.849> has<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> lot<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
memory which can actually has a lot of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.000 
memory which can actually has a lot of
pros<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.869> cons<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
pros and cons to it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
pros and cons to it
the<00:00:29.519> probing<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.269> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.599> very<00:00:31.050> fast

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the probing it's going to be very fast

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.950 
the probing it's going to be very fast
in<00:00:31.830> fact<00:00:32.009> faster<00:00:32.579> than<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.910> solid-state<00:00:33.630> drive

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
in fact faster than a solid-state drive

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.940 
in fact faster than a solid-state drive
or<00:00:34.320> SSD<00:00:34.890> drive<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.780> downside<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.649> if

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
or SSD drive the downside to it is if

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.549 
or SSD drive the downside to it is if
you<00:00:38.070> shut<00:00:38.250> down<00:00:38.370> your<00:00:38.550> computer<00:00:39.320> anything<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
you shut down your computer anything you

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.610 
you shut down your computer anything you
have<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.890> ram<00:00:41.070> disk<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.579> erased<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.410 

hey<00:00:46.280> you're<00:00:46.580> not<00:00:46.700> gonna<00:00:46.790> get<00:00:46.970> it<00:00:47.060> back<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:47.360> you

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
hey you're not gonna get it back so you

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.940 
hey you're not gonna get it back so you
got<00:00:47.540> to<00:00:47.600> make<00:00:47.720> sure<00:00:47.900> you<00:00:48.050> physically<00:00:48.650> save<00:00:48.830> it

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
got to make sure you physically save it

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.010 
got to make sure you physically save it
to<00:00:49.130> your<00:00:49.310> hard<00:00:49.370> disk<00:00:49.850> if<00:00:50.150> your<00:00:50.540> mechanical

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
to your hard disk if your mechanical

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.690 
to your hard disk if your mechanical
hard<00:00:51.200> disk

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
hard disk

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.570 
hard disk
but<00:00:53.700> let<00:00:54.600> me<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:54.810> ahead<00:00:54.900> and<00:00:55.080> bring<00:00:55.470> up

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
but let me go ahead and bring up

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.870 
but let me go ahead and bring up
the<00:00:58.150> program<00:00:58.750> itself<00:00:58.900> tent<00:00:59.830> disk

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.299 

now<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.360> you<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.630> is<00:01:03.660> once<00:01:04.440> you<00:01:04.589> open<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.160> up

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
now what you do is once you open it up

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.380 
now what you do is once you open it up
there'll<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:06.950> looks<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.390> floppy

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
there'll be a little looks like a floppy

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.260 
there'll be a little looks like a floppy
disk<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.190> got<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> menu<00:01:11.820> system<00:01:12.180> right

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
disk and it's got this menu system right

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.100 
disk and it's got this menu system right
here<00:01:12.470> make<00:01:13.470> new<00:01:14.130> temp<00:01:14.610> disk<00:01:14.880> current<00:01:15.720> tempest

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
here make new temp disk current tempest

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.780 
here make new temp disk current tempest
which<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.740> actually<00:01:16.860> already<00:01:17.310> got<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.610> now

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
which I actually already got right now

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.240 
which I actually already got right now
hard<00:01:18.090> disk<00:01:18.330> for

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.550 

start<00:01:21.790> always<00:01:22.150> start<00:01:22.660> on<00:01:22.840> login

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
start always start on login

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.470 
start always start on login
obviously<00:01:24.430> every<00:01:24.910> time<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.210> start<00:01:25.420> the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
obviously every time you start the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.230 
obviously every time you start the
computer<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:25.990> going<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.230> run<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:27.090> check<00:01:28.090> for

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
computer is going to run and check for

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.350 
computer is going to run and check for
updates<00:01:28.570> which<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.020> uh<00:01:29.050> with<00:01:29.740> new<00:01:30.010> version<00:01:30.460> now

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
updates which is uh with new version now

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.060 
updates which is uh with new version now
we're<00:01:31.480> going<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.630> go<00:01:31.780> ahead<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.020> select<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.590> new

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
we're going to go ahead and select a new

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.930 
we're going to go ahead and select a new
temp<00:01:33.700> disk<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.860> pop-up<00:01:36.370> window<00:01:36.760> will<00:01:36.850> be

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
temp disk and this pop-up window will be

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.860 
temp disk and this pop-up window will be
right<00:01:37.120> here

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
right here

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.100 
right here
now<00:01:38.380> says<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.770> must<00:01:39.010> make<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.580> disk<00:01:40.090> name<00:01:40.360> which

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
now says you must make a disk name which

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.910 
now says you must make a disk name which
is<00:01:41.230> a<00:01:41.260> handy<00:01:41.650> way<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:43.540> know<00:01:43.740> doing<00:01:44.740> it

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
is a handy way of you know doing it

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:55.420 
is a handy way of you know doing it
anyway<00:01:45.390> we're<00:01:46.390> gonna<00:01:46.480> call<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.810> disk<00:01:47.050> five

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.990 

and<00:01:55.520> label<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.540> know<00:01:56.660> easy<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.170> find<00:01:57.410> and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
and label it you know easy to find and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.500 
and label it you know easy to find and
now<00:01:59.740> this<00:02:00.740> size<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.280> goes<00:02:01.400> anywhere<00:02:01.790> from<00:02:02.030> 16

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
now this size it goes anywhere from 16

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.600 
now this size it goes anywhere from 16
megabytes<00:02:02.930> which<00:02:03.410> is<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.890> minimum<00:02:04.250> all<00:02:04.400> the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
megabytes which is the minimum all the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.790 
megabytes which is the minimum all the
way<00:02:04.730> to<00:02:05.830> 1.5<00:02:07.149> gigabytes

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
way to 1.5 gigabytes

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.620 
way to 1.5 gigabytes
now<00:02:09.800> supposedly<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.970> developer<00:02:11.360> says<00:02:11.510> you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
now supposedly the developer says you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.449 
now supposedly the developer says you
can<00:02:11.750> make<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.990> any<00:02:12.140> size<00:02:12.410> for<00:02:13.010> some<00:02:13.190> reason

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
can make it any size for some reason

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.100 
can make it any size for some reason
there's<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.670> limit<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.420> don't<00:02:14.570> know<00:02:14.660> if<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:14.900> due

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
there's a limit I don't know if it's due

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.710 
there's a limit I don't know if it's due
to<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:16.640> amount<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.970> stalled<00:02:17.300> memory

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
to the amount of stalled memory

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.780 
to the amount of stalled memory
obviously<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.290> can't<00:02:18.530> make<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.890> RAM<00:02:19.550> disk

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
obviously you can't make the RAM disk

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.100 
obviously you can't make the RAM disk
larger<00:02:20.570> than<00:02:21.320> here<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:22.730> memory<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.990> have

larger than here a memory that you have
installed<00:02:24.320> in<00:02:24.530> your<00:02:24.560> computer<00:02:25.010> obviously

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
installed in your computer obviously

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.890 
installed in your computer obviously
even<00:02:26.780> though<00:02:26.930> there's<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.550> maximum<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.760> 1<00:02:29.660> point

even though there's a maximum of 1 point
5<00:02:30.190> gigabytes<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.640> make<00:02:31.880> more<00:02:32.120> than<00:02:32.180> one

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
5 gigabytes you can make more than one

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.699 
5 gigabytes you can make more than one
as<00:02:32.810> many<00:02:33.140> as<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.470> need<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.940> just<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:35.390> to

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
as many as you need so you just have to

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.380 
as many as you need so you just have to
if<00:02:36.709> you've<00:02:37.220> got<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> lot<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.580> memory<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.209> do

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
if you've got a lot of memory like I do

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.729 
if you've got a lot of memory like I do
I've<00:02:38.660> got<00:02:38.690> like<00:02:39.020> 24<00:02:39.970> gigabytes<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.120> memory<00:02:41.739> if

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
I've got like 24 gigabytes of memory if

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.560 
I've got like 24 gigabytes of memory if
I<00:02:42.950> want<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.190> bypass<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:43.850> just<00:02:44.120> make<00:02:44.360> more

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
I want to bypass that I just make more

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.630 
I want to bypass that I just make more
than<00:02:44.720> one<00:02:44.870> disk<00:02:45.220> we're<00:02:46.220> gonna<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.459> ahead<00:02:46.520> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
than one disk we're gonna go ahead and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.820 
than one disk we're gonna go ahead and
keep<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.030> at<00:02:47.120> 16<00:02:47.810> megabytes<00:02:48.170> we're<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.770> to

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
keep it at 16 megabytes we're going to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.140 
keep it at 16 megabytes we're going to
go<00:02:48.920> ahead<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.190> start<00:02:49.489> it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
go ahead and start it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.100 
go ahead and start it
okay<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.849> hard<00:02:53.849> disks<00:02:54.180> five<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.600 

and<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.739> can<00:02:58.860> treat<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.160> pretty<00:02:59.400> much<00:02:59.550> just

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
and you can treat it pretty much just

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.720 
and you can treat it pretty much just
like<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.030> regular<00:03:00.390> hard<00:03:00.599> disk<00:03:01.489> store<00:03:02.489> anything

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
like a regular hard disk store anything

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.650 
like a regular hard disk store anything
you<00:03:02.940> want<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.269> there<00:03:03.480> audio<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:06.239> know

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
you want in there audio you know

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.170 
you want in there audio you know
documents<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.860> let<00:03:08.370> me<00:03:08.430> open<00:03:08.549> up<00:03:08.760> hard<00:03:09.030> disk

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
documents and let me open up hard disk

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.110 
documents and let me open up hard disk
four<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.190> we<00:03:11.190> got<00:03:11.310> some<00:03:11.519> things<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.940> here

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
four and we got some things in here

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.680 
four and we got some things in here
already

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
already

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.309 
already
I<00:03:13.489> got<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> PDF<00:03:14.700> file<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.540> document<00:03:15.810> file<00:03:16.349> and

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
I got a PDF file a document file and

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.930 
I got a PDF file a document file and
audio<00:03:19.319> file<00:03:19.590> as<00:03:19.799> well<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.340> hopefully<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.879> can

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
audio file as well and hopefully I can

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.490 
audio file as well and hopefully I can
get<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.239> play<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.959> guys<00:03:22.110> can<00:03:22.319> hear

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
get this to play and you guys can hear

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.809 
get this to play and you guys can hear
it

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
it

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.620 
it
and<00:03:24.330> I'm<00:03:24.390> gonna<00:03:24.540> play<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.780> right<00:03:25.019> from

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.410 

the<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.440> ramdisk<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.490> hopefully<00:03:32.180> should

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
the the ramdisk and hopefully should

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.140 
the the ramdisk and hopefully should
hear<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:32.780> can't<00:03:33.020> hear<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.290> from<00:03:34.150> my

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
hear it I can't hear it from my

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.100 
hear it I can't hear it from my
screencast<00:03:35.600> program

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.190 

and<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.250> said

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.870 

before<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.950> shut<00:03:45.130> down<00:03:45.250> your<00:03:45.370> computer<00:03:45.550> you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
before you shut down your computer you

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.500 
before you shut down your computer you
might<00:03:45.970> want<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.210> save<00:03:46.420> these<00:03:46.600> if<00:03:46.960> not

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.339 

they're<00:03:49.720> just<00:03:49.870> going<00:03:50.020> to<00:03:50.080> be<00:03:50.140> erased

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
they're just going to be erased

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.190 
they're just going to be erased
automatically<00:03:51.129> or<00:03:51.340> if<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.239> want<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.900> can

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
automatically or if you want to you can

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.660 
automatically or if you want to you can
eject<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:55.800> you'll<00:03:56.800> also<00:03:56.980> lose<00:03:57.340> on

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
eject it and you'll also lose on

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.020 
eject it and you'll also lose on
everything<00:03:58.660> inside<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.730> RAM<00:04:00.849> disk

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
everything inside the the RAM disk

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.750 
everything inside the the RAM disk
itself<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.800> course<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.160> makes<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.430> easy<00:04:03.550> way

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
itself so of course it makes it easy way

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.790 
itself so of course it makes it easy way
you<00:04:04.239> don't<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:05.050> know<00:04:05.170> let's<00:04:05.440> say<00:04:05.560> we've<00:04:05.680> got<00:04:05.769> a

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
you don't you know let's say we've got a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.309 
you don't you know let's say we've got a
lot<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.010> files<00:04:06.220> on<00:04:06.459> there<00:04:06.700> even<00:04:07.450> one<00:04:08.080> point

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
lot of files on there even one point

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.710 
lot of files on there even one point
five<00:04:08.970> gigabytes<00:04:09.970> you<00:04:10.330> know<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.510> don't<00:04:10.630> have

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
five gigabytes you know you don't have

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.780 
five gigabytes you know you don't have
to<00:04:10.810> worry<00:04:10.930> about<00:04:11.190> putting<00:04:12.190> in<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.489> trash<00:04:12.760> you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
to worry about putting in the trash you

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.910 
to worry about putting in the trash you
just<00:04:13.209> eject<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.050> it<00:04:14.140> just<00:04:14.380> deletes

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
just eject it and it just deletes

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.080 
just eject it and it just deletes
everything<00:04:15.340> automatically

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.439 

and<00:04:21.090> I'm<00:04:21.569> going<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.810> go<00:04:21.900> ahead<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:23.270> get<00:04:24.270> rid<00:04:24.419> of

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
and I'm going to go ahead and get rid of

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.600 
and I'm going to go ahead and get rid of
that<00:04:24.689> I'm<00:04:25.080> gonna<00:04:25.229> go<00:04:25.379> up<00:04:25.500> show<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.889> guys<00:04:26.280> where

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that I'm gonna go up show you guys where

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.740 
that I'm gonna go up show you guys where
you<00:04:26.669> can<00:04:26.819> find<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.270> if<00:04:27.419> you<00:04:27.509> want<00:04:27.689> to

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
you can find that if you want to

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.659 
you can find that if you want to
download<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.319> use<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.530> which<00:04:29.280> is<00:04:29.430> called

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
download it and use it which is called

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.779 
download it and use it which is called
ink<00:04:29.939> scribbles<00:04:30.330> comm<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.460> they<00:04:32.460> got<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.610> few

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
ink scribbles comm and they got a few

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.399 
ink scribbles comm and they got a few
other<00:04:32.939> programs<00:04:33.569> as<00:04:33.960> well

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
other programs as well
