00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.130 
to access this valve cover bolt there's
a<00:00:24.019> couple<00:00:24.380> up<00:00:24.470> here<00:00:24.500> which<00:00:25.000> I'd<00:00:26.000> have<00:00:26.179> it'd<00:00:26.900> be

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.389 
access drill wise so yeah you can only
curse<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:37.879> much<00:00:38.059> you<00:00:38.270> got<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.510> deal<00:00:38.660> with<00:00:38.690> it

first thing if you got some you know if

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.970 
first thing if you got some you know if
it's<00:00:44.270> recess<00:00:44.690> in<00:00:44.899> there<00:00:45.050> put<00:00:45.649> in<00:00:45.739> a<00:00:45.859> little

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
it's recess in there put in a little

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.080 
it's recess in there put in a little
penetrating<00:00:46.699> oil

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
penetrating oil

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.670 
penetrating oil
if<00:00:47.570> you're<00:00:47.809> lucky<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.109> might<00:00:48.320> actually<00:00:48.469> be

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
if you're lucky it might actually be

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.200 
if you're lucky it might actually be
above<00:00:49.070> that<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:51.219> engine<00:00:52.219> block<00:00:52.430> service<00:00:52.940> and

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
above that the engine block service and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.160 
above that the engine block service and
you<00:00:53.690> can<00:00:53.719> use<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.440> wrench<00:00:55.250> or<00:00:55.430> something<00:00:55.760> but

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
you can use a wrench or something but

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.689 
you can use a wrench or something but
it's<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.410> matter<00:00:57.620> of<00:00:57.710> taking<00:00:57.920> your<00:00:58.190> time<00:00:58.370> so

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
it's a matter of taking your time so

00:00:58.699 --> 00:00:59.860 
it's a matter of taking your time so
yeah<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.879> little<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.420> little<00:00:59.660> bit<00:00:59.750> of

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
yeah a little a little bit of

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.169 
yeah a little a little bit of
penetrating<00:01:00.500> oil<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.670> next<00:01:01.940> step<00:01:02.090> is

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
penetrating oil and the next step is

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.560 
penetrating oil and the next step is
going<00:01:02.269> to<00:01:02.329> be<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.859> carefully<00:01:03.859> drill<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:05.030> the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
going to be to carefully drill in the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.050 
going to be to carefully drill in the
middle<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.080> bolt<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.590> ease<00:01:06.950> your<00:01:07.160> screw

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
middle of that bolt to ease your screw

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.010 
middle of that bolt to ease your screw
extractor<00:01:09.130> key<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.340> don't<00:01:11.210> rush<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.630> take<00:01:11.900> your

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
extractor key is don't rush it take your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.340 
extractor key is don't rush it take your
time<00:01:12.290> make<00:01:13.040> sure<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.310> cover<00:01:14.030> these<00:01:14.330> all<00:01:15.110> these

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
time make sure to cover these all these

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.740 
time make sure to cover these all these
holes<00:01:15.620> with<00:01:15.980> rags<00:01:16.430> or<00:01:16.730> something<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:17.270> you

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
holes with rags or something so you

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:49.590 
holes with rags or something so you
don't<00:01:17.780> get<00:01:18.050> any<00:01:18.160> junk<00:01:19.160> in<00:01:19.340> there

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.080 

all<00:01:50.600> right<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.200> been<00:01:51.500> about<00:01:51.670> 30<00:01:52.670> minutes

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
all right so it's been about 30 minutes

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.740 
all right so it's been about 30 minutes
and<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:55.369> can<00:01:55.520> see<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:56.259> I've<00:01:57.259> got<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.680> up<00:01:58.750> it's

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
and you can see it's I've got it up it's

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.979 
and you can see it's I've got it up it's
almost<00:01:59.960> out<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.670> let's<00:02:01.939> just<00:02:07.300> get<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.479> rest<00:02:08.750> of

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
almost out so let's just get the rest of

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:21.009 
almost out so let's just get the rest of
it<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:16.870> voila<00:02:17.870> there<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:19.660> all<00:02:20.660> right<00:02:20.810> so

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
it and voila there it is all right so

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.740 
it and voila there it is all right so
just<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.319> quickly<00:02:21.530> go<00:02:21.830> over<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.970> tools<00:02:23.239> I<00:02:23.450> used

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
just to quickly go over the tools I used

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.140 
just to quickly go over the tools I used
and<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.560> can<00:02:24.709> see<00:02:24.860> basically<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> ideas<00:02:25.549> you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and you can see basically the ideas you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.240 
and you can see basically the ideas you
need<00:02:26.299> to<00:02:26.420> drill<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> hole<00:02:27.019> in<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> middle<00:02:27.500> which

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
need to drill a hole in the middle which

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.890 
need to drill a hole in the middle which
is<00:02:28.400> pretty<00:02:28.610> impossible<00:02:29.209> but<00:02:29.360> close<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
is pretty impossible but close to the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.340 
is pretty impossible but close to the
middle<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.970> want<00:02:32.180> super<00:02:32.660> sharp<00:02:32.989> you

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
middle and so you want super sharp you

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.670 
middle and so you want super sharp you
know<00:02:33.640> basically<00:02:34.930> brand-new<00:02:35.930> drill<00:02:36.440> bits

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
know basically brand-new drill bits

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.520 
know basically brand-new drill bits
makes<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.370> easier<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:38.900> start<00:02:39.290> yeah

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
makes it easier and I just start yeah

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.060 
makes it easier and I just start yeah
basically<00:02:40.269> 1/16<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.510> kind<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.380> work<00:02:42.560> up<00:02:42.799> and

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
basically 1/16 and kind of work up and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.960 
basically 1/16 and kind of work up and
ended<00:02:43.340> with<00:02:43.459> 764<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.959> I'm<00:02:45.049> basically<00:02:45.320> just

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
ended with 764 and I'm basically just

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.970 
ended with 764 and I'm basically just
trying<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.060> drill<00:02:47.329> angle<00:02:48.109> it<00:02:48.200> into<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.590> middle

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
trying to drill angle it into the middle

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.310 
trying to drill angle it into the middle
at<00:02:49.340> some<00:02:49.640> point<00:02:49.910> as<00:02:50.090> you're<00:02:50.239> drilling<00:02:50.480> this

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
at some point as you're drilling this

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.259 
at some point as you're drilling this
screw<00:02:51.680> actually<00:02:52.040> started<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.489> go<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.820> deeper

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
screw actually started to go in deeper

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.840 
screw actually started to go in deeper
so<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.260> knew<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.829> be<00:02:54.950> careful<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.700> don't<00:02:55.730> want

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
so I knew to be careful you don't want

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.479 
so I knew to be careful you don't want
to<00:02:56.030> drive<00:02:56.239> it<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.540> any<00:02:56.690> deeper<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:58.160> then<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.340> use

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
to drive it in any deeper and then I use

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.440 
to drive it in any deeper and then I use
a<00:02:58.519> mix<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.350> you<00:03:00.350> know<00:03:00.470> if<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.709> craftsman<00:03:01.450> this
