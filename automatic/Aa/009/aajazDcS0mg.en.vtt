the<00:01:29.030> number<00:01:29.299> one<00:01:29.450> spot<00:01:29.920> I'm<00:01:30.920> not<00:01:31.009> sure<00:01:31.070> because

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
the number one spot I'm not sure because

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.210 
the number one spot I'm not sure because
we<00:01:32.479> didn't<00:01:32.750> have<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.900> little<00:01:33.259> heart<00:01:33.860> break<00:01:34.040> it

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220
