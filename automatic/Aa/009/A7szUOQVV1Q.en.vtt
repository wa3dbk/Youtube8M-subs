 playing old replays is important and 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.330
 a noticeable change occurred in the format

 named f40 hp. 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.409
 xl it affected the fact that on the minimap 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.229
 missing circles that were tied to 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.150
 specific tank models such as the circle 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.100
 review range guns and 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.310
 other moments where names are used 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.900
 tanks in fashion 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.510
 it turns out that it will have something 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.909
 redo and most simple on my 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.610
 a glance method is take two files from 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.090
 archive with the mod folder of the doggie default and 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.909
 replace them with your own and afterwards open 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.229
 them and manually make changes if 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.510
 of course they were made 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.369
 regarding standards 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.320
 in addition localization has been added

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.910
 editing such as medium level 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.010

 as well as the minimum and maximum 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.540
 I would like to note the level of tank battles 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.860
 that programmers to their always 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.650
 try to do something new 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.660
 useful for you but unfortunately they 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.030
 highly dependent on data obtained from 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.770
 wargaming and therefore often with new 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.290
 update the game adds a new 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.990
 job optimization already existing 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.420
 functions mod hope you have learned for 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.530
 yourself useful information thanks for 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.530
