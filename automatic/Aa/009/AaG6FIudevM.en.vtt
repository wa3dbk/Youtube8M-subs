00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
scene for this we have to add a plane to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.840 
scene for this we have to add a plane to
the<00:01:48.509> ground<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.380> simulate<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> ground<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.700> the

target<00:02:01.920> direct<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.060> target

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
target direct I just like the target

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.010 
target direct I just like the target
directs<00:02:04.189> because<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.640> shadows<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.119> pretty

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
directs because the shadows are pretty

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.320 
directs because the shadows are pretty
good<00:02:07.229> much<00:02:07.740> better<00:02:08.039> than<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.849> shadows<00:02:09.179> like

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
good much better than the shadows like

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
good much better than the shadows like
omnia<00:02:09.780> or<00:02:10.229> something<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.030> scan<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
omnia or something like that scan the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.730 
omnia or something like that scan the
target<00:02:12.690> direct<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.349> in

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
target direct to in

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.160 
target direct to in
cruiser<00:02:14.010> decrease<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.970> area<00:02:15.510> light<00:02:15.840> and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
cruiser decrease the area light and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.280 
cruiser decrease the area light and
shadows<00:02:16.500> will<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.770> simulated<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.620> okay<00:02:20.030> now

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
shadows will be simulated and okay now

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.260 
shadows will be simulated and okay now
move<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.770> light<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.490> position<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.240> have

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
move the light in the position we have

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.940 
move the light in the position we have
the<00:02:24.570> light<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.890> our<00:02:26.810> real<00:02:27.810> scene<00:02:28.230> comes<00:02:28.650> from

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the light of our real scene comes from

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.330 
the light of our real scene comes from
so<00:02:29.250> where<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.820> Sun<00:02:30.240> comes<00:02:30.600> wrong<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.890> comes

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
so where the Sun comes wrong it comes

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.070 
so where the Sun comes wrong it comes
from<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.910> left<00:02:33.150> side<00:02:33.810> somewhere<00:02:34.290> there<00:02:34.730> okay

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
from the left side somewhere there okay

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.740 
from the left side somewhere there okay
place<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.680> ran<00:02:38.100> out<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.760> okay<00:02:39.450> looks

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
place it and ran out so okay looks

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.480 
place it and ran out so okay looks
pretty<00:02:39.840> good<00:02:40.080> now<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.410> want<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.830> add<00:02:40.950> some

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
pretty good now we want to add some

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.190 
pretty good now we want to add some

shadows so go to the modify panel and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.560 
shadows so go to the modify panel and
turn<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.440> shadows<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.250> for<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> shadow<00:02:48.210> time

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
turn on shadows and for the shadow time

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.280 
turn on shadows and for the shadow time
you're<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.350> select<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:51.360> let<00:02:51.630> select

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
we're going to scale the ground plane oh

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.540 
we're going to scale the ground plane oh
my<00:03:01.710> click<00:03:01.980> scan<00:03:03.230> okay<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.560> should<00:03:04.950> be<00:03:05.430> good

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.750 
off anymore go to the modify panel of
the<00:03:12.150> light<00:03:12.600> again<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.260> now<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.580> play

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
one with the settings of the shadow

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.540

parameters now play one with the
settings<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:21.270> get<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.690> white<00:03:21.870> shadows<00:03:22.260> when

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
settings to get the white shadows when

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.790 
settings to get the white shadows when
at<00:03:22.620> all<00:03:22.800> sorry<00:03:23.370> okay<00:03:24.330> now<00:03:24.660> when<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.290> all<00:03:25.440> done

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
watch okay I think shadows are pretty

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.550 
watch okay I think shadows are pretty
hard<00:03:28.800> just<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.400> little<00:03:29.580> bit<00:03:29.790> lighter<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.500> to

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
hard just a little bit lighter so go to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.040 
hard just a little bit lighter so go to
the<00:03:31.890> shadow<00:03:32.160> parameters<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.600> density

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
the shadow parameters and the density

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.960 
the shadow parameters and the density
you<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.500> move<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.980> density<00:03:35.430> though<00:03:35.580> maybe<00:03:35.790> on

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
you can move the density though maybe on

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.580 
you can move the density though maybe on
open<00:03:36.450> six<00:03:36.780> let's<00:03:37.440> draw<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.420> we're<00:03:39.420> not<00:03:39.600> okay

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
open six let's draw this we're not okay

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.680 
one and that way if you when you're out
now<00:04:22.850> you're<00:04:23.850> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.150> see<00:04:24.330> how<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.660> looks

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
now you're going to see how that looks

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.230 
now you're going to see how that looks
when<00:04:25.229> it's<00:04:25.260> composite

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
when it's composite

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.820 
when it's composite
and<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.830> see<00:04:28.099> okay<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:29.630> shadows<00:04:30.020> now<00:04:30.199> seem<00:04:30.680> to

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
and you see okay the shadows now seem to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.490 
and you see okay the shadows now seem to
be<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.009> little<00:04:31.400> bit<00:04:31.639> hard<00:04:31.940> okay<00:04:32.900> I'll<00:04:33.139> let<00:04:33.169> me

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
be a little bit hard okay I'll let me

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.339 
be a little bit hard okay I'll let me
run<00:04:33.680> up<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:33.949> odd<00:04:34.250> again<00:04:34.849> to<00:04:35.030> show<00:04:35.240> you<00:04:35.349> the

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
run up this odd again to show you the

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.999 
run up this odd again to show you the
results<00:04:37.160> okay<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.900> see<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.319> edges<00:04:39.710> are<00:04:39.860> the

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
results okay you see the edges are the

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.860 
results okay you see the edges are the
shadows<00:04:40.310> are<00:04:40.460> very<00:04:40.849> hard<00:04:41.120> instead<00:04:41.509> of<00:04:41.690> the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
shadows are very hard instead of the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.439 
shadows are very hard instead of the
edges<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.860> real<00:04:43.430> shadows<00:04:44.000> an<00:04:44.150> all<00:04:44.270> wheel

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
edges of the real shadows an all wheel

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.529 
edges of the real shadows an all wheel
seen<00:04:44.810> so<00:04:45.560> go<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.039> settings<00:04:46.699> of<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.000> light

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
seen so go to the settings of the light

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.890 
seen so go to the settings of the light

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
choose shadow type area shadows and now

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.390 
choose shadow type area shadows and now
let<00:04:51.139> me<00:04:51.169> run<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.470> ought<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.830> show<00:04:52.039> you<00:04:52.099> what

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
fault right now okay you see the edges

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.420 
fault right now okay you see the edges
now<00:04:58.430> are<00:04:58.669> pretty<00:04:59.000> smooth<00:04:59.330> okay<00:05:00.050> go<00:05:00.830> into<00:05:01.220> the

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
now are pretty smooth okay go into the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.360 
now are pretty smooth okay go into the
area<00:05:01.849> shadows<00:05:02.470> parameters<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:03.680> select<00:05:04.280> the

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
area shadows parameters and select the

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.909 
area shadows parameters and select the
shadow<00:05:05.030> integer<00:05:05.479> e27<00:05:06.409> and<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.650> shadow

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
shadow integer e27 and the shadow

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.469 
shadow integer e27 and the shadow
quality<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.789> them<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.289> Renard<00:05:09.289> again<00:05:09.680> and<00:05:10.479> now

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
quality to them to Renard again and now

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.230 
quality to them to Renard again and now
you're<00:05:12.349> going<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.650> see<00:05:12.889> that<00:05:13.099> the<00:05:13.310> edges<00:05:14.210> are

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
you're going to see that the edges are

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.529 
you're going to see that the edges are
very<00:05:14.990> smooth<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.710> this<00:05:16.069> really<00:05:16.909> looks<00:05:17.180> good

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
very smooth and this really looks good

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.469 
very smooth and this really looks good
maybe<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.860> shadows<00:05:19.280> a<00:05:19.580> little<00:05:19.970> bit<00:05:20.090> too<00:05:20.270> dark

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
maybe the shadows a little bit too dark

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.360 
maybe the shadows a little bit too dark
but<00:05:20.720> okay<00:05:21.050> play<00:05:21.319> one<00:05:21.560> with<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.800> settings<00:05:22.069> and

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
but okay play one with the settings and

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
getting the white light and shadows for

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.520 
getting the white light and shadows for
you<00:05:24.710> again<00:05:25.159> now<00:05:25.819> go<00:05:26.180> to<00:05:27.220> rendering<00:05:28.220> and<00:05:29.530> render

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
you again now go to rendering and render

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.629 
you again now go to rendering and render
setup<00:05:31.210> now<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.270> want<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:32.900> render<00:05:33.080> out<00:05:33.380> the

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
setup now you want to render out the

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.279 
setup now you want to render out the
active<00:05:34.639> temperament<00:05:35.240> so<00:05:35.509> go<00:05:35.659> time<00:05:35.930> I<00:05:35.960> put

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
active temperament so go time I put

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.249 
active temperament so go time I put
active<00:05:36.800> time<00:05:37.039> segment<00:05:37.190> okay<00:05:37.759> the<00:05:38.509> problem<00:05:39.080> is

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
active time segment okay the problem is

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.350 
active time segment okay the problem is
that<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.889> width<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.280> the<00:05:40.400> height<00:05:40.550> of<00:05:40.969> the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
that the width and the height of the

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.450 
that the width and the height of the
output<00:05:41.900> does<00:05:42.259> not<00:05:42.500> match<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:43.009> width<00:05:43.159> and<00:05:43.370> the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
output does not match the width and the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.990 
output does not match the width and the
height<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.820> your<00:05:44.680> real<00:05:45.680> video<00:05:46.250> so<00:05:46.610> it<00:05:46.789> will

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
height of your real video so it will

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.350 
height of your real video so it will
come<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:47.389> complications<00:05:48.259> when<00:05:49.360> compositing

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
come to complications when compositing

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.600 
come to complications when compositing
in<00:05:50.479> artifacts<00:05:50.990> so<00:05:51.259> maybe<00:05:51.590> go<00:05:51.830> to<00:05:51.889> artifacts<00:05:52.460> or

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
in artifacts so maybe go to artifacts or

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.459 
in artifacts so maybe go to artifacts or
somewhere<00:05:52.969> else<00:05:53.000> where<00:05:53.990> you<00:05:54.080> can<00:05:54.259> read<00:05:54.440> all

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469 
somewhere else where you can read all

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.559 
somewhere else where you can read all
the<00:05:54.830> wheel<00:05:55.009> width<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:55.490> height<00:05:55.729> select<00:05:56.449> the

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569

scene you're adding some elements to and

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.990 
scene you're adding some elements to and
reach<00:05:59.419> out<00:05:59.599> what<00:06:00.440> wheel<00:06:00.800> width<00:06:01.130> and<00:06:01.340> height<00:06:01.610> it

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
reach out what wheel width and height it

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.730 
reach out what wheel width and height it
f<00:06:02.960> and<00:06:03.490> then<00:06:04.490> input<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.240> and<00:06:05.539> the<00:06:06.380> width<00:06:06.590> and

the PNG file tube will generate a

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.070 
the PNG file tube will generate a
sequence<00:06:46.130> of<00:06:46.400> fights<00:06:46.699> so<00:06:46.970> we<00:06:47.090> shot<00:06:47.389> save<00:06:47.870> it<00:06:47.900> in

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
sequence of fights so we shot save it in

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.909 
sequence of fights so we shot save it in
a<00:06:48.169> folder<00:06:48.760> we<00:06:49.760> will<00:06:50.090> use<00:06:50.300> PNG<00:06:50.750> file<00:06:51.110> sequence

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
a folder we will use PNG file sequence

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.700 
a folder we will use PNG file sequence
because<00:06:52.840> the<00:06:53.840> other<00:06:53.990> channel<00:06:54.440> will<00:06:54.560> be

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
because the other channel will be

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.439 
because the other channel will be
included<00:06:55.340> and<00:06:56.260> it's<00:06:57.260> a<00:06:57.680> pretty<00:06:58.100> small<00:06:58.449> format

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
included and it's a pretty small format

but<00:07:20.870> to<00:07:20.990> make<00:07:21.139> it<00:07:21.169> realistic<00:07:21.620> I<00:07:22.010> want<00:07:22.280> to<00:07:22.340> add

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
but to make it realistic I want to add

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.730

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
object properties now in the motion

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.610
