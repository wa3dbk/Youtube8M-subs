smoked<00:00:29.399> gray<00:00:30.090> color<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.899> mean<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.469> pretty

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
smoked gray color I mean that pretty

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.930 
smoked gray color I mean that pretty
much<00:00:31.739> everything<00:00:32.009> else<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.430> same<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.850> they

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
much everything else is the same so they

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
much everything else is the same so they
have<00:00:33.030> paracord<00:00:33.540> same<00:00:34.500> sheath<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:35.040> I'll

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
have paracord same sheath which I'll

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.160 
have paracord same sheath which I'll
show<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.670> moment<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.809> me<00:00:36.930> when<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
show you in a moment but for me when I

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.360 
show you in a moment but for me when I
think<00:00:37.350> about<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.620> knives<00:00:37.860> certainly

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
think about these knives certainly

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.470 
think about these knives certainly
neckties<00:00:38.730> people<00:00:39.060> often<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.390> about

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
neckties people often think about

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.340 
neckties people often think about
self-defense

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
self-defense

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560 
self-defense
I<00:00:40.470> like<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.340> knife<00:00:41.580> when<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.880> comes<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.330> kind

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
I like this knife when it comes to kind

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.390 
I like this knife when it comes to kind
of<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.870> secondary<00:00:43.380> knife<00:00:43.650> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> want<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
of that secondary knife if you want to

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.110 
of that secondary knife if you want to
get<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> low-cost<00:00:45.950> night<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.370> wilderness

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
get a low-cost night for wilderness

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
get a low-cost night for wilderness
survival<00:00:48.540> bushcraft<00:00:49.020> camping<00:00:49.470> things<00:00:49.680> like

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
survival bushcraft camping things like

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
survival bushcraft camping things like
that<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.190> maybe<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> larger<00:00:51.120> fixed

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
that so maybe you have a larger fixed

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
that so maybe you have a larger fixed
blade<00:00:51.690> full-tang<00:00:52.560> knife<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.130> want

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
blade full-tang knife but you want

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100 
blade full-tang knife but you want
something<00:00:53.640> smaller<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.360> some<00:00:54.540> more<00:00:54.690> detail

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
something smaller to do some more detail

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.260 
something smaller to do some more detail
maybe<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.980> want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.220> do<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.400> little<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
maybe if you want to do a little bit of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.210 
maybe if you want to do a little bit of
you<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.540> skimming<00:00:58.110> or<00:00:58.440> doing<00:00:59.040> some

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
you know skimming or doing some

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.889 
you know skimming or doing some
preparation<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.820> game<00:01:00.060> you<00:01:00.540> could<00:01:00.690> use

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
preparation of game you could use

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.420 
preparation of game you could use
something<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.530> generally<00:01:02.280> people

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
something like this generally people

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.560 
something like this generally people
like<00:01:02.610> something<00:01:02.880> with<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.210> bit<00:01:03.360> more

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
like something with a little bit more

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
like something with a little bit more
belly<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.259> do<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.649> fine<00:01:05.070> point<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
belly but I do like that fine point and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
belly but I do like that fine point and
that<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> lot<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> blade<00:01:06.869> even

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that you do have a lot of blade even

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.889 
that you do have a lot of blade even
comparing<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> overall<00:01:08.430> size<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
comparing to the overall size of the

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.330 
comparing to the overall size of the
knife<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.079> look<00:01:10.469> at<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.829> close<00:01:10.859> well

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
knife so look at these up close well

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
knife so look at these up close well
show<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.639> sheath<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.539> this<00:01:12.719> is<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> 406

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
show you the sheath so this is the 406

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.649 
show you the sheath so this is the 406
which<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.039> ceramic<00:01:14.579> blade<00:01:14.819> and<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.509> main

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
which is the ceramic blade and the main

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
which is the ceramic blade and the main
advantage<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.109> the<00:01:16.200> ceramic<00:01:16.679> is<00:01:16.859> that<00:01:17.189> it's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
advantage to the ceramic is that it's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.849 
advantage to the ceramic is that it's
going<00:01:17.609> to<00:01:17.759> resist<00:01:18.569> rust<00:01:18.869> extremely

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
going to resist rust extremely

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:20.989 
going to resist rust extremely
effectively<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> rust<00:01:20.850> at

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
effectively it's not going to rust at

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.940 
effectively it's not going to rust at
all<00:01:21.149> essentially<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.079> also<00:01:22.499> it's<00:01:22.799> going

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
all essentially and then also it's going

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.559 
all essentially and then also it's going
to<00:01:23.009> hold<00:01:23.249> an<00:01:23.369> edge<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.789> well<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.389> main

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
to hold an edge really well the main

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:25.910 
to hold an edge really well the main
disadvantage<00:01:25.139> to<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.319> most<00:01:25.560> people<00:01:25.679> think

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
disadvantage to this most people think

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.679 
disadvantage to this most people think
about<00:01:26.039> compared<00:01:26.609> to<00:01:26.789> a<00:01:26.819> metal<00:01:27.179> knife<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.479> just

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
about compared to a metal knife is just

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.389 
about compared to a metal knife is just
it's<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:27.959> going<00:01:28.109> to<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.439> durable<00:01:29.280> though

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
it's not going to be as durable though

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.739 
it's not going to be as durable though
it<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.579> very<00:01:29.789> durable<00:01:29.999> it's<00:01:30.420> probably<00:01:30.659> not

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
it is very durable it's probably not

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:31.940 
it is very durable it's probably not
going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.929> be<00:01:30.990> overall<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.469> durable<00:01:31.829> as

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
going to be overall as durable as

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
going to be overall as durable as
something<00:01:32.399> that's<00:01:32.490> made<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.299> metal<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
something that's made out of metal you

basically proportionally the blade to
the<00:01:37.619> handle<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.069> almost<00:01:38.279> the<00:01:38.429> exact<00:01:38.670> same<00:01:38.819> size

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:39.029 
the handle is almost the exact same size

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:40.699 
the handle is almost the exact same size
we'll<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> tape<00:01:40.229> measure<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.649> a

like<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:29.090> nothing<00:02:30.090> too<00:02:30.239> fancy<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.900> then<00:02:31.230> let's

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
like so nothing too fancy and then let's

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.040 
like so nothing too fancy and then let's
bring<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.010> metal<00:02:32.459> version<00:02:32.580> here<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.209> you

can't see even when swishing we resumed

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.860 
can't see even when swishing we resumed
you<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> difference<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.690> color

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870

all the same features on this one flip

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.650 
all the same features on this one flip
it<00:02:41.640> over<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:41.940> other<00:02:42.030> side<00:02:42.269> just<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.599> you

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
it over to the other side just so you

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.080 
it over to the other side just so you
can<00:02:42.750> see<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.080> looks<00:02:43.260> like

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
can see what that looks like

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.690
