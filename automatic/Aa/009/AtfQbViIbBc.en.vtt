00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.979
 Hello and welcome to the second video of the series 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:07.020
 counter-strike 2 d Vettel "The Toyota expensive 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:10.519
 so 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.910
 Next land as it minimizes the we totally tired around in the previous one 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.179
 have created 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.989
 that was one 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.989
 the 2 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.499
 Today I do not want to show you how you are 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.810
 first 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.419
 the templates 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.210
 so weapons 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.310
 if the Kate can install 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.200
 so 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.260
 where weapons are just lying around 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.490
 and you have to go to Item 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.490
 go and then just place one here 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.310
 lights 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.969
 so at et al a Dietrich animal 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.049
 what are the topics in the eighth time namely a professional in 4 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.210
 and Brass Band you can decide 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.620
 were 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.100
 the um 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.450
 one the item 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.740
 should reappear when Steinmeier was used 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.000
 and one thing is that's back to the picture that's always there 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.100
 and every EGS sparkling wine and is you can 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.180
 to adjust 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.930
 how long must 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.210
 Percent takes until it is back 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.570
 just after that 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.480
 and that means there is always there 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.730
 that is, it is now more pm just around 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.730
 do the same again Mölzer 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.730
 Coupons Hikes Airports fixed No 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.830
 Euro 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 and I think we'll do the same 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.450
 around 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.809
 Meyer mourning drove next to pick four 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.370
 then you are not married yet choose to spray 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.320
 me here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.980
 ca 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.340
 Jazz is synonymous with Maps Woman 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.940
 No one at Sun has so you can not buy anything and at ABB fall 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.020
 annoys a party on the floor around but hey nothing else 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.199
 to buy 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.119
 and if we order one more hold on the Phono Bayern 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.189
 and just magically make radius Unity Stream 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.199
 and does the same thing Cities Bonn too 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.339
 Now there may be a directive 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.130
 and if you too 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.419
 Give Renault 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.189
 So do not want to make weapons 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.809
 This is 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.389
 There are servers like that too 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.799
 Where 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.740
 I'm where the pockets are not full in the previous round anymore 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.299
 so has 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.349
 if one is now a round 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.749
 Bern wins or loses 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:56.010
 and in the next round you do not have your weapon anymore if we have something like that 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.009
 want to make the Newey Plöbst 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.330
 Circle the Eidg 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
 just once again 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.789
 illogical then 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:13.139
 breaks also theirs at the beginning and no end 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
 to BAFA but only a knife 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.499
 if we try it out now as well as spokesman 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.329
 and go out thanks 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.289
 and then want to play 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.389
 I forget how to turn on the bots 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.639
 but that 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.639
 is still ok 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.899
 Now you do not have to buy anything and you see, there are no prices and 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.649
 Quantities and I have too 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:55.909
 I do not have only Nightmare 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.749
 then not just my promises » 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:00.419
 and a 4 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.239
 As you can see, the IOMs lie and when you collect them 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.579
 they are lying too 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.579
 back there 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.819
 No and they are also darkened 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.449
 and that's all 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.449
 just fine because it works 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.240
 and if you 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.509
 no Geisinger couple wanted CLS 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.029
 Rust itself 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:34.590
 I can help you too 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.009
 in order to simply again on the 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.629
 the the drugs 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:41.930
 Nestler next to the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.340
 and sport so you do not necessarily make the web I do it 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.569
 the BOM spots scrap 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.110
 so and then 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.710
 Lynch 2 costs 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.029
 when he got the door out of the lane and 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:57.029
 Just make Intel brand work because people are here 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.229
 So it was not because that's because you have to guard here a shelter 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.400
 and her one and one here 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.439
 and then need the thermal could bounce after a shot 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.300
 and that's here 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.300
 and then you just do a little bit of work here 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.669
 to save the animal 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.169
 and 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.620
 play 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.620
 the whole thing 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.599
 why here are the weapons 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.319
 and there are the hostages too 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:58.300
 Well 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.449
 around 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.610
 the war then with the hostages 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.499
 and 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.069
 around 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.430
 one thing after 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.619
 so 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.739
 if the hostages do not like what they look like yet 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:21.059
 here eaves and you will be watching a whole range of things to do here so here 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.469
 Merkel and her husband make 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.189
 and 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.009
 So Wars and so she took quite different looks at the hostages 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.639
 No, that was RP's second fidelity with our eyes 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:40.580
 around 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.080
 Ulrich will certainly have a third and more likely one 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.330
 fourth jump out 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.649
 Yes, Bonn just turns on again 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.649
 Bari - have it and 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:55.139
 then the war already
