00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
yeah last year was really heartbreaking

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.640 
yeah last year was really heartbreaking
on<00:00:12.280> he<00:00:12.789> there's<00:00:13.750> not<00:00:13.959> many<00:00:14.139> people<00:00:14.379> who<00:00:14.530> ever

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
on he there's not many people who ever

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.740 
on he there's not many people who ever
been<00:00:14.860> clear<00:00:15.369> the<00:00:15.519> year<00:00:15.639> back-to-back<00:00:15.879> and<00:00:16.509> and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
been clear the year back-to-back and and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.890 
been clear the year back-to-back and and
to<00:00:17.259> come<00:00:18.039> down<00:00:18.250> to<00:00:18.490> one<00:00:18.669> shot<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.240> throw<00:00:19.689> that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
to come down to one shot and throw that

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.200 
to come down to one shot and throw that
shot<00:00:20.200> on<00:00:20.680> a<00:00:20.829> demanding<00:00:21.490> condition<00:00:22.029> and

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
shot on a demanding condition and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.909 
shot on a demanding condition and
leaving<00:00:22.779> a<00:00:22.900> pin<00:00:23.140> was<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.939> was<00:00:25.119> brutal<00:00:25.329> and

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
leaving a pin was that was brutal and

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.810 
leaving a pin was that was brutal and
you<00:00:26.919> know<00:00:27.009> there's<00:00:27.189> not<00:00:27.309> a<00:00:27.369> lot<00:00:27.579> of<00:00:27.610> ways<00:00:27.790> to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
you know there's not a lot of ways to

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you know there's not a lot of ways to
fix<00:00:28.210> that<00:00:28.419> one<00:00:29.399> so<00:00:30.399> i<00:00:30.700> guess<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.509> most<00:00:31.689> i've

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
fix that one so i guess the most i've

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.799 
fix that one so i guess the most i've
taken<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.320> that<00:00:33.120> taking<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.270> ability<00:00:34.570> to<00:00:34.690> make

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
taken is that taking the ability to make

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.319 
taken is that taking the ability to make
that<00:00:34.989> shot<00:00:35.320> which<00:00:36.250> i<00:00:36.370> did<00:00:36.550> I<00:00:36.700> done<00:00:36.940> before<00:00:37.239> to

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
that shot which i did I done before to

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.450 
that shot which i did I done before to
win<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.570> US<00:00:37.780> open<00:00:38.140> it<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.440> take<00:00:38.920> that<00:00:39.160> forward

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
win the US open it and take that forward

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.120 
win the US open it and take that forward
and<00:00:39.760> knowing<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:41.110> performances<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.770> TV

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
and knowing that my performances on TV

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.870 
and knowing that my performances on TV
have<00:00:42.250> gotten<00:00:42.579> better<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:42.940> better<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:45.850> a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
have gotten better and better there is a

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.090 
have gotten better and better there is a
challenge<00:00:46.329> though<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.960> Detroit<00:00:47.500> did<00:00:47.680> not<00:00:47.739> go

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
challenge though and Detroit did not go

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.819 
challenge though and Detroit did not go
extremely<00:00:48.910> well<00:00:49.180> for<00:00:49.210> me<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:49.780> I<00:00:50.140> have<00:00:50.560> a<00:00:50.620> lot<00:00:50.800> of

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
extremely well for me so I have a lot of

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.290 
extremely well for me so I have a lot of
challenges<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.400> left<00:00:51.579> in<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:51.760> second<00:00:52.150> half

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
challenges the left in the second half

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.650 
challenges the left in the second half
of<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.450> year<00:00:52.480> it's<00:00:52.780> not<00:00:53.370> insurmountable

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
of the year it's not insurmountable

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440 
of the year it's not insurmountable
nobody's<00:00:55.660> ran<00:00:56.260> away<00:00:56.410> with<00:00:56.770> anything<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.520> so

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
nobody's ran away with anything and so

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.910 
nobody's ran away with anything and so
with<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.690> second<00:00:59.079> half<00:00:59.200> will<00:00:59.380> determine<00:00:59.770> a<00:00:59.800> lot

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
with a second half will determine a lot

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.319 
with a second half will determine a lot
of<00:01:00.100> whether<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.340> have<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.489> chance<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.970> win<00:01:01.090> player

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
of whether I have a chance to win player

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.000 
of whether I have a chance to win player
of<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.480> year<00:01:01.630> or<00:01:01.720> not<00:01:01.840> but<00:01:02.440> it's<00:01:02.590> still<00:01:02.710> my<00:01:02.890> own

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
of the year or not but it's still my own

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.259 
of the year or not but it's still my own
hands<00:01:03.250> there's<00:01:03.489> nobody's<00:01:03.820> going<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.030> run<00:01:04.149> away

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
hands there's nobody's going to run away

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.560 
hands there's nobody's going to run away
and<00:01:04.740> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:07.000> with<00:01:07.119> some<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.450> new<00:01:07.540> things

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
and I think with some of the new things

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.830 
and I think with some of the new things
that<00:01:07.840> we<00:01:07.990> have<00:01:08.079> coming<00:01:08.380> out<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:08.770> next<00:01:09.009> year<00:01:09.340> I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that we have coming out this next year I

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.450 
that we have coming out this next year I
can<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:11.170> can<00:01:11.439> compete<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.799> can<00:01:12.070> make<00:01:12.189> a<00:01:12.219> big<00:01:12.430> run

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
can I can compete I can make a big run

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.640 
can I can compete I can make a big run
the<00:01:12.850> second<00:01:13.180> half<00:01:13.329> and<00:01:13.690> and<00:01:14.080> try<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.409> pull<00:01:14.590> off

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
the second half and and try and pull off

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.310 
the second half and and try and pull off
a<00:01:14.710> flare

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.200 

well<00:01:21.800> they<00:01:21.920> have<00:01:22.040> changed<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.550> five<00:01:22.760> patterns

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
well they have changed the five patterns

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.240 
well they have changed the five patterns
the<00:01:23.900> biggest<00:01:24.260> change<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:24.770> on<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.010> cheetah

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
the biggest change is on the cheetah

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.250 
the biggest change is on the cheetah
pattern<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:26.030> shorter<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.780> gutter<00:01:27.050> is

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
pattern it's shorter and the gutter is

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260 
pattern it's shorter and the gutter is
back<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.830> so<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:28.550> much<00:01:28.820> much<00:01:29.060> higher

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
back and so it's much much higher

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.810 
back and so it's much much higher
scoring<00:01:29.720> than<00:01:29.900> it<00:01:29.990> has<00:01:30.140> been<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:31.640> they've

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
scoring than it has been and they've

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.860 
scoring than it has been and they've
changed<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.210> other<00:01:32.330> patterns<00:01:32.720> as<00:01:32.840> well

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
changed the other patterns as well

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.540 
changed the other patterns as well
basically<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.650> other<00:01:33.770> four<00:01:34.040> patterns<00:01:34.310> are

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
basically the other four patterns are

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.630 
basically the other four patterns are
all<00:01:34.580> harder<00:01:35.240> than<00:01:35.420> they<00:01:35.540> were<00:01:35.600> last<00:01:35.720> year<00:01:36.640> it's

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
all harder than they were last year it's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.280 
all harder than they were last year it's
been<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> bigger<00:01:38.150> challenge<00:01:38.479> i<00:01:38.840> don't<00:01:39.020> think

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
been a bigger challenge i don't think

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.570 
been a bigger challenge i don't think
the<00:01:39.380> scores<00:01:39.710> are<00:01:39.800> going<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.010> be<00:01:40.130> particularly

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
the scores are going to be particularly

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.550 
the scores are going to be particularly
high<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:40.820> those<00:01:41.119> four<00:01:41.390> weeks<00:01:41.600> you're<00:01:42.380> going<00:01:42.470> to

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
high in those four weeks you're going to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.980 
high in those four weeks you're going to
have<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.830> play<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.610> little<00:01:44.060> more<00:01:44.300> direct<00:01:44.630> on<00:01:44.810> all

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
have to play a little more direct on all

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.630 
have to play a little more direct on all
of<00:01:45.110> them<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.350> try<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.740> control<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.190> pocket

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
of them to try and control the pocket

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.660 
of them to try and control the pocket
it's<00:01:46.820> going<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.000> be<00:01:47.090> more<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.390> shot<00:01:47.630> makers

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
it's going to be more of a shot makers

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.830 
it's going to be more of a shot makers
deal<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.910> it's<00:01:50.210> going<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.360> be<00:01:50.450> less<00:01:50.600> about

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
deal and it's going to be less about

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.220 
deal and it's going to be less about
trying<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.259> create<00:01:51.500> area<00:01:51.800> on<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.950> lane

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.290 

well<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.950> toughest<00:01:59.490> competitor<00:02:00.090> on

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
well I think the toughest competitor on

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.170 
well I think the toughest competitor on

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
tour right now you know a lot of ways if

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.990 
tour right now you know a lot of ways if
it<00:02:06.470> it's<00:02:07.470> Wes<00:02:07.740> Malott<00:02:07.950> right<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.430> for<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it it's Wes Malott right now for the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.030 
it it's Wes Malott right now for the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
reasons of how he's able to match up

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.620 
reasons of how he's able to match up
with<00:02:11.370> what's<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.970> he's<00:02:12.150> got<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> unique

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
with what's going on he's got a unique

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.810 
with what's going on he's got a unique
skill<00:02:13.020> set<00:02:13.050> he<00:02:13.560> matches<00:02:14.160> up<00:02:14.370> very<00:02:14.400> well<00:02:14.640> with

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
skill set he matches up very well with

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.820 
skill set he matches up very well with
what's<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.270> on<00:02:15.450> tour<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.590> obviously

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
what's going on tour and that obviously

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.560 
what's going on tour and that obviously
makes<00:02:17.250> them<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> huge<00:02:17.910> force<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.540> that

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
makes them a huge force with that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.670 
makes them a huge force with that
reverie<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.460> it's<00:02:20.460> great<00:02:20.610> leverage<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
reverie and it's great leverage but you

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320 
reverie and it's great leverage but you
also<00:02:22.860> have<00:02:23.130> guys<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.610> norm<00:02:23.820> Duke<00:02:24.030> who<00:02:24.240> are

me to be successful on tour is to really

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.080 
me to be successful on tour is to really
get<00:03:22.439> my<00:03:22.590> ball<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.799> read<00:03:23.159> a<00:03:23.189> lot<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.939> mid

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
get my ball to read a lot in the mid

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.240 
get my ball to read a lot in the mid
lane<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.569> be<00:03:24.840> smooth<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.319> continuous<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:26.129> I

lane and be smooth and continuous if I
can<00:03:26.400> get<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.760> roll<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.299> continuation

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
can get it to roll with continuation

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.199 
can get it to roll with continuation
then<00:03:28.799> have<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.010> chance<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.310> control<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.760> pocket

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.929 
then have a chance to control the pocket
that<00:03:30.390> lets<00:03:30.599> me<00:03:30.689> use<00:03:30.780> my<00:03:31.049> different<00:03:31.409> tools<00:03:31.939> when

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
that lets me use my different tools when

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.850 
that lets me use my different tools when
i<00:03:32.970> when<00:03:33.510> my<00:03:33.540> bar<00:03:33.840> accent<00:03:34.200> gets<00:03:34.319> far<00:03:34.560> down<00:03:34.739> the

I'm<00:03:37.319> pretty<00:03:37.620> uncomfortable<00:03:37.980> with<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.280> I

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
I'm pretty uncomfortable with that I

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.069 
I'm pretty uncomfortable with that I
have<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.700> hard<00:03:38.909> time<00:03:39.060> controlling<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.959> have

before<00:03:49.409> the<00:03:49.680> end<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:49.950> pattern<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.489> lot<00:03:50.819> of

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
before the end of the pattern a lot of

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.059 
before the end of the pattern a lot of
these<00:03:50.970> patterns<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.420> makes<00:03:51.599> it<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.840> 30<00:03:52.049> 33<00:03:52.739> to

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
these patterns that makes it a 30 33 to

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.399 
these patterns that makes it a 30 33 to
36<00:03:53.370> foot<00:03:53.790> range<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.299> then<00:03:54.690> continue<00:03:55.200> through

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
36 foot range and then continue through

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.640 
36 foot range and then continue through
the<00:03:55.440> pins

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.819 

I<00:04:02.120> think<00:04:03.120> it's<00:04:03.269> very<00:04:03.569> satisfying<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.650> maybe

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
I think it's very satisfying and maybe

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.520 
I think it's very satisfying and maybe
ultimately<00:04:05.250> it's<00:04:05.730> really<00:04:06.030> peaceful<00:04:06.299> to<00:04:06.989> to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
ultimately it's really peaceful to to

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.210 
ultimately it's really peaceful to to
have<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.709> tournament<00:04:08.069> go<00:04:09.000> well<00:04:09.890> well<00:04:10.890> well<00:04:11.040> on

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
have a tournament go well well well on

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.390 
have a tournament go well well well on

time that you've spent working on all
these<00:04:16.440> different<00:04:16.709> things<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.329> pieces

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
these different things that the pieces

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.629 
these different things that the pieces
of<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.810> puzzle<00:04:18.930> came<00:04:19.289> together<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.739> for<00:04:20.609> a
