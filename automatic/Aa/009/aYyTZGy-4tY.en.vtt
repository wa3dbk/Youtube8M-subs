product of the turtle dock that I made

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.589 
product of the turtle dock that I made
out<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.880> PVC<00:00:09.179> piping<00:00:10.790> fixtures<00:00:11.790> or<00:00:12.360> whatever

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
out of PVC piping fixtures or whatever

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.019 
out of PVC piping fixtures or whatever
and<00:00:13.250> some<00:00:14.599> sheets<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.719> acrylic<00:00:16.880> this<00:00:17.880> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
and some sheets of acrylic this is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.580 
and some sheets of acrylic this is
basically<00:00:18.390> what<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.750> looks<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.470> is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
basically what it looks like this is

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.820 
basically what it looks like this is
going<00:00:19.800> inside<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.490> 40<00:00:20.880> gallon<00:00:21.000> breeder<00:00:21.390> tank

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.580 

there's<00:00:25.830> um<00:00:26.570> first<00:00:27.570> level<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:27.990> gonna<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.199> in

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
there's um first level is gonna be in

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.200 
there's um first level is gonna be in
shallow<00:00:28.830> water<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> second<00:00:30.060> level

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
shallow water this is the second level

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.580 
shallow water this is the second level
which<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.660> gonna<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.960> above<00:00:31.320> water<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.559> I

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
which is gonna be above water and so I

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.940 
which is gonna be above water and so I
basically<00:00:35.250> cut<00:00:36.079> everything<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> acrylic

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
basically cut everything all the acrylic

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.920 
basically cut everything all the acrylic
here<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.190> cut<00:00:38.460> from<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.730> sheet<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.660> try<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
here is cut from one sheet and try to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.270 
here is cut from one sheet and try to
use<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:40.230> much<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:40.920> sheet<00:00:41.160> as

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
use as much of that one sheet as

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
use as much of that one sheet as
possible<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:42.750> blue<00:00:42.989> thing<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.350> there

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
possible that blue thing right there

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.569 
possible that blue thing right there
just<00:00:43.770> poster<00:00:44.129> puddi<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.399> used<00:00:46.250> stick<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
just poster puddi I used stick it to the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.439 
just poster puddi I used stick it to the
PVC<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.800> just<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.820> ramp<00:00:51.059> just

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
PVC for now just to get the ramp just

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.740 
PVC for now just to get the ramp just
right<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.930> use<00:00:52.350> silicone<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.100> glue<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.750> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
right I use silicone to glue it down to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.920 
right I use silicone to glue it down to
the<00:00:55.620> acrylic<00:00:55.860> peaceful<00:00:56.430> bunch<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> other

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
the acrylic peaceful bunch of the other

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.630 
the acrylic peaceful bunch of the other
and<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.649> think<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.890> hardest<00:01:00.160> part<00:01:00.430> was<00:01:00.520> getting

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
and I think the hardest part was getting

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.270 
and I think the hardest part was getting
that<00:01:00.820> 150<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.629> be<00:01:01.719> great<00:01:01.930> yeah<00:01:02.230> 150<00:01:02.829> degree

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
that 150 to be great yeah 150 degree

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.750 
that 150 to be great yeah 150 degree
angle<00:01:03.699> further<00:01:04.600> ramp<00:01:04.930> I<00:01:05.320> actually<00:01:06.159> used<00:01:06.580> a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
angle further ramp I actually used a

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.120 
angle further ramp I actually used a
stove<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:08.500> melt<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:09.040> which<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.490> tough

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
stove to melt that which is tough

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.249 
stove to melt that which is tough
crazy<00:01:12.130> maybe<00:01:12.460> but<00:01:12.790> tough<00:01:13.030> that's<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.869> second

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
crazy maybe but tough that's the second

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.700 
crazy maybe but tough that's the second
level<00:01:14.500> which<00:01:15.399> I<00:01:15.580> cut<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.210> same<00:01:16.450> size<00:01:16.710> length

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
level which I cut the same size length

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.730 
level which I cut the same size length
as<00:01:19.320> first<00:01:20.320> level<00:01:20.619> I<00:01:22.140> flipped<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.200> over<00:01:23.350> cuz<00:01:23.680> I

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
as first level I flipped it over cuz I

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.719 
as first level I flipped it over cuz I
don't<00:01:23.890> want<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.479> floor<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:27.220> not<00:01:27.280> sure<00:01:27.580> if<00:01:27.670> I'm

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
don't want the floor I'm not sure if I'm

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.840 
don't want the floor I'm not sure if I'm
gonna<00:01:27.880> use<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.149> pole<00:01:28.420> same<00:01:28.750> poster<00:01:29.140> puddi

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
gonna use that pole same poster puddi

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.029 
gonna use that pole same poster puddi
once<00:01:30.850> it's<00:01:31.000> underwater<00:01:31.509> cuz<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:32.530> don't<00:01:32.590> know<00:01:32.860> if

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
once it's underwater cuz I don't know if

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.100 
once it's underwater cuz I don't know if
when<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.399> was<00:01:33.550> gonna<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.929> same

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
when I was gonna have the same

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.279 
when I was gonna have the same
stickiness<00:01:35.649> underwater<00:01:36.490> or<00:01:37.210> above<00:01:37.420> water<00:01:37.630> I'm

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
stickiness underwater or above water I'm

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.999 
stickiness underwater or above water I'm
probably<00:01:38.920> just<00:01:39.070> gonna<00:01:39.280> set<00:01:39.970> it<00:01:40.060> on<00:01:40.179> top<00:01:41.009> yeah

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
probably just gonna set it on top yeah

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.889 
probably just gonna set it on top yeah
some<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.520> corners<00:01:43.030> burnt<00:01:43.330> as<00:01:43.479> straight

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
some of the corners burnt as straight

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.190 
some of the corners burnt as straight
but<00:01:44.229> I<00:01:45.119> wasn't<00:01:46.119> very<00:01:46.240> technical<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:46.899> building

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
but I wasn't very technical in building

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.419 
but I wasn't very technical in building
this<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.630> didn't<00:01:50.289> use<00:01:50.500> up<00:01:50.530> that's<00:01:51.130> like<00:01:51.310> one

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
this and I didn't use up that's like one

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.550 
this and I didn't use up that's like one
of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.550> only<00:01:52.470> non<00:01:54.479> 90-degree<00:01:55.479> opals<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.350> I

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
of the only non 90-degree opals that I

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.429 
of the only non 90-degree opals that I
used<00:01:57.009> was<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.729> T<00:01:58.509> crossing

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
used was that T crossing

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
used was that T crossing
because<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.470> couldn't<00:02:01.740> find<00:02:01.829> any<00:02:02.450> corner

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
because I couldn't find any corner

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.229 
because I couldn't find any corner
pieces<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:05.670> connect<00:02:06.030> three<00:02:06.979> pipes<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
pieces to connect three pipes and so I

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.630 
pieces to connect three pipes and so I
had<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.569> use<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:09.959> elbows<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.430> it

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
had to use all elbows for this and it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.350 
had to use all elbows for this and it
was<00:02:14.730> basically<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.300> learning<00:02:15.690> process

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
was basically the learning process

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.540 
was basically the learning process
this<00:02:18.360> was<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.870> I'm<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:19.769> like<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> great<00:02:20.220> drawer

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
this was the I'm not like a great drawer

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.470 
this was the I'm not like a great drawer
so<00:02:20.910> my<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> drawing<00:02:21.630> but<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:23.180> my<00:02:24.180> plan

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
so my in the drawing but this is my plan

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.630 
so my in the drawing but this is my plan
and<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.900> measurements<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.410> made<00:02:25.590> out<00:02:25.769> for<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and the measurements I made out for the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.090 
and the measurements I made out for the
dot<00:02:28.849> so<00:02:29.849> yeah<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.060> wanted<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.980> turned<00:02:31.980> out

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
dot so yeah I wanted it to be turned out

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.949 
dot so yeah I wanted it to be turned out

I'm<00:02:42.300> actually<00:02:42.480> using<00:02:42.750> right<00:02:43.020> now<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.410> my<00:02:43.560> buff

I'm actually using right now for my buff

I'm actually using right now for my buff
tank

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
tank

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.510 
tank
basking<00:02:45.390> area<00:02:45.540> from<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.380> 29<00:02:46.740> gallon<00:02:46.890> gallon

basking area from the 29 gallon gallon
turtles<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.270> right<00:02:48.420> now<00:02:48.950> these<00:02:49.950> are<00:02:50.010> some

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
turtles and right now these are some

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.280 
turtles and right now these are some
pretty<00:02:50.460> crude<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.910> measurements<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:54.290> would

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
pretty crude and measurements I would

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.600 
pretty crude and measurements I would
actually<00:02:55.440> recommend<00:02:55.740> because<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.340> took<00:02:56.400> these

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
actually recommend because I took these

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.590 
actually recommend because I took these
measurements<00:02:57.240> for<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.080> pipe<00:02:58.290> without<00:02:59.600> adding

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
measurements for the pipe without adding

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.630 
measurements for the pipe without adding
in<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> fact<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.590> elbows<00:03:02.130> and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
in the fact that the elbows and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.610 
in the fact that the elbows and
connections<00:03:03.210> would<00:03:03.630> have<00:03:04.110> an<00:03:04.200> effect<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.560> that

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
connections would have an effect on that

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.590 
connections would have an effect on that
measurement<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.520> had<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> mix<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.270> lot<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
measurement so I had a mix a lot of

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.530 
measurement so I had a mix a lot of
adjustments<00:03:07.100> in<00:03:08.100> making<00:03:08.490> these<00:03:08.820> pipe<00:03:09.090> shorter

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
adjustments in making these pipe shorter

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.170 
adjustments in making these pipe shorter
to<00:03:09.990> be<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> little<00:03:10.410> fit<00:03:10.560> inside<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.280> tank<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:12.120> I

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
to be a little fit inside the tank so I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.590 
to be a little fit inside the tank so I
would<00:03:12.270> recommend<00:03:12.890> adding<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.130> length<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
would recommend adding the length of the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.160 
would recommend adding the length of the
elbows<00:03:15.990> in<00:03:16.320> with<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.160> length<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.610> pipe

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
elbows in with the length of the pipe

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.190 
elbows in with the length of the pipe
it's<00:03:19.170> gonna<00:03:19.290> make<00:03:19.500> your<00:03:19.650> life<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.800> lot<00:03:19.980> easier

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
it's gonna make your life a lot easier

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.600 
it's gonna make your life a lot easier
as<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.290> can<00:03:22.440> see<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.620> also<00:03:22.830> added<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.910 

t-junctions<00:03:26.850> for<00:03:27.180> support<00:03:27.600> on<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.560> on<00:03:28.680> top

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
t-junctions for support on one on top

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.520 
t-junctions for support on one on top
and<00:03:29.220> fed<00:03:29.820> for<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.060> legs<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
and fed for the legs and this is the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
and fed for the legs and this is the
aquarium<00:03:32.160> sealant<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.850> used<00:03:34.220> actually<00:03:35.220> as<00:03:35.400> you

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
aquarium sealant I used actually as you

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.610 
aquarium sealant I used actually as you
can<00:03:35.580> see<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.000> didn't<00:03:36.420> use<00:03:36.540> very<00:03:36.780> much<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.140> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
can see I didn't use very much of it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.370 
can see I didn't use very much of it
for<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.370> large<00:03:38.610> bottle<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.390> think<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.020> cost

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
for this large bottle I think this cost

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.980 
for this large bottle I think this cost
me<00:03:40.560> about<00:03:40.680> ten<00:03:40.890> bucks<00:03:41.040> for<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.940> three<00:03:42.780> hours

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
me about ten bucks for the three hours

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:50.050 
me about ten bucks for the three hours
clear

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.490 

these<00:03:50.900> are<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.110> leftover<00:03:51.530> pieces<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.950> have

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
these are the leftover pieces I have

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.650 
these are the leftover pieces I have
that's<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:56.040> 90<00:03:57.040> degree<00:03:57.340> elbow<00:03:57.730> which<00:03:58.330> I<00:03:58.450> think

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
that's a 90 degree elbow which I think

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.170 
that's a 90 degree elbow which I think
I'm<00:03:58.810> gonna<00:03:58.990> use<00:03:59.110> one<00:03:59.470> to<00:04:00.100> make<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.340> spray<00:04:00.940> bar

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
I'm gonna use one to make a spray bar

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.710 
I'm gonna use one to make a spray bar
for<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.140> flooville<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.710> I<00:04:02.770> just<00:04:02.950> bought

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
for the flooville that I just bought

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.510 
for the flooville that I just bought
I'll<00:04:04.720> do<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:04.900> later<00:04:05.020> these<00:04:05.710> are<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.010> extra

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
I'll do that later these are the extra

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.280 
I'll do that later these are the extra
pieces<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.940> acrylic<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.510> want<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.840> do<00:04:07.930> something

pieces of acrylic I want to do something

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.560 
pieces of acrylic I want to do something
with<00:04:08.410> them<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:08.800> I'm<00:04:08.890> not<00:04:09.160> quite<00:04:09.910> sure

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
with them but I'm not quite sure

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.000 
with them but I'm not quite sure
yeah<00:04:10.900> but<00:04:11.260> they're<00:04:11.650> there<00:04:11.800> in<00:04:11.920> case<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.100> need<00:04:12.340> it

and<00:04:15.010> this<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:15.430> my<00:04:15.640> exacto<00:04:16.359> knife<00:04:16.570> kit<00:04:19.079> but

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
and this is my exacto knife kit but

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.680 
and this is my exacto knife kit but
piece<00:04:20.769> always<00:04:20.980> comes<00:04:21.310> apart<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:22.480> then<00:04:22.600> of

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
piece always comes apart and then of

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.120 
piece always comes apart and then of
course<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:23.050> checked<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.470> see<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.800> hurt<00:04:23.980> my

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
course I checked to see if I hurt my

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.390 
course I checked to see if I hurt my
finger<00:04:24.190> here<00:04:24.670> cuz<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:24.940> felt<00:04:25.060> like<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.510> I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
finger here cuz I felt like it it I

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.230 
finger here cuz I felt like it it I
don't<00:04:27.400> think<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.640> did

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.350

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
yeah sorry about that closer but this

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.240 
yeah sorry about that closer but this
was<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.630> knife<00:04:34.840> that<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.350> use<00:04:35.710> to<00:04:36.039> cut<00:04:36.220> the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
was the knife that I use to cut the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.150 
was the knife that I use to cut the
acrylic<00:04:37.319> I'll<00:04:38.319> show<00:04:38.470> you<00:04:38.530> how<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.740> did<00:04:38.889> it<00:04:38.949> in<00:04:39.130> a

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
acrylic I'll show you how I did it in a

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.640 
acrylic I'll show you how I did it in a
minute<00:04:39.419> it's<00:04:40.419> just<00:04:40.599> a<00:04:40.660> crude<00:04:40.930> way<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.169> showing

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
minute it's just a crude way of showing

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.980 
minute it's just a crude way of showing
you<00:04:41.740> my<00:04:42.060> scratch<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.449> over<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:43.870> over

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
you my scratch that it over and over

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.469 
you my scratch that it over and over
again<00:04:44.280> about<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.490> third<00:04:45.849> to<00:04:45.880> half<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.360> way

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
again about a third to half the way
