00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.240
 every interior stands or falls by a floor 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.290
 and because there are of course many people who come to visit you, that is the reason 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 he makes the right choice and that is possible at the floriade 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.360
 Jan Kooijman times could win his ankle 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.360
 I think that explains why 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 it was a shock 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.310
 makes time for it 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.940
 I would like to have enough time for the customer 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.160
 That's why we also work to make an appointment at all our locations 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.800
 in the north, central and southern netherlands, mainly women are employed in sales 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.930
 and that is because they are one 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.600
 the old-fashioned about the personal wishes of our customers and we watch 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.590
 to that 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.440
 in spain and atmosphere of the people at home and search for a fitting past now 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.240
 are the prices 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.730
 our hair prices are competitive 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.060
 That's because their own import and scrap owner 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.430
 meanwhile have few intermediaries 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.730
 and so, for example, cheaper and and 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.730
 maybe it is even the cheapest in the Netherlands for the trip 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.820
 by sticking to the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.310
 the sheep are in stock, we can ensure that experience can be delivered quickly 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.340
 If the rail is up to the mark, it may even cause the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.210
 the land on the thigh the next day well that is clear 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.130
 the choice of volcano traces and good advice 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.540
 You can then lean back on the Maas side, but the benches of course still have to be raised 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.540
 made to measure and that happens here and in Friesland 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.790
 the order for the country is now coming in 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.610
 what happens next 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.350
 then we go on the a12 or the application 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.220
 we want at our own discretion 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.010
 55 released 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.900
 down 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.699
 even if you are after taking office if that says so 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.329
 the minimum win 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.389
 sweeter the quality and the broader compound sp we have with that 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.389
 once 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.219
 yes but that keeps it there he said that 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.219
 currently there are after to pick up the material 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.349
 he would be smaller than the results of the 1970s 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.349
 to achieve 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.729
 here we are at the end result 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.939
 the only thing that still needs to be done is when laying floors 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.939
 at his place 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.799
 happen wants now itself 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.539
 investors from turning around 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:16.619
 That's right we explain in a special way in that the customer one 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:20.679
 white curses and without deviations at the spot is the finish they do 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.679
 can choose in terms of color 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.729
 life by iniquities points 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.729
 and then the customer has exactly a little more time with 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.759
 and if you need 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.209
 you can enjoy 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.489
 the new wooden floor
