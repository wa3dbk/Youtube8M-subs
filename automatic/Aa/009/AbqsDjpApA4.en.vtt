 in a short time he has become one of the most popular artists but 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.590
 The Netherlands 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.920

 the last month more than usual 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.910
 and after this performance it reminds me a bit of last year when the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.290
 number one DJ of the world armin of neighbors gave a smashing performance with 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.040

 He attracts more audiences to the stadium and you can check a special one 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.320
 and he does not think back to set it up either 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.299
 We are ready for the election of the best Dutch song 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.459

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.930
 the focus is on the poet and the lyric poet, that manure is under consideration 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.559
 For discussion, the man who is going to announce that working winner makes us feel 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:46.900
