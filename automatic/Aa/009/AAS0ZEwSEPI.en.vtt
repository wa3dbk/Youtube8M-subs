this is his shit

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.629 
this is his shit
so<00:04:56.310> he<00:04:56.460> were<00:04:56.550> gonna<00:04:56.729> see<00:04:56.909> his<00:04:57.060> sheep<00:04:57.710> but<00:04:58.710> after

so he were gonna see his sheep but after

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.189 
so he were gonna see his sheep but after
that<00:04:59.819> I<00:05:00.120> don't<00:05:00.180> know<00:05:00.449> what<00:05:00.569> happened<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.020> mean<00:05:01.169> I

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
that I don't know what happened I mean I

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.200 
that I don't know what happened I mean I
guess<00:05:01.499> after<00:05:01.710> like<00:05:02.189> being<00:05:02.460> like<00:05:02.759> one<00:05:03.029> week

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
guess after like being like one week

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.610 
guess after like being like one week
within<00:05:03.449> like<00:05:03.569> the<00:05:03.599> box<00:05:03.870> office<00:05:04.259> it<00:05:04.439> kind<00:05:04.590> of

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
within like the box office it kind of

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.290 
within like the box office it kind of
like<00:05:04.740> plummeted<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.729> naturally<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.150> would

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
like plummeted that naturally I would

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.119 
like plummeted that naturally I would
assume<00:05:06.680> because<00:05:07.759> from<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:09.000> consensus<00:05:09.750> on<00:05:10.129> the

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
assume because from the consensus on the

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.860 
assume because from the consensus on the
people<00:05:11.430> on<00:05:11.520> YouTube<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.270> wasn't<00:05:12.539> that<00:05:12.599> good<00:05:12.750> at

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
people on YouTube it wasn't that good at

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.189 
people on YouTube it wasn't that good at
all

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
all

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.439 
all
so<00:05:13.620> but<00:05:14.219> then<00:05:14.310> again<00:05:14.400> that's<00:05:14.639> my<00:05:14.909> take<00:05:15.120> on<00:05:15.240> that

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
so but then again that's my take on that

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.929 
so but then again that's my take on that
but<00:05:16.110> either<00:05:16.349> way<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.770> is<00:05:16.800> fascinating<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.699> does

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:17.939 
but either way it is fascinating it does

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:19.999 
but either way it is fascinating it does
but<00:05:18.629> the<00:05:18.810> movie<00:05:19.110> premise<00:05:19.469> so<00:05:19.590> far<00:05:19.830> in<00:05:19.949> the

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
but the movie premise so far in the

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.909 
but the movie premise so far in the
paragraph<00:05:20.279> it<00:05:20.520> does<00:05:20.699> seem<00:05:20.939> very<00:05:20.969> very<00:05:21.919> basic

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
paragraph it does seem very very basic

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.670 
paragraph it does seem very very basic
the<00:05:23.250> light<00:05:23.520> side<00:05:23.849> the<00:05:24.419> dark<00:05:24.689> side<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.409> dark

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
the light side the dark side the dark

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.059 
the light side the dark side the dark
side<00:05:25.919> after<00:05:26.849> like<00:05:27.089> years<00:05:27.960> of<00:05:28.169> hitting<00:05:28.770> or

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
side after like years of hitting or

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.189 
side after like years of hitting or
hiding<00:05:29.460> hitting<00:05:29.969> after<00:05:30.150> years<00:05:30.779> of<00:05:30.839> hiding

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
hiding hitting after years of hiding

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.189 
hiding hitting after years of hiding
within<00:05:31.529> the<00:05:31.710> shadows<00:05:32.219> once<00:05:32.969> again<00:05:33.199> reimburses

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
within the shadows once again reimburses

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.579 
within the shadows once again reimburses
to<00:05:34.710> destroy<00:05:35.249> all<00:05:35.639> those<00:05:35.939> at<00:05:36.210> week<00:05:36.479> so<00:05:37.139> it<00:05:37.319> seems

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:37.589 
to destroy all those at week so it seems

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:41.269 
to destroy all those at week so it seems
very<00:05:37.949> very<00:05:38.339> basic<00:05:39.270> very<00:05:39.449> very<00:05:39.750> cliche<00:05:40.199> and<00:05:40.529> we

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
very very basic very very cliche and we

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.269 
very very basic very very cliche and we
do<00:05:41.490> see<00:05:41.960> he<00:05:42.960> soaked<00:05:43.229> us<00:05:43.409> and<00:05:43.589> maybe<00:05:43.740> involved

at some point um I don't know how but

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.679 
at some point um I don't know how but
again<00:05:46.889> he's<00:05:47.159> easy<00:05:47.580> soaking<00:05:48.120> he<00:05:48.240> does<00:05:48.449> whatever

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
some point so it looks like they're

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.200 
some point so it looks like they're
gonna<00:06:22.949> try<00:06:23.279> and<00:06:23.460> actually<00:06:23.580> hit<00:06:23.969> a<00:06:24.000> lot<00:06:24.180> of

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.379 
gonna try and actually hit a lot of
areas<00:06:24.569> maybe<00:06:24.990> gin<00:06:25.439> I<00:06:25.680> don't<00:06:26.279> know<00:06:26.430> because<00:06:27.210> the

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
areas maybe gin I don't know because the

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.879 
areas maybe gin I don't know because the
title<00:06:27.779> of<00:06:27.899> the<00:06:27.990> movie<00:06:28.139> it<00:06:28.500> actually<00:06:28.800> may

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
title of the movie it actually may

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.519 
title of the movie it actually may
incorporate<00:06:29.099> kite<00:06:29.550> to<00:06:29.759> so<00:06:30.689> because<00:06:31.080> it<00:06:31.199> seems

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
where it goes but mainly it's going to

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.329 
where it goes but mainly it's going to

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:10.379 
be the counterpart darkside that's why

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.019 
be the counterpart darkside that's why
it<00:07:10.439> seems<00:07:10.710> so<00:07:10.979> far<00:07:11.189> from<00:07:11.219> this<00:07:11.430> trailer<00:07:11.639> and

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:12.029 
it seems so far from this trailer and

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:14.299 
it seems so far from this trailer and
again<00:07:12.389> the<00:07:12.539> animation<00:07:12.930> looks<00:07:13.080> very<00:07:13.289> very<00:07:13.830> good

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:14.309 
again the animation looks very very good

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.829 
again the animation looks very very good
but<00:07:14.669> the<00:07:14.759> story<00:07:15.029> premise<00:07:15.270> is<00:07:15.360> actually<00:07:15.659> very

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:15.839 
but the story premise is actually very

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:17.989 
but the story premise is actually very
basic<00:07:16.259> and<00:07:16.409> I'm<00:07:16.740> hoping<00:07:17.039> that<00:07:17.099> you<00:07:17.400> see<00:07:17.669> a<00:07:17.699> good

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:17.999 
basic and I'm hoping that you see a good

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.659 
basic and I'm hoping that you see a good
movie<00:07:18.150> at<00:07:18.389> least<00:07:18.629> so<00:07:19.319> I'm<00:07:19.499> done<00:07:19.770> once<00:07:20.520> again
