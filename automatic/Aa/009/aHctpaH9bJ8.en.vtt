these<00:05:27.669> beakers<00:05:28.150> back<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.990> let's<00:05:29.469> see<00:05:29.680> if<00:05:29.889> we

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
these beakers back and let's see if we

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.070 
these beakers back and let's see if we
can<00:05:30.279> come<00:05:30.490> up<00:05:30.520> with<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.240> lighter<00:05:31.650> combination

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
can come up with a lighter combination

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.670 
can come up with a lighter combination
what<00:05:35.080> should<00:05:35.259> we<00:05:35.380> do<00:05:35.560> let's<00:05:36.550> put<00:05:37.319> one<00:05:38.319> drop<00:05:38.469> of

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
what should we do let's put one drop of

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.730 
what should we do let's put one drop of
blue<00:05:38.889> one<00:05:39.550> drop<00:05:39.849> of<00:05:40.090> blue<00:05:40.500> first<00:05:41.500> yes<00:05:42.009> and<00:05:42.400> then

blue one drop of blue first yes and then

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.170 
blue one drop of blue first yes and then
let's<00:05:44.740> see<00:05:44.919> what<00:05:45.069> happens<00:05:45.490> when<00:05:45.759> you

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
let's see what happens when you

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.309 
let's see what happens when you
experiment<00:05:46.990> and<00:05:47.440> put<00:05:47.770> three<00:05:48.610> drops<00:05:48.909> of<00:05:49.090> red

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
experiment and put three drops of red

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.830 
experiment and put three drops of red
three<00:05:50.319> drops<00:05:50.650> of<00:05:50.919> red<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.819> see<00:05:52.330> what<00:05:52.569> color

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
three drops of red and see what color

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.390 
three drops of red and see what color
change<00:05:53.289> we<00:05:53.500> can<00:05:53.680> make<00:05:54.060> one<00:05:55.080> two<00:05:56.159> three<00:05:57.159> you

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
change we can make one two three you

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.649 
change we can make one two three you
know<00:05:57.520> you<00:05:57.580> can<00:05:57.849> do<00:05:58.000> this<00:05:58.120> in<00:05:58.300> your<00:05:58.389> kitchen
