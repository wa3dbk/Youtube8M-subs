unsalted<00:02:01.570> cooking<00:02:02.570> butter<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.080> then<00:02:04.539> one

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
unsalted cooking butter and then one

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.300 
unsalted cooking butter and then one
hard-boiled<00:02:06.170> egg<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:07.360> some<00:02:08.360> salt<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:10.130> to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
hard-boiled egg and some salt I like to

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.699 
hard-boiled egg and some salt I like to
use<00:02:10.459> sea<00:02:10.910> salt<00:02:10.940> because<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:12.019> coarse<00:02:12.410> and

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
use sea salt because it's coarse and

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.320 
use sea salt because it's coarse and
adds<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:13.040> little<00:02:13.190> bit<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.730> nice

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
adds a little bit of that nice

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.300 
adds a little bit of that nice
consistency<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:15.500> if<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.860> don't<00:02:16.040> have<00:02:16.160> sea

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
consistency but if you don't have sea

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.770 
consistency but if you don't have sea
salt<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.640> can<00:02:16.760> use<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.030> regular<00:02:17.150> salt<00:02:17.599> too

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
salt you can use just regular salt too

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.770 
salt you can use just regular salt too
so<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.410> take<00:02:18.769> them<00:02:19.010> hard-boiled<00:02:19.790> egg<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.239> you

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
so you take them hard-boiled egg and you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.990 
so you take them hard-boiled egg and you
dice<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.319> into<00:02:21.380> really<00:02:21.830> small<00:02:21.980> pieces<00:02:22.310> and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
dice it into really small pieces and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.470 
dice it into really small pieces and
then<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.599> leave<00:02:23.870> out<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.920> butter<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.519> like<00:02:26.269> to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
then you leave out the butter I like to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.350 
then you leave out the butter I like to
use<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.690> one<00:02:27.319> tablespoon<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.250> butter<00:02:28.519> too

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
use just one tablespoon of butter too

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.390 
use just one tablespoon of butter too
one<00:02:29.569> hard-boiled<00:02:29.930> egg<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.860> it's<00:02:30.980> actually<00:02:31.160> a

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
one hard-boiled egg so it's actually a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.190 
one hard-boiled egg so it's actually a
lot<00:02:31.790> more<00:02:31.819> eggs<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.569> butter<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.870> leave<00:02:33.080> it

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
lot more eggs and butter and leave it

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.229 
lot more eggs and butter and leave it
out<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.650> becomes<00:02:33.920> nice<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.220> soft<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.150> then

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
out so it becomes nice and soft and then

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.009 
out so it becomes nice and soft and then
you<00:02:35.959> just<00:02:36.230> mush<00:02:36.860> then<00:02:37.790> egg<00:02:38.090> into<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.780> butter

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
you just mush then egg into the butter

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.840 
you just mush then egg into the butter
and<00:02:39.170> what's<00:02:39.350> great<00:02:39.650> about<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.250> cuts<00:02:40.549> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
and what's great about it is it cuts the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.720 
and what's great about it is it cuts the
fat<00:02:41.420> content<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.319> butter<00:02:42.500> almost<00:02:43.100> in<00:02:43.459> half

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
fat content of the butter almost in half

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.870 
fat content of the butter almost in half
because<00:02:44.510> an<00:02:44.930> egg<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.860> between<00:02:46.459> four<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.760> five

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
because an egg is between four and five

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.839 
because an egg is between four and five
grams<00:02:47.269> of<00:02:47.390> fat<00:02:47.630> each<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:48.319> more<00:02:48.620> than<00:02:48.830> just<00:02:49.100> fat

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
grams of fat each but more than just fat

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.600 
grams of fat each but more than just fat
it's<00:02:50.120> filled<00:02:50.599> with<00:02:50.900> protein<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.950> lecithin

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
it's filled with protein and lecithin

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.610 
it's filled with protein and lecithin
and<00:02:52.790> nutrients<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.720> takes<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.110> long<00:02:54.590> time

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
and nutrients and it takes a long time

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.770 
and nutrients and it takes a long time
for<00:02:54.890> your<00:02:55.250> body<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.670> digest<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.299> so<00:02:56.329> it's<00:02:56.630> this

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
for your body to digest it so it's this

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.310 
for your body to digest it so it's this
great<00:02:57.140> slow<00:02:57.950> release<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:59.079> consistent<00:03:00.079> energy

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
great slow release and consistent energy

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.650 
great slow release and consistent energy
so<00:03:00.980> you're<00:03:01.130> taking<00:03:01.310> butter<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.120> turning<00:03:02.540> it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
so you're taking butter and turning it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.970 
so you're taking butter and turning it
into<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:03.410> food<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.260> has<00:03:06.440> protein

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
into a food it's so that it has protein

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.590 
into a food it's so that it has protein
in<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.130> has<00:03:07.340> lecithin<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.150> which<00:03:08.299> helps

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
in it has lecithin in it which helps

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.300 
in it has lecithin in it which helps
with<00:03:08.720> your<00:03:08.750> connective<00:03:09.290> tissues<00:03:09.680> which<00:03:10.040> helps

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
with your connective tissues which helps

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.060 
with your connective tissues which helps
to<00:03:10.430> minimize<00:03:10.910> wrinkles<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.140> cellulite<00:03:12.859> I

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
to minimize wrinkles and cellulite I

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.890 
to minimize wrinkles and cellulite I
mean<00:03:13.280> it's<00:03:13.790> good<00:03:14.000> all<00:03:14.150> around<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.600> it's<00:03:14.750> half

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
mean it's good all around and it's half

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.110 
mean it's good all around and it's half
of<00:03:14.930> that<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:15.980> take<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.850> mush<00:03:17.090> it

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
of that so you take it you mush it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.060 
of that so you take it you mush it
together<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.930> can<00:03:17.989> use<00:03:18.109> a<00:03:18.230> blender<00:03:18.650> if<00:03:18.829> you'd

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
together you can use a blender if you'd

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.470 
together you can use a blender if you'd
like<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.670> makes<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.269> it's<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.450> more

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
like it makes it so that it's a more

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.259 
like it makes it so that it's a more
creamy<00:03:21.140> consistency<00:03:22.010> or<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:22.489> used<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:23.000> fork

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
creamy consistency or I just used a fork

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.470 
creamy consistency or I just used a fork
and<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.410> is<00:03:24.560> what<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.340> looks<00:03:25.549> like<00:03:25.760> nice<00:03:26.450> and

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
and this is what it looks like nice and

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.949 
and this is what it looks like nice and
creamy<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.230> yummy<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:34.480> then<00:03:35.480> if<00:03:35.780> you

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
creamy and yummy and then then if you

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.920 
creamy and yummy and then then if you
can<00:03:36.200> find<00:03:36.799> this<00:03:37.280> rice<00:03:38.030> bread<00:03:38.359> or<00:03:38.540> if<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.750> can

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
can find this rice bread or if you can

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.270 
can find this rice bread or if you can
make<00:03:39.109> it<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.380> honestly<00:03:39.739> don't<00:03:39.980> know<00:03:40.010> how<00:03:40.160> to

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
make it I honestly don't know how to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.699 
make it I honestly don't know how to
make<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.549> I<00:03:40.730> need<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.120> learn<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.290> take

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
make it I need to learn and you take

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.069 
make it I need to learn and you take
just<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.160> same<00:03:43.819> amount<00:03:44.209> of<00:03:44.420> butter<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:44.989> you

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
just the same amount of butter that you

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.470 
just the same amount of butter that you
would<00:03:45.230> normally<00:03:45.410> use<00:03:45.920> on<00:03:46.160> bread<00:03:46.519> just<00:03:47.120> because

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
would normally use on bread just because

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.110 
would normally use on bread just because
it<00:03:47.600> has<00:03:47.750> egg<00:03:47.989> isn't<00:03:48.380> an<00:03:48.470> excuse

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
it has egg isn't an excuse

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.270 
it has egg isn't an excuse
twice<00:03:49.420> as<00:03:49.629> much<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.440> sort<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.680> makes<00:03:51.099> the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
twice as much that sort of makes the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.610 
twice as much that sort of makes the
whole<00:03:51.310> thing<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:51.879> being<00:03:52.060> half<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.420> back<00:03:52.620> so

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
whole thing of it being half the back so

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.350 
whole thing of it being half the back so
take<00:03:54.310> some<00:03:54.580> of<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:55.470> egg<00:03:56.470> butter<00:03:57.060> rub<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.180> on

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
take some of this egg butter rub it on
