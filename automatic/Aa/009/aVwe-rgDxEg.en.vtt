was<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.159> something<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> eat

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
was going to get something to eat

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.200 
was going to get something to eat
you<00:01:44.880> never<00:01:45.030> eat<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.549> may<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.790> look<00:01:48.090> at

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you never eat so it may be look at

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.030 
you never eat so it may be look at
myself<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.840> realize<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.740> just

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
myself and realize that I was just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.670 
myself and realize that I was just
instead<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.060> having<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.659> healthy<00:01:51.840> diet<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.500> was

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
instead of having a healthy diet I was

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.490 
instead of having a healthy diet I was
starving<00:01:53.159> myself<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.670> keep<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:54.030> weight<00:01:54.240> down

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
starving myself to keep my weight down

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.740 
starving myself to keep my weight down
so<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.460> coincidentally<00:01:57.299> certainly

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
so it just coincidentally certainly

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.200 
so it just coincidentally certainly
there<00:01:57.899> after<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.619> into<00:01:59.100> started<00:02:00.000> doing

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
there after I got into started doing

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
there after I got into started doing
some<00:02:00.360> research<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> best<00:02:01.649> diet

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
