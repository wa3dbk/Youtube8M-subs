stuff I mean I really did all the
sampling<00:01:54.820> for<00:01:55.030> all<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.329> liquid<00:01:55.600> products<00:01:55.899> for

okay and obviously to buy this kind of
plethora<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.680> gear<00:02:33.040> you're<00:02:33.730> talking<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.120> hell

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
plethora of gear you're talking a hell

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.330

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
of a lot of money and I guess the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.820 
of a lot of money and I guess the
objective<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.910> see<00:02:37.210> if<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:38.440> can<00:02:38.620> get

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
objective is to see if you can get

00:02:38.830 --> 00:03:00.080 
objective is to see if you can get
usable<00:02:39.610> results<00:02:39.850> with<00:02:40.330> something<00:02:40.690> like<00:02:40.840> this

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.009 

it<00:03:01.090> was<00:03:01.239> quite<00:03:01.450> hard<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.780> tell<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:01.989> difference

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
it was quite hard to tell the difference

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.280 
it was quite hard to tell the difference
a<00:03:02.680> lot<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.459> time<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:04.030> thought<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.840> was

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
a lot of the time I thought it was

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.420 
a lot of the time I thought it was
really<00:03:05.530> good<00:03:05.800> sometimes<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.370> was

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
really good sometimes it was

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.280 
really good sometimes it was
indistinguishable<00:03:06.879> from<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:08.080> know<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
indistinguishable from you know the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:19.210 
indistinguishable from you know the
original

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.940 

do<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.460> what<00:03:20.730> hell<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.120> don't<00:03:21.240> know

do you know what hell I don't know

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.530 
do you know what hell I don't know
though<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.130> results<00:03:23.730> are<00:03:23.850> very<00:03:23.880> very

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
though the results are very very

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.480 
though the results are very very
interesting<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.680> was<00:03:25.800> actually<00:03:26.100> being<00:03:26.280> live

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
interesting it was actually being live

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.220 
interesting it was actually being live

but if you're in a slightly lower lower
range<00:04:35.310> studio<00:04:35.700> I<00:04:35.730> would<00:04:35.970> definitely<00:04:36.300> not<00:04:36.510> be

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
range studio I would definitely not be

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.650 
range studio I would definitely not be
scared<00:04:37.560> about<00:04:37.920> music<00:04:38.460> definitely<00:04:39.270> I'm

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660

surprised<00:04:40.110> at<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.380> quality<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.920> it<00:04:41.070> because<00:04:41.610> I

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
surprised at the quality of it because I

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.000 
surprised at the quality of it because I
have<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.240> admit<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.570> did<00:04:42.840> have<00:04:42.870> my<00:04:43.350> reservations

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
have to admit I did have my reservations

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.330 
have to admit I did have my reservations
that<00:04:44.220> I<00:04:44.250> thought<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.640> quality<00:04:45.020> wouldn't<00:04:46.020> be

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
that I thought the quality wouldn't be

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.790 
that I thought the quality wouldn't be
you<00:04:47.340> know<00:04:47.460> up<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.840> professional<00:04:49.350> standard

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
you know up to a professional standard

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.050 
you know up to a professional standard
but<00:04:49.980> I<00:04:50.010> think<00:04:50.280> everything<00:04:50.610> I've<00:04:50.700> heard<00:04:50.820> from

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
but I think everything I've heard from

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.060 
but I think everything I've heard from
it<00:04:51.240> sounds<00:04:51.570> good<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:51.930> wouldn't<00:04:52.290> need<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.560> use<00:04:52.740> in

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
it sounds good I wouldn't need to use in

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.610 
it sounds good I wouldn't need to use in
a<00:04:53.160> room<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.580> that's<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.360> thing<00:04:54.660> but<00:04:55.410> I

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
a room like this that's the thing but I

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.590 
a room like this that's the thing but I
wouldn't<00:04:55.890> hesitate<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.370> use<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.060> a<00:04:57.150> room<00:04:57.330> if

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
wouldn't hesitate to use it in a room if

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.720 
wouldn't hesitate to use it in a room if
it<00:04:57.720> was<00:04:57.870> there<00:04:58.110> that's<00:04:58.890> another<00:04:59.130> thing<00:04:59.370> and

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
it was there that's another thing and

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.000 
it was there that's another thing and
also<00:04:59.910> would<00:05:00.240> be<00:05:00.300> great<00:05:00.630> at<00:05:00.780> home<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:01.650> I've<00:05:01.830> got

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
also would be great at home but I've got

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.550 
also would be great at home but I've got
to<00:05:02.160> say<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.400> mean<00:05:03.020> there<00:05:04.020> was<00:05:04.080> nothing<00:05:04.530> that

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
to say I mean there was nothing that

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.330 
to say I mean there was nothing that
I've<00:05:04.740> heard<00:05:04.980> that<00:05:05.520> was<00:05:06.180> not<00:05:06.840> usable<00:05:07.230> as<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.890> kind

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
I've heard that was not usable as a kind

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.360 
I've heard that was not usable as a kind
of<00:05:08.400> workhorse<00:05:09.620> compressor<00:05:10.620> with<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:11.040> few

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
of workhorse compressor with a few

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.400 
of workhorse compressor with a few
different<00:05:11.850> options<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.750> few<00:05:12.930> different<00:05:13.200> soft

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
different options a few different soft

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.990 
different options a few different soft
flavors<00:05:13.920> and<00:05:14.100> I<00:05:14.190> think<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.490> does<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.640> very<00:05:14.730> good

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
flavors and I think it does a very good
