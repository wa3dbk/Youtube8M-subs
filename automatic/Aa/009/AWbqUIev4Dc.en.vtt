with the product I used to take the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.340 
with the product I used to take the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
original formula you know it was great I

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.710 
original formula you know it was great I

and um it was a real good supplement
gave<00:01:13.600> me<00:01:13.720> a<00:01:13.750> little<00:01:13.990> bit<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.229> energy<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:14.890> I

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
gave me a little bit of energy and I

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.950 
gave me a little bit of energy and I
really<00:01:15.430> liked<00:01:15.610> it<00:01:15.760> but<00:01:15.940> not<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.479> think<00:01:16.690> switched

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
really liked it but not I think switched

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.020 
really liked it but not I think switched
over<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.470> new<00:01:17.740> formula<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.460> didn't<00:01:18.880> care

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
over to this new formula I didn't care

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.160 
over to this new formula I didn't care
for<00:01:19.060> what<00:01:19.330> at<00:01:19.420> all<00:01:19.540> there<00:01:19.780> was<00:01:19.840> too<00:01:20.050> much

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
for what at all there was too much

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.200 
for what at all there was too much
sodium<00:01:20.500> you<00:01:21.190> know<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.610> was<00:01:21.700> too<00:01:21.940> thick

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
sodium you know the was too thick

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.210 
sodium you know the was too thick
felt<00:01:22.570> like<00:01:22.690> I<00:01:22.810> was<00:01:22.960> drinking<00:01:23.170> some<00:01:23.560> damn<00:01:23.740> ocean

water<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:25.630> just<00:01:26.350> really<00:01:26.560> wasn't<00:01:26.770> feeling<00:01:27.010> it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
water I just really wasn't feeling it

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.550 
water I just really wasn't feeling it
you<00:01:27.430> know<00:01:27.520> I'm<00:01:27.640> saying<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.150> I<00:01:28.390> went<00:01:29.110> head<00:01:29.290> and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
you know I'm saying so I went head and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.190 
you know I'm saying so I went head and
logged<00:01:29.770> on<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.310> bodybuilding.com<00:01:31.080> then<00:01:32.080> I

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
logged on to bodybuilding.com then I

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.140 
logged on to bodybuilding.com then I
researched<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.890> few<00:01:33.100> different<00:01:33.520> branched

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
researched a few different branched

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.270 
researched a few different branched
chain<00:01:34.270> amino<00:01:34.300> acid<00:01:34.990> powders<00:01:35.410> and<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:36.160> was

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
chain amino acid powders and I was

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.980 
chain amino acid powders and I was
trying<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.550> find<00:01:36.700> out<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.000> best<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.570> with<00:01:37.960> a

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
trying to find out the best one with a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.840 
trying to find out the best one with a
nice<00:01:38.230> rating<00:01:39.270> ironically<00:01:40.270> um<00:01:41.340> exten<00:01:42.340> had<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
nice rating ironically um exten had the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.090 
nice rating ironically um exten had the
highest<00:01:43.240> rating<00:01:43.660> it<00:01:44.350> must<00:01:44.560> have<00:01:44.680> been<00:01:44.770> you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
highest rating it must have been you

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.950 
highest rating it must have been you
know<00:01:45.190> they<00:01:45.280> must<00:01:45.430> have<00:01:45.550> had<00:01:45.730> a<00:01:45.760> lot<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.060> thumbs

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
know they must have had a lot of thumbs

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.160 
know they must have had a lot of thumbs
up<00:01:47.380> for<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.370> original<00:01:49.060> formula<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.990> just

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
up for the original formula and just

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.780 
up for the original formula and just
pretty<00:01:50.530> much<00:01:50.710> padded<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.190> together<00:01:51.490> with<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
pretty much padded it together with the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.820 
pretty much padded it together with the
new<00:01:51.940> formula<00:01:52.300> so<00:01:52.660> you<00:01:52.870> know<00:01:53.410> it's<00:01:53.560> kind<00:01:53.590> of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
new formula so you know it's kind of

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.590 
new formula so you know it's kind of
biased<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.520> don't<00:01:54.730> really<00:01:54.820> go<00:01:55.060> too<00:01:55.120> much<00:01:55.360> by

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
biased so I don't really go too much by

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.300 
biased so I don't really go too much by
that<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.200> then<00:01:56.350> also<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.710> reached<00:01:56.950> out<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.100> you

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
that and then also I reached out to you

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.610 
that and then also I reached out to you
