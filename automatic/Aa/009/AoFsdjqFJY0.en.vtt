powder to review this protein powder I'm

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.570 
powder to review this protein powder I'm
going<00:00:18.550> to<00:00:18.670> cover<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.930> of<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.349> key<00:00:20.770> points<00:00:21.189> so

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
going to cover some of the key points so

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.320 
going to cover some of the key points so
what<00:00:22.300> it's<00:00:22.449> used<00:00:22.660> for<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:24.520> torso<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:24.850> target

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
what it's used for the torso the target

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.179 
what it's used for the torso the target
market<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.769> cost<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.779> mix<00:00:29.349> ability<00:00:29.859> and

market the cost the mix ability and

market the cost the mix ability and
taste<00:00:30.519> and<00:00:30.910> also<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:32.710> overall<00:00:32.830> good<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.730> bad

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.039 
taste and also the overall good and bad
points<00:00:34.180> I<00:00:37.589> would<00:00:38.589> categorize<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.519> as<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:40.049> size

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:41.049 
points I would categorize it as a size

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.619 
points I would categorize it as a size
and<00:00:41.379> strength<00:00:41.620> protein<00:00:42.400> and<00:00:43.299> this<00:00:43.479> is

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
and strength protein and this is

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.469 
and strength protein and this is
predominantly<00:00:44.229> because<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:45.280> has<00:00:45.489> relatively

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
predominantly because it has relatively

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.560 
predominantly because it has relatively
high<00:00:46.629> level<00:00:47.589> of<00:00:47.650> protein<00:00:47.799> this<00:00:48.790> is<00:00:48.940> about<00:00:49.089> 70

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
high level of protein this is about 70

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.350 
high level of protein this is about 70
percent<00:00:49.690> protein<00:00:50.080> but<00:00:51.070> it<00:00:51.190> also<00:00:51.309> has<00:00:51.670> a<00:00:51.699> small

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
percent protein but it also has a small

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.180 
percent protein but it also has a small
amount<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.930> carbs<00:00:53.650> so<00:00:54.400> 15<00:00:54.970> percent<00:00:56.190> that's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
amount of carbs so 15 percent that's

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.500 
amount of carbs so 15 percent that's
ideal<00:00:57.640> for<00:00:57.670> trying<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.690> put<00:00:58.960> on<00:00:59.110> size<00:01:00.510> if

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
ideal for trying to put on size if

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.049 
ideal for trying to put on size if
you're<00:01:01.659> trying<00:01:01.869> to<00:01:02.019> build<00:01:02.199> because<00:01:03.059> after

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
you're trying to build because after

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.460 
you're trying to build because after
your<00:01:04.180> hard<00:01:04.390> work<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:04.869> when<00:01:05.140> you've<00:01:05.260> been<00:01:05.320> in

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
your hard work out when you've been in

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.070 
your hard work out when you've been in
the<00:01:05.500> gym<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:06.610> want<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:07.060> good<00:01:07.390> quality<00:01:07.630> protein

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
the gym you want a good quality protein

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.360 
the gym you want a good quality protein
but<00:01:08.920> also<00:01:09.159> carbs<00:01:09.940> I<00:01:10.500> think<00:01:11.500> that<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:12.250> they

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
but also carbs I think that and they

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.880 
but also carbs I think that and they
must<00:01:12.610> want<00:01:12.790> trying<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.450> pitch<00:01:14.230> it<00:01:14.440> towards

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
must want trying to pitch it towards

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.030 
must want trying to pitch it towards
that<00:01:15.280> type<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.550> market<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.630> addition<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.920> also

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
that type of market in addition it also

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.290 
that type of market in addition it also
has<00:01:18.720> high<00:01:19.720> levels<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.250> BCAAs<00:01:21.250> branched<00:01:22.090> chain

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
has high levels of BCAAs branched chain

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.950 
has high levels of BCAAs branched chain
amino<00:01:22.330> acids<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.280> really<00:01:24.550> think<00:01:24.790> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
amino acids and I really think that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.570 
amino acids and I really think that
that's<00:01:25.960> they're<00:01:26.440> really<00:01:26.710> targeted<00:01:27.250> down<00:01:27.400> and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
that's they're really targeted down and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.220 
that's they're really targeted down and
they're<00:01:27.670> pushing<00:01:27.850> that<00:01:28.150> because<00:01:28.540> they<00:01:29.080> know

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
they're pushing that because they know

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.230 
they're pushing that because they know
the<00:01:29.380> people<00:01:29.560> we're<00:01:30.780> having<00:01:31.780> more<00:01:31.960> BCAAs<00:01:32.620> is

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the people we're having more BCAAs is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.210 
the people we're having more BCAAs is
critical<00:01:34.240> after<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.870> heavy<00:01:35.350> workout<00:01:35.860> because

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
critical after a heavy workout because

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.270 
critical after a heavy workout because
it<00:01:36.430> will<00:01:36.580> help<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.970> repair<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.830> grow<00:01:38.830> your

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
it will help to repair and grow your

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.630 
it will help to repair and grow your
muscles<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:42.900> cost<00:01:43.900> of<00:01:44.260> this<00:01:44.770> protein<00:01:45.340> powder

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
muscles the cost of this protein powder

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.080 
muscles the cost of this protein powder
is<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:47.140> high<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.320> had<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.710> me<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:48.070> lot<00:01:48.820> higher

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
is really high I had to me a lot higher

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.600 
is really high I had to me a lot higher
than<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.600> thought<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:50.110> would<00:01:50.229> be<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.620> think<00:01:51.460> it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
than I thought it would be I think it

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.760 
than I thought it would be I think it
was<00:01:51.700> about<00:01:51.909> 80<00:01:52.210> pounds<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.050> two<00:01:53.260> point<00:01:53.560> two

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
was about 80 pounds for a two point two

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
was about 80 pounds for a two point two
kilo<00:01:54.159> tub<00:01:54.610> which<00:01:55.180> is<00:01:55.330> really<00:01:56.050> at<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.229> top<00:01:56.409> end

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
kilo tub which is really at the top end

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.990 
kilo tub which is really at the top end
I'm<00:01:58.390> trying<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:58.930> work<00:01:59.080> out<00:01:59.380> why<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.790> what

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
I'm trying to work out why and what

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.610 
I'm trying to work out why and what
ingredients<00:02:01.840> they<00:02:01.960> have<00:02:01.990> in<00:02:02.260> there<00:02:02.440> that

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
ingredients they have in there that

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.610 
ingredients they have in there that
they're<00:02:03.010> making<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:03.580> expensive<00:02:04.380> first<00:02:05.380> or

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
they're making so expensive first or

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.339 
they're making so expensive first or
words<00:02:05.799> from<00:02:06.060> away<00:02:07.060> concentrate<00:02:07.780> which<00:02:08.110> is

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
words from away concentrate which is

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.720 
words from away concentrate which is
generally<00:02:08.950> cheaper<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.700> produce<00:02:11.489> they've<00:02:12.489> got

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
generally cheaper to produce they've got

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.080 
generally cheaper to produce they've got
extra<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.360> BCAAs<00:02:14.050> in<00:02:14.290> there<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:15.280> maybe<00:02:15.760> that's

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
extra of BCAAs in there so maybe that's

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.059 
extra of BCAAs in there so maybe that's
added<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.660> cost

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
added to the cost

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.199 
added to the cost
I'm<00:02:18.030> not<00:02:18.299> exactly<00:02:18.749> sure<00:02:18.959> why<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:20.999> the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
I'm not exactly sure why but it's the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.660 
I'm not exactly sure why but it's the
expensive<00:02:21.719> protein<00:02:22.200> powder<00:02:22.469> I<00:02:25.430> think<00:02:26.430> that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
expensive protein powder I think that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.729 
expensive protein powder I think that
when<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.269> first<00:02:27.599> put<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.900> into<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.109> shaker<00:02:28.319> and

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
when I first put it into the shaker and

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.160 
when I first put it into the shaker and
I've<00:02:29.700> added<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.150> water<00:02:30.269> he<00:02:30.599> could<00:02:30.749> tell<00:02:30.989> they

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
I've added the water he could tell they

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.839 
I've added the water he could tell they
was<00:02:31.349> going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.620> make<00:02:31.829> sure<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.069> easily<00:02:32.400> found

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
was going to make sure it easily found

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.770 
was going to make sure it easily found
was<00:02:33.090> very<00:02:33.150> fine<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.280> when<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.450> made<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.599> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
was very fine and when I made it and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.410 
was very fine and when I made it and
shook<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.439> up<00:02:37.469> it<00:02:38.099> was<00:02:38.219> great<00:02:38.519> there<00:02:39.120> were<00:02:39.239> no

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
shook it up it was great there were no

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.080 
shook it up it was great there were no
bumpy<00:02:39.930> bits<00:02:40.219> everything<00:02:41.219> mixed<00:02:41.579> well<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.030> I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
bumpy bits everything mixed well so I

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.879 
bumpy bits everything mixed well so I
wasn't<00:02:42.510> losing<00:02:42.780> any<00:02:43.139> on<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.409> side<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.769> the

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
wasn't losing any on the side of the

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.869 
wasn't losing any on the side of the
shaker<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.209> was<00:02:45.329> perfect<00:02:45.840> great<00:02:46.079> I

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
shaker so that was perfect great I

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.080 
shaker so that was perfect great I
tasted<00:02:47.879> it<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:49.709> should<00:02:50.129> say<00:02:50.280> at<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.909> point

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
tasted it and I should say at this point

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.789 
tasted it and I should say at this point
I<00:02:51.299> always<00:02:51.510> use<00:02:51.719> water<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.169> don't<00:02:52.409> even<00:02:52.530> milk

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
I always use water I don't even milk

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.319 
I always use water I don't even milk
with<00:02:53.010> my<00:02:53.159> shapes<00:02:53.939> it<00:02:54.689> tasted<00:02:55.199> very<00:02:55.409> weak<00:02:55.829> so<00:02:56.639> it

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
with my shapes it tasted very weak so it

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.949 
with my shapes it tasted very weak so it
just<00:02:57.569> tasted<00:02:57.930> my<00:02:58.079> collagen<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.949> was<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.579> weak

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
just tasted my collagen I was a weak

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.059 
just tasted my collagen I was a weak
flavored<00:03:00.959> water<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.859> a

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
flavored water in it this is a

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.970 
flavored water in it this is a
strawberry<00:03:02.370> flavor<00:03:03.349> it<00:03:04.349> wasn't<00:03:04.650> too<00:03:04.769> bad<00:03:04.919> I

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
strawberry flavor it wasn't too bad I

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.559 
strawberry flavor it wasn't too bad I
think<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.519> you're<00:03:05.760> going<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.419> and<00:03:06.540> you

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
think if you're going to have it and you

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.879 
think if you're going to have it and you
didn't<00:03:06.900> want<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.109> make<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.620> very<00:03:08.519> thick<00:03:09.180> so

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
didn't want to make it very thick so

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.729 
didn't want to make it very thick so
only<00:03:10.889> like<00:03:11.040> 150<00:03:11.639> ml<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.239> water<00:03:12.569> per<00:03:13.019> per

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
only like 150 ml of water per per

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.670 
only like 150 ml of water per per
serving<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.519> had<00:03:14.879> about<00:03:15.090> 300<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.109> that<00:03:16.379> was<00:03:16.500> is

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
serving I had about 300 and that was is

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.229 
serving I had about 300 and that was is
really<00:03:16.980> weak<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.609> didn't<00:03:17.909> particularly

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
really weak and I didn't particularly

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.819 
really weak and I didn't particularly
like<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.719> taste<00:03:19.549> in<00:03:20.549> terms<00:03:20.849> of<00:03:21.349> mixing<00:03:22.349> I

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
like the taste in terms of mixing I

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.849 
like the taste in terms of mixing I
would<00:03:23.009> give<00:03:23.159> it<00:03:23.280> ten<00:03:23.489> out<00:03:23.639> of<00:03:23.669> ten<00:03:23.909> a<00:03:24.180> taste

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
would give it ten out of ten a taste

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.409 
would give it ten out of ten a taste
probably<00:03:25.859> only<00:03:26.009> five<00:03:26.370> or<00:03:26.699> six<00:03:26.729> out<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.120> ten

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
probably only five or six out of ten

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.509 
probably only five or six out of ten
really<00:03:30.379> so<00:03:31.379> onto<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.859> good<00:03:32.099> points<00:03:32.430> about

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
really so onto the good points about

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.449 
really so onto the good points about
this<00:03:32.790> protein<00:03:33.150> powder<00:03:33.709> first<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.919> all<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.069> would

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
this protein powder first of all I would

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.569 
this protein powder first of all I would
say<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:36.120> mixes<00:03:36.629> really<00:03:36.810> well<00:03:37.280> that's<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.400> real

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
say it mixes really well that's a real

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.129 
say it mixes really well that's a real
plus<00:03:38.790> point<00:03:39.060> for<00:03:39.239> me<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.840> means<00:03:39.930> you're

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
plus point for me and it means you're

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.039 
plus point for me and it means you're
not<00:03:40.290> losing<00:03:41.090> protein<00:03:42.090> powder<00:03:42.419> works<00:03:42.720> come

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
not losing protein powder works come

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.689 
not losing protein powder works come
tough<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.799> wash<00:03:43.919> it<00:03:43.949> away<00:03:44.340> when

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
tough and you have to wash it away when

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.460 
tough and you have to wash it away when
you're<00:03:44.849> when<00:03:45.629> you're<00:03:45.659> washing<00:03:45.930> your<00:03:46.079> shaker

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
you're when you're washing your shaker

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.479 
you're when you're washing your shaker
afterwards<00:03:47.840> in<00:03:48.840> addition<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:49.500> would<00:03:49.709> say<00:03:49.949> it's

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
afterwards in addition I would say it's

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.749 
afterwards in addition I would say it's
also<00:03:50.729> a<00:03:51.209> high<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.900> protein<00:03:52.379> which<00:03:53.159> is<00:03:53.340> good<00:03:53.579> and

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:53.759 
also a high in protein which is good and

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.689 
also a high in protein which is good and
it's<00:03:53.879> got<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.120> good<00:03:54.329> mix<00:03:54.629> between<00:03:55.340> protein<00:03:56.340> and

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
it's got a good mix between protein and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.199 
it's got a good mix between protein and
carbs<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:58.139> that's<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.560> plus<00:03:58.769> point<00:03:59.209> also

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
carbs so that's the plus point also

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.899 
carbs so that's the plus point also
there<00:04:00.780> are<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.019> lot<00:04:01.379> of<00:04:01.409> BCAAs<00:04:02.099> in<00:04:02.400> there<00:04:02.579> added

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
there are a lot of BCAAs in there added

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.069 
there are a lot of BCAAs in there added
BCAAs<00:04:03.509> so<00:04:04.259> that<00:04:04.889> will<00:04:05.129> really<00:04:05.699> help<00:04:05.969> to<00:04:06.389> repair

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
BCAAs so that will really help to repair

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.270 
BCAAs so that will really help to repair
your<00:04:07.259> muscles<00:04:07.680> after<00:04:08.189> a<00:04:08.250> workout<00:04:09.139> it's

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
your muscles after a workout it's

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.159 
your muscles after a workout it's
especially<00:04:11.280> high<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:11.729> glutamine<00:04:12.299> which<00:04:12.540> is

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
especially high in glutamine which is

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.120 
especially high in glutamine which is
really<00:04:13.439> gonna<00:04:13.560> help<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:14.509> repair<00:04:15.509> and<00:04:16.130> give

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
really gonna help to repair and give

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.099 
really gonna help to repair and give
back<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.789> your<00:04:17.969> muscles<00:04:18.359> what<00:04:18.599> they<00:04:18.870> need

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
back to your muscles what they need

back to your muscles what they need
after<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.709> strenuous<00:04:20.009> workout<00:04:20.699> so<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.329> bad

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
after a strenuous workout so the bad

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.939 
after a strenuous workout so the bad
points<00:04:22.199> about<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:22.590> la<00:04:23.250> whey<00:04:23.490> protein<00:04:24.389> powder

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
points about this la whey protein powder

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.589 
points about this la whey protein powder
first<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:26.159> all<00:04:26.219> I<00:04:26.250> would<00:04:26.520> say<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.449> way

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
first of all I would say it's a way

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.510 
first of all I would say it's a way
concentrate

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
concentrate

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.540 
concentrate
so<00:04:30.099> it's<00:04:31.099> really<00:04:31.340> expensive<00:04:31.699> for<00:04:32.449> some<00:04:32.630> reason

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
so it's really expensive for some reason

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.370 
so it's really expensive for some reason
it<00:04:34.550> being<00:04:34.819> a<00:04:34.970> concentrate<00:04:35.569> I'm<00:04:35.750> not<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:35.990> big<00:04:36.139> fan

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
it being a concentrate I'm not a big fan

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.749 
it being a concentrate I'm not a big fan
on<00:04:36.500> that<00:04:36.620> usually<00:04:36.919> going<00:04:37.069> for<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.340> nice<00:04:37.490> allure

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
on that usually going for a nice allure

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.909 
on that usually going for a nice allure
mainly<00:04:38.479> because<00:04:38.599> I<00:04:38.990> prefer<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.620> have<00:04:39.710> lower

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
mainly because I prefer to have lower

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.460 
mainly because I prefer to have lower
levels<00:04:40.099> of<00:04:40.340> lactose<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:41.840> that<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.110> don't<00:04:42.169> get

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
levels of lactose so that I don't get

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.189 
levels of lactose so that I don't get
any<00:04:42.530> bloating<00:04:43.280> or<00:04:43.490> any<00:04:44.210> sort<00:04:44.479> of<00:04:44.539> reaction<00:04:44.840> to

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
any bloating or any sort of reaction to

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:53.279 
any bloating or any sort of reaction to
it<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.870> yeah<00:04:47.990> it's<00:04:48.110> expensive<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:49.449> the

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.200 

because<00:04:54.289> it<00:04:54.440> from<00:04:54.680> way<00:04:54.860> concentrate<00:04:55.550> it's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
because it from way concentrate it's

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.420 
because it from way concentrate it's
going<00:04:56.449> to<00:04:56.690> be<00:04:56.810> take<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.110> lot<00:04:57.440> longer<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.919> absorb

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
going to be take a lot longer to absorb

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.120 
going to be take a lot longer to absorb
into<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.880> bloodstream<00:04:59.530> after<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.830> hard

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
into the bloodstream after a hard

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.279 
into the bloodstream after a hard
workout<00:05:01.580> that's<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.449> last<00:05:02.599> thing<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.930> want

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
workout that's the last thing you want

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.529 
workout that's the last thing you want
something<00:05:03.620> that's<00:05:03.770> quick<00:05:04.120> generally<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.479> is

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
something that's quick generally that is

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.469 
something that's quick generally that is
why<00:05:05.750> I<00:05:05.780> stick<00:05:06.199> to<00:05:06.229> a<00:05:06.710> whey<00:05:07.069> protein<00:05:07.490> isolate<00:05:08.000> or

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
why I stick to a whey protein isolate or

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.210 
why I stick to a whey protein isolate or
more<00:05:09.319> recently<00:05:09.680> hydrolyzed<00:05:10.400> whey<00:05:11.740> it's<00:05:12.740> also

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
more recently hydrolyzed whey it's also

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.740 
more recently hydrolyzed whey it's also
very<00:05:13.610> expensive<00:05:13.990> particularly<00:05:16.750> considering

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
very expensive particularly considering

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.409 
very expensive particularly considering
its<00:05:17.930> from<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.620> way<00:05:18.860> concentrate<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:19.880> that's

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
its from a way concentrate so that's

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.960 
its from a way concentrate so that's
another<00:05:20.659> bad<00:05:20.870> sort<00:05:21.319> so<00:05:22.039> quite<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.310> big<00:05:22.490> negative

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
another bad sort so quite a big negative

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.170 
another bad sort so quite a big negative
as<00:05:23.720> far<00:05:23.780> along<00:05:24.020> concern<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.680> cost<00:05:24.919> so<00:05:25.639> overall

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
as far along concern the cost so overall

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.890 
as far along concern the cost so overall
I<00:05:26.509> would<00:05:27.139> give<00:05:27.530> this<00:05:27.710> protein<00:05:28.130> powder<00:05:28.490> a<00:05:28.849> 7<00:05:29.630> out

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
I would give this protein powder a 7 out

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.520 
I would give this protein powder a 7 out
of<00:05:29.960> 10

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
of 10

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.980 
of 10
it's<00:05:31.479> it's<00:05:32.479> good<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:33.259> makes<00:05:33.530> as<00:05:33.680> well<00:05:34.090> it's<00:05:35.090> got

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
it's it's good it makes as well it's got

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.740 
it's it's good it makes as well it's got
a<00:05:36.020> nice<00:05:36.259> balance<00:05:37.099> of<00:05:37.610> protein<00:05:38.240> and

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
a nice balance of protein and

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.370 
a nice balance of protein and
carbohydrates<00:05:40.060> but<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:41.240> be<00:05:41.360> honest<00:05:41.630> it's<00:05:42.169> just

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
carbohydrates but to be honest it's just

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.129 
carbohydrates but to be honest it's just
not<00:05:42.710> worth<00:05:42.919> the<00:05:43.099> worth<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.880> money<00:05:44.120> is<00:05:44.900> 80

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
not worth the worth the money is 80

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.689 
not worth the worth the money is 80
pounds<00:05:46.419> if<00:05:47.419> the<00:05:48.050> 80<00:05:48.229> pound<00:05:48.530> if<00:05:49.430> he's<00:05:49.580> a

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
pounds if the 80 pound if he's a

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.300 
pounds if the 80 pound if he's a
two-pound<00:05:50.090> because<00:05:50.570> it's<00:05:51.560> got<00:05:51.949> a<00:05:51.979> lot<00:05:52.280> of

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
two-pound because it's got a lot of

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.029 
two-pound because it's got a lot of
BCAAs<00:05:53.120> in<00:05:53.360> and<00:05:53.960> i<00:05:54.139> think<00:05:54.380> that<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:54.710> could<00:05:54.889> just

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
BCAAs in and i think that you could just

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.240 
BCAAs in and i think that you could just
go<00:05:55.159> out<00:05:55.340> and<00:05:55.550> buy<00:05:55.669> a<00:05:55.969> separate<00:05:56.449> BCAA<00:05:56.900> and<00:05:57.620> mix

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
go out and buy a separate BCAA and mix

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.270 
go out and buy a separate BCAA and mix
that<00:05:58.460> in<00:05:58.610> with<00:05:58.639> your<00:05:58.789> protein
