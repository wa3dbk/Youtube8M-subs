00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.770 
then there's Robin and there's banger
racing<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> does

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
racing and that's what and does

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
racing and that's what and does
elsewhere<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.399> bring<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
elsewhere so to bring that into the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.520 
elsewhere so to bring that into the
corruptor<00:01:51.509> I'm<00:01:51.570> sure<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.140> not<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
corruptor I'm sure I think it's not the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
corruptor I'm sure I think it's not the
best<00:01:52.890> thing<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.250> doing<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.970> he<00:01:54.119> set<00:01:54.360> his

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
best thing to be doing but he set his

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.230 
best thing to be doing but he set his
tone<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.020> I've<00:01:55.799> continued<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> they

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
tone so I've continued like that they

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.149 
tone so I've continued like that they
just<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> truth<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.860> me<00:01:58.979> I

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
just for the truth so not for me I

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.830 
just for the truth so not for me I
passed<00:01:59.729> him<00:01:59.880> into<00:02:00.030> clear<00:02:00.210> bias<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.659> didn't

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
passed him into clear bias but I didn't

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.870 
passed him into clear bias but I didn't
know<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.229> last<00:02:01.409> lap<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:02.430> saw<00:02:02.579> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
know that was the last lap I just saw a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.310 
know that was the last lap I just saw a
sham<00:02:03.479> come<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> thought<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.140> we're<00:02:04.229> gonna

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
sham come and I thought if we're gonna

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.539 
sham come and I thought if we're gonna
get<00:02:04.500> through<00:02:04.710> we've<00:02:04.860> got<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.250> done<00:02:05.369> now

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
get through we've got to get it done now

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880 
get through we've got to get it done now
so<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:06.719> Teleca<00:02:07.049> through<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.409> moment<00:02:07.590> then

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
so just Teleca through that moment then

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.109 
so just Teleca through that moment then
when<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.129> when<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> when<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.670> finally<00:02:08.879> took

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
when you when you when you finally took

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.540 
when you when you when you finally took
him<00:02:09.800> that's<00:02:10.800> when<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.039> corners<00:02:11.370> really

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
him that's when then corners really

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.100 
him that's when then corners really
where<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.090> need<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.569> wide<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.870> go<00:02:12.959> good

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
