00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.290
 choose today 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.290
 we will start the car now 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.050
 with them i think 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.100
 I want to say again that I use it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.150
 this substance can say so 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.150
 it's not a badge boost 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.020
 I fill up gasoline I fill my eyes with gas 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.020
 now look hundreds 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.570
 I have been using it for 3 months 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.830
 up to 3 months 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.720
 Now bring closer to be seen 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:41.540
 cold pipe look i'm showing 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.890
 because many have heard that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.700
 using b &amp; g 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.290
 ruler engine runs smoothly you 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.360
 seen now how the car started up though 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.850
 she stood for two days now winter is already 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.640
 confirmation engine runs smoothly and 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.140
 and most importantly that the fuel that comes 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.140
 in the combustion chamber burns all 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.880
 take up your finger here look here 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.680
 you see 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.690
 acid is direct evidence that 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.690
 fuel burns everything and now sake 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.660
 interest you see when flying around in 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.090
 the yard costs a lot of cars 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.090
 interest see this car here 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.270
 the outcome is interesting 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.150
 it says something i donâ€™t choose a car 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:00.189
 will become 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:01.540
 the car can blink on it last here 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.450
 so sit down what was visible 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.180
 exhaust pipe I'll take another finger then 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.909
 there you see it is pure as well for the sake of 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.909
 interest we make here such that is 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.349
 here it can be seen much more clearly and so 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:25.439
 we can pass any car and you 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:28.469
 make sure to use boost 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.090
 3g or tablets 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:34.900
 says that the fuel burns 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.599
 completely it may just be words on 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.650
 if you think that any car even 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.150
 here it is the more it 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.319
 equipped with a catalytic system 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.769
 exhaust pipe 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.500
 I think if you think you will think 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.370
 why does it need fuel does not burn 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.440
 completely in the combustion chamber 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.010
 and so that it does not fly out to 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.849
 raise environmental standards set 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.090
 such baklushi called catalyst 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.090
 which is here 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.769
 harmful substances will remain there 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.829
 but even so even though you see 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:22.740
 what comes out of the exhaust pipe with this all 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:24.210
 we did not go under this video below will 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.410
 be link 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.039
 by going through which you can learn about 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:37.139
 this product you can order it 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:39.690
 yourself and use first protects 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:44.100
 your engine and secondly that more 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.960
 importantly protect the breathing of your children in 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:53.400
 I see two walk and one more 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.870
 the child shoots it was igor orcish 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.900
 I'll meet you on my channel 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.180
 so we got into the time machine just yet 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.560
 such an idea came but did not immediately say 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.690
 Of course you can not believe it yourself 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.360
 drowned what was now showing and and 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.169
 say yes he rubbed with a cloth first 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.750
 to show it is your business that is 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:20.039
 I'm not going to prove anything 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.840
 the only thing that an intelligent person is if he 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.729
 something doubts he will take and struck 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.930
 on myself 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.699
 silly man 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.669
 but here he will listen to nonsense 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.940
 fools and and eat and ipod 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:36.470
 so not close for Muscovites 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.470
 are you going on a date
