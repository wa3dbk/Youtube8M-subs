00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hi, Miguel Angel, I hope you're well 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.160
 this occasion to teach how to change the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.440
 design of the air coment of your galaxy not 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.970
 out 4 is to be able to change the color of 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.860
 background and air coment selection 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.570
 requirements to be able to do this have 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.460
 installed what is android lollipop and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.240
 a custom recovery and well said 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.240
 we started all that 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.560
 The first thing you will do is download the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.790
 following files as always since 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.710
 down in the description of the video is 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.989
 leaving downloading of these that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.390
 they would be some files in format 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.670
 zip each represents what is a 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.680
 different design for example air comet 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.800
 indigo that would be a strong blue 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.750
 The design of light material material 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.699
 etcetera also comes a file 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.960
 called original stock this would come 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.790
 being in case you do not like the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.440
 design that applied to the air coment what 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.699
 You can restore the original without any 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.960
 problem and good people who have 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.670
 downloaded these files as you 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.379
 he said they are in formats and so the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.030
 you are going to move in zip format to memory 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.739
 of your team once the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.269
 you have in the internal memory you're going to 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.360
 proceed to enter the custom cover 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.360
 Y 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.909
 once we are in the position 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.649
 overlay in this case I'm 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.820
 using the tingo recovery project if 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.950
 you are using the other side 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.240
 recovery as chlorine moto fields recovery 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.340
 it does not matter, it will work for you without any 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.840
 problem in any way since a 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.700
 side is leaving the steps to follow 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.140
 with those recovery but good in this 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.179
 case with him I have the recovery let's go 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.409
 to the install section we are going to 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.270
 select at the top where 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.039
 says is thorax and you are going to select 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.420
 internal is thorax that would be the 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.069
 internal memory as I commented to you 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.600
 beginning of the video move the 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.969
 files to what is this partition 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.679
 let's click on ok and for automatic 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.270
 will show us what information is 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.860
 the internal memory will proceed to 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.689
 locate the files in my case the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.610
 I have in this folder called the command 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.009
 once you've located five 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.720
 What we are going to do is select the 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.429
 mode or the aspect we want to apply 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.709
 al air comment in this case I'm going to 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.929
 apply for example the one called air 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.979
 Committed dark material once you 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.929
 selections 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.340
 the mod that you want to apply you go to 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.229
 slide the arrow to the right to 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.830
 confirm your installation and we are going to 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.570
 wait for it to settle 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.250
 once it has been installed we will 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.960
 click on redwood system and that would be 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.820
 everything once it starts we will have 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.500
 changed what is the appearance of the air 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.300
 comet will wait to start 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 I can show you how the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.950
 new design to read comment 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.480
 here the device started quickly 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.620
 I show you what the air comet is like 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.810
 you can see the aspect has already changed 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.150
 Now you have these style colors 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.100
 dark material that is the design that I chose 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.570
 in the same way you can see how it is 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.850
 working perfectly here I'm going to 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.950
 open what is the memo action or what 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.450
 it is therefore the writing on screen more than 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.090
 nothing so you can see that it's working 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.890
 perfectly that it is not affected 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.480
 change what the design is I'm going to 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.340
 discard these changes because in general 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.170
 that would be all and it's a matter of you 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.820
 apply then the design that you most 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.990
 please in this case, I applied this 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.640
 of dark material 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.650
 since it suits me quite well with what 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.480
 is my notification bar since I 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.190
 I have here the one that is 'no' style and 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.890
 pure lollipop and you can see what it looks like 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.930
 more coordinated this the comment with this 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.520
 notification bar and good for 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.170
 can finish this tutorial 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.370
 to reverse the changes is very 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.870
 simple the only thing we have to do 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.400
 is to enter again what is the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.689
 custom recovery 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.400
 once we are in the position 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.019
 recovery and we do the same thing we go to the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.730
 install section proceed to 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.890
 locate the files that we download and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.030
 we moved to the beginning of the video once 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.379
 that have located them you are going to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.989
 select the file called air 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.610
 Comment original stock that as you 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.379
 commented at the beginning of the video is the 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.090
 original design of the air comet once 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.470
 that you have selected it, you slide the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.840
 arrow to the right to confirm your 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.879
 installation 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.709
 once it has been installed we click 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.819
 in the boot sistem and that would be all a 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.739
 Once you start the device already 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.780
 we will have restored the original design 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.760
 of the air comet let's wait for it to start 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.410
 so I can show you how it has been 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.209
 restored the design of the air comet and 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.209
 can end this tutorial 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.400
 here the device started quickly 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.020
 our the air comet as you can see already 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.460
 be restored to the original is to say already 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.920
 I have the original colors again 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.440
 and of course working perfectly 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.480
 and well, this would be everything, I hope you 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.020
 have liked more than anything worked and 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.020
 until next time
