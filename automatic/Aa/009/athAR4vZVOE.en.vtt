00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
overall drum sounds instead of going to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
overall drum sounds instead of going to
individual<00:00:56.210> faders<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> moving<00:00:57.600> them<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.780> and

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.420 
or two seconds a piece so you can
actually<00:04:09.930> tell<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.199> difference<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:11.190> here<00:04:11.370> we

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
actually tell the difference so here we

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:40.080 
actually tell the difference so here we
go

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.240 

so<00:04:41.090> as<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:41.960> can<00:04:42.080> tell<00:04:42.289> parallel<00:04:42.830> compression

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
so as you can tell parallel compression

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.969 
so as you can tell parallel compression
can<00:04:43.580> give<00:04:43.789> you<00:04:43.939> some<00:04:44.270> low-end<00:04:44.930> knock<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.800> you

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
can give you some low-end knock that you

can give you some low-end knock that you
just<00:04:46.490> couldn't<00:04:46.789> get<00:04:46.939> before<00:04:47.090> um<00:04:47.990> it's<00:04:48.289> a<00:04:48.379> neat

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
just couldn't get before um it's a neat
