00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.850
 no I appreciate and bert van marwijk article we were 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.469
 emmen and I thought it would be fun to make a film of it once, anyway 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.020
 the pingel completely different things than standing 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.609
 the time in the article that I 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.459
 and that's reason poster so I'm going to show today what I have my bags 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.919
 and that has been going from a school behind the window to school 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.029
 and i'm shopping my own creature 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.429
 actually i have 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.589
 now today this bag just my handbag 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.420
 and his knee has everything 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.730
 and 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.730
 after the technically competent 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.000
 because I often take it to school 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.870
 and 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.199
 this was not in the hand and I think it is super annoying to do 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.620
 from a son 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.090
 anyway 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.929
 that falls 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.520
 in this mode and then 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.910
 can i have a nice one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.450
 in the inspector 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.440
 and both to 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.930
 during the session he is far too heavy and too much in his sentence 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.220
 but I want the job 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.530
 7 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.670
 however, very good actually actually most moderate in actually 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 that police are needed for staff 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 therefore, a breakthrough in general hopes 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 again with this then show him and then I was used to 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.480
 the summer 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.780
 for a good person 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.780
 guidetti at night with this project 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.320
 peppermint 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.650
 in the experimental garden and yes everything is so stupid the number started trading 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.230
 and a bit of his pass from the school 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.230
 the rotterdammer tour but I also missed in the broadcast 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.570
 mirror 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.730
 does not end 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.730
 but off to 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.030
 and I notice sting 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.139
 feyenoord 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.139
 the round are four udo the cap to throw 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.339
 titia helmond friend jan maarten 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.599
 that is from the visit but it sticks incredibly weird you can hear you 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.150
 to clean their hands, but for the boy took a bike 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.669
 throw the teenager 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.979
 and further 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.289
 is wrong 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.289
 who is earned instead of my child 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.629
 and those extra cards 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:36.839
 skittles 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.859
 a civil servant job 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.859
 and that was immediately the big breeding 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.849
 anp ak in addition 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.329
 and how 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.559
 I always have a certain brand or something to read in any case 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:55.469
 because I like it when on the train that the bus about doesn't want to 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.999
 School has to do with it all day so now I don't have them 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:02:59.919
 has to do 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.459
 in as well as in english 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.329
 and one this morning's newspaper 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.629
 I now read the nrc next 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.939
 in the municipal school 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.750
 and this is no longer visible to my jessie daams it is my first week 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.349
 this week there is again two years and 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.749
 I also have a handy blow to you in this bag so I have you as me 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.619
 just wrong is nice to trade 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.619
 but far from the sudden mission as you know 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.539
 and have another penalty 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:31.669
 television cook up 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.529
 not really did not 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.479
 with its place 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.479
 and another lip gloss from biotherm 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.929
 and bakers from the body shop 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:46.729
 other box 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.419
 aside candy 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.409
 let me be terns 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.869
 just happy is that it does 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.619
 the old parking ticket 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:57.999
 with more than 5 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.249
 and a pen and money 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.120
 I naturally realize a lot 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.470
 with and most every day and then there is also a bottle of water secretly 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.979
 to change 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.389
 and you can choose 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.469
 of the last five days and that kind of investigations 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.430
 and further but on the books where one just 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.620
 there is more to speak so all first prize winners 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.620
 the book is not really necessary either 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.180
 and that was actually nothing at all the laptop and charging and mouse and such 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.870
 it was 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.949
 and yes I take a lot with me I notice now it is actually ridiculous 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:34.860
 but yeah 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.199
 do you know what it is a habit that if not and then it appears that it would be one 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.639
 lie and then 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.639
