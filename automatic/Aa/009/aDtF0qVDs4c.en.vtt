00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
about half the frame is painted out

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.219 
about half the frame is painted out

watch the corners right in through here

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.069 
watch the corners right in through here
and<00:01:37.619> make<00:01:37.680> sure<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.150> lot<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> paint<00:01:39.869> isn't

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
gathering in these corners here if so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.389 
gathering in these corners here if so
just<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.659> ahead<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> brush<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.229> flat<00:01:43.560> alrighty

just make sure you get you know the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.820 
just make sure you get you know the
edges<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.170> let's<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.319> ahead<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.590> put<00:02:10.739> on

edges here and let's go ahead and put on

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.199 
edges here and let's go ahead and put on
another<00:02:11.099> coat<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.700> should<00:02:11.849> be<00:02:11.940> done<00:02:12.090> after

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
another coat and we should be done after

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.280 
another coat and we should be done after
two<00:02:12.450> coats

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
two coats

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.890 
two coats
and<00:02:13.409> one<00:02:13.680> other<00:02:13.799> thing<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> nice<00:02:15.480> piece

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and one other thing this is a nice piece

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.470 
and one other thing this is a nice piece
and<00:02:16.260> I'm<00:02:16.980> not<00:02:17.219> sure<00:02:17.579> exactly<00:02:17.939> I<00:02:18.150> should<00:02:18.209> have

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and I'm not sure exactly I should have

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.569 
and I'm not sure exactly I should have
done<00:02:18.569> my<00:02:18.750> research<00:02:19.079> so<00:02:19.439> if<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.980> grandparent

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
done my research so if a grandparent

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.130 
done my research so if a grandparent
gives<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.790> something<00:02:21.000> old<00:02:21.329> which<00:02:21.689> this<00:02:21.900> is

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
gives you something old which this is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.199 
gives you something old which this is
make<00:02:22.859> sure<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.219> research<00:02:23.609> it<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.909> make<00:02:24.030> sure

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
make sure you research it to make sure

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.750 
make sure you research it to make sure
you're<00:02:24.450> not<00:02:24.829> repainting<00:02:25.829> a<00:02:25.950> frame<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.730> a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
you're not repainting a frame on a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.089 
you're not repainting a frame on a
picture<00:02:27.150> that's<00:02:27.329> worth<00:02:27.540> like<00:02:27.799> $20,000<00:02:28.799> so

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
picture that's worth like $20,000 so

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.979 
picture that's worth like $20,000 so
that's<00:02:29.849> something<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.269> should<00:02:30.299> have<00:02:30.810> done

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
that's something I should have done

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.449 
that's something I should have done
because<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:31.739> might<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:31.950> worth<00:02:32.220> something

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
because this might be worth something

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.089 
because this might be worth something
I'm<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.760> really<00:02:32.819> sure<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.950> really<00:02:34.950> love

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
I'm not really sure but I really love

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.440 
I'm not really sure but I really love
the<00:02:35.159> paintings<00:02:35.549> no<00:02:35.670> matter<00:02:35.819> if<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.269> worth

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the paintings no matter if it's worth

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.729 
the paintings no matter if it's worth
something<00:02:36.720> or<00:02:36.959> not<00:02:37.049> I<00:02:37.109> was<00:02:37.319> going<00:02:37.439> to<00:02:37.530> keep<00:02:37.620> it

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
something or not I was going to keep it

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.149 
something or not I was going to keep it
anyway

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
anyway

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.429 
anyway
but<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.849> course<00:02:38.879> 20<00:02:39.359> grand<00:02:39.569> that's<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.959> that's<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439

but of course 20 grand that's a that's a
free<00:02:40.769> car<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:42.299> your<00:02:42.450> research<00:02:42.569> before<00:02:43.049> you

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
free car so do your research before you

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.110 
free car so do your research before you
paint<00:02:43.319> your<00:02:43.560> very<00:02:44.219> expensive<00:02:44.340> painting<00:02:44.969> and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
paint your very expensive painting and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.879 
paint your very expensive painting and
with<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.599> paint<00:02:45.959> something<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> really

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
with this paint something that I really

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.879 
with this paint something that I really
like<00:02:47.659> I'm<00:02:48.659> not<00:02:48.810> sure<00:02:49.019> if<00:02:49.109> it's<00:02:49.230> my<00:02:49.290> technique

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
like I'm not sure if it's my technique

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.770 
like I'm not sure if it's my technique
or<00:02:50.069> not<00:02:50.220> but<00:02:50.609> I<00:02:50.639> just<00:02:50.849> use<00:02:51.030> straight<00:02:51.389> strokes

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
or not but I just use straight strokes

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.720 
or not but I just use straight strokes
you<00:02:52.049> know<00:02:52.169> go<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.739> way<00:02:52.889> this<00:02:53.099> way<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.549> way

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
you know go this way this way this way

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.670 
you know go this way this way this way
this<00:02:53.760> way<00:02:53.909> but<00:02:54.750> when<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.959> dries<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.260> cannot

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
this way but when it dries you cannot

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.099 
this way but when it dries you cannot
see<00:02:56.099> any<00:02:56.370> brushstrokes<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.480> frame<00:02:57.840> so

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
see any brushstrokes in the frame so

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.409 
see any brushstrokes in the frame so
that's<00:02:58.200> also<00:02:58.530> something<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:58.919> really<00:02:59.159> like

00:02:59.409 --> 00:02:59.419 
that's also something I really like

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.020 
that's also something I really like
because<00:03:00.419> obviously<00:03:00.750> brush<00:03:01.530> strokes<00:03:01.889> and<00:03:02.790> some

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
because obviously brush strokes and some

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.300 
because obviously brush strokes and some
people<00:03:03.299> like<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.480> kind<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.989> motif<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:04.919> I

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
people like that kind of motif but I

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.030 
people like that kind of motif but I
particularly<00:03:06.180> don't<00:03:06.689> but<00:03:07.439> as<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.799> see<00:03:08.010> I

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
particularly don't but as you can see I

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.949 
particularly don't but as you can see I
got<00:03:08.189> a<00:03:08.250> lot<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.430> paint<00:03:08.760> along<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.510> edges<00:03:09.780> here

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
got a lot of paint along the edges here

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.809 
got a lot of paint along the edges here
so<00:03:10.139> I'm<00:03:10.709> going<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.889> take<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> razor<00:03:11.280> blade<00:03:11.430> and

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
so I'm going to take a razor blade and

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.089 
so I'm going to take a razor blade and
I'm<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.389> get<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.900> off<00:03:13.109> there<00:03:13.319> so

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
I'm going to get that off there so

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.559 
I'm going to get that off there so
that's<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> next<00:03:14.549> step<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.060> again<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.389> is

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
that's the next step so again this is

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.119 
that's the next step so again this is
after<00:03:15.870> two<00:03:16.139> coats<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.829> painting
