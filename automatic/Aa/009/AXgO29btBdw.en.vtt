says<00:01:50.830> Big<00:01:51.130> Bang<00:01:51.430> attack<00:01:51.820> instead<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.390> final

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
says Big Bang attack instead of final

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.450 
says Big Bang attack instead of final
flash<00:01:52.960> but<00:01:53.590> that's<00:01:53.770> what<00:01:53.979> he<00:01:54.070> says<00:01:54.280> in

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
flash but that's what he says in

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.539 
flash but that's what he says in
Japanese<00:01:54.970> too<00:01:55.299> so<00:01:55.929> it<00:01:56.200> isn't<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.560> mistake<00:01:56.710> for

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549

reasons not said baby got the attack
name<00:01:59.950> wrong<00:02:00.189> probably<00:02:01.060> because<00:02:01.659> it<00:02:01.810> isn't<00:02:01.960> his

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
name wrong probably because it isn't his
