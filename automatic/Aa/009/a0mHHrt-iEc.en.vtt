00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.520
 her own people from cham state brings a 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.980
 short to something unspectacular that 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.620
 unboxing but that's the content for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.099
 spectacular I have the xbox 360 here 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.599
 version of grand theft auto 5 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.240
 and I would rather have the special edition 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.529
 or the collector's edition on I box 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 Unfortunately I had the bad luck 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 but I did not get any more 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.289
 Nonetheless , you want that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.750
 I'm also happy about the game 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.809
 normal edition and then we'll have a look 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.160
 now you cool cover with cool comic 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.690
 Impressions recognize more of grand 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:46.229
 theft auto usk from 18 30 side and back 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.780
 we have the normal one player mode 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.400
 It takes 8 gb to do it 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.619
 So player can free space 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.119
 on the hard disk or alternatively on 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.280
 the usb-stick is synonymous if the 

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:59.010
 next bus without hard drive have the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.780
 scoring a game score 6 150 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.869
 kilobyte 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 It will be parts of the elevator 1920 1080i 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:09.090
 and 1080p dollars and xbox support 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.210
 live can the online multiplayer 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.490
 play with 2 to 16 players co-op mode 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.350
 with 26 players and there are among them 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.890
 according to stretcher game content and best lists 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.010
 and then I'll take you one 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.740
 piece with top to high up 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.010
 exactly not after, and already now 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.900
 See helicopter and couple cool game 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.440
 So one pretty much does not have one 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.880
 Graphic of the game when you drink that 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.110
 It runs on consoles in 2005 and 2006 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.290
 have come to the market 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.290
 So say xbox 360 or playstation 3 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.290
 I originally wanted to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.120
 wait until the xbox kubon has around 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.350
 the catholic far not however whether 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.799
 is immediately available and therefore 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.150
 well for the 360 â€‹â€‹the version probably if 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.770
 I really like it 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.799
 still 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.739
 the conversion because I know you 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.410
 because it noble noble all games on lack 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.900
 because of lack of time you know 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.900
 Maybe that's how it is bought weirdly 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.450
 Examples fragrance delicious 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.840
 something we have beautiful is relatively 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.400
 well filled for a normal edition 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.400
 one second is all getting out 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.870
 We got the instructions 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.420
 the digital manual can be found in the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:50.630
 internet for the short instructions then 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.130
 fly the atom with airship is there 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.510
 a code on the back with listing 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.680
 you can fly if you fly it yourself 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.420
 Can or fly with the white 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.560
 schmidt but at least there is a code 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.200
 offered is the standard edition and 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.040
 we have a really nice map of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.040
 los santos ecology reasonably 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.579
 unfolded now come a whole 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:23.299
 scarce 25 too far away not from the 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:24.829
 camera but is really ne yes yes is one 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.540
 I can not have a big card right now 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.540
 properly demonstrate the big one is 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:37.069
 seems really well to the size and 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.690
 there we have the games dvd with 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.989
 a delicious bikini is brewing on the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.989
 cover 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.450
 if you get out of this is dvd 1 and dvd 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.960

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.220
