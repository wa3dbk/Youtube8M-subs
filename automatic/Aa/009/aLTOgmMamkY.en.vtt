the live plant and then if we look in
the<00:01:22.140> inventory<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.890> life<00:01:23.369> plant<00:01:23.640> looks<00:01:23.820> like

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
eat this you can actually eat the fruit
by<00:01:31.860> itself<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.670> take<00:01:32.909> off<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.390> day

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
by itself and it will take off one day

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.460 
by itself and it will take off one day
of<00:01:34.759> aging<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.540> eat<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> know

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
of aging so you can eat like you know

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.960 
of aging so you can eat like you know
like<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> hundred<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.400> something<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
like a hundred of them or something and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.270 
like a hundred of them or something and
it<00:01:39.360> will<00:01:39.450> actually<00:01:39.659> uh<00:01:40.020> discount<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.100> those

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it will actually uh discount all those

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.730 
it will actually uh discount all those
days<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:41.850> life<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.450> love<00:01:42.659> used<00:01:43.170> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
days of your life that you love used so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
days of your life that you love used so
that's<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.280> way<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> achieve<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.970> process

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that's one way to achieve the process

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
that's one way to achieve the process
but<00:01:45.720> another<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.320> which<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.369> more

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
but another way which is much more

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.420 
but another way which is much more
feasible<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.810> last<00:01:48.990> fall<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.560> lot<00:01:50.220> more

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
feasible and the last fall a lot more

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.560 
feasible and the last fall a lot more
efficient<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:50.939> pretty<00:01:51.149> much<00:01:51.210> means<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
efficient which pretty much means the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.630 
efficient which pretty much means the
same<00:01:51.720> thing

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
same thing

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.490 
same thing
what<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.509> go<00:01:54.689> fishing<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
what you do is you go fishing and you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.170 
what you do is you go fishing and you
achieve<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.890> level<00:01:56.340> ten<00:01:56.520> fishing<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:57.060> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
achieve a level ten fishing which is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.789 
achieve a level ten fishing which is
maxing<00:01:57.540> out<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.659> insufficient<00:01:58.290> skill<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
maxing out your insufficient skill and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.140 
maxing out your insufficient skill and
you<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> UM<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.869> stream<00:02:01.350> or

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
you go to UM you go to a stream or

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.210 
you go to UM you go to a stream or
pound<00:02:02.330> or<00:02:02.600> whatever<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:03.680> looked<00:02:03.920> at<00:02:04.040> up

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
pound or whatever and you looked at up

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.630 
pound or whatever and you looked at up
to<00:02:04.250> also<00:02:04.700> enum<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.650> let's<00:02:06.650> see<00:02:06.830> well<00:02:07.490> right

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
to also enum and let's see well right

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.310 
to also enum and let's see well right
now<00:02:07.730> it's<00:02:07.910> dark<00:02:08.149> actually<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.990> think<00:02:09.229> I'm

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
now it's dark actually so I think I'm

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.690 
now it's dark actually so I think I'm
gonna<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.680> wait<00:02:09.830> until<00:02:10.009> twelve<00:02:10.369> what

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
gonna have to wait until twelve what
