and<00:02:07.050> I<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.350> here's<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.770> answer<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and I was like here's my answer and I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.070 
and I was like here's my answer and I
just<00:02:08.940> felt<00:02:09.150> like<00:02:09.210> there's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.540> support<00:02:09.869> system

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
just felt like there's a support system

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.110 
just felt like there's a support system
of<00:02:10.410> people<00:02:10.740> that<00:02:10.950> knew<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.580> had<00:02:11.880> been<00:02:12.090> through

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
of people that knew and had been through

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.700 
of people that knew and had been through
the<00:02:12.330> process<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.990> could<00:02:13.110> ask<00:02:13.230> questions

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
the process and I could ask questions

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.650 
the process and I could ask questions
because<00:02:13.920> any<00:02:14.190> book<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.700> pick<00:02:14.850> up<00:02:14.970> their<00:02:15.360> good

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
because any book you pick up their good

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.860 
because any book you pick up their good
kudi<00:02:16.020> ass<00:02:16.140> don't<00:02:16.650> maximize<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.880> it's

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
kudi ass don't maximize them and it's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.990 
kudi ass don't maximize them and it's
been<00:02:19.080> working<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:20.160> mean<00:02:20.700> I'm<00:02:20.850> losing

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
been working and I mean I'm losing

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.630 
been working and I mean I'm losing
weight<00:02:21.360> not<00:02:21.900> fast<00:02:22.620> what<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.430> with

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
weight not fast what can you do with

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.900 
weight not fast what can you do with
other<00:02:23.820> programs<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.630> doesn't<00:02:24.990> happen<00:02:25.170> fast

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
other programs it doesn't happen fast

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.300 
other programs it doesn't happen fast
but<00:02:26.910> I'm<00:02:27.120> feeling<00:02:27.540> amazing<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.560> find<00:02:29.190> with

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
that's what I may be so more and more

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.180 
that's what I may be so more and more
people<00:02:48.090> realize<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.260> has<00:02:49.380> less<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.950> do

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
people realize that it has less to do

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.790 
people realize that it has less to do
with<00:02:50.220> how<00:02:50.760> much<00:02:50.970> food<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.420> consume<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.530> lot

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
with how much food you consume and a lot

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.530 
with how much food you consume and a lot
more<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.190> deal<00:02:53.430> with<00:02:53.610> your<00:02:53.730> hormones<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
more to deal with your hormones but the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.870 
more to deal with your hormones but the
problem<00:02:54.960> is<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.400> toxins<00:02:56.400> getting<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.820> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
problem is this toxins getting in the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.449 
problem is this toxins getting in the
body<00:02:57.060> toxins<00:02:57.959> from<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.200> environment<00:02:58.459> toxins

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
body toxins from the environment toxins

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.310 
body toxins from the environment toxins
from<00:02:59.550> your<00:02:59.640> food<00:02:59.940> they<00:03:00.450> do<00:03:00.510> affect<00:03:01.170> your

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
from your food they do affect your

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.410 
from your food they do affect your
hormones<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.160> specifically<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.150> hormone

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
hormones and specifically the hormone

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.420 
hormones and specifically the hormone
that<00:03:03.540> gets<00:03:03.720> affected<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.470> left-handed

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
that gets affected is left-handed

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.100 
that gets affected is left-handed
you<00:03:05.580> know<00:03:05.700> leptin<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.270> hormone<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.990> is

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
you know leptin is the hormone that is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.930 
you know leptin is the hormone that is
created<00:03:07.410> by<00:03:07.470> your<00:03:07.590> fat<00:03:07.830> cells<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.640> goes<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
created by your fat cells it goes to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.720 
created by your fat cells it goes to
your<00:03:09.030> brain<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.570> tells<00:03:09.870> your<00:03:09.959> brain<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.410> burn

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
your brain and tells your brain to burn

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.910 
your brain and tells your brain to burn
those<00:03:10.879> same<00:03:11.150> fat<00:03:11.390> cells<00:03:11.659> for<00:03:11.840> energy<00:03:11.870> but<00:03:12.769> the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
those same fat cells for energy but the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.009 
those same fat cells for energy but the
problem<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.519> when<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.300> body<00:03:14.420> becomes<00:03:14.750> toxic

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
problem is when the body becomes toxic

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.589 
problem is when the body becomes toxic
it<00:03:15.739> causes<00:03:16.159> this<00:03:16.280> unregulated<00:03:17.120> release<00:03:17.450> of

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
it causes this unregulated release of

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.449 
it causes this unregulated release of
black<00:03:17.690> into<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.110> brain<00:03:18.349> just<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.159> the<00:03:19.250> point

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
black into the brain just to the point

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.430 
black into the brain just to the point
where<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.610> brain<00:03:19.819> stops<00:03:20.239> listening<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.230> you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
where the brain stops listening and you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.960 
where the brain stops listening and you
know<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.650> phenomena<00:03:22.129> is<00:03:22.250> called<00:03:22.280> weight<00:03:22.730> loss

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
know the phenomena is called weight loss

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.910 
know the phenomena is called weight loss
resistance<00:03:23.360> now<00:03:24.230> gets<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.530> point<00:03:24.799> R<00:03:24.830> it

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
resistance now gets the point R it

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.649 
resistance now gets the point R it
doesn't<00:03:25.280> matter<00:03:25.400> how<00:03:25.519> much<00:03:25.640> person<00:03:26.000> exercises

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
doesn't matter how much person exercises

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.150 
doesn't matter how much person exercises
it<00:03:27.110> doesn't<00:03:27.349> matter<00:03:27.470> how<00:03:27.620> much<00:03:27.739> what<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.099> a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
it doesn't matter how much what if a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.369 
it doesn't matter how much what if a
person<00:03:28.459> eats<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:29.090> brain<00:03:29.360> stops<00:03:29.750> listening<00:03:30.260> as

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
person eats the brain stops listening as

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.500 
person eats the brain stops listening as
a<00:03:30.410> result<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.830> toxicity<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:31.610> in<00:03:31.730> fat<00:03:31.940> cells<00:03:32.150> so

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
a result of toxicity and in fat cells so

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.900 
a result of toxicity and in fat cells so
again<00:03:32.989> what<00:03:33.470> does<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.680> come<00:03:33.830> down<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:34.430> clean

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
again what does it come down to a clean

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.580 
again what does it come down to a clean
healthy<00:03:35.299> diet<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.750> eliminating<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.410> toxins

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
healthy diet and eliminating the toxins

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.500 
healthy diet and eliminating the toxins
that<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.099> been<00:03:37.250> accumulated<00:03:37.610> in<00:03:38.209> many

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
that have been accumulated in many

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.780 
that have been accumulated in many
people's<00:03:38.810> cases<00:03:39.019> for<00:03:39.620> years<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.220> years<00:03:40.549> and

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
people's cases for years and years and

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.940 
people's cases for years and years and
years

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
years

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.100 
years
number<00:03:42.950> three<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.670> distance<00:03:44.269> exercise<00:03:44.780> and

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
number three is distance exercise and

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.140
