hey everybody Joe here at reverb today
we're<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> learn<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> little<00:00:18.660> bit<00:00:18.779> about

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
we're going to learn a little bit about

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.840 
we're going to learn a little bit about
diminished<00:00:19.500> chords<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.070> their<00:00:20.400> functions

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
diminished chords and their functions

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.330 
diminished chords and their functions
it's<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> question<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.020> get<00:00:22.080> often<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.710> how

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
it's a question that I get often is how

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
it's a question that I get often is how
do<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.519> use<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> diminished<00:00:24.210> chord<00:00:24.269> where<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:25.019> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
do I use the diminished chord where do I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.259 
do I use the diminished chord where do I
fit<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.500> into<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.710> progression<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.820> we're<00:00:27.180> going

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
fit it into a progression so we're going

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.599 
fit it into a progression so we're going
to<00:00:27.390> learn<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> diminished<00:00:28.410> chord<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.800> how

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
to learn what a diminished chord is how

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.460 
to learn what a diminished chord is how
to<00:00:29.670> use<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> progression<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.810> we'll

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to use it in a progression and we'll

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
to use it in a progression and we'll
take<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> look<00:00:31.740> at<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> couple<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.250> examples<00:00:32.520> of

minor thirds on top of each other so for
example<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.640> we're<00:00:56.789> making<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.149> D<00:00:57.420> diminished

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
example if we're making a D diminished

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.479 
example if we're making a D diminished
7th<00:00:58.260> chord<00:00:58.289> we're<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> D<00:00:59.489> an<00:00:59.780> F<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
7th chord we're going to have a D an F a

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.929 
7th chord we're going to have a D an F a
flat<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.030> C<00:01:03.809> flat<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:07.580> common<00:01:08.580> diminished

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
flat and C flat a common diminished

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.359 
flat and C flat a common diminished
chord<00:01:09.150> shape<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.580 

so<00:01:16.369> here<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.150> tonality<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.510> that<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.110> you

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
so here the tonality of that and you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.980 
so here the tonality of that and you
think<00:01:18.619> that's<00:01:19.549> very<00:01:19.729> unstable<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.750> is

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
think that's very unstable it is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.740 
think that's very unstable it is
diminished<00:01:21.830> chord<00:01:22.040> is<00:01:22.280> very<00:01:23.030> unstable<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.600> it

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
diminished chord is very unstable and it

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.010 
diminished chord is very unstable and it
wants<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.020> resolve<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:24.560> needs<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.130> resolve<00:01:26.020> you

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
wants to resolve it needs to resolve you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.300 
wants to resolve it needs to resolve you
need<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.290> resolve<00:01:27.530> that<00:01:27.619> chord<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.070> wouldn't

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
need to resolve that chord you wouldn't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.010 
need to resolve that chord you wouldn't
play<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.610> chord<00:01:28.820> last<00:01:29.270> thing<00:01:29.509> before<00:01:29.659> trying

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
play that chord last thing before trying

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.790 
play that chord last thing before trying
to<00:01:30.080> go<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.259> bed<00:01:30.440> you<00:01:30.619> wouldn't<00:01:30.830> get<00:01:30.920> any<00:01:31.040> sleep

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
to go to bed you wouldn't get any sleep

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.020 
to go to bed you wouldn't get any sleep
so<00:01:33.800> let's<00:01:33.979> take<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.190> same<00:01:34.520> chord<00:01:34.790> D

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
so let's take that same chord D

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.420 
so let's take that same chord D
diminished<00:01:35.479> seven<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.869> let's<00:01:35.899> move<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.220> root

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
diminished seven and let's move the root

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.700 
diminished seven and let's move the root
to<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> different<00:01:38.450> string<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:38.869> we<00:01:38.899> have<00:01:39.140> another

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
to a different string so we have another

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.800 
to a different string so we have another
shape<00:01:40.040> option<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.700> that<00:01:40.790> chord<00:01:41.060> middle

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
shape option for that chord middle

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.350 
shape option for that chord middle
finger<00:01:42.080> on<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.259> root<00:01:42.820> tenth<00:01:43.820> fret<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.300> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
finger on the root tenth fret of the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.870 
finger on the root tenth fret of the
e-string<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.320> then<00:01:46.070> we're<00:01:46.160> going<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.310> bar<00:01:46.580> on

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
e-string and then we're going to bar on

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.410 
e-string and then we're going to bar on
the<00:01:46.970> ninth<00:01:47.179> fret<00:01:47.420> D<00:01:48.350> string<00:01:48.740> g<00:01:48.970> string<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.090> b

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
the ninth fret D string g string and b

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.749 
the ninth fret D string g string and b
string<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.009> we're<00:01:52.009> going<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.190> add<00:01:52.340> our<00:01:52.369> ring

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
string and we're going to add our ring

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.719 
string and we're going to add our ring
finger<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.420> 10th<00:01:53.990> fret<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.320> g<00:01:54.530> string

finger on the 10th fret of the g string

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.660 
finger on the 10th fret of the g string
so<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:55.850> going<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.030> be<00:01:56.119> like<00:01:56.240> this<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:57.670> just

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
so it's going to be like this and just

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.540 
so it's going to be like this and just
playing<00:01:58.820> those<00:01:59.030> four<00:01:59.270> strings<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:04.220> here's<00:02:04.399> one

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
playing those four strings so here's one

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.620 
playing those four strings so here's one
shape<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.780> here's<00:02:06.200> another

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.900 

another<00:02:09.620> thing<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.010> is<00:02:10.160> fairly<00:02:10.670> unique

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
another thing that is fairly unique

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.730 
another thing that is fairly unique
about<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.630> nature<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.930> diminished<00:02:12.380> chord<00:02:12.590> is

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
about the nature of diminished chord is

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.230 
about the nature of diminished chord is
that<00:02:13.010> every<00:02:13.280> interval<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.880> core<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
that every interval in the core is the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.840 
that every interval in the core is the
same<00:02:14.540> like<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.870> said<00:02:15.050> minor<00:02:15.770> third<00:02:16.100> minor<00:02:16.520> third

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
same like I said minor third minor third

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.390 
same like I said minor third minor third
minor<00:02:17.240> third<00:02:17.600> by<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.350> logic<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.800> can<00:02:19.070> move

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
minor third by that logic you can move

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.400 
minor third by that logic you can move
the<00:02:20.000> chord<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.710> that<00:02:21.710> interval<00:02:22.160> minor<00:02:22.880> third

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
the chord in that interval minor third

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.770 
the chord in that interval minor third
and<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:25.010> have<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.250> same<00:02:25.430> chord<00:02:25.790> it's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
and you have the same chord it's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.420 
and you have the same chord it's
inverted<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.710> same<00:02:28.010> series<00:02:28.400> of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
inverted but it's the same series of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.320 
inverted but it's the same series of
notes<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.190> take<00:02:34.430> any<00:02:34.610> diminished<00:02:35.090> chord

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
notes so you take any diminished chord

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.320 
notes so you take any diminished chord
and<00:02:35.570> move<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.500> three<00:02:36.860> frets<00:02:37.160> anyway<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.030> it's

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
and move it three frets anyway and it's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.240 
and move it three frets anyway and it's
the<00:02:38.420> same<00:02:38.630> chord<00:02:38.930> ok<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:39.590> how<00:02:39.800> do<00:02:39.860> we<00:02:39.950> apply

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
the same chord ok so how do we apply

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.800 
the same chord ok so how do we apply
these<00:02:40.310> chords<00:02:40.820> how<00:02:40.940> do<00:02:41.000> we<00:02:41.120> fit<00:02:41.390> them<00:02:41.540> into<00:02:41.780> a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
these chords how do we fit them into a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.230 
these chords how do we fit them into a
progression<00:02:42.400> well<00:02:43.400> there<00:02:43.550> are<00:02:43.640> two<00:02:43.880> very

you<00:04:45.840> should<00:04:45.960> check<00:04:46.110> out<00:04:46.199> our<00:04:46.320> diatonic<00:04:46.919> slesin

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
you should check out our diatonic slesin

you should check out our diatonic slesin
so<00:04:48.330> where<00:04:48.479> do<00:04:48.570> we<00:04:48.630> fit<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.810> diminished<00:04:49.199> chord<00:04:49.320> in

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
so where do we fit a diminished chord in

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.040 
so where do we fit a diminished chord in
here<00:04:49.650> remember<00:04:50.310> as<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.490> passing<00:04:51.030> chord<00:04:51.300> linking

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
here remember as a passing chord linking

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.379 
here remember as a passing chord linking
two<00:04:52.259> chords<00:04:52.620> together<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.759> let's<00:04:54.150> try<00:04:54.330> it

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
two chords together so let's try it

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.570 
two chords together so let's try it
between<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.349> one<00:04:55.500> chord<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.190> two<00:04:56.340> chord

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
between the one chord and the two chord

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.390 
between the one chord and the two chord
the<00:04:57.030> first<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.419> second<00:04:57.660> chord<00:04:58.099> again<00:04:59.099> we're

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
the first and second chord again we're

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.240 
the first and second chord again we're
going<00:04:59.520> from<00:04:59.699> C<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.180> we<00:05:00.570> want<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.870> get<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.380> D

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
going from C and we want to get to D

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.689 
going from C and we want to get to D
minor<00:05:02.490> seven<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.990> if<00:05:04.740> we<00:05:04.949> build<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.310> diminished

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
minor seven so if we build a diminished

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.460 
minor seven so if we build a diminished
chord<00:05:05.820> off<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.210> c-sharp<00:05:06.780> right<00:05:07.349> in

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
chord off of that c-sharp right in

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.339 
chord off of that c-sharp right in
between<00:05:07.770> those<00:05:07.889> two<00:05:08.039> chords<00:05:09.169> we're<00:05:10.169> going<00:05:10.289> to

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
between those two chords we're going to

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:27.870 
between those two chords we're going to
get<00:05:10.440> our<00:05:10.560> answer

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.219 

very<00:05:28.880> simple<00:05:29.240> sounds<00:05:29.510> very<00:05:29.600> natural<00:05:29.780> right

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
very simple sounds very natural right

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.810 
very simple sounds very natural right
