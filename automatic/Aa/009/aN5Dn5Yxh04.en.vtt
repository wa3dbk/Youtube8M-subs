00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.129
 The world is on the verge of a global change. 

00:00:06.146 --> 00:00:10.084
 The data transmission rate has grown in multiples of millions. 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:16.299
 The rate of significant global events and that of discoveries and crises is growing exponentially. 

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:22.616
 Our civilization is like a ship without a captain navigating in rough seas without a map or compass 

00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:25.365
 moving faster and faster. 

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:29.356
 The time to make the right decisions is getting shorter and shorter. 

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:35.232
 We are faced with the option of falling into a new dark age, in affliction and degradation 

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:40.918
 or find a new model for human development and create not only a new civilization 

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:43.059
 but a new humanity. 

00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:48.220
 Historical crises show that to overcome stagnation we need technological revolutions. 

00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:53.826
 It is clear that the revolution of today will require the deepest social transformation. 

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:57.573
 The world community and its leaders should encourage humanity, 

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:02.043
 instead of wasting resources on solving momentary problems, 

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.866
 so that they focus on the technologies of the future: 

00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:10.119
 Nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, 

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:14.193
 cognitive, genetic and robotic technology. 

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:17.923
 Doing that will allow us to find new sources of energy, 

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:21.530
 create new transportation and architecture, 

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:25.597
 allow unprecedented developments in human cognitive abilities, 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.416
 refine the artificial intelligences and the interfaces between the brain and the computer. 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.292
 Simulate complex systems, create humanoid robots and cyborgs, 

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:39.882
 and with the help of nanorobots we can develop "controllable matter" 

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:46.016
 and find ways to transfer our personality to an artificial carrier. 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.831
 However, what we need is not just another technological revolution 

00:01:49.854 --> 00:01:52.225
 but a new paradigm of civilization. 

00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:57.833
 We need a new philosophy and ideology, a new ethic, a new culture and a new psychology. 

00:01:57.856 --> 00:01:59.872
 Even a new metaphysics. 

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:06.506
 We must re-set our limits, go beyond ourselves: beyond the Earth and the Solar System. 

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:10.013
 This is an adequate response to the challenges of our time. 

00:02:10.037 --> 00:02:14.054
 In that way a new reality and the future man could emerge. 

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:19.070
 Could it happen spontaneously, by itself? Unlikely. 

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.465
 Humanity does not have a master plan of its development. 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.176
 Seek stability, live in the present and do not plan. 

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:29.596
 Preserves the status quo and tries to escape from development. 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.249
 It does not tend to plan over future centuries and take responsibility for evolution. 

00:02:34.273 --> 00:02:42.725
 In the culture of consumerism there is no vocabulary and evolutionary rhetoric. 

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:47.266
 To break the stalemate, the Russia 2045 Movement was founded. 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:52.557
 It is a mega project that has the intention of reaching new peaks and senses. 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.760
 We intend to create a new vector for civilization 

00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:58.846
 that points to a constant human development of evolution. 

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:04.003
 As it happened with the megaprojects of the last century: the nuclear and the space program, 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.311
 We integrate the latest discoveries and developments of the sciences: 

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:13.704
 Physics, energy, aeronautics, bioengineering, nanotechnology, 

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.403
 neurology, cybernetics, cognitive science. 

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:22.892
 May the spiritual ideals and the imperishable values ​​help us to avoid taking the wrong path! 

00:03:22.904 --> 00:03:26.538
 Our project will give new meanings to the millions of people in the world. 

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:31.727
 We will be the result of their joint creativity and will take us out of the impasse, 

00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:38.453
 away from the murder of nature and physical death forward, to the realm of freedom and creativity, 

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:44.647
 to the depths of the ocean and to the stars, to the infinite universe of our inner world. 

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:47.592
 Our forecast for the next 40 years: 

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:53.807
 February, 2012: The 2045 Global Future Congress is held in Moscow. 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.867
 It is a debate platform for the discussion of the development prospects of our civilization. 

00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:06.458
 2012-2013: Global economic and social crises worsen. 

00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:11.008
 The debates on the global paradigm of future development intensify. 

00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:14.325
 New transhumanist movements and groups emerge. 

00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:18.913
 "Russia 2045" becomes "World 2045". 

00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:25.594
 Simultaneously the 2045.com international social network for hope and innovation is expanding. 

00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:31.882
 Here, anyone interested can propose a project, take part in it or finance it or both. 

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:38.468
 In the network there are scientists, experts, researchers, financiers and administrators. 

00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:47.654
 2013-2014: New centers are emerging working on cybernetic technologies for the development of radical life extensions. 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.545
 The race for immortality begins. 

00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:55.396
 2015-2020: The Avatar is created, 

00:04:55.416 --> 00:05:00.072
 a human robotic copy controlled by thought with a cerebral interface. 

00:05:00.107 --> 00:05:02.672
 It becomes as common as a car. 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.290
 In Russia and in the world, several projects with important advances appear in test mode 

00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:11.968
 Android robots to replace people in manufacturing tasks. 

00:05:11.986 --> 00:05:15.318
 Android robots servants for each house. 

00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:19.548
 Avatars controlled with thought to provide tele presence anywhere in the world 

00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:22.986
 and abolish the need for business travel. 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:31.312
 Flying cars, mobile communications inside the body or applied with spray on the skin and controlled with thought. 

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:41.026
 2020-2025: An autonomous system is created that provides life support for the brain and that allows interactions with the environment. 

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:44.323
 The brain is transplanted to an avatar. 

00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:48.710
 With the avatar the man gets a longer life. 

00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:55.046
 2025: The new generation of avatars provides a complete transmission of sensations 

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:58.972
 of the 5 sensor organs of the robot to the operator. 

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:07.363
 2030-2035: "Rebrain". The colossal brain reverse engineering project is implemented. 

00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:11.699
 World science is very close to understanding the principles of consciousness. 

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:18.455
 2035: The first successful attempt to transfer a personality to an alternative carrier. 

00:06:18.472 --> 00:06:22.928

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:42.456
 2045-2050: Drastic changes in the social structure and scientific and technological development. 

00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:46.100
 All the prerequisites for spatial expansion are established. 

00:06:46.134 --> 00:06:50.480
 For the man of the future, war and violence are not acceptable. 

00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:55.863
 The main priority of its development is spiritual self-improvement. 

00:06:55.898 --> 00:07:06.837
 A new era begins: the era of neo-humanity.
