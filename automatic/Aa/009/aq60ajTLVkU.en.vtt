as you can see a bots over lumberjack we

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.740 
as you can see a bots over lumberjack we
also<00:00:52.040> have<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.339> runner<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:53.269> gets<00:00:53.449> all<00:00:53.629> the

also have a runner that gets all the
materials<00:00:54.170> from<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.530> box<00:00:54.799> and<00:00:55.159> puts<00:00:55.519> it<00:00:55.610> into

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
materials from that box and puts it into

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.869 
materials from that box and puts it into
a<00:00:55.879> main<00:00:56.180> chest<00:00:57.970> and<00:00:58.970> then<00:00:59.210> over<00:00:59.720> here<00:00:59.750> we<00:01:00.879> have

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
a main chest and then over here we have

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.950 
a main chest and then over here we have
a<00:01:02.059> minor<00:01:03.759> as<00:01:04.759> you<00:01:04.909> can<00:01:05.059> see<00:01:05.180> snuggle<00:01:05.600> this<00:01:05.780> out

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
a minor as you can see snuggle this out

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.060 
a minor as you can see snuggle this out
so<00:01:06.170> for<00:01:06.409> I<00:01:06.439> think<00:01:06.680> he's<00:01:06.770> got<00:01:06.979> lost<00:01:08.619> maybe<00:01:09.619> is<00:01:09.860> I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
so for I think he's got lost maybe is I

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.499 
so for I think he's got lost maybe is I
can't<00:01:13.070> get<00:01:13.189> myself<00:01:13.340> up<00:01:13.670> there<00:01:18.130> digging<00:01:19.130> away

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
can't get myself up there digging away

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:29.440 
can't get myself up there digging away
if<00:01:20.509> we<00:01:20.659> go<00:01:20.810> over<00:01:21.049> here<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:22.040> have<00:01:22.159> a<00:01:22.420> farmer<00:01:28.450> if

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
if we go over here we have a farmer if

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.419 
if we go over here we have a farmer if
you<00:01:29.659> expecting<00:01:30.289> it<00:01:30.439> to<00:01:30.920> get<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.189> enough

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
you expecting it to get you enough

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.919 
you expecting it to get you enough
materials<00:01:31.939> to<00:01:32.179> build<00:01:32.329> something<00:01:32.600> like<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
materials to build something like the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.469 
materials to build something like the
Taj<00:01:33.170> Mahal<00:01:33.200> forget<00:01:34.100> about<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:35.299> can

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
Taj Mahal forget about it you can

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.800 
Taj Mahal forget about it you can
probably<00:01:35.719> actually<00:01:36.020> get<00:01:36.679> more<00:01:37.009> yourself<00:01:37.810> for

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
probably actually get more yourself for

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.690 
probably actually get more yourself for
a<00:01:38.869> bit<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.020> fun<00:01:39.259> we<00:01:39.799> can<00:01:39.979> leave<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.249> over<00:01:40.460> in

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
a bit of fun we can leave it over in

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.010 
a bit of fun we can leave it over in
fact<00:01:40.969> it<00:01:41.149> can't<00:01:41.329> even<00:01:41.539> leave<00:01:41.689> it<00:01:41.780> overnight

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
fact it can't even leave it overnight

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.980 
fact it can't even leave it overnight
because<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:42.590> stops<00:01:42.889> and<00:01:43.100> sleeps<00:01:43.539> it<00:01:44.539> leaves<00:01:44.780> a

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
because it stops and sleeps it leaves a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.520 
because it stops and sleeps it leaves a
load<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.380> signs<00:01:45.920> about<00:01:46.249> this<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> runner

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
load of signs about this is a runner

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.520 
load of signs about this is a runner
these<00:01:48.530> leave<00:01:49.039> signs<00:01:49.340> about<00:01:50.079> basically<00:01:51.079> for

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
these leave signs about basically for

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.059 
these leave signs about basically for
rock<00:01:52.929> basically<00:01:53.929> points<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.530> bot<00:01:54.829> in<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
rock basically points that bot in the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.620 
rock basically points that bot in the
direction<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:55.880> doesn't<00:01:56.149> collect<00:01:56.299> all<00:01:56.509> the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
direction and doesn't collect all the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.520 
direction and doesn't collect all the
materials<00:01:57.170> it's<00:01:57.889> very<00:01:58.130> slow<00:01:59.049> it's<00:02:00.049> extremely

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
materials it's very slow it's extremely

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.599 
materials it's very slow it's extremely
slow<00:02:01.069> to<00:02:01.130> be<00:02:01.369> quite<00:02:01.579> honest<00:02:02.920> but<00:02:03.920> it's<00:02:04.249> a<00:02:04.429> bit

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
slow to be quite honest but it's a bit

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.609 
slow to be quite honest but it's a bit
of<00:02:04.670> fun<00:02:04.819> that's<00:02:05.240> quite<00:02:05.479> maybe<00:02:06.109> just<00:02:06.319> can't<00:02:06.529> be

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
of fun that's quite maybe just can't be

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.499 
of fun that's quite maybe just can't be
bothered<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:07.009> gather<00:02:07.249> anything<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:08.270> leave

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
bothered to gather anything just leave

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.590 
bothered to gather anything just leave
it<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.750> an<00:02:08.840> area<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.759> if<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.000> see<00:02:11.209> it's<00:02:11.450> going

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
it in an area and if you see it's going

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.350 
it in an area and if you see it's going
here<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.860> what<00:02:13.520> got<00:02:13.790> me<00:02:13.910> knowing<00:02:14.180> would

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
here it's what got me knowing would

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.940 
here it's what got me knowing would
that's<00:02:14.840> what<00:02:14.990> it's<00:02:15.080> got<00:02:15.230> me<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:15.560> far<00:02:15.830> in

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
that's what it's got me so far in

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.210 
that's what it's got me so far in
probably<00:02:16.330> two<00:02:17.330> nights<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:18.459> see<00:02:19.459> what<00:02:19.610> this

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
probably two nights I see what this

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.170 
probably two nights I see what this
you<00:02:20.850> also<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.690> provide<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.710> with<00:02:22.740> tools

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
you also have to provide it with tools

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.490 
you also have to provide it with tools
so<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> initially<00:02:24.990> go<00:02:25.140> out<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.410> get

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
so you have to initially go out and get

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.140 
so you have to initially go out and get
the<00:02:25.620> resources<00:02:25.920> anyway<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.880> might<00:02:27.000> as

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the resources anyway so you might as

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.940 
the resources anyway so you might as
well<00:02:27.300> go<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.660> build<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.960> yourself<00:02:30.800> let's<00:02:31.800> go

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
well go and build it yourself let's go

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.210 
well go and build it yourself let's go
see<00:02:32.160> what<00:02:32.310> these<00:02:32.400> two<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.530> minor<00:02:37.830> will

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
see what these two it's the minor will

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.450 
see what these two it's the minor will
actually<00:02:38.730> get<00:02:38.910> any<00:02:39.180> resources<00:02:40.340> if<00:02:41.340> you'll

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
actually get any resources if you'll

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.680 
actually get any resources if you'll
even<00:02:41.490> get<00:02:41.730> diamonds<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.450> as<00:02:42.540> long<00:02:42.600> as

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
even get diamonds for you as long as

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
even get diamonds for you as long as
you've<00:02:42.870> got<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.020> supplied<00:02:43.350> with<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.560> right

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
you've got a supplied with the right

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.310 
you've got a supplied with the right
tools<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:45.270> basically<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.720> just<00:02:45.900> leave<00:02:46.110> it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
tools so basically you can just leave it

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.680 
tools so basically you can just leave it
you<00:02:47.220> go<00:02:47.370> over<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.700> another<00:02:47.940> part<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.450> map

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
you go over to another part of the map

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.720 
you go over to another part of the map
and<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:52.320> will<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:52.650> carry<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:53.280> long<00:02:53.640> as

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
and it will just carry on as long as

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.160 
and it will just carry on as long as
he's<00:02:53.820> got<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.060> supply<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.480> tools<00:02:56.930> this<00:02:57.930> will

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
he's got the supply of tools this will

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.860 
he's got the supply of tools this will
even<00:02:59.120> dig<00:03:00.120> everywhere<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.840> just
