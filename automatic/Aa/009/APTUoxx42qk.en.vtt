00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
instead of having that weird red texture

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.799

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
obviously you can still find it spawning

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
obviously you can still find it spawning
above<00:00:44.670> ground<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.300> these<00:00:45.510> clusters<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.890> know

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
above ground in these clusters you know

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.959 
above ground in these clusters you know
clusters<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.340> then

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
clusters like that that and and then

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
clusters like that that and and then
there's<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.510> weird<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.260> goes

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
there's just really weird one that goes

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.380
