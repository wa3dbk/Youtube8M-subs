00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.410
 so now it goes with part one and in 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.850
 video you see that's all 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.100
 a little different, I'll do it the whole way 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.180
 make a bit of rockstar because 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.890
 I have no idea before 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.470
 Look what comes out of it 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.460
 all done with the iphone 6 plus 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.230
 I wanted to do it once though 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.599
 then I really had problems because 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.740
 the team has year as three microphones and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.380
 then somehow all mixed up 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.960
 definitely did the day today 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.380
 Cages removed and the 5.25 inches 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.000
 then we also bay on the 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.649
 German buyers with us then too 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.120
 our resorts and ours have a place 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.629
 reserve everything to install now 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.219
 Let's start from the beginning 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.430
 basically always at the top 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.670
 there is so cool cordless screwdriver 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:04.530
 shop and then just here 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:06.000
 start and then off the post and you 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.040
 You see, then you always have these here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.390
 small rings of these things then 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.890
 Are you a bit careful that it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.890
 Do not get annoyed somehow 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.980
 that's how you describe fat bag 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.970
 astral body constantly in front of camera 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.410
 be pushed 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.560
 I have already ordered from it 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.370
 I see it working that way but me 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.500
 definitely have that 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.800
 hard drive cage built out 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.380
 we show only the good piece therefore 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.300
 let's get out of here so that's alone 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.750
 Almost as big as an ATX housing 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.850
 what I look at it but we 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.760
 are already running into a problem here 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.680
 in and problem though I say that 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.630
 have anticipated times because have 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.290
 all housing if you are here 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.940
 5,25 inch bay ausaut then see that 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.310
 then it gets a bit shaky here 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.100
 that means we have to enter this corner here 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.840
 slightly reinforce that housing 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.940
 standing stable again is no problem 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.950
 he comes to me that steel plate he one 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.050
 which then also with us because of us behind 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.350
 firm and so it is also behind 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.760
 you have to tell him something stable now 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.560
 but we can do it all 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.780
 no problem but you have to stop there too 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.890
 That's what we think about when 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.350
 her 5,25 inch shafts are upgraded up 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.810
 that you have a problem with that 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.640
 stability nothing wars yet 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.400
 Other thing to consider when 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.160
 you do it's that's what they are here 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.080
 the things which come out because if you do 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.810
 whole house so many small 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.920
 Metal splitter and that's why I have to 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.780
 example also the complete things 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.310
 disassembled what did that mean 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.220
 the front away plastic parts 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.230
 because so what can so small metal 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.930
 scratched very easily as well 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.540
 Fan expanded very important than if 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.140
 then and invite metal players come in 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.050
 may well be broken fan like me 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.640
 Hope this blog style video pleases 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.810
 you things where a bit more accurate 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.330
 I'll have to go into that 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.770
 course , but both moderate 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.270
 basically, I would say that about that 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.920
 continue in the style here 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.640
 but I hope you liked it 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.410
 if so, you give thumbs up where is here 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.000
 if he wants to stay with that 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.730
 project can be a abo da 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.580
 below you will find links to facebook 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.039

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.659
