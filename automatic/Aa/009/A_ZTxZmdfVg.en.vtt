AMD r9 three and nine TX and doing a bit

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.170 
AMD r9 three and nine TX and doing a bit
of<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.870> comparison<00:00:19.530> to<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.070> 290x<00:00:20.640> which<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.030> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
of a comparison to the 290x which is the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.960 
of a comparison to the 290x which is the
cut<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.660> replaces<00:00:22.260> now<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> 3<00:00:23.220> 90<00:00:23.460> x<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> not

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
cut it replaces now the 3 90 x is not

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.970 
cut it replaces now the 3 90 x is not
going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.360> AMD's<00:00:24.810> highest<00:00:25.260> card<00:00:25.590> anymore

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
going to be AMD's highest card anymore

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.480 
going to be AMD's highest card anymore
that<00:00:26.369> will<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.029> fury<00:00:27.510> x<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> bit

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that will be the fury x and it is a bit

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.279 
that will be the fury x and it is a bit
of<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.730> rebrand<00:00:30.420> however<00:00:30.779> they<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.930> made

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
of a rebrand however they have made

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.960 
of a rebrand however they have made
quite<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> few<00:00:31.710> under<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.250> hood<00:00:32.399> changes<00:00:32.820> which

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
quite a few under the hood changes which

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.460 
quite a few under the hood changes which
is<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.270> we're<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.720> talking<00:00:34.200> about

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
is what we're going to be talking about

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.000 
is what we're going to be talking about
here<00:00:34.829> today<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> GPU<00:00:36.960> ways<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.380> runs<00:00:37.560> the<00:00:37.739> same

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
here today so GPU ways it runs the same

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.580 
here today so GPU ways it runs the same
GPU<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> 290x<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.510> hawaii<00:00:39.840> GPU<00:00:39.930> however

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
GPU as a 290x the hawaii GPU however

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.490 
GPU as a 290x the hawaii GPU however
this<00:00:40.710> has<00:00:40.829> been<00:00:41.010> renamed<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.300> grenaded<00:00:43.050> GPU

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
this has been renamed the grenaded GPU

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
this has been renamed the grenaded GPU
so<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> same<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.309> TSMC<00:00:45.030> 28-nanometer

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
so it's the same at TSMC 28-nanometer

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
so it's the same at TSMC 28-nanometer
GPU<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> gcn<00:00:47.579> 1.1<00:00:48.480> architecture<00:00:49.550> that

GPU on the gcn 1.1 architecture that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
GPU on the gcn 1.1 architecture that
means<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.969> far<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.360> shader<00:00:51.840> processes<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
means as far as shader processes go it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.229 
means as far as shader processes go it
gets<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> same<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> 290x<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:55.280> 2816<00:00:56.280> same

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
gets the same as the 290x at 2816 same

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.990 
gets the same as the 290x at 2816 same

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
big change in the memory so on the 290x

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.109 
big change in the memory so on the 290x
you<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.650> 4<00:01:22.979> gigabytes<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.549> gddr5

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you would get 4 gigabytes of gddr5

the<00:01:58.649> 290x<00:01:59.310> which<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.790> 300<00:02:00.450> watts<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.290> has

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the 290x which is at 300 watts this has

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.550 
the 290x which is at 300 watts this has
just<00:02:01.530> been<00:02:01.619> done<00:02:01.950> by<00:02:02.159> refining<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.229> GPU<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
just been done by refining the GPU to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.399 
just been done by refining the GPU to
Hawaii<00:02:04.920> o<00:02:05.009> grenaded<00:02:05.520> GPU<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:07.170> just

Hawaii o grenaded GPU in it that just

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.459 
Hawaii o grenaded GPU in it that just
means<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.710> shouldn't<00:02:08.009> get<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.219> hot<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.489> theory

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:09.469 
means it shouldn't get as hot in theory

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.229 
means it shouldn't get as hot in theory
now<00:02:10.469> let's<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.919> into<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.459> benchmarks<00:02:12.090> and

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
now let's get into the benchmarks and

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.090 
now let's get into the benchmarks and
see<00:02:12.450> how<00:02:12.749> this<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.169> sister<00:02:13.650> Xu

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
see how this a sister Xu

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.670 
see how this a sister Xu

as<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.090> see<00:02:59.330> there<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.959> a<00:02:59.990> decent<00:03:00.410> step

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
as you can see there it is a decent step

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.070 
as you can see there it is a decent step
up<00:03:01.040> over<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.520> 290x<00:03:02.209> however<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.780> wouldn't

up over the 290x however I wouldn't

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.260 
up over the 290x however I wouldn't

really recommend anyone with a 290x to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.860 
really recommend anyone with a 290x to

run out and upgrade to the 39 TX it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.270 
run out and upgrade to the 39 TX it
still<00:03:09.140> does<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.350> good<00:03:09.560> job<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.100> lot<00:03:10.250> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
people should still be considering this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.170 
people should still be considering this
cut<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.980> has<00:03:13.190> very<00:03:13.520> very<00:03:13.640> solid

days the fury x is their new GPU and
that's<00:04:13.970> just<00:04:14.180> blowing<00:04:14.570> everything<00:04:14.840> away<00:04:15.579> but

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
that's just blowing everything away but

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.130 
that's just blowing everything away but
the<00:04:16.700> 390<00:04:17.090> x<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.390> still<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.600> good<00:04:17.810> incremental

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
the 390 x is still a good incremental

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.590 
the 390 x is still a good incremental
upgrade<00:04:18.950> over<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.370> 290x<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.209> i<00:04:20.239> think<00:04:20.510> it

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
upgrade over the 290x and i think it

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.050 
upgrade over the 290x and i think it
still<00:04:20.840> has<00:04:21.019> well<00:04:21.440> very<00:04:21.739> much<00:04:22.010> has<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.640> place<00:04:23.030> in

be a very good strong graphics card for
that<00:04:38.750> as<00:04:38.960> well<00:04:38.990> maybe<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.620> little<00:04:39.680> bit<00:04:40.010> overkill

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
that as well maybe a little bit overkill

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.870 
that as well maybe a little bit overkill
but<00:04:40.580> still<00:04:40.910> really<00:04:41.539> really<00:04:41.960> solid<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.740> i<00:04:43.669> just

really like the 390 x I think it's a
good<00:04:45.919> card<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.850> definitely<00:04:47.030> does<00:04:47.510> have<00:04:47.780> a
