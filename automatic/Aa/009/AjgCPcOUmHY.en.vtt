depot<00:03:53.120> completely<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:55.340> homestead<00:03:55.970> we<00:03:56.150> stayed

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
depot completely the homestead we stayed

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.840 
depot completely the homestead we stayed
when<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:57.110> was<00:03:57.380> under<00:03:57.590> water<00:03:57.860> food<00:03:58.580> on<00:03:58.730> the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
when it was under water food on the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.030 
when it was under water food on the

was<00:04:01.190> no<00:04:01.280> water<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.810> I<00:04:03.290> think<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.400> was<00:04:04.549> crazy

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
was no water so I think that was crazy

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.289 
was no water so I think that was crazy
because<00:04:05.180> number<00:04:05.750> before<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.769> tank<00:04:07.040> got<00:04:07.730> over

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
because number before the tank got over

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.150 
because number before the tank got over
we<00:04:08.600> filled<00:04:08.900> two<00:04:09.049> bottles<00:04:09.500> from<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.830> bathroom

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160 
we filled two bottles from the bathroom
and<00:04:10.489> our<00:04:10.940> area<00:04:11.299> was<00:04:11.480> hit<00:04:11.630> really<00:04:11.959> badly

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
and our area was hit really badly

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.780 
and our area was hit really badly
because<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.680> was<00:04:12.799> one<00:04:12.920> of<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.130> most<00:04:13.280> low-lying

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790

so so it wasn't you know really rough
time<00:05:49.190> to<00:05:49.370> think<00:05:49.580> for<00:05:49.849> all<00:05:49.940> this<00:05:50.090> because<00:05:50.330> it

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
time to think for all this because it

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.029 
time to think for all this because it
just<00:05:50.509> happens<00:05:50.900> between<00:05:51.050> like<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.349> know<00:05:51.590> what

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
just happens between like you know what

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.439 
just happens between like you know what
a<00:05:52.070> second<00:05:52.580> run<00:05:52.729> the<00:05:52.880> second<00:05:53.180> or<00:05:53.300> let

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
a second run the second or let

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.740 
a second run the second or let
everything<00:05:53.780> just<00:05:53.990> happens<00:05:54.500> so<00:05:55.159> the

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
everything just happens so the

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.820 
everything just happens so the
