00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.900
 now for your holiday inclusive with 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
 alexander 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 i want to say that i am actually 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.930
 true 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.820
 thanks already in his 13 years 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.430
 being on this scene is not on it and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.650
 in general in the abstract sense, I rarely 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.289
 meet people who are so cool 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.149
 and so powerful are strongly given to their 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.460
 professions and this is not advertising 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.219
 campaign hate all the words on duty you 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 probably noticed that I'm always looking for them 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.920
 some kind of replacement so sometimes 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.149
 It turns ugly friends 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.719
 exceptional person sorry i am 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.719
 I say this in your principle 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.690
 some measures that we are used to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.000
 not necessarily necessarily 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.320
 sure other person perfect 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320
 essentially huge 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.880
 the fire will come to me to do a little bit 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.130
 minus case 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:44.570

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.170
