 This film will demonstrate how to use alginic materials to help patients print models and make them into the basic steps of a patient's dental model!

 There are two types of impression trays for the upper jaw. They are used for the lower jaw. Generally, each has three different sizes: large, medium and small.

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:35.600
 First select the appropriate size of the tray and try it on the patient to see if it is suitable for the patient's arch 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.150
 Be sure to confirm that the tray is the right size for the patient and ask if the patient has oppression and discomfort. 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.150
 Be sure to confirm that the tray is the right size for the patient and ask if the patient has oppression and discomfort. 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.750
 According to the instructions of each brand of alginic material, mix it in an appropriate proportion and mix the prepared algae glue evenly to fill the impression tray. Because the posterior region usually needs more materials to print the teeth more complete. So you can put more material in the posterior region. 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.040
 According to the instructions of each brand of alginic material, mix it in an appropriate proportion and mix the prepared algae glue evenly to fill the impression tray. Because the posterior region usually needs more materials to print the teeth more complete. So you can put more material in the posterior region. 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:40.040
 According to the instructions of each brand of alginic material, mix it in an appropriate proportion and mix the prepared algae glue evenly to fill the impression tray. Because the posterior region usually needs more materials to print the teeth more complete. So you can put more material in the posterior region. 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.930
 Place the tray correctly in the patient's mouth and confirm that the anterior and posterior regions are pressed deep enough to confirm the quality of the impression. 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.350
 Place the tray correctly in the patient's mouth and confirm that the anterior and posterior regions are pressed deep enough to confirm the quality of the impression. 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.940
 Place the tray correctly in the patient's mouth and confirm that the anterior and posterior regions are pressed deep enough to confirm the quality of the impression. 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 Carefully remove the impression tray from the patient 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.089
 Usually the alginic material will cure in about a minute and a half, so we have to do it quickly before it cures. 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.489
 Usually the alginic material will cure in about a minute and a half, so we have to do it quickly before it cures. 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:26.489

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.919
 Mix the plaster until it is moderately thick and not too thin 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:03:03.919
 Mix the plaster until it is moderately thick and not too thin 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.199
 In order to avoid the generation of air bubbles, the tooth rest is placed on the oscillator when the mold is inverted. 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:29.199
 In order to avoid the generation of air bubbles, the tooth rest is placed on the oscillator when the mold is inverted. 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:04:13.459
 When pouring the plaster, let the plaster flow from one side of the tray to the other side of the tray and confirm that too much water on the tray is also shaken off. 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:33.319
 Pour the remaining plaster onto the top of the model to increase the height of the model. This is important for 3D model scanning because the model is more complete and allows the Ikelic technicians to have more room to operate. 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:56.319
 After pouring the plaster, it is very important to turn the tray upside down. If you don’t put the tray upside down, the weight of the plaster will sometimes cause the deformation of the algae impression. Turn the tray upside down and let the plaster end down. Can prevent this from happening 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:09.810
 When the plaster is completely hardened, the model can be carefully removed from the tray. 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.680
 This way you can easily have an Ikeli tooth model! 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.380
 Thank you for watching
