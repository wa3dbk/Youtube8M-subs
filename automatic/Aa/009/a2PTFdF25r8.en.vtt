stoves but what you can do is you peel

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.239 
stoves but what you can do is you peel
the<00:02:08.309> plastic<00:02:08.459> off<00:02:08.939> the<00:02:09.149> bottom<00:02:10.159> there's<00:02:11.159> a

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:11.249 
the plastic off the bottom there's a

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.110 
the plastic off the bottom there's a
screw<00:02:11.639> there<00:02:11.849> usually

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
screw there usually

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.240 
screw there usually
just<00:02:13.750> undo<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.260> screw<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.860> liner<00:02:18.099> comes

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
just undo the screw and the liner comes

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:29.690 
just undo the screw and the liner comes
out<00:02:20.069> real<00:02:21.069> nice<00:02:21.280> metal<00:02:21.670> liner<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:25.569> my<00:02:25.720> idea<00:02:26.110> was

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.850 

you<00:02:30.700> have<00:02:30.849> this<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.099> lid<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:35.709> wet

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
you have this have the lid the wet

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.809 
you have this have the lid the wet
fighter<00:02:36.159> stove<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:40.540> take<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.989> out<00:02:41.819> move

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
fighter stove just take that out move

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:54.089 
fighter stove just take that out move
the<00:02:43.000> legs<00:02:43.239> around<00:02:49.859> wet<00:02:50.859> fire<00:02:51.069> tinder<00:02:53.099> the

the legs around wet fire tinder the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.460 
the legs around wet fire tinder the
metal<00:02:54.400> sleeve<00:02:54.730> comes<00:02:55.450> out<00:02:55.690> that'll<00:02:56.200> hold<00:02:56.379> the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
metal sleeve comes out that'll hold the
