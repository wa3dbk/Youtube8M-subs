think about how much product you get and
you<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.670> literally<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.239> half<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> do

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
in them and Jan Marini was for example

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.770 
in them and Jan Marini was for example
pulled<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.790> first<00:04:33.000> time<00:04:33.300> because<00:04:33.510> they

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
pulled the first time because they

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.200 
pulled the first time because they
didn't<00:04:34.080> clarify<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.400> FDA<00:04:35.700> what

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
didn't clarify to the FDA what

didn't clarify to the FDA what
ingredients<00:04:37.140> were<00:04:37.260> contained<00:04:37.680> in<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.190> growth

serum<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:39.420> revitalash<00:04:40.110> is<00:04:40.350> now<00:04:40.500> having<00:04:40.920> to

serum the revitalash is now having to

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.400 
serum the revitalash is now having to
kind<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.610> do<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.940> same<00:04:41.970> or<00:04:42.360> repackage<00:04:42.990> or<00:04:43.350> I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
kind of do the same or repackage or I

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.530 
kind of do the same or repackage or I
think<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.190> already<00:04:44.400> has<00:04:44.670> repackage<00:04:45.300> but

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
think it already has repackage but

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.000 
think it already has repackage but
there's<00:04:45.840> still<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> bit<00:04:46.230> of<00:04:46.320> controversy<00:04:46.620> about

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
there's still a bit of controversy about

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.660 
there's still a bit of controversy about
it<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:49.740> know<00:04:49.980> that<00:04:50.130> there<00:04:50.400> are<00:04:50.520> some

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
it and I know that there are some

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.030 
it and I know that there are some
lawsuits<00:04:51.120> as<00:04:51.300> well<00:04:51.510> going<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.290> it's<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.650> bit

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
lawsuits as well going on so it's a bit

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.610 
lawsuits as well going on so it's a bit
of<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.220> dodgy<00:04:53.430> market<00:04:54.030> but<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:55.200> reason<00:04:55.500> why

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
of a dodgy market but and the reason why

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.620 
of a dodgy market but and the reason why
most<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:56.070> these<00:04:56.130> products<00:04:56.580> work<00:04:56.760> an<00:04:57.090> enormous

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
most of these products work an enormous

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.750 
most of these products work an enormous
lash<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.410> lot<00:04:58.590> of<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.860> others<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.430> because

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
lash and a lot of the others is because

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.150 
lash and a lot of the others is because
they<00:04:59.910> do<00:04:59.970> contain<00:05:00.630> an<00:05:01.380> ingredient<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:02.130> I

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
they do contain an ingredient that I

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.070 
they do contain an ingredient that I
believe<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:02.970> included<00:05:03.540> in<00:05:03.660> glaucoma

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
believe is included in glaucoma

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.420 
believe is included in glaucoma
medication<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:06.210> it's<00:05:07.430> prostaglandin

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
medication and it's prostaglandin

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.290 
medication and it's prostaglandin
analogue<00:05:08.940> or<00:05:09.270> that's<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.840> name<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:10.980> think<00:05:11.300> and

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
analogue or that's the name I think and

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.330 
analogue or that's the name I think and
it's<00:05:12.450> basically<00:05:12.840> just<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.290> they<00:05:13.800> include<00:05:14.160> like

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
it's basically just a they include like

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.920 
it's basically just a they include like
a<00:05:14.370> tiny<00:05:14.730> percentage<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.450> this<00:05:15.630> in<00:05:15.810> this

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
a tiny percentage of this in this

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.290 
a tiny percentage of this in this

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
and with this I don't get that at all

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.370 
and with this I don't get that at all
and<00:05:53.790> how<00:05:54.150> you<00:05:54.210> apply<00:05:54.540> it<00:05:54.570> is<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:54.960> same<00:05:55.170> way<00:05:55.320> you

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
I would highly recommend this product I

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.980 
I would highly recommend this product I
think<00:06:27.450> is<00:06:28.790> you<00:06:29.790> know<00:06:29.940> if<00:06:30.030> you're<00:06:30.270> really<00:06:30.540> into

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
think is you know if you're really into

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.050 
think is you know if you're really into
having<00:06:31.800> really<00:06:32.040> good<00:06:32.160> eyelashes<00:06:32.760> and<00:06:33.000> you

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
having really good eyelashes and you

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.580 
having really good eyelashes and you
think<00:06:33.270> it's<00:06:33.420> really<00:06:33.600> important<00:06:34.110> part<00:06:34.350> of<00:06:34.440> your

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
think it's really important part of your

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.310 
think it's really important part of your
whole<00:06:34.830> overall<00:06:35.310> look<00:06:35.610> and<00:06:36.180> you<00:06:36.540> perhaps<00:06:36.780> don't

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
whole overall look and you perhaps don't

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.860 
whole overall look and you perhaps don't
want<00:06:37.620> to<00:06:37.710> resort<00:06:38.010> to<00:06:38.070> eyelash<00:06:38.460> extensions<00:06:39.150> or

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
want to resort to eyelash extensions or

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.439 
want to resort to eyelash extensions or
using<00:06:40.500> fake<00:06:40.800> eyelashes<00:06:41.340> on<00:06:41.550> a<00:06:41.580> regular<00:06:42.000> basis

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449 
using fake eyelashes on a regular basis

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.840 
using fake eyelashes on a regular basis
then<00:06:43.139> it's<00:06:43.320> much<00:06:43.590> healthier<00:06:44.130> kind<00:06:44.490> of<00:06:44.610> to<00:06:44.730> go

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
then it's much healthier kind of to go

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.640 
then it's much healthier kind of to go
down<00:06:45.060> this<00:06:45.240> route<00:06:45.540> that's<00:06:46.169> just<00:06:46.380> my<00:06:46.530> opinion

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
down this route that's just my opinion

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.740 
down this route that's just my opinion
and<00:06:47.220> it's<00:06:47.580> based<00:06:47.760> on<00:06:47.910> my<00:06:48.030> experience<00:06:48.570> which

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
and it's based on my experience which

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.200 
and it's based on my experience which
has<00:06:48.840> been<00:06:49.020> very<00:06:49.260> possible<00:06:49.680> so<00:06:50.100> obviously<00:06:51.060> do

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
has been very possible so obviously do

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.760 
has been very possible so obviously do
your<00:06:51.389> research<00:06:51.570> find<00:06:52.050> out<00:06:52.260> if<00:06:52.350> it's<00:06:52.530> right<00:06:52.740> for

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
your research find out if it's right for

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.100 
your research find out if it's right for
you<00:06:52.979> and<00:06:53.340> if<00:06:53.880> it<00:06:54.000> is<00:06:54.180> I<00:06:54.449> would<00:06:54.600> love<00:06:54.780> to<00:06:54.960> hear

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
someone is using this who's never used
