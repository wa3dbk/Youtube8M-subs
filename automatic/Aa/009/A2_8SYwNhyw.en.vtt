yeah you put both things on the screen

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.510 
yeah you put both things on the screen
to<00:00:30.660> kind<00:00:30.930> of<00:00:30.990> sort<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.470> move<00:00:31.680> forward<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
one way and then go our way adjust the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.850 
one way and then go our way adjust the
dawn<00:00:40.559> finger<00:00:40.950> um<00:00:42.410> depending<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.530> how<00:00:43.710> I'm

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
dawn finger um depending on how I'm

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.100 
dawn finger um depending on how I'm
dragging<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.340> finger<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.960> could

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
dragging my finger so you know we could

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.420 
dragging my finger so you know we could
roll<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.649> roll<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.550> oh<00:00:48.739> I<00:00:49.739> had<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> go<00:00:50.399> at

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
roll up roll like this oh I had a go at

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.010 
roll up roll like this oh I had a go at
this<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.450> crashed<00:00:51.840> into

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
this and then I just crashed into

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
this and then I just crashed into
mountains<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.620> i<00:00:52.649> thought<00:00:52.860> i'd<00:00:52.980> let<00:00:53.129> yo<00:00:53.760> hand

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
mountains so i thought i'd let yo hand

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
mountains so i thought i'd let yo hand
fly<00:00:54.210> instead<00:00:54.600> oh<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> he's<00:00:55.260> down<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.649> well<00:00:55.829> so

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
fly instead oh and he's down as well so

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.959 
fly instead oh and he's down as well so
it's<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> pretty<00:00:57.719> game<00:00:58.010> yeah<00:00:59.010> i<00:00:59.309> mean

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
it's kind of a pretty game yeah i mean

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.630 
it's kind of a pretty game yeah i mean
my<00:01:00.360> focus<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.170> basically<00:01:01.770> creating<00:01:02.370> beautiful

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
my focus is basically creating beautiful

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.929 
my focus is basically creating beautiful
worlds<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.079> it's<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.619> relaxation<00:01:05.279> but

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
worlds you know it's for relaxation but

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.609 
worlds you know it's for relaxation but
of<00:01:06.179> course<00:01:06.240> there<00:01:06.659> will<00:01:06.719> be<00:01:06.869> you'll<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.380> judged

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
of course there will be you'll be judged

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.789 
of course there will be you'll be judged
on<00:01:07.829> how<00:01:07.979> far<00:01:08.219> you<00:01:08.340> fly<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.179> the<00:01:10.139> object<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.529> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
on how far you fly and the object of the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.999 
on how far you fly and the object of the
game<00:01:10.829> is<00:01:11.039> finding<00:01:11.999> in<00:01:12.179> these<00:01:12.329> animals<00:01:13.009> there's

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
game is finding in these animals there's

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.289 
game is finding in these animals there's
not<00:01:14.159> many<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.459> them<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.029> it<00:01:15.179> will<00:01:15.270> be

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
not many of them here but it will be

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.239 
not many of them here but it will be
plentiful<00:01:15.749> when<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.349> game<00:01:16.529> is<00:01:16.679> released<00:01:16.889> this

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
plentiful when the game is released this

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.779 
plentiful when the game is released this
is<00:01:17.399> very<00:01:17.909> early<00:01:18.539> pre-alpha<00:01:19.439> version<00:01:19.709> by<00:01:20.399> okay

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
is very early pre-alpha version by okay

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.699 
is very early pre-alpha version by okay
but<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.389> idea<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.840> sweep<00:01:22.020> down<00:01:22.229> collect

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:22.709 
but the idea is to sweep down collect

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.440 
but the idea is to sweep down collect
animals<00:01:22.979> then<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.490> gives<00:01:23.609> you<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:23.819> burst<00:01:24.179> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
animals then that gives you a burst of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
animals then that gives you a burst of
energy<00:01:24.569> to<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:25.469> if<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.709> you<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:26.039> flap<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
energy to see and if I you do flap the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.449 
energy to see and if I you do flap the
wings<00:01:27.139> basically<00:01:28.139> and<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:29.069> you<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.310> also

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.459 
wings basically and but you will also

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.819 
wings basically and but you will also
have<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> option<00:01:30.029> if<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.599> have<00:01:30.719> low<00:01:31.349> around

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
have the option if you have low around

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
have the option if you have low around
running<00:01:32.520> low<00:01:32.639> on<00:01:32.669> energy<00:01:32.939> mm-hmm<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.840> can

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
running low on energy mm-hmm you can

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
running low on energy mm-hmm you can
likes<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.279> winds<00:01:35.669> you<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:35.999> see<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
likes or the winds you know see you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.599 
likes or the winds you know see you
there<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.200> white<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:38.009> clouds<00:01:38.340> there

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
there then the white little clouds there

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.039 
there then the white little clouds there
will<00:01:38.759> show<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:38.999> the<00:01:39.240> direction<00:01:39.419> of<00:01:39.779> the<00:01:39.929> wind

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
will show you the direction of the wind

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.010 
will show you the direction of the wind
and<00:01:40.469> got<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.520> pretty<00:01:42.060> much<00:01:42.270> random

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and got you now it's pretty much random

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.280 
and got you now it's pretty much random
but<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.859> will

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
but it will

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
but it will
in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.410> finished<00:01:46.830> game<00:01:46.980> it<00:01:47.130> will<00:01:47.250> follow<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
in the finished game it will follow the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280 
in the finished game it will follow the
terrain<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.330> there<00:01:48.420> will<00:01:48.510> be<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.780> thermals

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
terrain and there will be like thermals

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.640 
terrain and there will be like thermals
like<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.980> crafts<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.580> can<00:01:50.670> follow<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.650> so

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
like up crafts you can follow and so

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.280 
like up crafts you can follow and so
it's<00:01:52.830> just<00:01:53.040> uh<00:01:53.240> yeah<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.480> just<00:01:54.750> flying<00:01:55.050> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it's just uh yeah it's just flying in
