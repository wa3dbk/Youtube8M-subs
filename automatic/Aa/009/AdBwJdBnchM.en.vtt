00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
day but for Jerusalem itself I think

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.360

the<00:04:12.790> valleys<00:04:13.240> look<00:04:13.420> like<00:04:13.630> this<00:04:13.960> and<00:04:14.520> it's<00:04:15.520> much

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
the valleys look like this and it's much

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.060 
the valleys look like this and it's much
more<00:04:16.060> conceivably<00:04:16.870> possible<00:04:17.140> for<00:04:17.650> blood<00:04:17.890> to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
more conceivably possible for blood to

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.380 
more conceivably possible for blood to
flow<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.609> horse's<00:04:18.880> bridle<00:04:19.120> than<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.200> is<00:04:20.320> here

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
flow to a horse's bridle than it is here

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.510 
flow to a horse's bridle than it is here
when<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.510> valley<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:22.900> like<00:04:22.930> this<00:04:23.370> even<00:04:24.370> that's

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
when the valley is like this even that's

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.850 
when the valley is like this even that's
still<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.730> lot<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:24.940> blood

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
still a lot of blood

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.170 
still a lot of blood
but<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.920> can<00:04:27.040> still<00:04:27.190> see<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.490> flowing<00:04:27.730> like<00:04:28.000> so

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
but you can still see it flowing like so

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.150 
but you can still see it flowing like so
I<00:04:28.210> think<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.600> think<00:04:28.840> so<00:04:29.700> what<00:04:30.700> we<00:04:30.820> have<00:04:31.090> is<00:04:32.160> in

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
I think I think so what we have is in

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.560 
I think I think so what we have is in
Revelation<00:04:33.970> as<00:04:34.570> in<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> rest<00:04:35.200> of<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.530> Bible<00:04:35.710> a
