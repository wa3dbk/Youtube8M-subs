00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello friends welcome to this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.700
 special informative where I'll talk 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 about the future of dragon ball online 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.400
 that as you know will finish closing your 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.299
 servers on October 31 of this year 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.000
 2003 that's already a fact and that's why I've 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.320
 heard many rumors about it 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.750
 as for example that the servers of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.539
 proof will be closed and that they will get worse 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.490
 finally the official version or that a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.310
 company in china and here the rights and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.619
 that another in Europe are negotiating 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.260
 and I really have not found anything at 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.720
 respect and let me tell you that for more 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.820
 I searched and searched I did not find anything 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.699
 reliable just rumors 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 it's true that you're playing one of the most 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.750
 great leaders of the development operation 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.360
 and publication of the simplest games 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.559
 Online multiplayer in Chinese had already 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.079
 announced having acquired the rights 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.110
 about dragon ball online since the year 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.570
 2011 and that we can verify in your 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.120
 official page where we can see to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.059
 dragon ball online as a game to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.489
 launch a future but unfortunately 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.760
 he stayed with tubey launcher and with a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.270
 nice coming soon and that stayed there 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.250
 since 2011 and this we can 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.260
 verify the since we were going to the party 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.479
 bottom of the page we can see that 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.960
 this place has not been updated league 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.400
 that the year 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.710
 unfortunately the culprits of everything 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.970
 this is the development team that 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.250
 slowed the progress of the project 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.280
 for which no longer game would have 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.910
 canceled dragon ball online as one of 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.910
 your future releases 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.140
 all this caused by these certain 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.219
 ingredients but not only you have to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.380
 blame the team for 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.079
 development maybe they took the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.590
 decision not to continue for several 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.539
 factors such as the development and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.159
 implementation of pressure games is 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.069
 very expensive 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.159
 additionally this the online games 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.020
 have an additional burden when needing 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.220
 maintenance updates and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.040
 servers 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.540
 also lately the developers 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.100
 they are giving more for the phones 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.680
 mobile 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.720
 that offer cheaper markets and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.870
 Versatile that require low 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 investment and development budgets 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.770
 which generates higher profits 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.740
 It also affects that the market for 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.960
 computer video games in asia be 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.660
 dying slowly and all this thanks 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.730
 to the high competition of games 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.900
 basile multiplayer online that exists in 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.600
 Asia 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.300
 and that the majority is a free to play 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.680
 this has generated that all the content 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.110
 of these games is quite consumed 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.560
 fast and that the players change 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.080
 constantly videogames 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.840
 although they believe that blizzard lost 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.200
 millions of subscribers a few years ago 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.540
 back in the world of warcraft game 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.489
 now you know 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.430
 It is also why a luisana 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.799
 desperate attempt I try to recover 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.859
 these Asian by outputting 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.129
 kung fu panda 'or better known as mists 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.129
 of pandaria 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.450
 but beyond that there remains the doubt 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.070
 because they never took the game beyond 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.070
 of Asia because it will never take you to 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.840
 West where obviously there are millions 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.610
 of fanatics lock a goal that 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.610
 would have been willing to play this 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.000
 great game 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.610
 and now thanks to this Asian market 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.660
 where, unfortunately, there is enough 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.180
 competition the game closes and we 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.040
 leave us with a bitter taste in 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.160
 the mouth and with many wishes to continue 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.840
 playing despite all this water and 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.570
 good news and a ray of hope 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.260
 to be able to continue playing the dragon ball 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.260
 on-line 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.720
 recently I see you with created a page 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.489
 on facebook where he started recruiting 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.030
 moderators people specialized in 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.770
 development programming and so on 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.440
 to be part of the team 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.140
 development of the project that I see that is 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.300
 which aims to create a 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.520
 totally private game server 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.040
 translated into English which will be more 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.989
 stable and friendly for the player 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.359
 and also seek to make more known 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.720
 dragon ball online since this was his 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.850
 greater advantage thanks to its instability 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100
 unbalanced and the one that has been generated 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.620
 for many 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.040
 so good friends I ask you just 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.770
 be patient and hopefully this 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.050
 project comes to light and everything goes very 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.710

 servers will allow should be a thousand
