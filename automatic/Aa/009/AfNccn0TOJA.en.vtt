this demonstration is to show natural
pulling<00:00:09.450> power<00:00:09.630> between<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.590> spout<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
pulling power between the spout and the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.629 
pulling power between the spout and the
spanner<00:00:11.990> so<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.410> we've<00:00:13.530> got<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.309> typical

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
spanner so what we've got is the typical

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.439 
spanner so what we've got is the typical
setup<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.120> with<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.630> pull<00:00:16.109> bar<00:00:16.350> across<00:00:16.710> here

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
setup here with the pull bar across here

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.040 
setup here with the pull bar across here
but<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> purpose<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.960> this

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
but for the purpose of this

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.240 
but for the purpose of this
demonstration<00:00:19.289> we're<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> replace

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
demonstration we're going to replace

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.599 
demonstration we're going to replace
this<00:00:20.670> pull<00:00:21.060> bar<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.529> strain<00:00:23.310> gates

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
this pull bar with this strain gates

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.450 
this pull bar with this strain gates
purpose-made<00:00:24.029> strain<00:00:24.630> gage<00:00:25.019> as<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.220> see

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
purpose-made strain gage as you can see

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.660 
purpose-made strain gage as you can see
they're<00:00:27.050> in<00:00:28.050> black<00:00:28.289> you've<00:00:28.439> got<00:00:28.590> psi<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
they're in black you've got psi and the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.470 
they're in black you've got psi and the
round<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> edges<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:31.320> square<00:00:31.590> inch<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
round the edges of square inch and the

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.819 
round the edges of square inch and the
needle<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.719> 0<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
needle is 0 so all I'm gonna do is

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.970 
needle is 0 so all I'm gonna do is
replace<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:39.290> pull<00:00:40.290> bar<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:42.649> with<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
replace this pull bar here with the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.729 
replace this pull bar here with the
strain<00:00:44.280> gage<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> strain<00:00:46.200> gage<00:00:46.410> now<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
strain gage so the strain gage now is

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.270 
strain gage so the strain gage now is
connected<00:00:47.219> between<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.820> pull<00:00:48.750> spanner<00:00:49.280> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
connected between the pull spanner and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.330 
connected between the pull spanner and
stop<00:00:51.149> using<00:00:51.840> state<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> obviously<00:00:56.039> pulling

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
stop using state so obviously pulling

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.689 
stop using state so obviously pulling
between<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.449> spout<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:59.010> spun-out<00:00:59.370> will

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
between the spout and the spun-out will

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.900 
between the spout and the spun-out will
show<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.559> strain<00:01:01.800> gage<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.430> I'll<00:01:02.699> get

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
show up on the strain gage so I'll get

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.929 
show up on the strain gage so I'll get
the<00:01:03.030> adjusting<00:01:03.449> spanner<00:01:03.750> put<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.939> see

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the adjusting spanner put that on see

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.410 
the adjusting spanner put that on see
what<00:01:06.090> happens

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
what happens

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.929 
what happens
got<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.600> wind<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:13.460> keep<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.580> eye<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
and this is a point where usually

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.929 
and this is a point where usually
usually<00:01:39.210> breaks<00:01:40.310> cracks<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> head<00:01:41.610> let's<00:01:41.790> go

usually breaks cracks the head let's go

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.429 
usually breaks cracks the head let's go
into<00:01:42.150> 82<00:01:44.540> just<00:01:45.540> below<00:01:45.720> 85<00:01:47.899> down<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.200> tight

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
into 82 just below 85 down to get tight

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139 
into 82 just below 85 down to get tight
now<00:01:49.619> oh<00:01:49.649> yes<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.430> down<00:01:50.729> which<00:01:50.909> means

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
now oh yes it's going down which means

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.830 
now oh yes it's going down which means
it's<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:52.399> broke<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.430> seal<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.600> coming

it's actually broke the seal it's coming

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.190 
it's actually broke the seal it's coming
down<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:58.079> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
down now you can actually see if you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.039 
down now you can actually see if you
look<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.860> spanner<00:01:59.130> rotating

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
look you can see the spanner rotating

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.090 
look you can see the spanner rotating
just<00:02:01.049> keep<00:02:01.320> pulling<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.740> around<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
just keep pulling it around to

completely loosen it off that was all
done<00:02:04.649> with<00:02:04.829> one<00:02:04.979> finger<00:02:06.439> there<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.560> go

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
done with one finger there you go

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.670 
done with one finger there you go
what<00:02:09.310> I'll<00:02:09.399> do<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.580> I'll<00:02:09.700> take<00:02:09.729> this<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
what I'll do is I'll take this to the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.550 
what I'll do is I'll take this to the
strain<00:02:11.980> gauge<00:02:12.220> off<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:15.069> show<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.380> can
