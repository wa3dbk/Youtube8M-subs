step<00:00:59.910> 8<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.359> domino<00:01:00.780> system<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:02.309> bait<00:01:02.520> is

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
step 8 this domino system the bait is

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.820 
step 8 this domino system the bait is
kinetic<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> potential<00:01:03.570> downwards<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.710> the

kinetic to potential downwards at the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.329 
kinetic to potential downwards at the
ball

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339

step<00:01:05.970> 9<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.450> kinetic<00:01:06.900> tube<00:01:07.140> central<00:01:07.520> ball<00:01:08.520> hits

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
step 9 is kinetic tube central ball hits

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
step 9 is kinetic tube central ball hits
ball<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> 10<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.869> kinetic<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> potential<00:01:13.799> box

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
ball so 10 is kinetic to potential box

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.340 
ball so 10 is kinetic to potential box

Domino's sep 11 2007 the set well fault
hits<00:01:23.090> yeah<00:01:24.090> Dennis<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.320> add<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.710> potential

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
hits yeah Dennis can add to potential

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.780 
hits yeah Dennis can add to potential
step<00:01:26.850> 13<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.799> potential<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.950> kinetic<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.610> egg

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
step 13 is potential to kinetic the egg
