00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
on loud city song for the most part

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.380 
on loud city song for the most part
lyrically<00:05:55.890> it<00:05:56.100> brings<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.670> lot<00:05:56.850> of<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.090> same

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
lyrically it brings a lot of the same

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.970 
lyrically it brings a lot of the same

themes that were delivered on the
opening<00:05:59.370> track<00:05:59.640> here<00:06:00.000> maybe<00:06:00.330> it's<00:06:00.540> a<00:06:00.630> bit<00:06:00.750> of<00:06:00.870> a

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
opening track here maybe it's a bit of a

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.780 
opening track here maybe it's a bit of a
reprieve<00:06:01.410> I<00:06:01.680> guess<00:06:01.950> this<00:06:02.130> LP<00:06:02.430> doesn't<00:06:02.670> really

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
reprieve I guess this LP doesn't really

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.180 
reprieve I guess this LP doesn't really
end<00:06:03.030> with<00:06:03.240> a<00:06:03.270> significant<00:06:03.900> change<00:06:04.170> because<00:06:04.350> so

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
end with a significant change because so
