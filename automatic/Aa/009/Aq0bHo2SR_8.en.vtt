 hello everyone I'm dan and I'm here 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.650
 new on island minecraft news for 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.320
 bring the latest news of the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.150
 future version 1.4 these days has not 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 there was hardly news since bojan has 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 been at the video game fair packs 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.160
 but I bring you some news that is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.200
 have filtered so let's start 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.330
 a user of redit commented that 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.680
 jeff and nathan adams announced in the pax 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.689
 that he webber same or wanted from the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.520
 next way first 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.180
 we would have to get the heads of 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.650
 skeletons 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.000
 the new decorative block that you 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.520
 shows on the previous island minecraft 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.100
 news and then in some way we can 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.480
 invoke the winter when you want 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.519
 notice that this information has not 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 could contrast and therefore could 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.760
 be false 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 more things a twitter user will 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 proposed to Nathan to implement a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 area milk potion ie the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.890
 that are launched as I suppose already 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.870
 you will know when drinking milk they are eliminated 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.329
 all the effects of our character 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.949
 both good and bad so 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.900
 that that portion of area can be a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.890
 good way to counteract the position 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.259
 of invisibility 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.700
 the case is that they are born adams commented that 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.039
 maybe they would 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.990
 finally a good news jeff has 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.579
 commented on his twitter that tomorrow there will be 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.320
 snapshot so it's likely that 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.240
 many of the novelties if I have been 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.170
 commenting these days we can see them 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.210
 finally in the game 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.220
 Well that was all for the moment 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.080
 tomorrow as you will naps or not upload a 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.369
 video until it comes out what it means 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.140
 that depending on the time at which 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.080
 exit the snapshot you will have the video 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.149
 sooner or later the first video will be a 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.369
 first glance explaining some of the 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.110
 news and later or the next day 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.060
 upload a much more complete video 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.610
 with all the news totally 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.659
 detailed as nothing more than a greeting and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.659
 until the next video
