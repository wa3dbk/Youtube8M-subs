00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
high amounts of salt and what that's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.830 
high amounts of salt and what that's
doing<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.920> drawing<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.670> extra<00:00:36.600> water

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
doing is it's drawing in extra water

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.090 
doing is it's drawing in extra water
