00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.330
 ah 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.330
 ah 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.810
 measured and without celebrating more Luis 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.520
 Fernando Suarez coach of the national team 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.900
 of Honduras discarded that the triumph 2 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.849
 for 1 against Mexico in the field of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.470
 Aztec stadium has been the triumph 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.810
 important although he said that Mexico 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.279
 remains the most important rival of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.279
 the concacaf for me not 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.440
 what have been more interesting things 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.809
 most important to me as is having 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.329
 world state and having gone has been 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.550
 in 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.810
 passed to the round of 16 or so that for 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.460
 me is still the most important thing what 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.460
 I 've done it in my career 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.370
 I from Honduras hope that especially the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.280
 places that consider this to be a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.800
 match that is worth only three points and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 is one more step of the classification and not 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.229
 plus 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.720
 and let the people the celebs very 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.619
 good to let people do it 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.790
 healthy would be the best but if there is a 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.110
 message for the players and 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.780
 fortunately they themselves are 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.420
 saying is that it's worth nothing to win today 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.159
 if we take the World Cup there are times in 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.040
 that one does not accept goals suddenly the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.170
 team changes or lowers its level 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.170
 psychic and before on the contrary 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.840
 the team I think 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.350
 had an incentive in that goal and not 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.299
 after what was spoken in the first 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.110
 I think it helped him a lot 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.390
 so that it was much more 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 concentrated very involved I do not think that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.740
 so much was the whole first time 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.100
 it cost us at the beginning it 's true we 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100
 cost 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.610
 for all that they were in the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.150
 pressure that they had and we did not have 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.680
 a way to have good ball 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.470
 recover them well 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.680
 has a very good dynamic since those 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.660
 first 20 25 minutes was the most 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.430
 complicated for us what we 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.950
 we did things 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.049
 better than them and no more I can tell you 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.489
 a doctor is the biggest team that 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.439
 there is in Central America in this center 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.840
 America and North America is still the 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.970
 larger 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.090
 so you have to value what you value 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.090
 the tube for what we did before a 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.090
 big 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.350
 it is good not to minimize our triumph 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.140
 but I still think that Mexico 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.790
 is the best team of Suarez indicated that 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.319
 nothing will serve the triumph before mexico 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.990
 if honduras can not be in the world 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.430
 of Brazil-2014 so he pondered the 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.080
 match next Tuesday against panama 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.090
 to get the 3 points and now follow 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.680
 head towards the next cup of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.240
