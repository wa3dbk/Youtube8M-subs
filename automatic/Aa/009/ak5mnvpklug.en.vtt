00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.400
 Johanna it comes to the second league 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.380
 Idea here on the foot clearly know 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.580
 I am the enemy extra I wanted me 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.890
 sometimes I imagine am 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.179
 second league together with maxi so im 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.900
 background you are a gameplay that 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.569
 is from me 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.759
 it 's a i think my 91 04 or something 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:28.609
 that's the gameplay anywhere in any 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.239
 case what solo ground attack domination 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.970
 on yemen 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.649
 and yes it was a nuclear and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.630
 many deaths so much pecher you 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.700
 rarely am I there with the spd 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.200
 I believe shortly before the new roadster 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.850
 and all the new things again 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.490
 otherwise probably 100 plus 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.290
 He definitely was and should 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.210
 what I found relatively special about it 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.920
 so it's something else that's me 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.020
 no orbital so there was no 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.730
 orbital satellite currently are the quasi 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.170
 90 of the black ops two gameplay 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.340
 to see some small stables 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.530
 are always always some 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.930
 position multi team and then always with 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.000
 hobby and complete party and so on 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.530
 I played completely without robbie 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.929
 in complete sol and then have one more 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.310
 nuclear is enough and therefore is little 

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.299
 the gameplay something else and 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.829
 That's why I just say that in the 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.999
 background so there are now time 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.560
 to the questions so I have a small 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.670
 wanted, we would then be with each 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.799
 member going through with it 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.569
 Just imagine so briefly 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.670
 real david i am 16 years old 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.799
 games on the pc on the pc game is 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.810
 for one and a half to two years so it 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.939
 i think june 2012 I was with 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.859
 mw3 did not start that way yet 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.499
 Eternally long work also did not work out 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.020
 just starting my favorite 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:34.700
 cds currently mw3 so m operator my 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.990
 first call of duty that explains most of the time 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.670
 much because it is often so that the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.979
 first call of duty m also the favorite 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.670
 call of duty is mw3 so i like it 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.749
 actually most like black ops 2 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.039
 yes that's a little so on 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.389
 made the beginning I do I do it 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.749
 not now, and now it may 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:52.310
 again so far and large I like currently 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.740
 not the game anymore at the moment 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.850
 more to the gameplays so i have 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.439
 now said never had any 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.389
 at least I do not believe world records 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.999
 cracked conscious world record 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:04.549
 I always have many more 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.770
 unspectacular ffh pug and normal 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.229
 orcs and nucleus and camps and stuff like that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.790
 but somehow now , there are many 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.200
 but we are now this thing 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.790
 namely any world record can say 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.340
 where I say yes I have 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.439
 So there is nothing too special 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.709
 so cad I come then also very briefly 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.629
 and yes in mw3 by a 1 a kg i 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.769
 I have not had a cad for a long time now 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.780
 well now that the three are me 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.659
 now one-expanding kd in black ops have 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.049
 i have a 15 hkd and in big i have 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.459
 a 22 kg or so that sounds right now 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.500
 of course pretty bad but she 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.420
 I always have something to talk about 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.010
 say so mw3 I was natural 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.870
 Bad was that you first of duty 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.129
 I was had no idea I 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.269
 had already said in somehow the 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.769
 when I did not even know how to do it 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.209
 build a class together that I think 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.569
 Thank you for used with the everlasting 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.010
 standard class ump played there 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.590
 I can not manage a lonely one 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.329
 believe by a 0.85 cad or so 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.099
 had when I played that time 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.849
 That was three months I have that 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.250
 I think I played 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.930
 then came black ops 2 out there I was 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.870
 even at the beginning not very good in it 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.099
 by that 0.9 academy or so yes then I am 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.260
 I've gotten better over time 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.430
 a better massiveness set that 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.709
 I'm so I'm real 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.560
 suddenly become better so then I 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.939
 I almost brought to 1.5 kg, the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.709
 is not that spectacular right now either 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.329
 I think so, but now I think so 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.829
 So I do not care 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.989
 as it might not really matter 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.989
 In any case , I have a 1.4 kg 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.389
 actually always managed solo and the 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.799
 I was a ghost at the beginning too 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.979
 not so good that I you again one 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.769
 1.5 kg and then at the end with the mvz 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.819
 I think I have a three kilos or so 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.919
 that's not perfect either, I say 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.549
 but that's because I do not 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.829
 like so much 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.120
 and now my current kds are there 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.590
 everything is still a little bit of 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.919
 the old things influenced I say 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.629
 times 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.599
 So in mw3 I usually have 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.430
 weekly his 4 to 5 kg so that 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.019
 would be my kd now if I'm so in 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.760
 cities and so on a bit on kd 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.139
 would go yes and then I have 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.760
 of course also on the world record 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.199
 I probably have the emsteker the 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.079
 even the world at second glance 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:07.340
 on the 2 because I do not say now which kds 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.209
 I'll just say over 40 me 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.609
 Do not want you here now 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.810
 spoil it because he is a very upset 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.519
 a channel and I want you there now 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.900
 Do not spoil if you still see it 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.909
 and I do not know what follow degree 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.109
 I do not want to be online right now 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.430
 current kg spoiler 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.409
 but it is probably one 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.060
 world record in conclusion I say then 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.770
 short on a channel to see 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.360
 So I'm not a normal gameplay 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.889
 channel as it is mainly in call of 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.319
 duty 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.360
 actually that is more and more gameplay 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.289
 the most important thing for me is gameplay 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.490
 I mostly do not care and I usually bring 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.330
 So mainly right now 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.639
 say - videos say both too big to 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.830
 the dlcs and so on, as well as the new ones 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.479
 things like the new call of 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.460
 duty which he probably will be mp4 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.629
 So there always brings videos and then 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.520
 i also want to start with call of duty 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.830
 share at the beginning of big and 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.479
 I still bring backups two 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.370
 tips and tricks we will get better 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.650
 can you and look like just said 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.659
 bluetooth caddy so I go in there 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.889
 his live series at the highest of the 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.779
 world as you can see in the name 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.120
 can and thus is already again 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.120
 I hope in the next video
