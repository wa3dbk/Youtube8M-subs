 On service 13 battery on which we 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:32.460
 you are owned 16

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 the composition had lower 11 inches this one 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 from battery coast defense system 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.190

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 since 1890 or cover 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.570
 she really is the base of the Black Sea year 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.129
 gun shots during the first 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.140
 world war batteries scared off

 who were in quarantine beams 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.450
 to 12 and 13 batteries was narrow gauge 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.640
 railway which was delivered 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.240
 ammunition pretty solid ammunition 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.789
 heavy and in the forty first year for 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.759
 defense this railway was 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.140
 disassembled to install hedgehogs 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.479
 anti hedgehogs 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.460
 Sevastopol in the forty first was here 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.770
 command post coastal defense created 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.869
 at about the same time 14 was broken 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.970
 meters and spiral stairs after 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.280
 Leaving Sevastopol here are Germans 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.000
 equip your extra not 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.550
 battery installed here and very 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.500
 stubbornly defended her when we were forty 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.060
 the fourth year they returned Sevastopol 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.330
 the traces of these fights are visible here by 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.580
 amount 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.950
 destroyed concrete everything remained in that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.629
 after the war was here 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.520
 command post and after the collapse 

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:56.739
 Soviet Union object was transferred 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.140
 ukrainian side and looted to 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.879
 grounds to its 120 complex 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.940
 finally straightens shoulders after 

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:05.379
 decades of devastation and oblivion in 2012 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.910
 year activist public organization 

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:08.979
 citizens of Chersonesos started 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.080
 clearing complexes main volume 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.510
 the most difficult work 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.440
 the most harmful already done trash on 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.760
 the surface remains as it were to bring in 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.780
 order room 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.580
 make electricity make ventilation 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.470
 to make plumbing in order to go 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.019
 facility potential to use it 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.730
 huge 650 meters long more 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.430
 sixty seven rooms 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.680
 this is one of the longest batteries in 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.750
 Sevastopol 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.760
 and one of those that is enough 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.159
 well preserved 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.700
 can be used in full and 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.980
 underground premises and artillery 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.640
 the courtyard upstairs near which we are with you 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.120
 worth for the armed forces this object is not 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.959
 represents no value we 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.459
 reported to the governor reported to the deputy 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.620
 legislative assembly and 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.920
 governments and their proposals for 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.480
 creation based on defensive 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 complex 12-13 shore batteries 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.530
 military patriotic education center 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.450
 but for the complex to work it is necessary 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.430
 build infrastructure pave the way 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.319
 not to download the act of the reserve 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.870
 Chersonesos Tauride Reserve 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.269
 gasps from transport unloading 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.810
 unloading he also needs that is if 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.680
 we mean we mean the development of this 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.700
 complex 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.720
 we need a road junction which 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.000
 displays along the bottom edge of the beam on say 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.799
 hope acutely narrow water transport for 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.650
 that there was no traffic jam at the reserve 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.690
 in order to have a convenient approach 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.090
 here here also opens here 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.099
 a unique view of the Nakhimov school with 14 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.930
 batteries reserve Chersonese tauride 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.340
 without saying the mikhailovsky and 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.579
 Konstantin battery 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.230
 now if we turn to the southwest and 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:04.389
 west we see our new neighborhood 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.000
 the pilots and on it are located near 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.310
 banking academy 15 a coastal 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.459
 battery you tried to destroy 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.790
 slightly to the right of the cadet territory 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.739
 schools 23 coastal battery and again 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.530
 back school nakhimov 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.669
 a little to the right is Mikhailovskaya 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.699
 battery a little closer oriental thought bay 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:31.210
 quarantine for 10 shore battery too 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.070
 preserved not bad slightly to the right with us 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.190
 street admiral of vladimir 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.870
 11 coastal battery from one point 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.669
 You can see the full range of batteries 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.800
 created to protect Sevastopol 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.449
 however, without the support of the authorities, 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.440
 the active development of the complex will be 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.080
 complicated 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.080
 ideas are not drunk Krasikov all information bureau
