00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
do it again doubt that would have been

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.450 
do it again doubt that would have been
something<00:04:46.200> new<00:04:46.500> all<00:04:47.220> right<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:48.450> what<00:04:49.020> else

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
something new all right so what else

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.800 
something new all right so what else
right<00:04:50.460> right<00:04:51.210> right

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.840 

she<00:04:54.810> uh<00:04:55.039> she<00:04:56.039> realized<00:04:56.370> something<00:04:56.700> that

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
she uh she realized something that

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.409 
she uh she realized something that
before<00:04:57.150> he<00:04:57.270> jumps<00:04:57.810> he's<00:04:58.460> butt<00:04:59.460> twitches<00:04:59.880> twice

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
before he jumps he's butt twitches twice

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.550 
before he jumps he's butt twitches twice
