of<00:01:09.110> things<00:01:09.259> when<00:01:09.560> we<00:01:09.710> do<00:01:09.830> this<00:01:10.390> first<00:01:11.390> thing<00:01:11.600> is

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
of things when we do this first thing is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.109 
of things when we do this first thing is
that<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.110> don't<00:01:12.290> need<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.009> hopper<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:14.000> can

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
that we don't need the hopper so you can

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.030 
that we don't need the hopper so you can
take<00:01:14.299> that<00:01:14.479> off<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:15.259> applies<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:15.830> one

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
take that off this applies to that one

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.380 
take that off this applies to that one
side<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.610> then<00:01:18.070> we<00:01:19.070> also<00:01:19.340> don't<00:01:19.729> really<00:01:19.970> need

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
side and then we also don't really need

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.200 
side and then we also don't really need
the<00:01:20.600> ten<00:01:21.130> what<00:01:22.130> we<00:01:22.280> all<00:01:22.430> do<00:01:22.580> is<00:01:22.610> take<00:01:22.940> that<00:01:22.970> off

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
it's a small work so we'll take the tap

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.670 
it's a small work so we'll take the tap
off<00:01:28.360> just<00:01:29.360> put<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.899> one<00:01:30.020> side<00:01:30.080> as<00:01:30.500> well

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
off just put that to one side as well

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.529 
off just put that to one side as well
and<00:01:31.039> then<00:01:31.220> we'll<00:01:31.369> take<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.850> blanking<00:01:32.299> cap

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
and then we'll take the blanking cap

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.370 
and then we'll take the blanking cap
which<00:01:33.080> actually<00:01:33.409> comes<00:01:33.800> with<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.220> machine

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.850 

now<00:01:39.380> when<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.740> do<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.100> it's<00:01:40.670> not<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.940> bad<00:01:41.179> idea

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
now when you do this it's not a bad idea

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.460 
now when you do this it's not a bad idea
it<00:01:42.860> actually<00:01:43.009> is<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.520> fine<00:01:44.090> filter<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:44.990> like

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
it actually is the fine filter and like

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.859 
it actually is the fine filter and like
the<00:01:45.700> six<00:01:46.700> five<00:01:46.940> eight<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.330> seven<00:01:47.509> five

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
the six five eight and a seven five

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.230 
the six five eight and a seven five
eight<00:01:48.050> five<00:01:48.679> eight<00:01:48.890> eight<00:01:49.100> has<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:50.030> two

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
eight five eight eight has the two

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.899 
eight five eight eight has the two
filters<00:01:50.539> with<00:01:50.869> as<00:01:51.020> well<00:01:51.319> as<00:01:51.799> paint<00:01:52.460> with<00:01:52.640> part

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
filters with as well as paint with part

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.510 
filters with as well as paint with part
of<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.030> machine<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:53.979> what<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.069> do<00:01:55.220> is<00:01:55.340> just

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
of the machine so what you do is just

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.359 
of the machine so what you do is just
slide<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.060> into<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.420> side<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.020> jar<00:01:57.369> what

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
slide that into the side of the jar what

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.419 
slide that into the side of the jar what
that<00:01:58.549> all<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:59.390> effect<00:01:59.840> do<00:02:00.080> or<00:02:00.500> close<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.190> gap

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
that all in effect do or close the gap

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.510 
that all in effect do or close the gap
between<00:02:02.209> where<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.810> ten<00:02:03.069> so<00:02:04.069> I'll<00:02:04.159> just<00:02:04.310> pour

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
between where the ten so I'll just pour

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.609 
between where the ten so I'll just pour
that<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.030> can<00:02:05.180> see<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.140> if<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.320> ever<00:02:06.409> look

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
that so you can see so if you ever look

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.620 
that so you can see so if you ever look
in<00:02:06.770> there<00:02:06.950> see<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.909> bit<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.209> gap<00:02:08.390> if<00:02:08.600> you

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
in there see that bit of a gap if you

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:18.039 
in there see that bit of a gap if you
put<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:16.400> actually<00:02:16.730> places<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.359> gap<00:02:17.600> right<00:02:17.630> up

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
put it actually places that gap right up

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.250 
put it actually places that gap right up
okay<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:20.000> would<00:02:20.120> make<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.450> easier<00:02:20.870> also

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
okay so that would make it easier also

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.960 
okay so that would make it easier also
revealing<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.400> there's<00:02:25.579> a<00:02:25.609> general

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
revealing this so there's a general

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:35.259 
revealing this so there's a general
there<00:02:26.859> and<00:02:28.959> this<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:33.310> take<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.340> little<00:02:34.489> bit<00:02:34.609> like

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
there and this is take a little bit like

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.370 
there and this is take a little bit like
that<00:02:35.299> on<00:02:35.600> top<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:37.519> actually<00:02:37.640> with<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
that on top and actually with the the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.470 
that on top and actually with the the
five<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.890> eight<00:02:39.980> direction<00:02:40.400> then<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:40.760> let's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
five and eight direction then to let's

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270 
five and eight direction then to let's
see<00:02:41.600> how<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.260> here<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.739> then<00:02:42.950> one<00:02:43.070> on<00:02:43.100> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
see how a just here and then one on the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.160 
see how a just here and then one on the
machine<00:02:43.579> you<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:43.880> pop<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.660> there<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
machine you just pop that in there and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.140 
machine you just pop that in there and
line<00:02:45.320> them<00:02:45.470> up<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.010> then<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:46.519> twist<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.910> job

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
line them up and then just twist the job

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.699 
line them up and then just twist the job
that<00:02:47.359> actually<00:02:47.510> arms<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.230> machine<00:02:48.530> it's

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
that actually arms the machine it's

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:49.420 
that actually arms the machine it's
ready<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.190> go

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
ready to go

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.690 
ready to go
if<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.329> ever<00:02:50.480> like<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.310> can't<00:02:52.310> turn<00:02:52.549> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
if I ever like this I can't turn the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.460 
if I ever like this I can't turn the
machine<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.450> have<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.720> fly<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> lot<00:02:54.200> better

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
machine so I have to fly a lot better

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.550 
machine so I have to fly a lot better
and<00:02:55.190> then<00:02:55.370> we're<00:02:55.549> ready<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.910> go<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.090> there

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and then we're ready to go in there

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.009 
and then we're ready to go in there
which<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:01.010> use<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.380> lot<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.680> first<00:03:03.950> order<00:03:04.400> yeah

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
which I use it a lot of first order yeah

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.140 
which I use it a lot of first order yeah
so<00:03:06.019> they<00:03:06.140> can<00:03:06.290> come<00:03:06.560> down<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:07.100> up<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
so they can come down and up and the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.550 
so they can come down and up and the
sometimes<00:03:08.389> I<00:03:08.810> use<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.079> pulse

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
sometimes I use a pulse

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.159 
sometimes I use a pulse
yep<00:03:09.919> so<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.250> can<00:03:10.519> use<00:03:10.669> the<00:03:10.790> pause<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.780> after

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
yep so you can use the pause and after

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.110 
yep so you can use the pause and after
you<00:03:12.260> get<00:03:12.410> done<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.620> now<00:03:13.250> we've<00:03:13.459> got<00:03:13.639> a<00:03:13.669> vented

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
you get done that now we've got a vented

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.620 
you get done that now we've got a vented
cap<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:14.780> reducing<00:03:15.400> pressure<00:03:16.400> build<00:03:16.760> up<00:03:16.910> so

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
cap for reducing pressure build up so

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.509 
cap for reducing pressure build up so
it'll<00:03:18.109> probably<00:03:18.410> look<00:03:18.739> like<00:03:18.799> it's<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.220> bit<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.459> a

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
it'll probably look like it's a bit of a

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.949 
it'll probably look like it's a bit of a
chemistry<00:03:19.940> experiment<00:03:20.329> while<00:03:20.720> we're<00:03:20.870> doing

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
chemistry experiment while we're doing

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.370 
chemistry experiment while we're doing
this<00:03:21.229> that's<00:03:22.010> okay<00:03:22.720> if<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.780> want<00:03:24.139> to<00:03:24.199> cover

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
this that's okay if you want to cover

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.289 
this that's okay if you want to cover
that<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.650> can<00:03:25.070> there's<00:03:25.579> no<00:03:25.790> problem<00:03:26.150> with

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
that you can there's no problem with

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:26.500 
that you can there's no problem with
that

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
that

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.469 
that
I<00:03:27.280> want<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.370> show<00:03:28.519> you<00:03:28.609> how<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:28.910> calculates

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:29.479 
I want to show you how this calculates

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.629 
I want to show you how this calculates
into<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:29.930> just<00:03:30.650> imagine<00:03:31.010> if<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.280> has<00:03:31.459> hot

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
into a so just imagine if this has hot

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.099 
into a so just imagine if this has hot
water<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:32.030> there<00:03:32.180> as<00:03:32.329> well<00:03:32.540> because<00:03:32.870> it's

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
water in there as well because it's

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.449 
water in there as well because it's
actually<00:03:33.229> a<00:03:33.380> good<00:03:33.530> demonstration<00:03:33.799> for<00:03:34.310> that

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
actually a good demonstration for that

00:03:34.459 --> 00:04:15.300 
actually a good demonstration for that
too<00:03:34.639> so<00:03:35.359> just<00:03:35.389> push<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.930> auto<00:03:36.079> button

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.590 

okay<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.699> can<00:04:16.850> see<00:04:17.000> what<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.209> made<00:04:17.389> about

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
okay so you can see what I made about

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.460 
okay so you can see what I made about
that<00:04:17.900> meeting<00:04:18.289> of<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.590> cafe<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:20.359> just<00:04:21.049> over<00:04:21.169> 30

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
that meeting of the cafe so just over 30

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.340 
that meeting of the cafe so just over 30
seconds<00:04:21.889> like<00:04:22.039> we<00:04:22.430> actually<00:04:22.759> have<00:04:22.910> about

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
seconds like we actually have about

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.029 
seconds like we actually have about
buckwheat<00:04:24.350> flat<00:04:25.389> beautiful<00:04:26.389> I'm<00:04:26.449> smooth<00:04:27.039> if

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
buckwheat flat beautiful I'm smooth if

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.490 
buckwheat flat beautiful I'm smooth if
he<00:04:28.280> did<00:04:29.120> believe<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:29.570> running<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.169> went<00:04:30.380> out

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
he did believe it running and went out

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.230 
he did believe it running and went out
of<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.680> machine<00:04:30.979> out<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.400> room<00:04:31.759> while<00:04:32.180> I

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
of the machine out of the room while I

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.270 
of the machine out of the room while I
was<00:04:32.419> running<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:33.020> don't<00:04:33.620> have<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.860> worry<00:04:34.070> the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
was running you don't have to worry the

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.270 
was running you don't have to worry the
mache<00:04:34.580> Malaysia<00:04:34.910> 10<00:04:35.300> itself<00:04:35.690> off<00:04:35.870> so<00:04:36.199> I<00:04:36.590> other

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
mache Malaysia 10 itself off so I other

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.010 
mache Malaysia 10 itself off so I other
than<00:04:37.400> million<00:04:38.000> probably<00:04:38.389> a<00:04:38.419> bit<00:04:38.539> longer<00:04:38.780> than

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
than million probably a bit longer than

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.900 
than million probably a bit longer than
unity

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
unity

00:04:39.910 --> 00:05:02.350 
unity
it<00:04:40.910> will<00:04:41.120> be<00:04:41.240> fine<00:04:41.479> just<00:04:42.190> take<00:04:43.190> as<00:04:44.000> well<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:02.270> you

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
it will be fine just take as well so you

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.939 
it will be fine just take as well so you
can<00:05:02.539> see<00:05:02.720> there's<00:05:02.960> nothing<00:05:03.139> better<00:05:03.470> than<00:05:03.620> Java

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
can see there's nothing better than Java

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.420 
can see there's nothing better than Java
and<00:05:04.370> we've<00:05:04.460> got<00:05:04.639> that<00:05:04.789> beautiful<00:05:05.560> fine<00:05:06.729> we're
