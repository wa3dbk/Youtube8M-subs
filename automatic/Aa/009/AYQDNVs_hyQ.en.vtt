a<00:04:53.120> more<00:04:53.930> in-depth<00:04:54.230> review<00:04:54.860> on<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.630> but<00:04:56.630> here's

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
a more in-depth review on it but here's

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.970 
a more in-depth review on it but here's
what<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.050> get<00:04:57.169> in<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.320> box<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.710> get<00:04:57.830> the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
what you get in the box to get the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.070 
what you get in the box to get the
obviously<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.820> device<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.120> remote<00:04:59.570> power
