00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:03.959
 distribution of living beings 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.160
 the biosphere includes everything that surrounds us including which living beings 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.719
 this boat from the equator 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.999
 up to the poles 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.789
 from the depths of the oceans 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.029
 ashton the high peaks of the mountains including the flies 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.890
 because the sun gives you enough land to have water 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.899
 liquid 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.029
 have been able to develop a large number of organisms 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.190
 most of them are between the tropics of cancer and the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 Tropic of Capricorn 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.570
 since in those areas Libya are plentiful and the average temperature 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.350
 annual is to exceed 25 degrees 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.350
 giving place must be lenses conditions for life 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.980
 0 to move away from that strip towards the poles where low temperatures do not 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.930
 they allow to have liquid water 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.140
 the variety of life science decreases 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.730
 the same goes on the top of the mountains or the depth of the 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.560
 oceans 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.650
 where the lack of sunlight manages the water and the wounded there depend 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.430
 but cc chosica indec in the background 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.430
 Mexico is one of the countries with the greatest biodiversity 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.690
 because the cancer tropic passes through it allowing a lot of 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.940
 climates and reliefs 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.080
 giving rise to a great variety of species that inhabit the acerbas 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.000
 desert forests coral reefs among many others 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.540
 due to the great variety of living beings that really exists 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.810
 Mexico is considered a country with mega diversity 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.210
 but like in the whole world 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.650
 biodiversity in mexico is being threatened 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.330
 half of the mammal species that live in mexico are considered 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.980
 with two tries or disappear 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.130
 things for the species can disappear 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.600
 they are diverse 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.140
 for example it can be a natural catastrophe like hurricane fires so 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.760
 that are volcanic 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.920
 millions of years ago a catastrophe occurred that led to the dinosaurs 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.680
 of extinction like many other species this was the shock of a 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.410
 celestial body with the earth 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.890
 causing great climatic changes pere actions of the human being that causes 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.009
 the disappearance of certain species 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.089
 those are actions like indiscriminate hunting and massive logging of 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.129
 forests 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.290
 the cup are large tracts of land to build cities perform 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.459
 crops oo large-scale livestock 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 displacing many species causing his death 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.209
 the entire biosphere that connects to each other 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.399
 and if one or several species disappears the remaining thickened 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.489
 are affected by this loss 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.679
 and sometimes its permanence 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:49.679
 there are social organisms that the spinning top conserve ecosystems 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.939
 but you can or on your part respecting nature when you are in 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.159
