to me so I started looking at all those
things<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:11.520> steel<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.360> decided<00:02:12.810> on

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
things and the steel that I decided on

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.119 
things and the steel that I decided on
was<00:02:13.379> 154cm<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.989> reason<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.349> decided<00:02:16.769> on<00:02:16.950> that

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
was 154cm the reason I decided on that

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.960 
was 154cm the reason I decided on that
steel<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.819> have<00:02:18.269> used<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.019> past<00:02:19.590> 80<00:02:20.010> s<00:02:20.310> 34

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
steel is I have used in the past 80 s 34

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.880 
steel is I have used in the past 80 s 34
which<00:02:21.329> if<00:02:21.569> I'm<00:02:21.870> correct<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:23.569> equivalent<00:02:24.569> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
which if I'm correct is equivalent to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.759 
which if I'm correct is equivalent to
154cm<00:02:25.890> were<00:02:26.280> very<00:02:26.489> close<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:27.360> think<00:02:27.689> 80s<00:02:28.200> 34

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
154cm were very close to I think 80s 34

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.280 
154cm were very close to I think 80s 34
is<00:02:28.890> actually<00:02:29.310> add<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.970> foreign<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.989> might<00:02:31.140> be

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
is actually add a foreign I might be

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.589 
is actually add a foreign I might be
japanese-made<00:02:31.950> still<00:02:32.519> or<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:33.000> chinese-made

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
japanese-made still or a chinese-made

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.530 
japanese-made still or a chinese-made
still<00:02:34.019> not<00:02:34.260> sure<00:02:34.409> which<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.829> of<00:02:35.549> course<00:02:35.579> 154cm

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
still not sure which and of course 154cm

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.680 
still not sure which and of course 154cm
is<00:02:37.110> American<00:02:37.769> but<00:02:38.060> those<00:02:39.060> two<00:02:39.329> types<00:02:39.569> of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
is American but those two types of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.720 
is American but those two types of
stills<00:02:39.959> are<00:02:40.079> very<00:02:40.290> similar<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:43.349> 80s<00:02:43.980> 34

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
stills are very similar and the 80s 34

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.699 
stills are very similar and the 80s 34
I've<00:02:45.060> gone<00:02:45.239> swimming<00:02:45.720> with<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.079> thing<00:02:46.409> and

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
I've gone swimming with that thing and

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.289 
I've gone swimming with that thing and
never<00:02:47.190> had<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.700> worry<00:02:47.909> about<00:02:47.970> rust<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:50.299> that's

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
never had to worry about rust so that's

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.460 
never had to worry about rust so that's
why<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.540> wanted<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.959> go<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.079> 154cm<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:54.470> that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
why I wanted to go to 154cm and that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.460 
why I wanted to go to 154cm and that
that<00:02:55.799> still<00:02:56.790> keeps<00:02:57.239> your<00:02:57.569> blade<00:02:58.019> or<00:02:58.319> your

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
that still keeps your blade or your

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.539 
that still keeps your blade or your
overall<00:02:58.980> cost<00:02:59.340> to<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:02.780> reasonable<00:03:03.780> cost<00:03:04.620> so

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
overall cost to a reasonable cost so

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.339 
overall cost to a reasonable cost so
that<00:03:05.700> was<00:03:05.849> kind<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.180> why<00:03:06.359> I<00:03:06.389> wanted<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.989> steel

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
that was kind of why I wanted that steel

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.379 
that was kind of why I wanted that steel
I<00:03:07.590> haven't<00:03:08.519> had<00:03:08.639> any<00:03:08.790> experience<00:03:09.239> with<00:03:09.329> that

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
I haven't had any experience with that

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.490 
I haven't had any experience with that
steel<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.340> we'll<00:03:11.340> see<00:03:11.849> if<00:03:11.879> I<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.060> it

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
steel so we'll see if I like it

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.530 
steel so we'll see if I like it
something<00:03:13.500> else<00:03:13.680> they<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.299> found<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.420> I

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
something else they have found that I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.400 
something else they have found that I
really<00:03:15.569> like<00:03:16.109> with<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.060> tenacious<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.629> it's

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
really like with the tenacious is it's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.280 
really like with the tenacious is it's
it's<00:03:19.709> kind<00:03:20.069> of<00:03:20.129> a<00:03:20.340> thicker<00:03:21.180> handle<00:03:21.840> there's<00:03:22.199> a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
it's kind of a thicker handle there's a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.869 
it's kind of a thicker handle there's a
little<00:03:22.500> more<00:03:22.650> real<00:03:22.859> estate<00:03:22.889> down<00:03:23.489> here<00:03:23.760> on

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
little more real estate down here on

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.460 
little more real estate down here on
your<00:03:23.970> handle<00:03:24.419> to<00:03:24.540> put<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> palm<00:03:25.139> of<00:03:25.169> your

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
your handle to put in the palm of your

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.210 
your handle to put in the palm of your
hand<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:26.150> have<00:03:27.150> found<00:03:27.449> that<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.500> like<00:03:28.949> that

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
hand I have found that I like that

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.589 
hand I have found that I like that
especially<00:03:29.489> in<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.660> thinking<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.199> a<00:03:31.349> a

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
especially in in thinking of a a

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.629 
especially in in thinking of a a
self-defense<00:03:33.599> type<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.139> role<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.739> like<00:03:35.430> that

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
self-defense type of role I like that

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.640 
self-defense type of role I like that
real<00:03:35.879> estate<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.299> my<00:03:36.419> hand<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> wanted

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
real estate in my hand so I wanted

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.379 
real estate in my hand so I wanted
something<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.069> was<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.310> little<00:03:38.430> bit<00:03:38.940> bigger

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
something that was a little bit bigger

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.890 
something that was a little bit bigger
and<00:03:39.660> beefier<00:03:40.199> that<00:03:40.379> I<00:03:40.410> could<00:03:40.910> put<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.569> my

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
and beefier that I could put that in my

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.180 
and beefier that I could put that in my
hand<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.660> those<00:03:46.410> are<00:03:46.590> some<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:46.919> things

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
hand so those are some of the things

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.619 
hand so those are some of the things
like<00:03:47.549> there's<00:03:47.730> other<00:03:48.120> factors<00:03:48.359> that

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
like there's other factors that

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.119 
like there's other factors that
considered<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.440> those<00:03:49.590> were<00:03:49.709> some<00:03:49.919> of<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
considered but those were some of the

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.599 
considered but those were some of the
main<00:03:50.340> ones<00:03:50.720> what<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.750> really<00:03:52.349> wanted<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.280> I

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
main ones what I really wanted that I

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.229 
main ones what I really wanted that I
didn't<00:03:53.910> get<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:55.139> benchmade<00:03:56.129> onslaught<00:03:56.909> I

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
didn't get is the benchmade onslaught I

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.430 
didn't get is the benchmade onslaught I
am<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:58.049> love<00:03:58.560> with<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.980> knife<00:04:00.019> it's<00:04:01.019> one<00:04:01.319> of

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
am in love with that knife it's one of

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.050 
am in love with that knife it's one of
those<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.919> as<00:04:02.069> soon<00:04:02.280> as<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.549> put<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.000> my

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
those that as soon as I put it in my

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.979 
those that as soon as I put it in my
hand<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.690> was<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:04.199> phenomenal<00:04:05.329> however<00:04:06.329> the

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
hand it was just phenomenal however the

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.469 
hand it was just phenomenal however the
price<00:04:07.290> point<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:08.010> was<00:04:08.310> was<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:09.060> think<00:04:09.389> it's

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
price point on that was was I think it's

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.240 
price point on that was was I think it's
one<00:04:09.569> hundred<00:04:09.629> fifty<00:04:09.989> dollars<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.859> little

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
one hundred fifty dollars so a little

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.539 
one hundred fifty dollars so a little
more<00:04:11.549> than<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.790> wanted<00:04:11.819> to<00:04:12.180> spend<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.159> blade

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
more than I wanted to spend so the blade

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.659 
more than I wanted to spend so the blade
that<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.120> did<00:04:15.449> choose<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.400> there<00:04:17.400> are<00:04:17.519> some

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
that I did choose and there are some

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.089 
that I did choose and there are some
things<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:18.120> really<00:04:18.449> like<00:04:18.659> about<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.289> there

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
things I really like about it and there

things I really like about it and there
are<00:04:20.190> some<00:04:20.370> things<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:20.909> don't<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.329> about<00:04:21.450> but

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
are some things I don't like about but

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.320
