00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.020
 that's what a reflex I 'm a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.389
 small video ad to recruit on 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.429
 the twin server the men because we 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.770
 are looking for about six 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.770
 staff members in addition so it's up to 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.580
 say two or three architects and two 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.609
 or three coders because right now we 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.470
 we need a lot much 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.780
 to help with the mac mini games 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.219
 that a the server all or school is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.829
 split into two parts 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:44.700
 so there is a light server and a 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:46.800
 mmorpg server and so I have my six 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.410
 more staff members will be on the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.649
 mini games server so I'm going to show 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 of three emilienne maps after for 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.699
 show the style for architects to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.149
 what does it look like and at the level of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.530
 bell test coders will be made to 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.840
 know who we will choose so here is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.869
 the lobby or even for its reconstruction 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.869
 of course so that's for the staff 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.900
 so I showed you a quick map 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 so not a long time ago with a 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.259
 friend so architects we created 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.290
 a map 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.540
 one in the queen so has for the future and 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.470
 so she's here playing and going 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.470
 directly with the law 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.910
 so here is the note 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.840
 so that's pretty much the level 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.940
 architectural staff 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.880
 so yes at the level of architects 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.940
 looking for architects with a panel of 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.380
 architectural styles quite varied when 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.250
 even because we would like to pass maps of 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.360
 modern amap medieval maths and that's 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.810
 so it has to be it c varies the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.810
 thousands breads 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.450
 here it is so that it is the mc2 the most 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.420
 important that we write on the server 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:34.480
 ming and after I can you enter a 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:37.650
 other so this one will be used for a 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.959
 game that we created especially for 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.220
 our server so it's a map of m 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:51.310
 iceland so the same created by the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:55.900
 server architects you see the game 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.090
 will consist of putting three teams into 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.850
 face to face with sticks as our bins 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.920
 5 and the goal is to push others 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.470
 david players a good bah it's not the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.570
 purpose of the video it was just for you 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.769
 show pretty much the style that we can 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.769
 have on the server 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.830
 I will come back the gones 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:26.269
 so here at the moment bring back 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:28.819
 about 5 or 6 6/10 small yes that's it 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:35.510
 we are five or six in the laval staff 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:36.040
 and I will check but I think we 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.260
 at six 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.530
 and so yes it would make an addition of 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.829
 about five more staff members 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:51.769
 on the single server m so yes we are 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:59.269
 7 and the level they are more but we did not 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:01.819
 not finished the time has so here and so 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.480
 if you want to be an architect on those 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:09.170
 on the server all my dresses or coderre 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:14.690
 on this server so you will register 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.980
 your skype and well your skype on in 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.250
 the description in the description 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.260
 excuse me so I would add you 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.370
 directly I am present pretty much 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:31.039
 every afternoon on sky is so 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.560
 a test will be done to find out if 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.139
 you have the required level for the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.160
 server is training finally I say that without 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:42.380
 pretense when it's going and so the same 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.840
 for coders we are encoded in 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.440
 chief on the server goes he wants will pass 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.360
 a test also the same for coders 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.910
 So that's all for this little girl 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:05:00.250
 video announcement I will surely make a 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.870
 for other lovers to follow 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.639
 the tunnel server progress and so 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.650
 Well, I'm telling you it's a 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.650
 next saad and how
