00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.220
 hello dear knife friends is back 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.070
 once 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.010
 Bonn 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.210
 I built myself so small at the acer 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.009
 there one of my favorite knives that 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.160
 He knows from the video now then 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.400
 someday goes to someone from you 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.920
 and that's when I built myself a replacement 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.320
 he must have what we have again 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.230
 I'm out hunting or hunting 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.690
 at the bush force resp 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.339
 the female and that is what I have here 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.339
 made better again 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.530
 this time with the intervention 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.590
 wooden handle of it here on the sides like that 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.690
 a bit bumpy that one is not 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.020
 Slightly slips off again a pretty 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.380
 cheap form 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:13.030
 that is supposed to be 1 then I have like 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.290
 this is leather used in front here 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.440
 Just a little bit always going on 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.890
 still increase if you work with it 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:27.550
 then again, of course, a carbon steel 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 clean blade is there too 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.800
 nice sharpened 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 Then we come to the leather tailor 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.509
 view the turn should be relatively thick 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.170
 Sadleder I have a few now 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.340
 specials built in and we have 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.990
 here once below 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 a fire is a lot in it 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:04.369
 what the concept is practically made of 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:05.960
 the same wood as the knife here 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.229
 on top of it I have such a pretty tame 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.840
 The page is also incorporated 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.350
 out again and so we have a fire 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.580
 style then next comes here 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.580
 a little special 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.430
 u 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.519
 I know that this does not happen so 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.750
 a file there you can the whole thing 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.560
 then practically again with pugilist 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.359
 that's up from the older one 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.090
 Breaking tool in front of the reader my what 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.189
 always worked up and indeed can 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:04.900
 this cover is here in the back too 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:08.109
 take as a handle and no beard 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.209
 handy then if it is the extent 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.609
 to sharpen a knife 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.810
 so that's in there yes and that was it 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.549
 actually here as well as again 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.319
 sometimes small advises to be incorporated 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.709
 I do the leather as you probably do 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.150
 anyway always knows once in 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.299
 candle wax from baking or frying 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.769
 so in paraffin then comes the whole 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:35.109
 I was dead one night in Valais 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.030
 right there I have so liter in it 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.250
 such a canister because I stuff everything 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.709
 pure what I am somewhere against moisture 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.370
 The knife wants to protect one after another 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.190
 located in it 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.829
 the driving style was a night so 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.780
 Pretty much everything will work out right 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.500
 nice in every crack and then as I said 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.500
 nothing can happen 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.030
 up here knows I happened to happen 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.940
 again very small notch made pure 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.120
 that you can practice the style of driving then 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.120
 can use 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.270
 So it is my new replacement as I said 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.270
 knife 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.880
 mr schneider I have today 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:06:12.640
 We almost have to forget, of course 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:06:12.640
 even so, somewhat cuts
