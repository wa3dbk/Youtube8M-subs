and our white chocolate to ensure this
is<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> fair<00:00:16.049> test<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:17.220> will<00:00:17.510> make<00:00:18.510> sure<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
is a fair test we will make sure the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.769 
is a fair test we will make sure the
amount<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.650> water<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> saucepan<00:00:20.779> remains

melted<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:28.039> 25<00:00:29.039> pieces<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.760> each<00:00:30.320> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
melted is 25 pieces of each the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.650 
melted is 25 pieces of each the
temperature<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> water<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:33.000> will<00:00:33.239> go

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
temperature of the water which will go

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.740 
temperature of the water which will go
in<00:00:33.870> cold<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> tap<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> will<00:00:35.460> boil<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.390> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
in cold from the tap and will boil as it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930 
in cold from the tap and will boil as it
goes<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.070> temperature<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> stove

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
goes on the temperature of the stove

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940 
goes on the temperature of the stove
which<00:00:39.210> will<00:00:39.420> remain<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.230> medium<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.920> high

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
which will remain at a medium to high

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.290 
which will remain at a medium to high
heat<00:00:41.399> cooling<00:00:42.120> down<00:00:42.390> after<00:00:42.930> each<00:00:43.079> batch<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
heat cooling down after each batch and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.360 
heat cooling down after each batch and
to<00:00:45.300> ensure<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.960> stir<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> batch<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.950> each

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to ensure that we stir the batch of each

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.119 
to ensure that we stir the batch of each
chocolate<00:00:47.850> after<00:00:48.840> 4<00:00:49.079> minutes<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.829> two

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
chocolate after 4 minutes and then two

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.270 
chocolate after 4 minutes and then two
minutes<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:51.050> two<00:00:52.050> minute<00:00:52.320> increments<00:00:52.890> after

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
minutes in two minute increments after

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.910 
minutes in two minute increments after
this<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> chocolate<00:00:55.170> will<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.320> considered

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this the chocolate will be considered

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.590 
this the chocolate will be considered
melted<00:00:56.489> when<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.629> no<00:00:57.809> lumps<00:00:58.109> left<00:00:58.320> I

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
melted when there are no lumps left I

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.299 
melted when there are no lumps left I
think<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.440> milk<00:01:01.649> chocolate<00:01:01.859> will<00:01:02.280> melt

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
think that the milk chocolate will melt

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.670 
think that the milk chocolate will melt
quicker<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> has<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.080> higher<00:01:04.320> milk

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
quicker because it has a higher milk

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.850 
quicker because it has a higher milk
content<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:06.360> let's<00:01:06.780> begin<00:01:06.930> our<00:01:07.110> test<00:01:07.470> we'll

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
content so let's begin our test we'll

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.270 
content so let's begin our test we'll
start<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> milk<00:01:08.670> chocolate<00:01:10.070> we'll<00:01:11.070> take

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
start with the milk chocolate we'll take

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
start with the milk chocolate we'll take
our<00:01:11.460> milk<00:01:11.700> chocolate<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.510> our<00:01:12.810> double<00:01:13.229> boiler

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
our milk chocolate to our double boiler

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
our milk chocolate to our double boiler
which<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> prepared<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> stove<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.180> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
which is prepared on the stove which is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.760 
which is prepared on the stove which is
just<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> glass<00:01:15.810> bowl<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.979> top<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:18.770> saucepan

just a glass bowl on top of a saucepan
with<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> three<00:01:20.520> cups<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.970> cold<00:01:21.180> water<00:01:21.299> we

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
with the three cups of cold water we

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.700 
with the three cups of cold water we
will<00:01:22.409> turn<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:23.009> our<00:01:23.490> stove<00:01:24.560> onto<00:01:25.560> our

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
will turn on our stove onto our

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.480 
will turn on our stove onto our
medium-high<00:01:26.400> heat<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:28.009> we<00:01:29.009> will<00:01:29.220> give<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
medium-high heat and we will give it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
medium-high heat and we will give it
about<00:01:29.850> four<00:01:30.360> minutes<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.960> we'll<00:01:31.409> come<00:01:31.680> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
about four minutes and we'll come and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.210 
about four minutes and we'll come and
check<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:33.259> ok<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.710> our<00:01:34.829> progress

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
check on it ok so this is our progress

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.620 
check on it ok so this is our progress
at<00:01:35.400> four<00:01:35.610> minutes<00:01:35.939> we'll<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.270> give<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
at four minutes we'll just give it a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.050 
at four minutes we'll just give it a
quick<00:01:36.750> stare<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.670> there's<00:01:38.880> not

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
quick stare as you can see there's not

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.679 
quick stare as you can see there's not
much<00:01:39.299> change<00:01:39.950> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.360> consistency<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> our

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
much change in the consistency of our

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.440 
much change in the consistency of our
chocolate<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:44.460> we'll<00:01:44.640> keep<00:01:44.880> an<00:01:45.060> eye<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
chocolate but we'll keep an eye on it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.730 
chocolate but we'll keep an eye on it
and<00:01:45.600> we'll<00:01:45.810> come<00:01:45.990> back<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> check<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and we'll come back and check on it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.090 
and we'll come back and check on it
shortly

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.070 

all<00:01:49.610> right<00:01:49.730> this<00:01:49.940> is<00:01:50.150> what<00:01:50.480> it<00:01:50.600> looks<00:01:50.840> like

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
all right this is what it looks like

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.020 
all right this is what it looks like
after<00:01:51.590> six<00:01:51.830> minutes<00:01:52.040> we're<00:01:52.550> going<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.790> give<00:01:52.909> it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
after six minutes we're going to give it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.110 
after six minutes we're going to give it
another<00:01:53.270> quick<00:01:53.780> little<00:01:54.050> stir<00:01:54.820> just<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.000> we

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
another quick little stir just so we

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.719 
another quick little stir just so we
make<00:01:56.300> sure<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.600> doesn't<00:01:56.810> get<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.370> bottom

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
make sure it doesn't get on the bottom

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.660 
make sure it doesn't get on the bottom
as<00:01:58.910> well<00:02:02.290> all<00:02:03.290> right<00:02:03.350> we're<00:02:03.860> looking<00:02:03.979> good<00:02:04.220> I

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
as well all right we're looking good I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.820 
as well all right we're looking good I
think<00:02:05.180> just<00:02:05.390> another<00:02:05.660> few<00:02:05.960> minutes<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.500> we

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
think just another few minutes and we

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.830 
think just another few minutes and we
should<00:02:06.860> be<00:02:07.160> melted<00:02:09.640> all<00:02:10.640> right<00:02:10.820> this<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.420> after

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
should be melted all right this is after

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.970 
should be melted all right this is after
eight<00:02:12.050> minutes<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:14.270> it's<00:02:14.570> quite<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.110> runny

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
eight minutes so it's quite a runny

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.890 
eight minutes so it's quite a runny
consistency<00:02:16.220> but<00:02:17.000> we've<00:02:17.120> still<00:02:17.360> got<00:02:17.510> months

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
consistency but we've still got months

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.040 
consistency but we've still got months
so<00:02:18.110> we're<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:19.240> keep<00:02:20.240> watching<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.870> now

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
so we're going to keep watching it now

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.400 
so we're going to keep watching it now
because<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.830> lumps<00:02:22.190> will<00:02:22.340> disappear<00:02:22.820> shortly

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.729 

okay<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.890> took<00:02:28.160> us<00:02:28.340> 10<00:02:28.700> minutes<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.739> 23

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
okay so it took us 10 minutes and 23

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.250 
okay so it took us 10 minutes and 23
seconds<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.820> we're<00:02:32.120> now<00:02:32.390> at<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> smooth

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
seconds and we're now at a smooth

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.150 
seconds and we're now at a smooth
consistent<00:02:35.890> mixture<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.440> time<00:02:39.709> for<00:02:40.070> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
consistent mixture so the time for the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.660 
consistent mixture so the time for the
milk<00:02:40.400> chocolate<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:41.060> 10<00:02:41.420> minutes<00:02:41.600> 23<00:02:42.670> now

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
milk chocolate is 10 minutes 23 now

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.120 
milk chocolate is 10 minutes 23 now

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
and just see how it's going okay so this

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.720 
and just see how it's going okay so this
is<00:03:03.950> our<00:03:04.070> dark<00:03:04.280> chocolate<00:03:04.430> at<00:03:05.060> four<00:03:05.630> minutes

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730

is our dark chocolate at four minutes
you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.880> see<00:03:08.030> it's<00:03:08.180> actually<00:03:08.570> starting<00:03:08.780> to

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
you can see it's actually starting to

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.080 
you can see it's actually starting to
melt<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.739> little<00:03:09.769> bit<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.820> we'll<00:03:10.970> just

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
melt just a little bit so we'll just

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
melt just a little bit so we'll just
give<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.450> quick<00:03:11.570> stir<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.790> we'll<00:03:17.540> come<00:03:17.840> back

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.400 
give it a quick stir and we'll come back
and<00:03:18.910> check<00:03:19.910> our<00:03:20.090> progress<00:03:20.329> in<00:03:20.870> another<00:03:21.200> two

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
and check our progress in another two

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.960 
and check our progress in another two
minutes<00:03:23.769> okay<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:24.799> this<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.190> our<00:03:25.310> consistency

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
minutes okay so this is our consistency

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.180 
minutes okay so this is our consistency
of<00:03:26.000> our<00:03:26.239> dark<00:03:26.510> chocolate<00:03:26.630> at<00:03:27.200> 10<00:03:27.650> minutes<00:03:27.920> and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
of our dark chocolate at 10 minutes and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.170 
of our dark chocolate at 10 minutes and
44<00:03:28.760> seconds<00:03:29.560> it's<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.650> nice<00:03:31.010> smooth<00:03:31.459> texture

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
44 seconds it's a nice smooth texture

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.410 
44 seconds it's a nice smooth texture
now<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.780> completely<00:03:33.769> melted<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.180> took<00:03:35.299> a

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
now and completely melted so that took a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.240 
now and completely melted so that took a
little<00:03:35.600> bit<00:03:35.780> longer<00:03:35.890> than<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.070> milk

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
little bit longer than the milk

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.530 
little bit longer than the milk
chocolate<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:39.280> our<00:03:40.280> total<00:03:40.700> time<00:03:40.910> was<00:03:41.269> 10

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
chocolate and our total time was 10

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.979 
chocolate and our total time was 10
minutes<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:42.049> 44<00:03:42.470> seconds<00:03:43.390> okay<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:44.450> we're<00:03:44.840> up

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
minutes and 44 seconds okay so we're up

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.920 
minutes and 44 seconds okay so we're up
to<00:03:45.170> our<00:03:45.200> final<00:03:45.590> chocolate<00:03:46.600> doing<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.720> white

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
to our final chocolate doing the white

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
to our final chocolate doing the white
chocolate<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:50.090> put<00:03:50.450> some<00:03:50.690> new<00:03:51.410> cold<00:03:51.680> water

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
chocolate just put some new cold water

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.550 
chocolate just put some new cold water
in<00:03:52.130> our<00:03:52.280> saucepan<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:53.060> we'll<00:03:53.690> leave<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.410> and

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
in our saucepan and we'll leave that and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.000 
in our saucepan and we'll leave that and
come<00:03:54.680> back<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.010> check<00:03:55.100> or<00:03:55.250> not<00:03:55.370> shortly<00:03:57.010> all

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
come back and check or not shortly all

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.319 
come back and check or not shortly all
right<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:58.519> this<00:03:58.639> is<00:03:58.790> what<00:03:58.910> our<00:03:59.060> milk<00:03:59.269> chocolate

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
right so this is what our milk chocolate

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.760 
right so this is what our milk chocolate
is<00:03:59.750> looking<00:04:00.049> like

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
is looking like

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.790 
is looking like
minutes<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:02.060> can<00:04:02.240> see<00:04:02.480> there's<00:04:02.840> no<00:04:03.230> change<00:04:03.560> at

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
minutes you can see there's no change at

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.530 
minutes you can see there's no change at
all<00:04:04.070> there's<00:04:04.370> nothing<00:04:04.760> stuck<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.360> glass

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
all there's nothing stuck to the glass

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.350 
all there's nothing stuck to the glass
bottle<00:04:06.280> anything<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.460> so<00:04:08.060> we'll<00:04:08.180> come

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
bottle anything like that so we'll come

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.740 
bottle anything like that so we'll come
back<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:08.660> we'll<00:04:08.750> check<00:04:08.960> on<00:04:09.110> that<00:04:09.230> shortly

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
back and we'll check on that shortly

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.980 
back and we'll check on that shortly
okay<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.020> this<00:04:12.170> is<00:04:12.230> our<00:04:12.710> white<00:04:13.070> chocolate<00:04:13.990> and

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
okay and this is our white chocolate and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.600 
okay and this is our white chocolate and
it's<00:04:15.200> completely<00:04:15.740> melted<00:04:16.480> at<00:04:17.920> 13<00:04:18.920> minutes<00:04:19.370> in

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
it's completely melted at 13 minutes in

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.380 
it's completely melted at 13 minutes in
8<00:04:20.000> seconds<00:04:21.340> because<00:04:22.340> it's<00:04:22.730> a<00:04:22.850> really<00:04:23.000> smooth

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
8 seconds because it's a really smooth

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.000 
8 seconds because it's a really smooth
consistency<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:24.290> we<00:04:24.410> know<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:24.860> all

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
consistency so we know that it's all

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.490 
consistency so we know that it's all
melted<00:04:25.460> which<00:04:26.390> means<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.230> milk

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
melted which means that the milk

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.810 
melted which means that the milk
chocolate<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.760> fastest<00:04:29.980> at<00:04:30.980> melting<00:04:31.340> at

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
chocolate is the fastest at melting at

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.070 
chocolate is the fastest at melting at
10<00:04:32.450> minutes<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:32.990> 23<00:04:33.380> seconds
