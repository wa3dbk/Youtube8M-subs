only the simplest tools for instance a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.860 
only the simplest tools for instance a
week<00:00:11.370> pickaxe<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.059> takes<00:00:12.330> forever<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.660> dig

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
week pickaxe that takes forever to dig

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900 
week pickaxe that takes forever to dig
pretty<00:00:13.080> much<00:00:13.410> anywhere<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.889> small<00:00:14.309> Lantern<00:00:14.759> so

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
pretty much anywhere a small Lantern so

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.790 
pretty much anywhere a small Lantern so
your<00:00:15.059> field<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.480> vision<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.839> very<00:00:16.170> restricted

your field of vision is very restricted

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.189 
your field of vision is very restricted
and<00:00:16.920> no<00:00:17.400> way<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.820> back<00:00:17.970> up<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:19.020> really

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and no way to get back up so you really

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.599 
and no way to get back up so you really
have<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.529> meticulous<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.250> how<00:00:20.279> you're

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you'll advance your equipment as well so

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.120 
you'll advance your equipment as well so
you'll<00:00:24.539> upgrade<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.960> stronger<00:00:25.380> pickaxes<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
better equipment and you do that by

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
in miner dig deep you get only the most

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
in miner dig deep you get only the most
common<00:00:53.280> minerals<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.850> tin<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> copper<00:00:54.449> but

common minerals like tin and copper but

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
common minerals like tin and copper but
as<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.410> dig<00:00:55.559> deeper<00:00:55.860> you'll<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.160> rarer<00:00:56.460> and

as you dig deeper you'll get rarer and
more<00:00:56.730> value<00:00:57.180> than<00:00:57.210> minerals<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
more value than minerals and it's this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.170 
more value than minerals and it's this
constant<00:00:58.590> improvement<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> both<00:00:59.520> your<00:00:59.699> assets

three games the story definitely takes a
backseat<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> mechanics<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:29.909> usually

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
really makes these games stand out is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.370 
really makes these games stand out is
that<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> player<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> constantly<00:01:34.110> given<00:01:34.320> a
