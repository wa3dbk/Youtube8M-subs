 There is a difference in Zoron 's hand here, such as general Thermidor

 Thermidor in general 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:40.030
 Not only to gather as much part of the here management but here Thermidor is tail 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.390
 Take out once and go to white sauce 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:50.079
 I 'm packing all three from here to my head 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:52.760
 Another difference is that this isp shrimp is coated in white sauce and tasted

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.679
 Then I think that I want to burn from now on 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.869
 The middle of the competition is that same on the shop bread 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:08.070
 The sauce will flow if you leave it 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.040
 It is more like a wind chime 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.470
 It is a little way rounding 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.510
 Here of Thermidor it will pull down 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:25.170

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.170

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.400
 In the frying pan a little bigger than before 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.040

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.200
 On top of that, the TV Doll mentioned earlier 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.830
 Jose I 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.700
 If you do so, the stability will be firm. 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.700
 From above 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:57.350
 We cover and cook beef over low heat 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.350
 If you open the lid and the three cheeses are melted, it's done!
