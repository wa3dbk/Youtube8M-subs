00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.899 
material milled out there and kind of
even<00:03:50.549> see<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.620> different<00:03:52.730> fluctuations<00:03:53.730> and

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
even see the different fluctuations and

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.860 
even see the different fluctuations and
waves<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.919> but<00:03:55.919> it's<00:03:56.069> a<00:03:56.159> nice<00:03:56.400> chassis

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.110 

that's<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.079> bottom

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
that's the bottom

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.600 
that's the bottom
become<00:04:03.120> milled<00:04:03.389> out<00:04:03.659> it<00:04:03.840> is

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.730 

it's<00:04:09.070> pretty<00:04:10.070> strong<00:04:10.810> it's<00:04:11.810> definitely<00:04:12.350> like

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.130 

very<00:04:15.740> interesting<00:04:17.680> that's<00:04:18.680> pretty<00:04:18.950> much<00:04:19.040> it

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
very interesting that's pretty much it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.830 
very interesting that's pretty much it
there<00:04:21.140> are<00:04:21.260> these<00:04:21.380> six<00:04:22.000> in<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.030> nutshell<00:04:23.360> let's

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
there are these six in a nutshell let's

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.840 
there are these six in a nutshell let's
see<00:04:24.050> what's<00:04:24.230> in<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.410> bag<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:25.250> any<00:04:25.430> different

than<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.060> tki<00:04:26.510> treatment<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:35.030> it's<00:04:35.270> just<00:04:35.660> a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
than the tki treatment so it's just a

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.740 
than the tki treatment so it's just a
minute<00:04:37.070> now<00:04:37.130> here<00:04:37.490> we<00:04:37.550> go<00:04:38.740> got<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.770> window<00:04:40.100> masks

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
minute now here we go got a window masks

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.840 
minute now here we go got a window masks
and<00:04:41.750> decals<00:04:43.090> then<00:04:44.090> check<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.480> SMS<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:46.550> forth

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
like with the pka three these

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.090 
like with the pka three these
instructions<00:04:52.790> look<00:04:53.240> just<00:04:53.840> like<00:04:56.500> from<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.620> TK

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
instructions look just like from the TK

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:07.320 
instructions look just like from the TK
a3<00:04:58.900> let's<00:04:59.900> just<00:05:00.170> look<00:05:00.440> here<00:05:00.940> all<00:05:01.960> disassembly

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.900 

here<00:05:08.330> show<00:05:08.570> instructions<00:05:09.260> are<00:05:10.330> pretty<00:05:11.330> good

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
here show instructions are pretty good

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.560 
here show instructions are pretty good
there's<00:05:13.910> others<00:05:14.300> that<00:05:14.330> are<00:05:14.570> better<00:05:14.750> but

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
there's others that are better but

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.290 
there's others that are better but
shouldn't<00:05:17.570> be<00:05:17.660> too<00:05:17.870> difficult<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:20.180> is

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
shouldn't be too difficult so that is

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.170 
shouldn't be too difficult so that is
