little younger in you're playing this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.009 
little younger in you're playing this
game<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> coolest<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.750> ever

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and you know even by today's standard it

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.310 
and you know even by today's standard it
still<00:01:05.909> looks<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.479> looks<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.960> good<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
still looks it looks pretty good it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
still looks it looks pretty good it
looks<00:01:07.470> ok<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.580> go

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
looks ok it's not like it's go

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
looks ok it's not like it's go
graphically<00:01:09.540> terrible<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.290> then<00:01:10.409> compared

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
graphically terrible and then compared

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.050 
graphically terrible and then compared
to<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> newer<00:01:11.010> games<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> newer

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
to the newer games you have the newer

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.250 
to the newer games you have the newer
games<00:01:12.210> look<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.659> better<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
games look a little better but you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.980 
games look a little better but you
notice<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.189> bad<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:15.150> getting

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
notice it's not that bad but getting

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.210 
notice it's not that bad but getting
back<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> theory<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.920> we're<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
back into the theory that we're going to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.140 
back into the theory that we're going to
be<00:01:17.310> doing<00:01:17.430> today<00:01:17.580> we're<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.090> doing

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
be doing today we're going to be doing

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.880 
be doing today we're going to be doing
to<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.650> scooby-doo<00:01:19.820> post-apocalyptic<00:01:20.820> theory

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
to be scooby-doo post-apocalyptic theory

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.050 
to be scooby-doo post-apocalyptic theory
now<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> real<00:01:23.220> short<00:01:23.460> theory<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:23.909> it's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
now it's a real short theory but it's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.609 
now it's a real short theory but it's
really<00:01:24.240> fun<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.869> thought<00:01:25.259> I'd<00:01:25.350> share<00:01:25.500> with

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
