00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:24.189
 but good that I die quiet of 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.119
 rafa danced more or less not so 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.820
 We already started on Saturday with the 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.910
 touch he had with the piano in the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.520
 first chicana in classification and already 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.170
 we had channel break and there 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.930
 we had the chassis problem that what 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.230
 we are solving and good and after 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.250
 on Sunday on how the series was viewed and on 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.460
 the end of the wall 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.989
 because we came quite regular was in 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.020
 some time we have to touch a 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.580
 complicated career to predict a 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.580
 a little more more intense 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.380
 well on Tuesday we got off the 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.600
 Semi auto we are 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:12.409
 channeler trunk 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.510
 escapes heaps windshields enough 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.050
 old 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.360
 and destroying the rescue truck is going to 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.820
 look for the car the car in a moment 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.860
 entered the field continues utility of the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.500
 truck in the trunk of the car the trunk 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.210
 also despite the touch in the race 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 have had a touch the car of 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.510
 rescue also and forward it had to 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.330
 cut half of the structure let's say 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.020
 all that is the anchors of the anchor 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.440
 to the c and there we started everything for 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440
 ahead 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.430
 as you can appreciate we have this that 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.000
 this grill that is also 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.220
 crooked is also everything new we have the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.950
 anchorage to which he also had beaten himself 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.100
 twisted that we're also going to change the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.570
 cold pipe from now that will go again 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.350
 dancing another thickness wow be more 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.270
 reinforced the thickness of this compared 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.930
 with the other pipe that went that has the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.010
 same thickness of this different would be missing 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.890
 and good to settle the channelers the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.739
 two tubes because we broke two tubes if 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.320
 we will take more or less around 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.420
 four or five days in finishing the water 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.100
 at the time the shock was 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.400
 it produces the shock we are heading 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.260
 towards the car so that people 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.000
 things do not take anything that even 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.470
 they took us the shot in an oversight 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.120
 when we were hooking it 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.260
 on the stretcher to bring it in a 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.520
 careless they took us the take but a 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.880
 gift that took the people of the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.880
 car 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.290
 I had all the auto maneuvers 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.700
 shocked but good but dodges me something 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.830
 the pilot was not there or we saw him not one 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.090
 It sounds like once I went through the workshop 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.940
 come and say hello come with us 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.750
 Bring the invoice if you want to have it taken 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.340
 mate and hopefully for the sweep 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.700
 we are on the podium and we can eat in 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.700
 the living room 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.380
 and
