00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
systems that carries basically how we

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.170 
systems that carries basically how we
operate<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> aircraft<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.610> then<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> will

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
operate the aircraft and then it will

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.430 
operate the aircraft and then it will
pretty<00:00:42.360> much<00:00:42.449> be<00:00:42.839> operating<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.409> aircraft

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
pretty much be operating the aircraft

trim Brisbane the Gold Coast area and
we'll<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.040> through<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> profiles

company<00:00:56.909> I've<00:00:57.330> always<00:00:57.510> only<00:00:57.870> become<00:00:58.110> a<00:00:58.140> pilot

company I've always only become a pilot

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.860 
company I've always only become a pilot
because<00:00:58.979> you<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.760> often<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.269> end<00:01:00.449> you're

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
because you just often the end you're

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.350 
because you just often the end you're
afraid<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.830> just<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.940> whatever<00:01:03.120> you

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
afraid you just you can do whatever you

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.719 
afraid you just you can do whatever you
want<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.629> there<00:01:03.659> is<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.159> great

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
want up there is it's just great

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
want up there is it's just great
well<00:01:05.940> I<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.390> expect<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.870> get<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
well I think you can expect to get a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
well I think you can expect to get a
pretty<00:01:07.860> good<00:01:07.950> understanding<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pretty good understanding what the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.520 
pretty good understanding what the
aircraft<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.450> capable<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> how<00:01:10.470> we

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
aircraft is capable of and how we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.740 
aircraft is capable of and how we
operate<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.040> aircraft<00:01:11.420> both<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> other

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
operate that aircraft both the other

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.000 
operate that aircraft both the other
front<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> back<00:01:13.260> seat<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.680> pilot<00:01:13.950> an

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
front and back seat when the pilot an

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.670 
front and back seat when the pilot an
ACO<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> should<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.500> able<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
ACO and I think you should be able to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
ACO and I think you should be able to
get<00:01:16.829> a<00:01:16.860> pretty<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.219> feel<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.729> how<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
get a pretty good feel of how the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.630 
get a pretty good feel of how the
aircraft<00:01:19.289> flies<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.280> should<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.610> over

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
aircraft flies and you should get over

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.200 
aircraft flies and you should get over
at<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.969> appropriate<00:01:21.420> proficiently<00:01:21.810> by<00:01:23.210> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
at the appropriate proficiently by the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.050 
at the appropriate proficiently by the
best<00:01:24.539> thing

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
best thing

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.499 
best thing
and<00:01:25.240> I<00:01:25.659> think<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.140> did<00:01:26.259> really<00:01:26.290> well<00:01:26.500> he<00:01:27.509> lost

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
and I think you did really well he lost

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.940 
and I think you did really well he lost
Hamas<00:01:28.869> or<00:01:28.990> he<00:01:29.140> was<00:01:29.290> landing<00:01:29.409> on<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.649> aircraft

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
Hamas or he was landing on the aircraft

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.440 
Hamas or he was landing on the aircraft
carrier<00:01:30.009> so<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.369> was<00:01:30.610> pretty<00:01:31.060> good<00:01:31.180> flying

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
carrier so that was pretty good flying

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.969 
carrier so that was pretty good flying
from<00:01:31.720> what<00:01:31.840> I<00:01:31.869> could<00:01:31.960> see<00:01:32.110> Cindy<00:01:32.649> flying<00:01:32.890> the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
from what I could see Cindy flying the

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.069 
from what I could see Cindy flying the
aircraft<00:01:33.100> well<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:34.810> pretty<00:01:35.020> much

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
aircraft well and you pretty much

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.510 
aircraft well and you pretty much
navigate<00:01:35.500> his<00:01:35.590> way<00:01:35.649> around<00:01:35.920> Brisbane<00:01:36.280> and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
navigate his way around Brisbane and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.990 
navigate his way around Brisbane and
Gold<00:01:37.090> Coast<00:01:37.649> quite<00:01:38.649> well<00:01:38.860> this<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.759> best

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
Gold Coast quite well this is the best

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.719 
Gold Coast quite well this is the best
experience<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.750> my<00:01:40.840> life<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.350> was<00:01:41.740> awesome<00:01:42.490> fun

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
and I've aware of tapes about the fa-18

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.060 
and I've aware of tapes about the fa-18
so<00:01:45.340> he's<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:46.530> certificate<00:01:47.530> for<00:01:47.679> you<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.920> say
