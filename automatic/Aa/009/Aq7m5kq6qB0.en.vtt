it can reminds me off for now this is
actually<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.970> rake<00:01:26.210> if<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.479> go<00:01:26.600> on<00:01:26.689> to<00:01:26.810> Google

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
actually the rake if you go on to Google

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.660 
actually the rake if you go on to Google
and<00:01:27.290> look<00:01:27.350> up<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.619> rake<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:27.979> can<00:01:28.130> read<00:01:28.340> into

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
leave a link in the description but I'm

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.850 
leave a link in the description but I'm
just<00:01:53.540> going<00:01:53.689> to<00:01:53.810> talk<00:01:53.960> over<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:54.500> not<00:01:54.710> as

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
just going to talk over it but not as

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.889 
just going to talk over it but not as
much<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.219> depth<00:01:55.460> before<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.479> next

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
much in depth before so the next

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.080 
much in depth before so the next
achievement<00:01:57.079> is<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:58.130> have<00:01:58.340> no<00:01:58.490> power<00:01:58.729> over<00:01:58.850> me

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
achievement is you have no power over me

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.580 
achievement is you have no power over me
and<00:01:59.329> to<00:01:59.420> getting<00:01:59.570> what<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.899> have<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.170> do<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.409> in

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
and to getting what you have to do is in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.709 
and to getting what you have to do is in
trans<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.039> defeat<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.759> avogadro<00:02:02.450> without

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
trans you defeat the avogadro without

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.660 
trans you defeat the avogadro without
being<00:02:02.930> attacked<00:02:03.229> by<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.680> that's<00:02:03.860> for<00:02:04.009> 15g

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
being attacked by it and that's for 15g

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.090 
being attacked by it and that's for 15g
so<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.420> thought<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:05.990> electric<00:02:06.500> zombie<00:02:06.890> thing

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
so I thought this electric zombie thing

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.440 
so I thought this electric zombie thing
that<00:02:07.250> we<00:02:07.340> got<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.640> see<00:02:07.759> in<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.939> world<00:02:08.060> premiere

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
that we got to see in the world premiere

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.910 
that we got to see in the world premiere
trailer<00:02:08.750> for<00:02:08.960> zombies<00:02:09.259> could<00:02:09.470> be<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:09.740> new

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
trailer for zombies could be this new

trailer for zombies could be this new
avogadro<00:02:10.580> boss<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.720> especially<00:02:12.020> because<00:02:12.350> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
avogadro boss and especially because the

second so we've got the normal zombies
the<00:03:20.970> normal<00:03:21.270> zombies<00:03:21.570> which<00:03:21.750> can<00:03:21.930> set<00:03:22.140> on<00:03:22.320> fire

think someone spotted it within the
preview<00:03:27.270> trailer<00:03:27.690> if<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.170> den<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.560> I'm

like I said we've got basically two

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.479 
like I said we've got basically two
different<00:03:51.870> types<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.650> zombies<00:03:52.830> we've<00:03:53.190> got<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
different types of zombies we've got the

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.280 
different types of zombies we've got the
original<00:03:53.820> zombies<00:03:54.420> which<00:03:54.570> since<00:03:54.750> alpha<00:03:55.140> and

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
original zombies which since alpha and

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.720 
original zombies which since alpha and
then<00:03:55.380> we<00:03:55.470> just<00:03:55.650> got<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.860> normal<00:03:56.190> zombies

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
then we just got the normal zombies

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.280 
then we just got the normal zombies
so<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.209> normal<00:03:57.510> zombies<00:03:57.780> which<00:03:57.930> was<00:03:58.110> set<00:03:58.260> on

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
so the normal zombies which was set on

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.660 
so the normal zombies which was set on
fire<00:03:58.380> I'm<00:03:58.680> not<00:03:58.860> sure<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.100> they<00:03:59.280> do<00:03:59.459> any

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
fire I'm not sure if they do any

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.250 
fire I'm not sure if they do any
different<00:04:00.120> harm<00:04:00.360> than<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.600> normal<00:04:00.900> zombies

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
different harm than the normal zombies

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.360 
different harm than the normal zombies
maybe<00:04:01.470> if<00:04:01.560> they<00:04:01.680> touch<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:02.040> when<00:04:02.160> they're<00:04:02.280> on

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
maybe if they touch it when they're on

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.670 
maybe if they touch it when they're on
fire<00:04:02.580> it<00:04:03.000> could<00:04:03.120> do<00:04:03.300> extra<00:04:03.840> damage<00:04:04.230> I'm<00:04:04.530> not

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
fire it could do extra damage I'm not

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.770 
fire it could do extra damage I'm not
too<00:04:04.860> sure<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.850> looks<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.360> nizam<00:04:06.690> B

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
too sure but it looks like a nizam B

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.449 
too sure but it looks like a nizam B
could<00:04:06.959> set<00:04:07.140> on<00:04:07.230> fire<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:07.620> any<00:04:07.800> normal<00:04:08.160> zombie

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
could set on fire so any normal zombie

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.100 
could set on fire so any normal zombie
could<00:04:08.580> suddenly<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.150> become<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.450> fire<00:04:09.720> zombie

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
could suddenly just become a fire zombie

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.930 
could suddenly just become a fire zombie
so<00:04:10.230> that's<00:04:10.410> awesome<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.310> looks<00:04:11.520> like<00:04:11.700> all

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
so that's awesome but it looks like all

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.280 
so that's awesome but it looks like all
the<00:04:12.120> normal<00:04:12.450> zombies<00:04:12.810> wearing<00:04:13.140> different

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290
