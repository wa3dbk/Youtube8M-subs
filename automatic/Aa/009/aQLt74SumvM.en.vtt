00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.440 
feed into being able to kind of steady
themselves<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.579> game<00:03:05.790> yeah<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.150> know

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
themselves in this game yeah you know

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.559 
themselves in this game yeah you know
I'm<00:03:06.600> not<00:03:06.750> sure<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.440> know<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:08.269> think<00:03:09.269> we<00:03:09.420> just

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
I'm not sure you know you think we just

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.710 
I'm not sure you know you think we just
come<00:03:09.810> out<00:03:09.959> compete<00:03:10.470> hard<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:12.359> know<00:03:12.480> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
come out compete hard and you know it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.509 
come out compete hard and you know it
would<00:03:12.840> look<00:03:13.049> like<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.410> could<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.590> back<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
would look like it could be back to

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.910 
would look like it could be back to
overtime<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.569> know<00:03:16.519> I'm

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
overtime you know I'm

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.280 
overtime you know I'm
we<00:03:18.069> missed<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.370> field<00:03:18.550> goal<00:03:18.730> there<00:03:19.150> we<00:03:20.140> had<00:03:20.230> a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
we missed a field goal there we had a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.470 
we missed a field goal there we had a
chance<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.709> go<00:03:20.830> score<00:03:21.160> didn't<00:03:21.490> get<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.880> you

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
chance to go score didn't get it in you

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.449 
chance to go score didn't get it in you
start<00:03:22.690> thinking<00:03:22.840> about<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.500> but<00:03:24.190> then<00:03:24.340> our

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
start thinking about it but then our

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.370 
start thinking about it but then our
defense<00:03:24.880> came<00:03:25.090> up<00:03:25.239> with<00:03:25.390> some<00:03:25.569> big<00:03:25.690> plays<00:03:26.020> and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
defense came up with some big plays and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.020 
defense came up with some big plays and
I<00:03:26.590> think<00:03:26.950> that's<00:03:27.099> what's<00:03:27.370> what's<00:03:27.760> fun<00:03:28.000> to

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
I think that's what's what's fun to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.990 
I think that's what's what's fun to
watch<00:03:28.300> us<00:03:28.569> is<00:03:28.750> when<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.500> pressure<00:03:29.739> was<00:03:29.920> on<00:03:30.099> how

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
watch us is when the pressure was on how

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.360 
watch us is when the pressure was on how
hard<00:03:31.390> our<00:03:31.690> guys<00:03:31.900> competed<00:03:32.590> those<00:03:33.010> what<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
hard our guys competed those what is the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.040 
hard our guys competed those what is the
biggest<00:03:33.580> grope<00:03:33.940> you've<00:03:34.150> seen<00:03:34.390> this<00:03:34.569> team<00:03:34.810> it

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
biggest grope you've seen this team it

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.080 
biggest grope you've seen this team it
turns<00:03:35.260> out<00:03:35.319> you've<00:03:35.440> had<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> rearrange<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.940> lot

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
turns out you've had to rearrange a lot

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.550 
turns out you've had to rearrange a lot
of<00:03:37.209> pieces<00:03:37.390> because<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.840> guys<00:03:38.080> didn't<00:03:38.350> hurt

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
of pieces because the guys didn't hurt

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.410 
of pieces because the guys didn't hurt
yeah<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.190> know<00:03:39.310> they're<00:03:39.790> fun<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.090> coach

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
yeah you know they're fun to coach

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.330 
yeah you know they're fun to coach
because<00:03:40.930> they<00:03:41.170> go<00:03:41.380> out<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.590> work<00:03:41.920> hard<00:03:42.190> at

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
because they go out and work hard at

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.860 
because they go out and work hard at
practice<00:03:42.489> they've<00:03:43.120> got<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.390> good<00:03:43.660> attitude

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
practice they've got a good attitude

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.430 
practice they've got a good attitude
they<00:03:44.800> have<00:03:45.069> a<00:03:45.100> tremendous<00:03:45.700> amount<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:46.090> energy

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
they have a tremendous amount of energy

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.740 
they have a tremendous amount of energy
you<00:03:47.440> know<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:48.250> think<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.790> defense<00:03:49.209> did<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.480> great

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
you know I think the defense did a great

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.440 
you know I think the defense did a great
job<00:03:49.780> early<00:03:50.680> in<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.950> year<00:03:51.269> understand<00:03:52.269> and

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
job early in the year understand and

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.180 
job early in the year understand and
it's<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.690> team<00:03:52.959> game<00:03:52.989> we<00:03:53.769> didn't<00:03:53.950> have<00:03:54.069> any

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
it's a team game we didn't have any

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.890 
it's a team game we didn't have any
separation<00:03:54.760> when<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.239> offense<00:03:55.600> couldn't

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
separation when the offense couldn't

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.050 
separation when the offense couldn't
move<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.200> ball<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.130> know<00:03:57.519> couldn't<00:03:57.940> get

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
move the ball and you know couldn't get

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.490 
move the ball and you know couldn't get
it<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.420> end<00:03:58.450> zone<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.049> couple<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.470> games

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
it in the end zone in a couple of games

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.949 
it in the end zone in a couple of games
so<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:00.910> know<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.090> think<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.420> proud<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.690> our

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
everyone understood today this is a team

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.160 
everyone understood today this is a team
game<00:04:05.799> it's<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.850> offensive<00:04:07.209> job<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.690> score<00:04:07.989> one

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
game it's the offensive job to score one

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.050 
game it's the offensive job to score one
more<00:04:08.350> point<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.769> defense<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.340> stop<00:04:09.580> them<00:04:09.819> for

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
more point and defense to stop them for

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.539 
more point and defense to stop them for
less<00:04:10.630> than<00:04:10.840> one<00:04:11.110> point<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.709> they<00:04:12.340> held

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
less than one point and they held
