of you know have to be accurate is
emphasized<00:00:34.930> when<00:00:35.200> using<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:35.710> op<00:00:35.890> because<00:00:36.640> of

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
emphasized when using the op because of

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.869 
emphasized when using the op because of
course<00:00:37.390> if<00:00:37.690> you're<00:00:37.870> out<00:00:38.170> in<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.440> open<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:39.160> you

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
course if you're out in the open and you

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.819 
course if you're out in the open and you
miss<00:00:40.090> an<00:00:40.239> opp<00:00:40.390> shot<00:00:40.660> you're<00:00:41.170> pretty<00:00:41.410> much<00:00:41.469> dead

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
miss an opp shot you're pretty much dead

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.110 
miss an opp shot you're pretty much dead
and<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:44.110> know<00:00:44.230> you're<00:00:44.559> it<00:00:45.370> takes<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:45.879> long<00:00:46.059> to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
and you know you're it takes so long to

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.110 
and you know you're it takes so long to
load<00:00:46.510> in<00:00:46.960> between<00:00:47.590> you're<00:00:48.190> exposed<00:00:48.670> for<00:00:48.940> so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
load in between you're exposed for so

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.369 
load in between you're exposed for so
long<00:00:51.390> sure<00:00:52.390> you'll<00:00:52.570> have<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.719> chance<00:00:52.809> if<00:00:53.230> you

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
long sure you'll have a chance if you

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.580 
long sure you'll have a chance if you
peek<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.890> miss<00:00:54.520> but<00:00:55.359> then<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:55.719> know<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:56.440> next

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
peek and miss but then you know the next

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.500 
peek and miss but then you know the next
time<00:00:56.800> you<00:00:56.949> pick<00:00:57.129> that<00:00:57.340> corner<00:00:57.820> you've<00:00:58.300> just

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
time you pick that corner you've just

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.860 
time you pick that corner you've just
increased<00:00:58.690> your<00:00:59.079> risks<00:00:59.530> of<00:00:59.949> dying<00:01:00.390> even<00:01:01.390> more

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
increased your risks of dying even more

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.560 
increased your risks of dying even more
so<00:01:02.829> it's<00:01:03.100> very<00:01:03.309> important<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:04.150> kill<00:01:04.420> people

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
so it's very important to kill people

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.609 
so it's very important to kill people
the<00:01:04.840> first<00:01:05.080> time<00:01:05.290> with<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.620> up<00:01:07.350> what's<00:01:08.350> key

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
the first time with the up what's key

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.620 
the first time with the up what's key
with<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.920> op<00:01:09.040> is<00:01:09.400> getting<00:01:09.759> flickers<00:01:10.180> down

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
with the op is getting flickers down

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.469 
with the op is getting flickers down
what<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.530> what<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.770> flicker<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.369> is<00:01:12.700> it's

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
what it what a flicker is is it's

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.670 
what it what a flicker is is it's
usually<00:01:13.930> not<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:14.470> huge<00:01:14.920> distance<00:01:15.490> but

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
usually not a huge distance but

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.620 
usually not a huge distance but
basically<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:18.220> know<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.369> have<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:19.090> target

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
basically you know you have a target

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.630 
basically you know you have a target
somewhere<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.500> you're<00:01:21.040> able<00:01:21.189> to<00:01:21.340> just

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
somewhere and you're able to just

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.090 
somewhere and you're able to just
flicker<00:01:22.170> straight<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.470> target<00:01:23.680> you're

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
flicker straight to the target you're

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.249 
flicker straight to the target you're
just<00:01:24.250> like<00:01:24.430> BAM<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.970> then<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.420> know<00:01:25.540> shoot

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
just like BAM and then you know shoot

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.719 
just like BAM and then you know shoot
you<00:01:29.259> really<00:01:29.590> need<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.799> get<00:01:29.920> this<00:01:30.100> down<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
you really need to get this down and the

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.580 
you really need to get this down and the
key<00:01:30.970> is<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.689> like<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> while<00:01:34.689> I<00:01:35.049> was<00:01:35.350> trying

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
key is is like for a while I was trying

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.859 
key is is like for a while I was trying
to<00:01:35.649> go<00:01:35.770> as<00:01:35.890> fast<00:01:35.920> as<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:36.549> can<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:37.210> get<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.689> you

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
to go as fast as I can to get to the you

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.050 
to go as fast as I can to get to the you
know<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.290> get<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.740> target<00:01:38.950> just<00:01:39.610> try<00:01:40.000> to

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
know to get to the target just try to

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.620 
know to get to the target just try to
flicker<00:01:40.450> as<00:01:40.570> fast<00:01:40.810> as<00:01:40.990> I<00:01:41.110> can<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.619> I<00:01:42.070> realized

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
flicker as fast as I can and I realized

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020 
flicker as fast as I can and I realized
it's<00:01:43.630> not<00:01:43.840> possible<00:01:44.110> for<00:01:44.500> me<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.920> move<00:01:45.189> you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
it's not possible for me to move you

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.679 
it's not possible for me to move you
know<00:01:46.180> it's<00:01:46.720> fast<00:01:47.049> as<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.530> would<00:01:47.680> like<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:49.450> get

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
know it's fast as I would like to to get

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.859 
know it's fast as I would like to to get
to<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.590> target<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.030> truth<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.689> can

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
to the target but the truth is you can

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.530 
to the target but the truth is you can
still<00:01:53.200> do<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.439> pretty<00:01:53.979> fast<00:01:54.310> let<00:01:55.060> me<00:01:55.180> in<00:01:55.299> tough

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
still do it pretty fast let me in tough

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.889 
still do it pretty fast let me in tough
to<00:01:56.140> other<00:01:56.290> people<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:58.000> gonna<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:58.630> going<00:01:58.840> to

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
to other people it's gonna it's going to

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.740 
to other people it's gonna it's going to
look<00:01:59.140> like<00:01:59.170> incredibly<00:02:00.040> fast<00:02:00.369> but<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:01.509> do

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
look like incredibly fast but you do

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.080 
look like incredibly fast but you do
have<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.079> find

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
have to find

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.630 
have to find
the<00:02:03.990> speed<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.399> but

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the speed that you can do it at but

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.690 
the speed that you can do it at but
still<00:02:05.969> quickly<00:02:06.619> not<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.340> throw

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
still quickly not going to like throw

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.070 
still quickly not going to like throw
the<00:02:08.849> mouse<00:02:09.000> across<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.569> room<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:09.899> anything

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the mouse across the room or anything

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
but you should be pretty darn quick at

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.559 
but you should be pretty darn quick at
switching<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.640> hitting<00:02:15.150> him<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.480> you

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
switching and and hitting him so you

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.979 
switching and and hitting him so you
definitely<00:02:15.810> work<00:02:16.709> on<00:02:16.860> your<00:02:17.040> speed<00:02:17.870> see<00:02:18.870> what

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you can do as far as speed and know your

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.699 
you can do as far as speed and know your
limitations<00:02:23.930> another<00:02:24.930> thing<00:02:25.170> that's<00:02:25.349> huge

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
limitations another thing that's huge

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.509 
limitations another thing that's huge
that<00:02:25.910> can<00:02:26.910> help<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.410> basically<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:29.310> to

target and basically you don't have to
stop<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.260> target<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.950> opp<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:42.630> way

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
stop on the target with the opp the way

stop on the target with the opp the way
you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.170> aim<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.310> pan<00:02:44.610> across

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
you can aim is you can just pan across

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.039 
you can aim is you can just pan across
and<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:46.400> press<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.610> button<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:48.269> right

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
and just press the button you know right

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
as your as you're going yeah the target

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.259 
as your as you're going yeah the target
and<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.780> very<00:02:55.200> helpful<00:02:55.500> sometimes

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
and that that is very helpful sometimes

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.819 
and that that is very helpful sometimes
you<00:02:57.269> don't<00:02:57.390> always<00:02:57.629> need<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.170> aim<00:02:58.319> exactly

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
you don't always need the aim exactly

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.479 
you don't always need the aim exactly
just<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.250> know<00:02:59.370> pan<00:02:59.640> across<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.329> fire<00:03:01.489> right

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
just you know pan across and fire right

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.380 
just you know pan across and fire right
when<00:03:02.700> you're<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.090> their<00:03:03.390> hip<00:03:03.569> box<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:05.010> can

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
when you're on their hip box and I can

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.250 
when you're on their hip box and I can
that<00:03:06.390> can<00:03:06.510> make<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.660> difference<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.230> your

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
that can make a difference in your

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.740 
that can make a difference in your
aiming<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.799> well<00:03:10.880> yeah<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:12.150> mean<00:03:12.389> that's<00:03:12.510> pretty

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
aiming as well yeah I mean that's pretty

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.280 
aiming as well yeah I mean that's pretty
much<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.500> ops<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.609> know<00:03:14.730> pretty<00:03:14.940> basic<00:03:15.290> most

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
much the ops you know pretty basic most

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.840 
much the ops you know pretty basic most
of<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.410> time<00:03:16.560> one<00:03:16.799> hit<00:03:17.040> kill<00:03:17.310> unless<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.760> hit

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
of the time one hit kill unless you hit

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.309 
of the time one hit kill unless you hit
him<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.120> leg<00:03:18.359> or<00:03:18.540> something<00:03:18.599> which<00:03:19.109> we've

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
him in the leg or something which we've

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.360 
him in the leg or something which we've
all<00:03:19.500> done<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:20.000> hate<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:22.130> it's<00:03:23.130> pretty

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
all done I hate that but it's pretty

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.839 
all done I hate that but it's pretty
much<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.579> one<00:03:23.819> hit<00:03:24.060> kill<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.599> it's<00:03:25.349> definitely

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
much a one hit kill and it's definitely

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.599 
much a one hit kill and it's definitely
you<00:03:26.849> know<00:03:27.859> one<00:03:28.859> of<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.010> most<00:03:29.190> expensive

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
you know one of the most expensive

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.840 
you know one of the most expensive
reasons<00:03:30.150> their<00:03:30.569> weapons<00:03:31.560> for<00:03:31.709> good<00:03:32.340> reason

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.090 

there's<00:03:36.810> pretty<00:03:37.020> much<00:03:37.080> one<00:03:37.410> method<00:03:37.890> you're

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
there's pretty much one method you're

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.670 
there's pretty much one method you're
going<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.280> be<00:03:38.400> using<00:03:38.600> when<00:03:39.600> op<00:03:39.840> aiming<00:03:40.350> and

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
going to be using when op aiming and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.940 
going to be using when op aiming and
that's<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.420> flickering<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.720> wrist<00:03:45.950> maybe

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
that's the flickering of the wrist maybe

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.170 
that's the flickering of the wrist maybe
get<00:03:47.340> a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
get a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.979 
get a
watch<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.879> we'll<00:03:51.879> see<00:03:52.060> how<00:03:52.209> most<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.719> time

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
watch and we'll see how most of the time

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.679 
watch and we'll see how most of the time
it's<00:03:53.379> just<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.709> class<00:03:54.069> like<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:54.760> movement<00:03:55.450> and

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
it's just a class like a movement and

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.660 
it's just a class like a movement and
you<00:03:56.109> just<00:03:56.290> click<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:56.829> right<00:03:57.010> when<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.370> hits

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
you just click it right when it hits

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.599 
you just click it right when it hits
them<00:03:57.819> I<00:03:58.530> do<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.650> course<00:03:59.829> have<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.189> take<00:04:00.400> note

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
them I do of course have to take note

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.309 
them I do of course have to take note
that<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.909> hitboxes<00:04:01.480> while<00:04:01.810> they're<00:04:01.989> running

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
that the hitboxes while they're running

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.580 
that the hitboxes while they're running
are<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:03.040> front<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.400> them<00:04:03.579> non<00:04:04.180> back<00:04:04.510> or<00:04:04.870> on<00:04:05.620> them

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
are in front of them non back or on them

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:19.890 
are in front of them non back or on them
some<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.769> other<00:04:08.889> videos<00:04:18.359> see<00:04:19.359> as<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:19.630> see

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
some of the other videos see as you see

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.529 
some of the other videos see as you see
like<00:04:20.139> you<00:04:20.320> just<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:21.639> can't<00:04:21.669> sit<00:04:22.300> there<00:04:22.330> and

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
like you just you can't sit there and

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.900 
like you just you can't sit there and
think<00:04:22.720> about<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.229> it's<00:04:23.860> just<00:04:24.009> got<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.430> be<00:04:24.550> a

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
think about it it's just got to be a

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.499 
think about it it's just got to be a
reaction<00:04:25.389> like<00:04:25.930> you're<00:04:27.090> after<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.270> while

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
reaction like you're after a while

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.120 
reaction like you're after a while
you're<00:04:28.720> all<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:29.139> goes<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:29.800> don't<00:04:29.949> even

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
you're all just goes that you don't even

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.900 
you're all just goes that you don't even
really<00:04:30.280> think<00:04:30.400> about

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:45.110 

switch<00:04:33.780> right<00:04:34.380> onto<00:04:34.740> them<00:04:43.640> it's<00:04:44.640> not<00:04:44.910> much

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
switch right onto them it's not much

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.330 
switch right onto them it's not much
thought<00:04:45.450> into<00:04:45.590> administrative<00:04:46.590> practice

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
thought into administrative practice

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.660 
thought into administrative practice
really<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.290> see<00:04:49.470> people<00:04:49.650> who<00:04:49.980> are<00:04:50.070> like<00:04:50.280> way

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
really and I see people who are like way

00:04:50.670 --> 00:05:12.469 
really and I see people who are like way
