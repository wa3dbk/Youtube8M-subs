00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.950
 I hope you are very well 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.780
 and in this video we're going to see the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.600
 installation in server version and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.369
 client of the smart moving mode that is 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.470
 this mod that adds many animations 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.590
 new or more realistic to what is the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.599
 minecraft character for it I go 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.849
 to do the installation in the 1.4 points 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.820
 7 and for this I have here the server and the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.579
 minecraft point folder clean of that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.070
 version of minecraft we will need 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.620
 what is the smart moving mode the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.719
 player ip which is a base that comes 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.699
 along with the smart moving and the version 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.109
 the forge be compatible with the 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.040
 minecraft version that in this case 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.050
 is 1.4 points 7 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.210
 as you see here I have what is the mod 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.140
 of the smart moving and mentions that it is for 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.220
 minecraft point 4.6 and I have the player 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.870
 for the 1.4 point 7 as I mentioned in 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.880
 previous videos I do not remember the truth 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.880
 what video but I was talking about what 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.360
 the version of 1.4 point 6 is identical 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.970
 at 1.4 point 7 and this is one of the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.060
 mods that works in both versions that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 it was not updated for 1.4 point 7 but 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.740
 that the version can be used 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.080
 previous and it works perfectly well 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.369
 let's start with the installation 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.979
 first of all we are going to do it in the 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.560
 client folder for this we open the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.110
 minecraft point folder and we go to the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.970
 bit folder we open the file 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.530
 minecraft dot jar we open it with the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.270
 winrar 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.729
 and once we have it open 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.420
 we delete the meta folder that contains 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.150
 this file 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.620
 let's open what is the forge 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.500
 and we copy all the files of our 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.300
 jorge and we put it inside the minecraft 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.270
 point jar 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.070
 we accept and as you see it is 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.370
 replacing all files 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.900
 we are going to close the forge and now the only thing 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.660
 What would be missing would be to open the model player 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.180
 and select the files you have 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.870
 inside and also put them inside the 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.209
 minecraft dot hard we give in accept 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.569
 and we can close then our 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.730
 two files let's go back to the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.560
 folder point to minecraft and here we go to 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.560
 create a folder called mods 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.690
 the force that automatically creates it 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.610
 but for this we need to execute the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.770
 minecraft then one more way 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.680
 simple would be better us creating 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.330
 the folders manually now once 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.000
 that you download the smart file 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.510
 moving will be this compressed file that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.250
 other files will come from it 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.530
 zip point 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.980
 well in several versions since they are 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.840
 different different files for each 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.210
 Minecraft version or for the version 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.950
 server and therefore as right now 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.650
 we are doing the installation in the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.810
 customer let's select this first 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.650
 option that comes here the smart moving 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.959
 for the loader or minecraft for head 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.520
 this is what we need as you see there 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.800
 three files for the version of the 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.959
 client but we need the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.450
 first so let's drag it 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.090
 inside the mods folder 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.819
 and now we are going to close this folder of 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.700
 the main card good dot point 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.920
 main we recorded to close it and at once 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.110
 that we have open the smart file 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.970
 moving we are going to copy the file that 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.819
 will work on our server which is 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.489
 this the smart moving server for 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.130
 minecraft forge then let's copy 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.959
 to the desk those are the only ones 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.209
 two files that we need 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.120
 of the smart moving since the other two 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.440
 they are like bases or prototypes in 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.080
 development for another type of 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.790
 modification we do not need that 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.090
 we only need the mod that 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.190
 work on our server so now 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.620
 that we have then this we are going now to 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.220
 continue with the installation in the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.040
 folder or on the server 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.660
 let's create a new folder to 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.130
 we are going to put inside our 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.490
 server 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.870
 and we are going to open the minecraft file 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.810
 server we open it with the winrar 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.120
 and now we also open what is because 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.359
 We are going to select the for files 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.359
 g 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.530
 and we are going to copy them inside our 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.600
 minecraft file 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.290
 server point 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.960
 let's accept and as you see then 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.600
 I copy the archives of the equal forge 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.700
 we're going to do it with the player 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.830
 we copy all the files and the 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.630
 we put inside the minecraft nyon under 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.360
 server accept 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.850
 and I already copy them so let's close 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.410
 now this and this 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.690
 likewise in the folder of our 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.650
 server let's create a new folder 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.650
 to be called mods 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.650
 and within it we will put the 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.570
 smart moving file for the version 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.120
 of server that is the one that we take 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.240
 before and let's put it inside 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.340
 from the mods folder that way already 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.080
 we have installed what is the mod we are going 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.060
 to execute the service we already have 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.570
 installed what is the mod in our 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.270
 good folder that our server and 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.760
 well here something that changes is that what 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.430
 is the player and vii the smart moving is 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.020
 they need in both versions that is both 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.020
 in the client folder as in the 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.940
 folder on the server so when 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.850
 you download what are the two the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.190
 mods the player and dimensions that is a 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.780
 universal version so that works 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.240
 both in the client version and in 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.310
 that of the server and installs itself 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.920
 way by opening the jar file and 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.530
 putting things inside very similar to 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.000
 as it is done with the forge and in the case 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.470
 of smart mobile, remember 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.960
 only use what 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.550
 the version that corresponds to them in the 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.950
 The client's case will be the version 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.070
 for the ader module and in the case of 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.960
 server will be the version for the forge and 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.750
 those are the only two files that 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.390
 they need as you see here in the window or 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.850
 the server console takes time to start 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.310
 or to appear that is because remember 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.470
 that downloads the forge bookstores the 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.120
 first time we run it once 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.190
 that we have already executed it before 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.860
 will immediately open the console 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.380
 our server as they see on screen already 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.630
 is only generating the world and in 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.640
 When I finish, it will appear that 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.630
 our server is ready for you to 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.520
 other people get into a game in 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.040
 the client's case this we already have 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.040
 installed in the same way as you see here 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.770
 it appears that it's finished it took 35 seconds 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.610
 and you 're ready to be able to 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.470
 add more people to our server 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.570
 so we're going to close everything and that's the 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.580
 installation of this smart mode 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.010
 moving I hope you liked the 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.810
 video if you have any doubt I put it 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.160
 in the comments or in any of the 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.040
 facebook pages 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.660
 so I can help them so that 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.660
 It's everything and we'll see each other until next time
