00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.099
 ah 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.920
 well here we are in a race of 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.140
 mario kart 8 to see how we get 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.730
 so I like quite a lot of f 0 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.709
 basically everything in the f 0 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.410
 I do not know if this map also came out in the f 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.630
 0 original or that is one of more selection 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.130
 some map or something but it's good 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.050
 pretty cool 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.699
 by the way many think is because no 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.939
 you get shortcuts or there are no shortcuts in this 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 dlc yes there are but the problem is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.449
 that you have to catch the many of them 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 with mushrooms those who have hidden me 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.440
 I mean and there is one in particular with maps 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.440
 Ghana I do not remember how the fuck is called 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.350
 that I prefer not to take it or be fucking 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.300
 more than what makes you overtake 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.629
 in general they have put a very chunky drawer 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.190
 in this dlc the truth is quite 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.720
 difficult in fact here is one that is 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.780
 you need a mushroom 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.880
 which is quite had the truth well 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.920
 now in this curve to the right there is no 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.010
 you have seen it now from the right 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.280
 who found a way because that's more 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.020
 easy planets some mushrooms 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.479
 stands out pretty elaborate with rates 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.159
 a lot but yes that I simply 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.140
 calm that when you have to take you 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.440
 one I catch 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.909
 he did not try to risk and stations more 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.190
 well of luxury and we advance a position 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.200
 first I do not know how I do not know when I speak 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.610
 more is when I get the fucking pilot 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.990
 automatic and advanced I do not understand 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.700
 our steps of the games but let's 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.700
 german advance for keeping quiet 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.240
 because it has also been fixed that if 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.659
 you pass by the rose n otan coins I do not know 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.939
 simply with this car 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.569
 and on this map do not know when so 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.460
 I realized that this happened 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:51.880
 it was not coincidence because it is this car 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.520
 with this map a single tlc 0 you 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.380
 we advance not 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.630
 the friend approach me because he has a 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.329
 banana and he's going to let go 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.329
 as soon as he is behind as if he saw it 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.090
 like nothing 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.970
 so I have an approach to a 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.980
 hour 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.980
 doctor, you bounce me 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.370
 we should not 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.370
 Well, no 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.600
 that flies to you a day to me would they come out 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.370
 coins all the time ostia of luck not 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.560
 what bad luck? 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.080
 It happens by God 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.420
 and then turbo subscriber that I have 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.400
 good luck to win but good has 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.720
 good luck nothing guys is that the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.720
 next race of nothing until now 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.480
 can here we are in one that made 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.010
 in mario kart 8 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.239
 new map I think it's the last one that I 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.090
 it remains to teach us and in addition 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.980
 we take advantage we put new vehicle that 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.689
 it's going quite well the truth goes pretty 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.760
 well but they those of cars do not 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.889
 I am'm more of motorcycles and monkeys for 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.220
 do what they can achieve can do 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.320
 what I can good 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.720
 I only left the flames flames 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.720
 teach but I have a vehicle left 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.860
 quite 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.710
 those eight golds that you're worth the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.870
 I'm sorry each one of them, I hope it's almost 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.870
 He is like these always macho 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.570
 a molar level editor I'm 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.150
 thinking that one day there is fiction something 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.810
 so for mario kart I would be infinite the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.810
 fucking day game 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.030
 monsoon 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.510
 good 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.560
 good 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.560
 good is good 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.909
 I can not complain because it's going very well 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.519
 Fuck until I'm not used to 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.920
 carry vehicles or carry cars 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.920
 I saw vehicles worth 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.630
 let's go let's go 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.140
 since I took off the fire hop and in this one 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.340
 of jumping and others 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.590
 you will ask why you do not do it 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.980
 He takes his car and you have to do it to me 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.510
 I like it 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.540
 some people may seem 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.950
 clean I do not know I do not know how much to me I do not 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.380
 look in instruction and nothing 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.490
 simply because I do not already it is 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.110
 used to playing so do it 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.640
 logically that is not something that is 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.010
 not as complicated as he said a lot 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.200
 people but if you do not do it because they do not 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.030
 you know how to jump from left to 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.600
 right, everyone comes out, I believe once 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.550
 once they have a high level you know 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.320
 do it I do not think it costs 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.610
 because what is going in a practical way and 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.610
 it does not cost anything either 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:09.800
 not only that we say he is super kid 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.490
 ridiculous I do not know if I'm a spectator 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.490
 I like it 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.860
 Not if we at least like to count as 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.310
 again this is good 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.140
 I'm like this 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.040
 that bojan disadvantage good I'm going to 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.770
 handicap me the super ventilates 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.260
 if they had to win my way my way 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.430
 way and believe me you can win in 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.430
 way because I earn enough 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.170
 already it has ended already considered 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.750
 just 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:42.020
 the shell and is blown away because he has given 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.280
 I thought that if I wanted the 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.120
 first then I say that he communicated and 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.940
 second and I got that shit but hey 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.350
 third our mom our mom we go 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.350
 the next race guys so far
