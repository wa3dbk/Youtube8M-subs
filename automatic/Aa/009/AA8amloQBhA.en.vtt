00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello to all his desires I you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.840
 find this week so as promised 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.190
 for the opening of boxing deoxys ex 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 I really did not really have any 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.269
 luck on the previous two boxing 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.220
 and on top of that my cellphone 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.310
 it was one so I could not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 movies and finally I had filmed the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.050
 boxing williams and that was not 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.330
 recorded at once but that will only 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 two videos for these pocketbooks 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.000
 may be good but it's already 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.210
 very short videos so good we'll go 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.149
 to something else next week with 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.399
 videos a little bit longer 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.149
 so I hope I'll have something 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.399
 of good in this boxing deoxys boxing that 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:54.840
 is for me the least pretty but it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:01:00.180
 still very nice box of 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.140
 has six ex promo guillet the bdew 82 so 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.549
 we fled the first rice and loga who 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.700
 then follows after six six so pretty 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.950
 pretty ex but I maintain that figure 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.979
 which was called the prettiest code in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.220
 line 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.520
 online code booster and 2nd code in 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.290
 line 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.060
 there was an online code that was 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.650
 slipped on the side good noble victory 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.119
 always obscure explorers is 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.470

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.270
 start as usual by 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.820
 the most recent extension so noble 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:52.530
 victory we had not seen that in core 2 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:55.950

 is gappi rivers and gold to reims she 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.480
 takes and last booster last chance 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.439
 to have a good map because 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.129
 decidedly on the more opaque and the 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:41.700
 I will not have seen anything 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:44.220
 so good it's disappointing cac nea and all 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.500
 delivered quite 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:54.319
 ratatat tadmor exaggerates el nido rhinau and 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.659
 Ibo and rivers in a common padlock 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.819
 and will have neither docking decidedly I have 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.129
 really bad luck right now 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.829
 I believe that French is not for 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.470
 me and I go anyway day 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.120
 basically English but that's 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.669
 true that there really really is no 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.329
 chance just a holographic on this 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:17.930
 box and I had a holographic on 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.880
 each of the two previous boxes so 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.430
 it's not really it's not great after 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.010
 I know that there have been there also 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.530
 boxes without anything at all but also 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.250
 boxes with one or even two ex and 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.919
 scarves so we know the luck cic of 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.900
 chance so we can not always have 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.659
 always have beautiful cards we have 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.610
 still the promo so that's it 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.880
 anyway even pretty cards 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.650
 promo deviation so but here it will be 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.389
 a very small video of not even five 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.520
 minutes I still hope that she 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.120
 will have pleased you despite the big lack of 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.180
 chance that b happening to me right now 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.250
 I hope it will turn away and I will 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.070
 so find out next week I do not 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.190
 do not know yet what I will open m 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.170
 but I think I think it will 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.520
 to please you I wish you a good 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.520
