00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
top hair around the front so we're

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.009

such a good product but it means that I
can<00:00:58.180> direct<00:00:58.600> it<00:00:58.900> directly<00:00:59.619> into<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.070> roots

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
can direct it directly into the roots

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.250 
can direct it directly into the roots
and<00:01:00.519> the<00:01:00.610> mid<00:01:00.790> links<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.449> be<00:01:01.659> quite<00:01:01.900> specific

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
some of that guts in there I mean it

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.610 
some of that guts in there I mean it
actually<00:01:24.090> looks<00:01:24.270> good<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:25.170> their<00:01:25.320> hair<00:01:25.500> from

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
actually looks good with their hair from

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.830 
actually looks good with their hair from
a<00:01:25.770> sensor<00:01:26.130> power<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> side<00:01:27.210> part<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
a sensor power or from the side part it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.210 
a sensor power or from the side part it
doesn't<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.260> matter<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:28.680> could<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.040> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
doesn't really matter it could be that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.150 
doesn't really matter it could be that
this<00:01:29.430> ends<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.730> being<00:01:30.229> flattered<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.710> could<00:01:31.979> be

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
this ends up being flattered it could be

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.310 
this ends up being flattered it could be
that<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.820> take<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.120> for<00:01:33.300> a<00:01:33.360> definite<00:01:33.810> side<00:01:34.080> with

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that we take it for a definite side with

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.530 
that we take it for a definite side with
a<00:01:34.410> backhand<00:01:34.650> side<00:01:34.979> passing<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:36.150> those

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
a backhand side passing in those

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.719 
a backhand side passing in those
circumstances<00:01:37.020> you're<00:01:37.770> much<00:01:38.010> better<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.550> just

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
circumstances you're much better to just

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.230 
circumstances you're much better to just
take<00:01:38.990> everything<00:01:39.990> as<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.740> going<00:01:40.950> back<00:01:41.280> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
take everything as if it's going back so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050 
take everything as if it's going back so
what<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.869> take<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.460> small<00:01:44.460> diamond

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
what I do is I take a small diamond

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.260 
what I do is I take a small diamond
section<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.950> beginning<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.000> can

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
section in the beginning here so you can

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.240 
section in the beginning here so you can
see<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.410> way<00:01:49.530> through<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.009> going<00:01:50.160> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
see all the way through and I'm going to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
see all the way through and I'm going to
have<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.640> roller<00:01:50.940> sit<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.630> its<00:01:51.899> own<00:01:52.080> base<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
have this roller sit on its own base I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.780 
have this roller sit on its own base I
take<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:53.880> around<00:01:54.330> about<00:01:54.920> 45<00:01:55.920> degree<00:01:56.280> angle

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
take it up around about 45 degree angle

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.260 
take it up around about 45 degree angle
and<00:01:56.970> then<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.410> put<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.420> hot<00:02:00.420> rollers

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
and then I'm going to put in hot rollers

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.370 
and then I'm going to put in hot rollers
these<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.420> great<00:02:03.570> because<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.899> actually<00:02:04.080> do

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
these are great because they actually do

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.280 
these are great because they actually do
heat<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:04.830> very<00:02:04.890> quickly<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.640> also<00:02:06.540> we've<00:02:07.259> got

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
heat up very quickly and also we've got

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.660 
heat up very quickly and also we've got
dual<00:02:07.680> voltage<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.840> compact<00:02:09.840> case

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
dual voltage so they have a compact case

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.040 
dual voltage so they have a compact case
for<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.790> be<00:02:11.970> able<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> travel<00:02:12.480> with<00:02:12.630> so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
for you to be able to travel with so

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.110 
for you to be able to travel with so
just<00:02:13.110> make<00:02:13.440> sure<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.370> ends<00:02:14.700> are<00:02:14.850> clean

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
just make sure all of the ends are clean

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.690 
just make sure all of the ends are clean
once<00:02:15.810> you've<00:02:15.989> done<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:18.230> secure<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
once you've done that just secure the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.660 
once you've done that just secure the
pins<00:02:21.090> now<00:02:22.019> when<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.350> move<00:02:22.500> back<00:02:22.560> again<00:02:23.280> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
pins now when you move back again you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.360 
pins now when you move back again you
can<00:02:23.700> see<00:02:24.030> where<00:02:24.269> your<00:02:24.450> diamond<00:02:24.930> starts<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
can see where your diamond starts the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.340 
can see where your diamond starts the
next<00:02:26.519> one<00:02:26.760> behind<00:02:27.090> sits<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.720> exactly<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.320> same

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
next one behind sits in exactly the same

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.650 
next one behind sits in exactly the same
way<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.519> reason<00:02:29.880> for<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.630> that

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
way so the reason for this is that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.570 
way so the reason for this is that
you're<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.110> get<00:02:31.260> no<00:02:31.500> marks<00:02:31.980> whatsoever

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
you're going to get no marks whatsoever

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.710 
you're going to get no marks whatsoever
because<00:02:32.730> everything<00:02:33.120> will<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.390> blend

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
because everything will just blend

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.920 
because everything will just blend
totally<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.519> as<00:02:35.790> much<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.000> possible<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.720> these

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
totally so as much as possible on these

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.110 
totally so as much as possible on these
three<00:02:37.650> or<00:02:37.739> four<00:02:37.920> sections<00:02:38.400> at<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.610> top<00:02:38.910> if<00:02:39.090> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
three or four sections at the top if you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.660 
three or four sections at the top if you
can<00:02:39.360> try<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.660> keep<00:02:39.810> them<00:02:40.019> with<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.680> section

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
can try and keep them with this section

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.400 
can try and keep them with this section
in<00:02:41.790> pattern<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.540> rest<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.930> doesn't<00:02:43.080> matter

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
in pattern the rest of it doesn't matter

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.009 
in pattern the rest of it doesn't matter
anywhere<00:02:43.920> near<00:02:44.100> as<00:02:44.250> much<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.570> does<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
anywhere near as much but it does on the

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.670 
anywhere near as much but it does on the
top<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.470> again<00:02:46.790> we're<00:02:47.790> holding<00:02:48.180> out<00:02:48.680> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
top so again we're holding out and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.130 
top so again we're holding out and
they're<00:02:49.920> going<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.100> pop<00:02:50.280> those<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.930> is

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
they're going to pop those in this is

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.870 
they're going to pop those in this is
the<00:02:52.260> best<00:02:52.440> angle<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:53.040> hold<00:02:53.250> her<00:02:53.459> because<00:02:53.730> then

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
the best angle to hold her because then

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.100 
the best angle to hold her because then
you're<00:02:54.000> going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> find<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:54.570> going<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.810> sit

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
you're going to find it's going to sit

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.500 
you're going to find it's going to sit
back<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.590> its<00:02:55.739> own<00:02:55.860> base<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.910> hold<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.390> up

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
back on its own base if you hold it up

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.060 
back on its own base if you hold it up
too<00:02:57.780> high<00:02:58.049> what<00:02:58.410> you're<00:02:58.590> going<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.830> do<00:02:58.980> is

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
too high what you're going to do is

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.830 
too high what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.400> stretch<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.910> roots<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
you're going to stretch the roots to the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.940 
you're going to stretch the roots to the
point<00:03:01.140> where<00:03:01.260> you're<00:03:01.380> not<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.739> get<00:03:01.860> an

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
point where you're not going to get an

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.360 
point where you're not going to get an
even<00:03:03.230> curl<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.410> comes<00:03:04.620> forward<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.220> then

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
even curl that comes forward and then

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.759 
even curl that comes forward and then
goes<00:03:05.579> bad

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.319 

though<00:03:10.769> it's<00:03:11.189> quite<00:03:11.340> important<00:03:11.879> that<00:03:11.909> we<00:03:12.120> take

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
though it's quite important that we take

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.559 
though it's quite important that we take
at<00:03:12.480> least<00:03:12.599> these<00:03:12.840> four<00:03:12.900> sections<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:14.099> these<00:03:14.969> in

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
at least these four sections in these in

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.880 
at least these four sections in these in
this<00:03:16.140> diamond<00:03:16.439> faceted<00:03:17.400> pattern<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.900> put

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
this diamond faceted pattern so put

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.599 
this diamond faceted pattern so put
those<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.280> make<00:03:20.519> sure<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.879> ends<00:03:21.239> are<00:03:21.359> nicely

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
those in make sure the ends are nicely

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.240 
those in make sure the ends are nicely
smooth<00:03:23.609> round<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.079> then<00:03:25.230> sits<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.889> its<00:03:26.069> own

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
smooth round and it then sits on its own

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:40.949 
smooth round and it then sits on its own
base

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.530 

okay<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:41.980> there's<00:03:42.159> the<00:03:42.310> last<00:03:42.489> roller<00:03:42.819> let

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
okay so there's the last roller let

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.759 
okay so there's the last roller let
those<00:03:43.659> set<00:03:43.959> for<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.200> few<00:03:44.379> minutes

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.500 

okay<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:52.430> rollers<00:03:52.730> have<00:03:52.760> cooled<00:03:53.090> down<00:03:53.150> so

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
okay so the rollers have cooled down so

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.229 
okay so the rollers have cooled down so
we<00:03:53.599> can<00:03:53.720> start<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.019> bring<00:03:54.200> those<00:03:54.379> out<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:58.239> can

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
we can start to bring those out I can

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.890 
we can start to bring those out I can
take<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.690> directly<00:04:00.440> from<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.970> center<00:04:02.420> and

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
take it directly from the center and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.479 
take it directly from the center and
start<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.410> give<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.709> that<00:04:03.739> slightly<00:04:04.310> more

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
start to give it that slightly more

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.479 
start to give it that slightly more
retro<00:04:05.180> feeling<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.140> just<00:04:06.410> into<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.950> crown<00:04:07.220> I

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
retro feeling so just into the crown I

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.270 
retro feeling so just into the crown I
can<00:04:07.730> actually<00:04:07.849> take<00:04:08.209> some<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.569> this<00:04:08.690> away<00:04:09.280> and

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
can actually take some of this away and

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.000 
can actually take some of this away and
I<00:04:10.400> can<00:04:10.610> just<00:04:10.849> take<00:04:11.660> some<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.290> those<00:04:12.470> sections

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
I can just take some of those sections

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.890 
I can just take some of those sections
are<00:04:13.160> beginning<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.580> either<00:04:13.670> backcomb<00:04:14.209> it<00:04:14.420> or

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
are beginning to either backcomb it or

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.870 
are beginning to either backcomb it or
even<00:04:15.200> just<00:04:15.379> use<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.650> brush<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.160> back<00:04:16.340> rushing

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
even just use a brush and back rushing

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.750 
even just use a brush and back rushing
so<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:17.690> can<00:04:17.959> see<00:04:18.169> already<00:04:18.530> we're<00:04:19.130> creating

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
so you can see already we're creating

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.240 
so you can see already we're creating
something<00:04:20.479> there<00:04:20.810> now<00:04:21.019> how<00:04:21.440> much<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.919> that<00:04:21.949> you

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
something there now how much of that you

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.740 
something there now how much of that you
want<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.550> create<00:04:22.669> is<00:04:22.820> up<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.300> can<00:04:23.600> put

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
want to create is up to you you can put

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.680 
want to create is up to you you can put
more<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.229> that<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:26.150> can<00:04:26.330> then<00:04:26.450> start

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
more of that in and you can then start

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.500 
more of that in and you can then start
to<00:04:26.780> distress<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.530> afterwards<00:04:28.160> or<00:04:28.340> not<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:29.330> can

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
to distress it afterwards or not you can

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.310 
to distress it afterwards or not you can
even<00:04:29.840> actually<00:04:30.260> spray<00:04:31.060> some<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.360> if<00:04:32.960> you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
even actually spray some of this if you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.340 
even actually spray some of this if you
want<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:34.400> can<00:04:34.430> also<00:04:34.820> still<00:04:35.660> take<00:04:35.960> some<00:04:36.229> of

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
want and you can also still take some of

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.159 
want and you can also still take some of
this<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.880> actually<00:04:37.880> pin<00:04:38.450> all<00:04:38.570> that<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:38.930> and

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
this and actually pin all that in and

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:53.200 
this and actually pin all that in and
then<00:04:39.860> use<00:04:40.340> some<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.229> sides<00:04:43.270> again

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.110 

to<00:04:53.840> lock<00:04:54.050> that<00:04:54.259> in<00:04:54.319> so<00:04:54.889> by<00:04:55.340> doing<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:55.699> you're

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
to lock that in so by doing that you're

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.879 
to lock that in so by doing that you're
then<00:04:56.300> really<00:04:56.750> just<00:04:56.990> starting<00:04:57.289> to<00:04:57.319> get<00:04:57.530> some<00:04:57.590> of

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
then really just starting to get some of

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.680 
then really just starting to get some of
that<00:04:57.919> movement<00:04:58.310> through<00:04:59.180> here

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
that movement through here

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.270 
that movement through here
that's<00:04:59.930> tighter<00:05:00.199> and<00:05:00.440> then<00:05:00.530> create<00:05:00.889> that<00:05:00.919> kind

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
that's tighter and then create that kind

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.080 
that's tighter and then create that kind
of<00:05:01.370> half-up<00:05:01.880> half-down<00:05:02.349> feeling<00:05:03.349> so<00:05:03.530> by<00:05:03.680> just

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
of half-up half-down feeling so by just

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.159 
of half-up half-down feeling so by just
gripping<00:05:05.090> in<00:05:05.330> there<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:06.069> then<00:05:07.069> carrying<00:05:07.580> on

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
gripping in there and then carrying on

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.529 
gripping in there and then carrying on
with<00:05:09.169> our<00:05:09.349> sections<00:05:10.190> we<00:05:10.789> can<00:05:10.970> start<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.389> get

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
with our sections we can start to get

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:22.540 
with our sections we can start to get
that<00:05:11.870> kind<00:05:12.169> of<00:05:12.259> shape<00:05:12.759> going<00:05:13.759> on

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.930 

a<00:05:23.470> munch<00:05:24.470> you've<00:05:24.680> got<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:25.040> security<00:05:25.820> of

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
a munch you've got that security of

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.660 
a munch you've got that security of
everything<00:05:26.390> being<00:05:26.600> in<00:05:27.220> it's<00:05:28.220> very<00:05:28.430> easy

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
everything being in it's very easy

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:38.650 
everything being in it's very easy
lenses<00:05:29.210> just<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.920> mess<00:05:30.920> up<00:05:31.160> some<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.670> those

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.560 

so<00:05:39.200> I'm<00:05:39.320> putting<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.680> last<00:05:40.330> final<00:05:41.330> touches

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
so I'm putting the last final touches

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.570 
so I'm putting the last final touches
I'm<00:05:41.930> using<00:05:42.140> so<00:05:42.410> a<00:05:42.440> mixture<00:05:42.710> of<00:05:42.890> fine<00:05:43.130> pins<00:05:43.460> just

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
I'm using so a mixture of fine pins just

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.450 
I'm using so a mixture of fine pins just
to<00:05:43.820> get<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.380> silhouette<00:05:45.380> just<00:05:45.680> perfect<00:05:46.310> but

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
to get that silhouette just perfect but

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.790 
to get that silhouette just perfect but
it's<00:05:46.970> as<00:05:47.210> I<00:05:47.330> said<00:05:47.390> before<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.960> idea<00:05:48.350> is<00:05:48.530> is

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
it's as I said before the idea is is

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.920 
it's as I said before the idea is is
that<00:05:48.980> you've<00:05:49.160> got<00:05:49.310> something<00:05:49.760> underneath<00:05:50.210> but

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
that you've got something underneath but

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.080 
that you've got something underneath but
it's<00:05:51.110> quite<00:05:51.350> firm<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:52.010> giving<00:05:52.700> you<00:05:52.880> that

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
it's quite firm and giving you that

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.850 
it's quite firm and giving you that
Heights<00:05:53.480> and<00:05:53.720> that<00:05:53.840> volume<00:05:54.080> but<00:05:54.740> then

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
Heights and that volume but then

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.530 
Heights and that volume but then
everything<00:05:55.460> else<00:05:55.580> over<00:05:55.910> it

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
everything else over it

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.300 
everything else over it
whether<00:05:56.720> that<00:05:56.900> be<00:05:56.960> shorter<00:05:57.560> layers<00:05:57.770> or

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
whether that be shorter layers or

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.370 
whether that be shorter layers or
whether<00:05:58.550> it<00:05:58.670> be<00:05:58.790> waves<00:05:59.090> or<00:05:59.540> whatever<00:05:59.810> just

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
whether it be waves or whatever just

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.700 
whether it be waves or whatever just
becomes<00:06:00.890> slightly<00:06:02.110> almost<00:06:03.110> just<00:06:03.380> caught

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
becomes slightly almost just caught

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.240 
becomes slightly almost just caught
that's<00:06:04.280> really<00:06:04.640> part<00:06:04.850> of<00:06:05.030> the<00:06:05.180> charm<00:06:05.480> of<00:06:05.690> it<00:06:06.250> so

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
that's really part of the charm of it so
