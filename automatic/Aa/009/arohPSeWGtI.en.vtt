 we Italians are good at filling the 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.420
 table in manner 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.000
 then passed and 15 the consequence of 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.890
 leftovers that sometimes are everyday 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.500
 later we wonder but this 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.720
 we do in the novels and here we are more 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.470
 hit some recipes let's start with 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.620
 that of the panettone demonstrate the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.170
 missing ingredients we have 500 grams 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.290
 of advanced bread cut cooper piffer 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.550
 and try to do it like this then hover 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.340
 we have rooms to soak panettone 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.350
 if you want you can put the quantity to 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.620
 your pleasure but you can also choose 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.769
 not to put it to those who do not like it then 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.950
 always with regard to the aggravation 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.240
 of Christmas I have taken pains 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.730
 advanced that I have advanced the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.600
 refrigerator if you want the goals 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.450
 and not too tightly tied to slices 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.090
 here we have in the butter to grease it 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.700
 frank and almost to get we have ed 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.650
 to vanillin 1 these divine nature 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.960
 just 2 tablespoons of teleuropa e sugar 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.110
 half a glass as you see 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.290
 we all have simple ingredients to 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.310
 find and also how you say enough 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.740
 cheap because if it wouldn't make sense 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.190
 recycle and then take this away 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.350
 equipment of which 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.440
 you must have that practically one 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:57.320
 cake pan and possibly non-stick from 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:59.810
 24 cm here it is the right one e 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.909
 a basin 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:09.970
 plastic ok we are going to start a 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:14.650
 run on the plate we take some butter 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.909
 we butter the peter well 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.909
 in tunisia on fire 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.920
 the wall would be better 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.580
 ok made place instead of half 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.740
 let's go get the ride 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.380
 wrong previously however we have 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.380
 place in the cake pan 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.810
 they crush it for good 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.810
 the list node 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.290
 Hello 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.700
 as we know we create 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.800
 a month 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.270
 now we take the 1 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.599
 let's go to bathe 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.430
 valid 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.640
 as we have already said it is not 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.640
 essential 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.870
 if you don't have it at home 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.709
 let's say the nib 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:04.850
 after that we go to put the xa 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.850
 overpower 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.660
 here also the quantity you can decide 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:20.030
 you I have made a real can put 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.820
 two apples 2 for and from the other fruit 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.010
 always the one 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.100
 here's how it looks is not 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.300
 now on our plate we go to 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:36.100
 prepared by you but we never do why 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:38.130
 with eye shadows and eggs in the containers of 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.130
 plastic 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.040
 add the sugar 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.090
 add the gasoline 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.320
 and finally the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.930
 let's start with the fruit to try to 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.830
 mix all the ingredients without 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.830
 form lumps 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:31.070
 when to press liquid and not to stop 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.370
 from once 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.290
 pour the mixture is a cake with totti 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.900
 then tackles to bake then now 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.150
 let's take it in the oven at 200 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.160
 degrees for about 20 minutes 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.410
 they form a combed if you have a bottom 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.540
 ventilated at home you can decrease the 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.860
 time and even a little temperature 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.830
 so we can go to 170 for 12 13 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.180
 minutes ok 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.020
 here we have baked 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.900
 guilt this is what it will become 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.669
 this connector we did the 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.500
 form that I recommend you leave it 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:16.600
 rest for at least 5 10 minutes then 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.150
 these doses are cut into place 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.970
 for about five six people once 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.470
 cut if you put it on your plate like 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.280
 I dusted myself with sugar 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:30.910
 or if you have a mint leaf 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.330
 a mind and serve again ends good 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.330
 appetite to all
