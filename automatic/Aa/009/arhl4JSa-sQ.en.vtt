times 1 2 3 4 and the next one and we
will<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.650> left<00:01:05.159> 3<00:01:05.519> times<00:01:05.790> 1<00:01:06.360> 2<00:01:06.750> 3<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.119> next

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
will go left 3 times 1 2 3 and the next

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.580 
will go left 3 times 1 2 3 and the next
one<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.570> we'll<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.049> right<00:01:10.290> twice<00:01:10.650> 1<00:01:11.130> 2<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.590> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
one and we'll go right twice 1 2 and the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.210 
one and we'll go right twice 1 2 and the
final<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.430> go<00:01:14.610> left<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.479> two<00:01:15.840> three<00:01:16.470> four

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
final one we go left one two three four

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.210 
final one we go left one two three four
times<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.350> first<00:01:19.770> part<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
times and there we go first part of the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.350 
times and there we go first part of the
puzzle<00:01:20.400> solved<00:01:22.970> continue<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.210> have

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
puzzle solved continue and so we have

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.530 
puzzle solved continue and so we have
another<00:01:27.600> puzzle<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.939> again<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.270> one's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
another puzzle here now again this one's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.130 
another puzzle here now again this one's
in<00:01:30.750> four<00:01:31.439> parts<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> soo<00:01:33.150> min<00:01:33.329> there<00:01:33.540> again<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
in four parts so soo min there again and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.429 
in four parts so soo min there again and
so<00:01:35.100> again<00:01:35.600> starting<00:01:36.600> from<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> farthest<00:01:37.259> one

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so again starting from the farthest one

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
so again starting from the farthest one
out<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.310> left<00:01:38.579> twice<00:01:38.939> 1<00:01:39.570> 2<00:01:40.140> next<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
out we go left twice 1 2 next one in to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.830 
out we go left twice 1 2 next one in to
the<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.570> once<00:01:43.100> then<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> right<00:01:44.909> 5<00:01:45.479> times

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the right once then to the right 5 times

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.480 
the right once then to the right 5 times
1<00:01:46.380> 2<00:01:46.860> 3<00:01:46.890> 4<00:01:47.700> 5<00:01:48.860> then<00:01:50.479> we'll<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.020> right

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
1 2 3 4 5 then we'll go to the right

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
1 2 3 4 5 then we'll go to the right
five<00:01:53.490> times<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> next<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.630> 1<00:01:54.960> 2<00:01:55.470> 3<00:01:55.770> 4<00:01:56.329> 5<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
five times on the next one 1 2 3 4 5 and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840 
five times on the next one 1 2 3 4 5 and
now<00:01:58.350> basically<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.040> backtrack<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.700> go

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
now basically have to backtrack and go

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.649 
now basically have to backtrack and go
back<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> second<00:02:02.399> ring<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.939> go<00:02:03.119> left<00:02:03.360> 5

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
back to to the second ring and go left 5

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.290 
back to to the second ring and go left 5
times<00:02:03.960> 1<00:02:04.409> 2<00:02:04.829> 3<00:02:05.159> 4<00:02:05.969> 5<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.310> there<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.459> go<00:02:08.489> second

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
times 1 2 3 4 5 and there you go second

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.540 
times 1 2 3 4 5 and there you go second
part<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> puzzle<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.110> done

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
part of the puzzle is done

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.300 
part of the puzzle is done
low<00:02:12.480> game<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.590> third<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:19.310> again

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
low game going on to the third so again

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.410 
low game going on to the third so again
starting<00:02:20.850> at<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.480> farthest<00:02:21.960> one<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.500> I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
starting at the the farthest one out I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.290 
starting at the the farthest one out I
will<00:02:24.420> go<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.870> right<00:02:25.080> once<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:27.090> will

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
will go to the right once then we will

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
is just giving you some texts it's going

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.490 
is just giving you some texts it's going
to<00:03:00.420> do<00:03:00.570> another<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> chess<00:03:01.500> pieces

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
to do another one of the chess pieces

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.380 
to do another one of the chess pieces
this<00:03:04.500> one<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.190> clue<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.910> work<00:03:06.060> force

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
this one the clue is the work force

increases<00:03:06.690> brother<00:03:07.200> right<00:03:07.440> beside<00:03:07.800> brother

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
increases brother right beside brother

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.830 
increases brother right beside brother
so<00:03:08.730> they<00:03:08.820> would<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.120> talking<00:03:09.480> about<00:03:09.570> another

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
so they would be talking about another

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.680 
so they would be talking about another
pond<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:11.340> we're<00:03:11.520> going<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.700> move<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.090> up<00:03:12.240> two

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
pond so we're going to move it up two

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.750 
pond so we're going to move it up two
spaces<00:03:12.990> right<00:03:13.500> beside<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.010> other<00:03:14.130> one<00:03:16.760> okay

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
spaces right beside the other one okay

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.380 
spaces right beside the other one okay
and<00:03:18.570> then<00:03:19.140> we<00:03:19.260> have<00:03:19.380> another<00:03:20.000> quarantine<00:03:21.000> zone

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390
