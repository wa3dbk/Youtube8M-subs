00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.750
 this chapter 18 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.170
 specifically personalism 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
 hereinafter 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.590
 appeared 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.029
 it was the pair 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.029
 tell us of Elijah 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.439
 the town had left God 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.310
 the town had abandoned the law 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.819
 the town had abandoned the house of God 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.350
 the town did not materialize 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.720
 To worship 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.400
 exalts 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.450
 and recognize 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.950
 the manor 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.240
 the 6 3% of our god 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.700
 but rather 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.790
 they had gone astray 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.800
 they had given him the 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.900
 miss God 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.220
 and he had felt a times 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.930
 of gods 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.400
 pagans 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.080
 gods 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 they worshiped pagan nations 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.870
 the sad thing is that this town 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.920
 had been 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.840
 he pointed 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.970
 in the word of God 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 and not only had he been taught 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 experienced the power of god 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.810
 In their lifes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.140
 as I said 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.330
 god through the prophet 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.860
 Jeremiah 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 this town has done two parts first 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.210
 they have left 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.390
 goodbye 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.960
 source 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.580
 of living water 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.430
 second nested finish broken cisterns 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.310
 robotic systems that do not retain love 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.970
 this town had done is highly 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.630
 they had left the real reasons 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.220
 to the god who had taken them 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.940
 of slavery 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.390
 and that he had given them 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.150
 place of crime 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.540
 in the land of Canaan 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.579
 I knew it 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.819
 filled with blessings 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.419
 and has put as you say 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.679
 the prophet isaiah 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.679
 I had placed them on the wood 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.209
 and had removed all the stones that thorny 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.039
 he had raised security measures 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.789
 and God 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.589
 there raised an actor 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.119
 he made a letter 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.849
 and I hoped that it should be Cubans 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.529
 and they gave in cuba wild 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:41.670
 and the lament of God through the prophet is 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.779
 What else would I have done to my vineyard? 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.749
 quito 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.889
 noticinela 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.919
 who was what I'm missing 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.219
 like God 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.789
 abed cho 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.719
 for this town 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.709
 a being all 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.779
 was necessary 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.449
 I chose them 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.149
 I raised them 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.069
 he escaped to messi 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.199
 I sent to the rain 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.209
 the early rain the late rain 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.369
 I was waiting to say that the equestrian tower 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.189
 he talked about the vigilance 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.509
 of the protection of the security of all 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.369
 and then he had made a dunghill 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:30.009
 the dakar was done 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.419
 where they were collected game 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.739
 the plays 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.869
 the man 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.909
 there was that product to extract the wine 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.619
 the Lord says 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.069
 Esperanto active that days in Cuba 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.069
 I want is to play wild 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.329
 bitter 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.869
 that is 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.749
 I want to see you soon 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.739
 who should not have 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.049
 they gave the fruit as if they had been 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.489
 abandoned 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.379
 ibiza have been sown for making 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.819
 the pp something wild 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.499
 it's probably true 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:16.399
 and the Lord would have abandoned them and never been aware of them 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.299
 it was studied 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.769
 logical that arose external 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.300
 but in power in the case of the people 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.590
 but yesterday 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.580
 God was there 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.960
 god was waiting god what the authentic god 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.259
 projection 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.520
 with everything 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.139
 but the town 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.090
 he answered me wrong 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.010
 the people did not please God 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.659
 the town in between 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.620
 the fruit that god expected 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.889
 yes what I say 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.830
 I enjoy against de iu 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.650
 that idea is that the fruit of the flesh 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.840
 the fruit of his sin 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.550
 that result 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.559
 or loss 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.659
 is the result of having abandoned said 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.939
 that's why they gave a wild fruit 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.319
 says Mr. 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.960
 he had to remove the fence 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.809
 and all and above all the mercy 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:18.959
 kisses adversaries of his friends said and I know then as presences 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.849
 early to tread country
