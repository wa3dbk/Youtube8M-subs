00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.259
 When the sun is shining on the Mölltaler Glacier 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.809
 Carinthia are the first athletes 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.120
 ready for training 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.660
 also the alpine snowboard 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.580
 National team 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.580
 with the sonthofen in selina jörg 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.810
 getting up early is hard but it 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:30.160
 is it worth it because there is an important one 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:33.190
 Of course, the goal in winter was really nice 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.750
 but also every day that passed afterwards 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.520
 was just so annoying because you 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.350
 The name has actually been changed 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 and what on which day also happen 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.550
 can and of course I want the two 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.120
 competition days at the games everything 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.850
 put 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.220
 and this time possibly with a medal 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.170
 go home at her second 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.930
 participation in Olympic Games after 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.550
 vancouver 2010 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.230
 since the beginning of may are the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.430
 athletes in the diverse 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.980
 preparation for the olympic season 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.589
 It was an extremely tough summer for the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 26 year old 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.610
 I have my bachelor thesis alongside 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 written and finished my studies and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.760
 from that it was partly real 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.970
 stressful because two units a day 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.950
 were the necessary regeneration phases and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.290
 then sitting at the desk so there was 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.720
 one night or another was on 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.910
 every event in the program ends 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.220
 So first with international 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.000
 Management of sport is now in 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.610
 foreground 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.770
 Four German women can work together 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.140
 drive to sochi and there in 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.090
 Giant Slalom go to the start 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.620
 team is very important for everyone 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.330
 that he has a strong team in the know 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.970
 we complement each other perfectly 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.290
 training we know we have strong 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.110
 People in the team against whom we compete 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.290
 and of course that is for one 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.840
 personally it is extremely important and at 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.300
 the olympic winter games 2014 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.710
