growing<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.280> me<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.670> think<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:55.020> this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
growing a lot on me I think that this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.979 
growing a lot on me I think that this
mask<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.860> King<00:00:56.219> daddy<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.879> h2o<00:00:57.420> s<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
mask is the King daddy of all h2o s and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.330 
mask is the King daddy of all h2o s and
a<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.039> underrated<00:00:59.370> mask<00:01:00.469> however<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
a very underrated mask however there is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.660 
a very underrated mask however there is
one<00:01:02.370> problem<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> mass<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.369> will<00:01:05.369> not

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
one problem with the mass that will not

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.719 
one problem with the mass that will not
ever<00:01:05.970> fly<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.720> me<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.979> weathering

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
ever fly with me like the weathering

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.250 
ever fly with me like the weathering
eventually<00:01:09.540> did<00:01:11.180> as<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.420> size<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> mask

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
eventually did as the size of the mask

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.070 
eventually did as the size of the mask
it's<00:01:13.950> 22<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> half<00:01:15.180> inches<00:01:15.570> while<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.900> my

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
it's 22 and a half inches while on my

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.520 
it's 22 and a half inches while on my
head<00:01:16.430> it's<00:01:17.430> 23<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> half<00:01:18.450> inches<00:01:20.930> so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
head it's 23 and a half inches so

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.500 
head it's 23 and a half inches so
that's<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.310> only<00:01:24.460> problem<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:25.000> have<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.330> mass

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
that's the only problem I have the mass

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.430 
that's the only problem I have the mass
that<00:01:25.540> will<00:01:25.900> not<00:01:26.080> grow<00:01:26.650> on<00:01:26.860> me<00:01:27.040> over<00:01:27.280> time<00:01:28.440> is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
that will not grow on me over time is

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.160 
that will not grow on me over time is
that<00:01:29.530> something<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.400> can't<00:01:30.640> fix<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:31.210> can't<00:01:32.080> do

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
that something you can't fix I can't do

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.470 
that something you can't fix I can't do
anything<00:01:32.320> about<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:32.860> this<00:01:33.700> must<00:01:33.940> be<00:01:34.120> mostly

as<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:51.490> can<00:01:51.610> see<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.240> hood<00:01:52.480> is<00:01:52.750> way<00:01:52.990> smaller

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
as you can see the hood is way smaller

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.609 
as you can see the hood is way smaller
and<00:01:53.890> definitely<00:01:54.460> nothing<00:01:55.330> like<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:56.350> stock

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619

the<00:01:59.740> size<00:02:00.010> is<00:02:00.460> nothing<00:02:00.790> like<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.000> stock<00:02:01.240> pic

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510
