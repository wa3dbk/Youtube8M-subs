00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
two now we're going to to go up against

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.359 
two now we're going to to go up against
torch<00:00:19.830> with<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.340> also<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> curve<00:00:21.330> 8530<00:00:22.369> so

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
torch with and also a curve 8530 so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.560 
torch with and also a curve 8530 so
we're<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.670> go<00:00:23.730> ahead<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.970> pull<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
we're going to go ahead and pull the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:54.510 
we're going to go ahead and pull the
batteries<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.289> these<00:00:25.500> guys

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.850 

all<00:00:55.300> right<00:00:55.540> temp<00:00:55.900> to<00:00:56.020> try<00:00:56.200> and<00:00:56.350> sell<00:00:56.530> all<00:00:56.710> these

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
all right temp to try and sell all these

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.940 
all right temp to try and sell all these
at<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.070> same<00:00:57.160> exact<00:00:57.880> time<00:00:58.470> so<00:00:59.470> hopefully<00:00:59.650> we

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
at the same exact time so hopefully we

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:12.230 
at the same exact time so hopefully we
can<00:01:00.570> get

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.789 

see<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.290> torch<00:01:14.810> 9800<00:01:15.810> already<00:01:16.110> started<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
see the torch 9800 already started to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.260 
see the torch 9800 already started to
boot<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.320> see<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.350> starting<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:21.060> go

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
boot up and see you starting to to go

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.999 
boot up and see you starting to to go
there<00:01:22.549> of<00:01:23.549> course<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.439> storm<00:01:25.439> two<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
there of course the storm two in the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.139 
there of course the storm two in the
curve<00:01:26.399> 8530<00:01:27.049> just<00:01:28.049> now<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:29.070> about<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.670> load

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
curve 8530 just now are about to load

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:39.050 
curve 8530 just now are about to load
the<00:01:31.280> blackberry<00:01:32.280> screen

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.580 

and<00:01:40.060> all<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.240> these<00:01:40.510> actually<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.290> pretty

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
and all of these actually have pretty

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.770 
and all of these actually have pretty
much<00:01:41.650> exact<00:01:42.280> same<00:01:42.630> applications<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
much exact same applications and of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.690 
much exact same applications and of
course<00:01:47.050> they<00:01:47.230> have<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:48.930> same<00:01:50.100> data<00:01:51.100> on<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.580> as

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
course they have the same data on it as

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.360 
course they have the same data on it as
well<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:53.140> not<00:01:53.410> too<00:01:53.560> much<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.860> different<00:01:54.250> from

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
well so not too much is different from

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.030 
well so not too much is different from
each<00:01:54.550> device<00:01:54.970> so<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:55.930> should<00:01:56.140> be<00:01:56.170> loaded<00:01:56.560> about

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
each device so it should be loaded about

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.450 
each device so it should be loaded about
the<00:01:57.190> same<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:58.150> know<00:01:58.210> memory<00:01:58.660> and<00:01:59.110> whatnot<00:01:59.560> but

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
the same you know memory and whatnot but

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.390 
the same you know memory and whatnot but
as<00:02:00.550> you<00:02:00.670> can<00:02:00.760> see<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.060> torch<00:02:01.360> 9800<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.400> just

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
as you can see the torch 9800 is just

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:20.600 
as you can see the torch 9800 is just
fly<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.300> buy<00:02:04.480> right<00:02:04.930> now

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.210 

excuse<00:02:21.360> storm<00:02:21.690> two<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.170> curve<00:02:22.380> 8530<00:02:22.740> are

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
excuse storm two and the curve 8530 are

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.130 
excuse storm two and the curve 8530 are
pretty<00:02:23.760> much<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:23.970> same<00:02:24.440> same<00:02:25.440> level<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
pretty much the same same level but the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.870 
pretty much the same same level but the
torch<00:02:28.140> which<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.680> killing<00:02:29.370> them<00:02:29.490> right<00:02:29.670> now

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.570 

and<00:02:35.120> there<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.870> go<00:02:35.900> see<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.560> ATT<00:02:37.370> boot<00:02:37.820> screen

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
and there we go see the ATT boot screen

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.660 
and there we go see the ATT boot screen
of<00:02:40.580> course<00:02:40.880> is<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> little<00:02:41.300> bit<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:42.670> little

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
of course is a little bit of a little

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.100 
of course is a little bit of a little
bit<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.850> lag<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.270> blue<00:02:44.480> screen<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:44.900> there<00:02:45.020> you

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
bit of lag on blue screen but there you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.180 
bit of lag on blue screen but there you
go<00:02:45.190> mm<00:02:46.190> torch<00:02:46.550> on<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.730> hundred<00:02:47.770> just<00:02:48.770> finally

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
go mm torch on a hundred just finally

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.980 
go mm torch on a hundred just finally
booted<00:02:49.370> up<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:51.170> 8530<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.460> storm<00:02:52.910> 2<00:02:53.120> 9550

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
booted up and the 8530 in storm 2 9550

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.200 
booted up and the 8530 in storm 2 9550
or<00:02:54.910> leave<00:02:55.910> in<00:02:56.060> there<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.610> just<00:02:58.790> goes<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.150> show

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
or leave in there so just goes to show

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.350 
or leave in there so just goes to show
the<00:02:59.540> improvements<00:03:00.140> as<00:03:00.860> far<00:03:01.130> as<00:03:01.280> OS<00:03:01.610> six<00:03:01.940> ghost

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
the improvements as far as OS six ghost

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.720 
the improvements as far as OS six ghost
and<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:05.240> know<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.630> course<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.320> torch<00:03:07.040> 9800

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
and you know of course the torch 9800

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.250 
and you know of course the torch 9800
has<00:03:07.820> 512<00:03:08.570> megabytes<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:11.570> processor<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.170> a

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
has 512 megabytes and the processor is a

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.800 
has 512 megabytes and the processor is a
little<00:03:12.500> bit<00:03:12.590> higher<00:03:12.800> than<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.930> storm<00:03:14.930> two<00:03:15.230> and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
little bit higher than the storm two and

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.810 
little bit higher than the storm two and
8530
