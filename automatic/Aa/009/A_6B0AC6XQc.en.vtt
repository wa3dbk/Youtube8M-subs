must have been looking at the kitchen
when<00:02:13.489> he<00:02:13.700> started<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.269> pull<00:02:14.480> up<00:02:14.540> his<00:02:14.630> camera

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
when he started to pull up his camera

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.830 
when he started to pull up his camera
meaning<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.829> he<00:02:15.980> wasn't<00:02:16.250> his<00:02:16.489> camera<00:02:16.910> chica

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
meaning that he wasn't his camera chica

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.140 
meaning that he wasn't his camera chica
was<00:02:17.989> in<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.440> he<00:02:18.530> was<00:02:18.650> moaning<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:19.970> one

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
was in and he was moaning but the one

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.660 
was in and he was moaning but the one
who<00:02:20.269> got<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.450> last<00:02:20.750> laugh<00:02:21.019> would<00:02:21.410> most<00:02:21.950> likely

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
who got the last laugh would most likely

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.809 
who got the last laugh would most likely
or<00:02:22.940> more<00:02:23.299> than<00:02:23.510> likely<00:02:23.540> be<00:02:24.519> golden<00:02:25.519> Freddy

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
or more than likely be golden Freddy

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.840 
or more than likely be golden Freddy
because<00:02:26.480> he<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.230> last<00:02:27.530> scream<00:02:28.130> but<00:02:28.730> if

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
because he is the last scream but if

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.580 
because he is the last scream but if
anything<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.480> would<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.750> been<00:02:29.930> all<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.470> the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
anything it would have been all of the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.930 
anything it would have been all of the
animatronics<00:02:31.250> when<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.609> comes<00:02:31.819> down<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.060> it

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
animatronics when it comes down to it

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.699 
animatronics when it comes down to it
but<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.090> one<00:02:35.269> that<00:02:35.510> got<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.019> last<00:02:36.230> laugh<00:02:36.470> I

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
but the one that got the last laugh I

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.620 
but the one that got the last laugh I
assume<00:02:37.069> would<00:02:37.459> be<00:02:37.579> going<00:02:37.760> Freddy<00:02:38.090> because<00:02:38.359> one

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
assume would be going Freddy because one

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.360 
assume would be going Freddy because one
he<00:02:39.049> is<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.260> only<00:02:39.560> one<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:39.859> actually<00:02:39.889> does

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
he is the only one that actually does

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.970 
he is the only one that actually does
the<00:02:40.519> only<00:02:40.880> attack<00:02:41.269> scream<00:02:41.630> he's<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.560> only<00:02:42.709> one

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
the only attack scream he's the only one

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.289 
the only attack scream he's the only one
that<00:02:43.100> does<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.370> attack<00:02:43.639> scream<00:02:43.910> or<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
that does the attack scream or the

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.210 
that does the attack scream or the
animatronics<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.799> little<00:02:45.950> jump

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
animatronics you know a little jump

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.129 
animatronics you know a little jump
scare<00:02:46.430> scream<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.480> he<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.840> only<00:02:47.989> one

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
scare scream and that he is the only one

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.930 
scare scream and that he is the only one
that<00:02:48.200> has<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.620> deeper-voiced<00:02:48.940> animatronic

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
that has the deeper-voiced animatronic

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.000 
that has the deeper-voiced animatronic
scream<00:02:50.239> meaning<00:02:51.019> that<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.380> was<00:02:51.560> him<00:02:51.799> that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
scream meaning that it was him that

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.870 
scream meaning that it was him that
that's<00:02:52.639> how<00:02:52.819> we<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:53.120> identify<00:02:53.650> him<00:02:54.880> other

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
that's how we can identify him other

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.759 
that's how we can identify him other
than<00:02:56.209> all<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.720> other<00:02:56.870> animatronics<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.650> would

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
than all the other animatronics it would

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.740 
than all the other animatronics it would
have<00:02:57.859> been<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> lot<00:02:58.160> harder<00:02:58.340> if<00:02:58.639> it<00:02:58.790> wasn't<00:02:59.209> or

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
have been a lot harder if it wasn't or

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.150 
have been a lot harder if it wasn't or
if<00:02:59.870> they<00:02:59.989> all<00:03:00.109> sound<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.410> same<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:00.829> go<00:03:01.010> under

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
if they all sound the same but go under

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160 
if they all sound the same but go under
Freddy<00:03:01.340> doesn't<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.609> the<00:03:01.670> distinct<00:03:02.170> deeper

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
Freddy doesn't have the distinct deeper

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.009 
Freddy doesn't have the distinct deeper
scream<00:03:03.609> and<00:03:04.609> that's<00:03:05.000> why<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:05.299> believe<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.930> it

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
scream and that's why I believe that it

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.599 
scream and that's why I believe that it
was<00:03:06.079> going<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.380> Freddy<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.859> I<00:03:07.100> think<00:03:07.400> that

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
was going to Freddy and I think that

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.610 
was going to Freddy and I think that
this<00:03:08.090> entire<00:03:08.510> thing<00:03:08.569> kind<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.290> links<00:03:09.470> together

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
this entire thing kind of links together

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.660 
this entire thing kind of links together
very<00:03:10.010> easily<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.660> yeah<00:03:12.560> thank<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.340> guys<00:03:13.489> so
