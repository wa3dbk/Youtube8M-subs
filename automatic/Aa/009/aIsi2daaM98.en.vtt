basically<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.590> when<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.890> about

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
basically what it was when I think about

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.310 
basically what it was when I think about
it<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.760> should<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.539> merit<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it now I was should have got merit to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.139 
it now I was should have got merit to
wear<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> badge<00:00:58.649> suit<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> pole<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.760> do

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
wear a badge suit and a pole and just do

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.930 
wear a badge suit and a pole and just do
that<00:01:01.109> sort<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> thing<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.590> also<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.129> went

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
that sort of thing and also I just went

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.520 
that sort of thing and also I just went
when<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.420> about<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> basic<00:01:04.470> though

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
when I think about it on a basic though

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
when I think about it on a basic though
I<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.979> didn't<00:01:05.339> ask<00:01:05.489> enough<00:01:05.729> people<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.479> vote

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
I just didn't ask enough people to vote

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.530 
I just didn't ask enough people to vote
for<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:09.090> was<00:01:09.210> where<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.450> all

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
for me and I think that was where it all

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
for me and I think that was where it all
sort<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> broke<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:10.680> went<00:01:11.070> wrong<00:01:11.220> after<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
sort of broke down went wrong after that

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.890 
sort of broke down went wrong after that
because<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> was<00:01:12.060> great<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.510> then<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.780> we

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
because it was great and then when we

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
because it was great and then when we
didn't<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> votes<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:13.979> well

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
didn't have the votes it's just well

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.679 
didn't have the votes it's just well
that's<00:01:14.939> great<00:01:16.939> it's<00:01:17.939> true<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.270> could<00:01:18.479> write<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
