let's<00:00:00.299> talk<00:00:00.450> about<00:00:00.539> nutrition<00:00:01.050> first<00:00:01.260> he<00:00:01.410> says

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
let's talk about nutrition first he says

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.860 
let's talk about nutrition first he says
you<00:00:01.709> did<00:00:01.829> your<00:00:01.949> research<00:00:01.979> and<00:00:02.700> show<00:00:03.389> that<00:00:03.419> mice

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
you did your research and show that mice

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.480 
you did your research and show that mice
with<00:00:04.110> ms<00:00:04.440> they<00:00:04.680> have<00:00:04.830> shrinking<00:00:05.250> brains

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
with ms they have shrinking brains

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.210 
with ms they have shrinking brains
they've<00:00:05.759> got<00:00:05.910> dysfunctional<00:00:06.480> mitochondria

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
they've got dysfunctional mitochondria

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.250 
they've got dysfunctional mitochondria

loss of mile in an early brain cell
death<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.830> took<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.519> studying

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
death and that took you to studying

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.060 
death and that took you to studying
nutrition<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.380> know<00:00:13.500> one<00:00:13.679> thing<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.009> I

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
nutrition and you know one thing that I

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.829 
nutrition and you know one thing that I
always<00:00:14.219> tell<00:00:14.549> my<00:00:14.759> client<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.540> say<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.750> know

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
always tell my client to say you know

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.720 
always tell my client to say you know
your<00:00:16.320> body<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.800> brick<00:00:17.070> house<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.640> you

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
your body is like a brick house and you

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.189 
your body is like a brick house and you
got<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.880> build<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.420> brick<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.080> when

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
got to build it up with brick so when

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.510 
got to build it up with brick so when
you're<00:00:19.320> eating<00:00:19.410> bad<00:00:19.650> food<00:00:19.920> you're<00:00:20.220> trying<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
you're eating bad food you're trying to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.890 
you're eating bad food you're trying to
build<00:00:20.640> up<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.910> brick<00:00:21.090> house<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.270> something

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
build up a brick house with something

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.060 
build up a brick house with something
that's<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.170> bricks<00:00:22.470> trying<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> build<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.039> up

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's not bricks trying to build it up

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.040 
that's not bricks trying to build it up
with<00:00:23.130> wood<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.850> course<00:00:24.359> your<00:00:24.600> health<00:00:24.869> is

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
with wood and of course your health is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.470 
with wood and of course your health is
going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.380> deteriorate<00:00:26.070> over<00:00:26.250> time<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.330> can

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
going to deteriorate over time so can

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
going to deteriorate over time so can
you<00:00:27.599> talk<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> little<00:00:28.019> bit<00:00:28.230> about<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you talk a little bit about like the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.950 
you talk a little bit about like the
structures<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> reactions<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
structures and the reactions and the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
structures and the reactions and the
process<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.800> progress<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> brain

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
process and the progress is in the brain

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.700 
process and the progress is in the brain
that<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.210> dependent<00:00:33.690> upon<00:00:33.750> these<00:00:34.170> nutrients

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that are dependent upon these nutrients

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.260 
that are dependent upon these nutrients
that<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.070> lot<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.520> people<00:00:35.640> aren't<00:00:35.969> getting<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
that a lot of people aren't getting the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.639 
that a lot of people aren't getting the
diet<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.309> know<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.730> my<00:00:38.760> clinics<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.840> tell

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
diet so you know in my clinics I tell

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.160 
diet so you know in my clinics I tell
people<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.420> you<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.870> alive

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
people that you know we are alive

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.650 
people that you know we are alive
because<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.739> chemistry<00:00:44.000> when<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> chemistry

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
because of chemistry when the chemistry

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.860 
because of chemistry when the chemistry
stops<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.829> die<00:00:47.149> if<00:00:48.149> we're<00:00:48.510> missing<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
stops we die if we're missing the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.510 
stops we die if we're missing the
building<00:00:49.320> blocks<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.160> chemistry

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
building blocks to do that chemistry

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
building blocks to do that chemistry
properly<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.660> we're<00:00:51.870> missing<00:00:52.199> our<00:00:52.440> minerals

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
properly so we're missing our minerals

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.260 
properly so we're missing our minerals
are<00:00:53.539> vitamins<00:00:54.539> our<00:00:55.280> antioxidants<00:00:56.280> either

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
are vitamins our antioxidants either

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
are vitamins our antioxidants either

structures that either do not get made

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.840 
structures that either do not get made

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
or they get made incorrectly and it's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
or they get made incorrectly and it's
the<00:01:03.059> accumulation<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.899> incorrectly<00:01:04.650> made

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the accumulation of incorrectly made

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.060 
the accumulation of incorrectly made
stuff<00:01:05.330> that<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.510> lead<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.780> stiffening<00:01:07.770> of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
stuff that will lead to stiffening of

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.640 
stuff that will lead to stiffening of
your<00:01:08.250> blood<00:01:08.460> vessels<00:01:09.470> weakening<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> the

vitamin<00:01:57.000> c<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.390> vitamin<00:01:57.750> A<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.460> age

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
vitamin c or vitamin A and so we age

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.660 
vitamin c or vitamin A and so we age
much<00:02:00.119> much<00:02:00.810> more<00:02:01.049> rapidly<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.490> course

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
much much more rapidly and of course

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.149 
much much more rapidly and of course
develop<00:02:03.119> all<00:02:03.899> sorts<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.409> chronic<00:02:04.829> health

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
develop all sorts of chronic health

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.280

getting<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.750> brixton

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
getting the brixton

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.990 
getting the brixton
build<00:02:13.620> our<00:02:13.800> brick<00:02:13.980> houses<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.610> course<00:02:14.820> we

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
build our brick houses and of course we

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.970 
build our brick houses and of course we
are<00:02:15.150> certainly<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.960> break<00:02:16.200> down<00:02:16.440> now

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
are certainly going to break down now

are certainly going to break down now
you<00:02:17.040> were<00:02:17.400> doing<00:02:17.730> your<00:02:17.850> research<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:19.190> you're

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
you were doing your research and you're

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.130 
you were doing your research and you're
looking<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:20.940> brain<00:02:21.330> specific

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
looking for like brain specific

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.770 
looking for like brain specific
nutrients<00:02:22.980> how<00:02:23.340> helpful<00:02:23.730> was<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.270> research

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
nutrients how helpful was that research

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.780 
nutrients how helpful was that research
and<00:02:25.020> helping<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.500> identify<00:02:25.790> specific

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and helping you to identify specific

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.410 
and helping you to identify specific
foods<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.660> those<00:02:27.900> nutrients<00:02:28.460> well<00:02:29.460> so

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
foods that have those nutrients well so

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.070 
foods that have those nutrients well so
I<00:02:31.160> gone<00:02:32.160> through<00:02:32.400> my<00:02:32.490> research<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.180> come<00:02:33.930> up

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
I gone through my research and come up

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.230 
I gone through my research and come up
with<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.380> list<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.280> about<00:02:35.490> forty<00:02:35.880> seven

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
with this list of about forty seven

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.660 
with this list of about forty seven
different<00:02:36.860> vitamins<00:02:37.860> minerals<00:02:38.250> antioxidants

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
different vitamins minerals antioxidants

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.380 
different vitamins minerals antioxidants
that<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:40.320> had<00:02:41.130> clearly<00:02:41.459> been<00:02:41.580> identified<00:02:42.150> it's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
that I had clearly been identified it's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.680 
that I had clearly been identified it's
important<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.410> brain
