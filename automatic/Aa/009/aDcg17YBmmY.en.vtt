00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.399 
different things for that that was a
little<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.570 
little bit I think that's one of the
reasons<00:01:19.650> why<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:19.920> were<00:01:19.979> low<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> list

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
reasons why they were low on the list

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.160 
reasons why they were low on the list
but<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> were<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> scratch<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
but if you if you were to scratch that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.020 
but if you if you were to scratch that
out<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.860> mean<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.430> fantastic

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
out I mean that's a fantastic

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.789
