00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:20.090 

I<00:00:17.990> can<00:00:18.990> say<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> things<00:00:19.740> I've<00:00:19.949> been

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
I can say that the things I've been

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.590 
I can say that the things I've been
doing<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.430> last<00:00:20.460> two<00:00:20.820> years<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.240> really

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
doing the last two years have really

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
doing the last two years have really
made<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> difference<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.500> my<00:00:22.890> kids<00:00:23.189> have

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
made a difference because my kids have

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.880 
made a difference because my kids have
scored<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.359> highest<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> state<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
scored the highest in the state on the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.650 
scored the highest in the state on the
standardized<00:00:26.400> tests<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.449> we're<00:00:27.630> doing

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
standardized tests so what we're doing

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.230 
standardized tests so what we're doing
here<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> working<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.550> helping<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:30.000> be

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
here is working and it's helping them be

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.850 
here is working and it's helping them be
successful<00:00:32.570> we<00:00:33.570> define<00:00:33.870> blended<00:00:34.260> learning<00:00:34.530> as

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
successful we define blended learning as

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190 
successful we define blended learning as
the<00:00:35.340> combination<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.149> digital<00:00:36.450> content<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the combination of digital content and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280 
the combination of digital content and
activity<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.910> face-to-face<00:00:39.239> content<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
activity with face-to-face content and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.150 
activity with face-to-face content and
activities

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
activities

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.000 
activities
it<00:00:42.030> sounds<00:00:42.390> easy<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.930> blend<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it sounds easy to blend but it really it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
it sounds easy to blend but it really it
looks<00:00:44.040> very<00:00:44.460> different<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.969> every<00:00:45.420> classroom

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
looks very different in every classroom

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.380 
looks very different in every classroom
so<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> teacher<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.129> using<00:00:47.789> something<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
so if a teacher is using something that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.170 
so if a teacher is using something that
works<00:00:48.600> really<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.680> face-to-face

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
works really well in a face-to-face

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.420 
works really well in a face-to-face
situation<00:00:51.289> they<00:00:52.289> should<00:00:52.530> continue<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.340> do

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
situation they should continue to do

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
situation they should continue to do
that<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.940> works<00:00:54.120> well<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.410> can

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that because it works well if they can

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.139 
that because it works well if they can
find<00:00:55.829> something<00:00:56.219> else<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.460> works<00:00:56.610> better

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
find something else that works better

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.729 
find something else that works better
it's<00:00:57.480> more<00:00:57.600> efficient<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.199> effective

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it's more efficient or more effective

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
it's more efficient or more effective
that's<00:00:58.920> digital<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.329> be

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that's digital then that would be

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.219 
that's digital then that would be
implemented<00:01:01.550> what<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.940> online<00:01:03.300> could<00:01:04.110> be

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
implemented what I have online could be

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.450 
implemented what I have online could be
completely<00:01:04.589> different<00:01:04.710> than<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
completely different than what the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
completely different than what the
biology<00:01:05.939> teacher<00:01:06.090> has<00:01:06.450> online<00:01:06.659> or<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
biology teacher has online or what the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.500 
biology teacher has online or what the
physical<00:01:07.710> education<00:01:07.830> teacher<00:01:08.250> has<00:01:08.729> online<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
physical education teacher has online it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.230 
physical education teacher has online it
just<00:01:09.750> depends<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.650> need<00:01:10.920> those<00:01:11.369> kids<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just depends what you need those kids to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.179 
just depends what you need those kids to
have<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.570> order<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.960> understand<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.070> they

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
have in order to understand what they

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.870 
have in order to understand what they
need<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.549> learn<00:01:15.770> okay<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:17.220> ahead<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.729> the

and I wanted a way to be able to work

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.630 
and I wanted a way to be able to work
with<00:01:39.090> students<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.869> small<00:01:40.740> groups<00:01:40.920> while

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
with students in small groups while

activities one's a sorted sentence
activity<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.829> online<00:01:50.250> interactivity

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
activity one is an online interactivity

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149 
activity one is an online interactivity
and<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.020> small<00:01:52.350> group<00:01:52.380> that's<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and one is small group that's going to

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.450 
and one is small group that's going to
be<00:01:53.250> working<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.610> me

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
be working with me

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.149 
be working with me
okay<00:01:56.460> um<00:01:57.020> slide<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> apps<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.770> open<00:01:58.890> up

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
okay um slide to the apps and open up

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.429 
okay um slide to the apps and open up
edge<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> creations<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.930> we're<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.290> fill

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
edge of creations is we're going to fill

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.749 
edge of creations is we're going to fill
in<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.740> chart<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
in this chart because this is going to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.700 
in this chart because this is going to
get<00:02:02.850> us<00:02:03.000> practicing<00:02:03.689> base<00:02:04.079> pairing<00:02:04.560> between

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
get us practicing base pairing between

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.190 
get us practicing base pairing between
DNA<00:02:05.189> RNA<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.020> reading<00:02:07.020> our<00:02:07.290> codon<00:02:07.950> chart<00:02:09.200> okay

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
DNA RNA and reading our codon chart okay

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.059 
DNA RNA and reading our codon chart okay
so<00:02:10.259> what<00:02:10.619> goes<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:11.009> gene<00:02:12.319> C<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:13.650> I'm<00:02:13.770> gonna<00:02:13.860> put

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
so what goes in gene C so I'm gonna put

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.130 
so what goes in gene C so I'm gonna put
G<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.489> C<00:02:14.730> together<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.510> right

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
G and C together like this right

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.300 
G and C together like this right
I<00:02:17.510> would<00:02:18.510> probably<00:02:18.959> learn<00:02:19.080> more<00:02:19.440> today<00:02:19.950> just

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
I would probably learn more today just

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.970 
I would probably learn more today just
by<00:02:20.430> doing<00:02:20.489> this<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.620> whole<00:02:22.800> week

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
by doing this and I have the whole week

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.520 
by doing this and I have the whole week
that<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.760> doing<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:25.110> looked<00:02:25.319> at<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
that was in doing this we looked at the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.170 
that was in doing this we looked at the
research<00:02:25.890> about<00:02:26.190> blended<00:02:26.550> learning<00:02:26.580> we

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
research about blended learning we

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.360 
research about blended learning we
defined<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.410> then<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.800> had<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> figure<00:02:29.190> out

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
defined it and then we had to figure out

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.910 
defined it and then we had to figure out
what<00:02:29.610> would<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:29.970> look<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.569> my<00:02:31.200> class<00:02:31.530> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
what would it look like in my class and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.119 
what would it look like in my class and
so<00:02:32.730> that's<00:02:33.720> when<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.050> went<00:02:34.319> well<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.830> actually

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
so that's when I went well I actually

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.400 
so that's when I went well I actually
want<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.640> use<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.970> more<00:02:36.000> as<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> tool<00:02:36.660> for<00:02:37.019> the
