 tenno tested it and give it now 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.939
 our impressions of the hardware and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.490
 the software to the device 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.560
 the blackberry z10 is a standard 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.270
 smartphone that the iphone in design you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.200
 hundreds of nice and a very flat 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.790
 design 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.160
 the processing quality of the iphones 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.559
 However, this is not achieved 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.039
 whole device is very plastic plastic and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.870
 The back cover wobbles a bit the 4.2 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.550
 inch big display of the blackberry shows 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.469
 us light and shadow it releases the hd 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.699
 on is therefore scarce schaaf, however 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.710
 not very healing 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.620
 the colors are not very strong 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.960
 the acute put is removable 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.300
 that's good too, because he does not stop 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.640
 especially long at average 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.100
 use has approximately at scarce day 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 something from the blackberry z see in ours 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.460
 test has shown that the phone 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.320
 there with six hours in the good area 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 However, the online running time is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.990
 not very long is the camera of 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.939
 ccs with 8 megapixels and deliver in 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.310
 test a really good performance from the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.930
 colors are already strong the sharpness 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.759
 only true in dark 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.369
 lighting conditions will be the whole 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.869
 sometimes a little noise the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.400
 further equipment details of the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.380
 can draw can be seen 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.420
 The device supports Lte in all 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.030
 German frequency ranges supported 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.790
 wlan n and has a hdmi port 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.710
 that was the first time that it really came down 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.780
 interesting is most delicious mushrooms 10 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 namely the operating system the new one 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.860
 blackberry teno it has a completely new 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.659
 operating concept that we ended so and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.729
 have not seen it all yet 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.130
 does not control physical or 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.590
 virtual buttons but sets up 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.119
 A bishop gestures from the bottom up 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.189
 always bring her back to you 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.560
 homescreen already wants to go to the right and 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.509
 turn left through the menus if 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.220
 they come with the finger from below 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.520
 Describe the curve you get from 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.810
 Every application out in the message 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.960
 apropos homescreen a right one 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.630
 homescreen does not have the cc on it 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.090
 start screen, so to speak, only the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.550
 Giant tabs displayed that is the the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.130
 us task manager , showing open apps 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.720
 as tabs that apple is similar 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.150
 like android and ios 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.270
 the apps are in side by side 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.460
 Assorted screens can be sorted in 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.100
 folders can be renamed 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.270
 to start the blackberry app 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.500
 world over 70,000 downloadable apps 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.600
 In addition, there are still some special 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.690
 customized android apps though 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.920
 partly not working well 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.160
 The new one is also very good 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.530
 keyboard of blackberry tm which shows 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.960
 them on the next letter 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.880
 the word you want to type in the word 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.470
 word that you may write 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.690
 you want to know this then easily 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.550
 is provided with a second upward gesture 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.670
 to be practiced in something that works 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.380
 Writing sms and emails clearly 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.300
 faster than other to do that 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.610
 a real master is the blackberry os 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.440
 at the security settings system 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.630
 administrators have access to 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.400
 numerous settings the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.770
 Security settings are extreme 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.600
 extensively speak as device for the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.980
 work is the blackberry 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.950
 Chechnya's claim 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.480
 our conclusion is the blackberry set 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.980
 an average smartphone that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.870
 but does not make a big mistake 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.660
 we find really interesting 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.730
 blackberry teno convinced the system 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.800
 with a fresh use concept and 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.350
 numerous security settings in the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.000
 Comparison with android and ios offers it 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.640
 but no real killer features 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.870
 the private users mandatory to one 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.870
 change over the would
