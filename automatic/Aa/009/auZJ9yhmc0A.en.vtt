Stewart hopefully he's alive man he's
heavy<00:01:25.600> alright<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:28.340> I<00:01:28.370> have<00:01:28.580> this<00:01:29.890> set<00:01:30.890> up<00:01:31.070> a

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
heavy alright so I have this set up a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.570 
heavy alright so I have this set up a
super<00:01:32.120> temporary<00:01:32.840> couple<00:01:33.260> days<00:01:33.440> I<00:01:33.710> figured

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
super temporary couple days I figured

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.420 
super temporary couple days I figured
since<00:01:34.730> he<00:01:34.910> was<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.210> tub<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:36.080> in<00:01:36.800> Iraq<00:01:37.070> he

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
since he was in a tub and in Iraq he

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.040 
since he was in a tub and in Iraq he
probably<00:01:37.670> is<00:01:37.970> not<00:01:38.120> going<00:01:38.300> to<00:01:38.420> like<00:01:38.570> me<00:01:38.810> put

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
probably is not going to like me put

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.080 
probably is not going to like me put
throwing<00:01:39.530> him<00:01:39.650> into<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.890> four<00:01:40.280> foot<00:01:40.580> by<00:01:40.760> three

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
throwing him into a four foot by three

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.570 
throwing him into a four foot by three
foot<00:01:41.120> by<00:01:41.420> one<00:01:41.870> foot<00:01:41.900> cage<00:01:42.350> it'll<00:01:43.100> probably<00:01:43.280> be

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
foot by one foot cage it'll probably be

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.220 
foot by one foot cage it'll probably be
way<00:01:43.820> too<00:01:43.880> much<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:44.660> I'm<00:01:44.720> going<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.900> transition

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
way too much so I'm going to transition

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.100 
way too much so I'm going to transition
him<00:01:45.560> into<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:46.010> by<00:01:46.640> starting<00:01:46.970> with<00:01:47.120> a<00:01:47.420> normal

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
him into that by starting with a normal

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.100 
him into that by starting with a normal
just<00:01:48.410> like<00:01:49.060> glass<00:01:50.060> container<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:50.660> then<00:01:50.990> I'm

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
just like glass container and then I'm

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.510 
just like glass container and then I'm
going<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.290> transfer<00:01:51.440> him<00:01:51.830> in<00:01:51.980> like<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.130> couple

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
going to transfer him in like a couple

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.210 
going to transfer him in like a couple
days<00:01:52.640> into<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.120> big<00:01:53.390> cage<00:01:53.690> once<00:01:53.990> he's<00:01:54.260> used<00:01:55.010> to

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
days into the big cage once he's used to

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.340 
days into the big cage once he's used to
everything<00:01:55.520> all<00:01:56.360> right<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:56.900> let's<00:01:57.110> put<00:01:57.260> this

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
everything all right so let's put this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.790 
everything all right so let's put this
down<00:01:57.560> somewhere<00:01:59.020> there's<00:02:00.020> not<00:02:00.200> any<00:02:00.320> movement

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
down somewhere there's not any movement

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.160 
down somewhere there's not any movement
but<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.100> could<00:02:01.280> just<00:02:01.310> be<00:02:01.550> cold<00:02:01.790> I'm<00:02:02.630> hoping

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:19.460 
but it could just be cold I'm hoping
that<00:02:03.470> that's<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.979> case

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:03:10.910
