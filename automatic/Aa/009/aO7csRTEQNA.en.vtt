00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.460 
special no it's a it's a very good day
at<00:01:40.350> work<00:01:41.420> I've<00:01:42.420> been<00:01:42.480> doing<00:01:42.660> this<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> long<00:01:43.080> time

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
at work I've been doing this a long time

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.770 
at work I've been doing this a long time
though<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.430> gets<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.510> kind<00:01:45.660> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
though in it it gets to be you kind of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.550 
though in it it gets to be you kind of
get<00:01:45.930> caught<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.680> day-to-day<00:01:48.290> rat<00:01:49.290> race

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
get caught up in the day-to-day rat race

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
get caught up in the day-to-day rat race
of<00:01:49.800> working<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.550> it<00:01:50.730> gets<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.300> be<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> little

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
of working and it gets to be a little

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.190 
of working and it gets to be a little
bit<00:01:51.900> like<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> job<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.980> and<00:01:53.190> again<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.360> think

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
bit like a job now and again but I think

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.310 
bit like a job now and again but I think
milestones<00:01:56.180> probably<00:01:57.180> put<00:01:57.930> things<00:01:58.140> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
milestones probably put things in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.550 
milestones probably put things in
perspective<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:59.750> it's<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:00.990> nice<00:02:01.230> when

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
perspective and it's really nice when

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.750 
perspective and it's really nice when
you<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:03.770> recognition<00:02:04.770> from<00:02:05.250> your<00:02:05.430> peers

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
you get the recognition from your peers

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.419 
you get the recognition from your peers
I<00:02:06.090> think<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:06.600> that's<00:02:07.590> probably<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I think that's that's probably the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.080 
I think that's that's probably the
nicest<00:02:08.790> part<00:02:09.270> about<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.840> being<00:02:10.560> recognized

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
nicest part about it is being recognized

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.770 
nicest part about it is being recognized
