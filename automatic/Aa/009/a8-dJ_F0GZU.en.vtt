00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.480
 yes 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.300
 hello we are all in the skate park of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.530
 madrid-rÃ­o vega one of the best and most 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.530
 crowded skyper de madrid 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.780
 starting with comfort so 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.120
 general has no shadows you only have in 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.950
 one side of the skatepark last sunset 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.790
 he served to sit you have the port of 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.380
 sky park 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.010
 you have a tier is right next to the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.390
 bowl day and not for sayings that are 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.220
 around to legislate also if not 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.260
 you have to sit for the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.540
 surroundings because so it 's inside 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.550
 is full of sand another one of those the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.820
 park has sand everywhere and 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.590
 Bearings stop dust rises in 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.850
 the sand forget to put the cycles 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.899
 skype for what you do to us because it is 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.520
 shit 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.290
 as you enter the skate for and three 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.110
 fountains are always usually open 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.030
 but you also have one just in case 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.369
 a little stand next to the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.170
 people is a crowd outfit there 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.270
 so many people that skates like 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.610
 that does not skip the entry of one matches 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.290
 with the output of another of another module and 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.030
 you can not do a trick at ease without 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.030
 and fixating ink stamping 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.730
 to get here these models equip 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.740
 better communications of all Madrid by 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.810
 metro can reach or by line 3 or 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.910
 on line 6 by bus 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.130
 there are many buses that pass through that area 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.159
 and here we leave you a few more 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.560
 for a walk 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.240
 or if you want to come by car here I leave you 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.789
 a couple of directions you can put or the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.189
 plaza de legazpi and now now technical 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.539
 how you get to detail how you can put 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.270
 avenida del manzanares that is also 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.429
 next to it as a pass of chopera are all 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.990
 next and here is the route that 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.850
 you have to do to get to this 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.959
 electrical these gas companies for the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.000
 step of the chopera where abattoir 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.379
 times in the park go straight until a 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.769
 bridge and on the right has is the 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.769
 skatepark 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.470
 to see the bowl is the most complete of all 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.570
 madrid has a lot of things to 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.870
 start are as divided in two 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.390
 parts one time bigger than the other the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.430
 plus the largest part that has ramps 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.380
 more inclined and that can be done 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.920
 least things at least with skates and with 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.960
 tables because it costs more to throw 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.770
 run are harder to enter 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.120
 to provide airplanes yes that because with 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.220
 that of the level you also get many more 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.860
 speeds as it helps you are but a 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.680
 little beyond the part with the ramps 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.210
 the little ones have many more things 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.780
 you have a perfect copy to enter 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.370
 both on one side and on the other can be 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.280
 practice a lot of tricks in trap 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.560
 and it goes great it was copied great 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.140
 it's like a looked also at a curve 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.720
 also perfect without sideways but you can 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.300
 do continuous that followed 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.530
 and another thing that the truth that I do not 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.460
 least I have not seen it in any team 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.640
 that is how the copy is in peak ups 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.460
 in peak and is quite cool you can 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.960
 get up and fall screaming or go 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.090
 from the side try to make it whole 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.010
 it's quite pretty cool yes 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.480
 You can also make waves on the ramp 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.460
 so do the casualties but speed 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.710
 you tried to make a transfer too 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.900
 is attached to an inclined plane and there 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.210
 what can be skipped and dropped or 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.790
 give it to the imagination is how we did 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.830
 we also a little is very well 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.830
 the bowl will one day be with him 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.849
 to see the curbs let's start with 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.489
 the ones that I liked the most are two 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.280
 curbs embassies one to enter or 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.670
 on the right or on the left according to 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.530
 according to your tastes, everything you prefer is 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.290
 pretty good because apart from being 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.849
 embassy has a straight part and that 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.939
 it's always grateful you can start with 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.150
 a trick and the fall to make another or the 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.370
 backwards and go straight to the rectum 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.590
 those curbs are pretty good for 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.910
 learn and for all 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.130
 perfect 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.690
 as you enter the skate park you have another 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.210
 curb more chiquitito for 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.720
 beginners that's perfect for 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.730
 learn by showing little ones and pretty 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.080
 high 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.870
 quite rare that you can do things 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.670
 pretty good to scream at you yesterday that 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.410
 you want and there it is 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.890
 it's quite interesting and they do not usually 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.600
 have the skis for pockets like that 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.090
 a straight curb with the entrance in 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.890
 pyramids and there you can enter both of 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.870
 one side like the other is pretty good 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.610
 because when you enter other than that although 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.680
 no momentum of the pyramid enters 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.230
 quite close and falling is a fall 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.060
 with a little more slope it's a bit 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.470
 more level that and I know that too 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.930
 it was fine is something that you do not see all 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.690
 the sides there is also a pretty plane 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.630
 large plane above and downhill 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.030
 the rest is quite long and allows 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.680
 changes I do not know or make you a pretty gray 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.300
 long is pretty good the only bad thing 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.890
 it's the exit right after leaving 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.250
 It also has a small curb that 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.850
 It does not work for us either, but it's good 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.850
 there they have it 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.539
 handrails there is 32 embassy one 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.789
 little girl is pretty good the same 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.339
 always the handrails are first in 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.529
 flat and then in fall the little one 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:36.169
 It's great to learn and to start 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:39.259
 to give embassies perhaps the best 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.610
 that there are good many escape because 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.889
 if you fall too after this 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.229
 a lot of damage and it helps us a lot to 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.729
 practice that the tocha that is already when 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.499
 you're tired of the little one 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.689
 you are going to go says to see if I hit it well 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:54.259
 because it has a large gap is 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:59.119
 quite long is high increase a little 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:00.680
 level according to low and good but is 

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:03.199
 pretty good for people who already 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.059
 manages and tricks the truth 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.439
 that was perfect and the last 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:08.779
 railing that are also not 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.709
 many escape is in a curve if it were 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.360
 against the curb but not 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:12.769
 railings is pretty good to me 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.089
 like the ropes in curve at least 

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:16.089
 and it is good that they innovate 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.770
 we started with the ramps let's start 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.360
 with the open loop could put it in a 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.630
 bowl but it gets on ramps because I 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.940
 they come out well some open the truth that 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.520
 it's pretty good and it would be better if 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.410
 would have done a little bit bigger if 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.720
 have you tried something there none else can 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.700
 enter because it will be stamped on you 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.460
 leave or when entering is a pretty bug 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.410
 big is the idea was good but it failed 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.900
 a concept of size the size itself 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.730
 matter kids there is a straight zone for 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.389
 scream on ramp that is very good there 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.610
 you can enter from both sides and to 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.580
 practice is great that's also a 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.530
 perfect copy a very good ramp and 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.630
 safe fun let's go there is also a 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.630
 area that is like a bridge or copy 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.280
 up and down is pretty good that no no 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.009
 is found in almost no bowl or in 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.199
 no sky far 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:13.080
 he's pretty cool to get you tricks 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:15.270
 you have a certain degree of complexity and 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.649
 it is great is a little farther 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.300
 you have like another bridge like that of 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:20.669
 before but smaller and more compact 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.979
 This is also good, it's fun 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.599
 true and being a more open area 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:26.759
 it also allows you to continue trick to 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.759
 other sides there is another area that is like a 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:31.559
 half an egg there, you can do aerial 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.240
 or you can also try to offer it 

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:36.300
 the fucked up but hey is pretty good 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.619
 the same trick left very well is not 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.240
 something that you find in almost no 

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:41.909
 side is black be true also the 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.219
 electrical there are two large mounds 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:46.379
 that that takes away to do aerial there's one 

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:48.240
 what is giant is the quite complicated 

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:51.029
 but you can take out some brutal areas 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.990
 there and there is another smaller one that is the 

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:55.309
 practically to catch run 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.539
 because nothing interesting comes out and 

00:07:55.309 --> 00:08:00.749
 also and two curbs in the area that 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:02.399
 Spend the bone is the street that are 

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:04.620
 normal curbs with two cutters 

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.719
 Escaleritas and up to here kids 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.610
 equip the gafi possibly one of 

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:10.080
 the best this pair of madrid and the 

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.759
 it would be much more if there were not so much 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.810
 people and things were a little bit 

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:15.480
 more separated 

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.870
 but well you can not have everything up 

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.870
 the next
