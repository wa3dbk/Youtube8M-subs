haven't tried to play seriously on it
before<00:03:48.120> up<00:03:48.600> until<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.019> game<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.380> have<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.530> world

my<00:07:11.060> opinion<00:07:11.330> in<00:07:11.480> this<00:07:11.540> game<00:07:11.750> is<00:07:11.840> kind<00:07:12.020> of

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
my opinion in this game is kind of

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.960 
my opinion in this game is kind of
overpowered<00:07:12.530> and<00:07:12.650> I<00:07:13.130> it's<00:07:13.490> almost<00:07:13.760> like<00:07:13.940> a

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970 
overpowered and I it's almost like a

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.270 
overpowered and I it's almost like a
auto-aim<00:07:14.690> kind<00:07:15.110> of<00:07:15.170> deal<00:07:15.560> with<00:07:16.010> the<00:07:16.130> knife

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
auto-aim kind of deal with the knife

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.730 
auto-aim kind of deal with the knife
when<00:07:17.150> you're<00:07:17.270> close<00:07:17.420> enough<00:07:17.450> which<00:07:18.410> is<00:07:18.560> fine

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
when you're close enough which is fine

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.530 
when you're close enough which is fine
but<00:07:19.160> I<00:07:19.220> feel<00:07:19.400> like<00:07:19.430> the<00:07:19.640> commando<00:07:20.060> park<00:07:20.300> makes

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.540 
but I feel like the commando park makes

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.460 
but I feel like the commando park makes
it<00:07:20.660> even<00:07:20.750> more<00:07:21.940> ridiculous<00:07:23.260> that's<00:07:24.260> just<00:07:24.320> my

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470
