00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello my name is king marÃ­n 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.660
 in five steps 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.939
 first of all we have to have the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.009
 pedals with a good grip so that 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.930
 do not have trouble making this 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.860
 trick 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.360
 another thing that we should have 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.210
 in account is that our trans 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.410
 they want freely so that they do not 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.150
 go to work or we can not 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.370
 catch in the turn 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.760
 something important is the position of 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.680
 feet preferably the position of the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.680
 feet should be this way so that 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.290
 so you get more trick the foot 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.140
 back but we only put the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.870
 point and the front with so much in between 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.810
 so that this allows us to turn the tram 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.660
 freely since the rear pushes the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.550
 great blow to the back sorry and the 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.550
 forward pulls it this way 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.460
 another point would be the correct way to 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.680
 perform the boni 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.560
 first lifting the front tire 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.280
 and then the one from the back at the point where 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.170
 You raise leante forward your feet must 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.540
 to be placed as I had already 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.820
 written in the previous point so that 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.240
 so when I lift on the back tire 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.050
 this foot the psychological supports and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.050
 achieve a good turn 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.760
 the fifth and final step would be to learn to 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.760
 reach the pedals 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.930
 for some the difficult to catch them 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.790
 trans what I recommend is that 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.160
 when they ask for the front foot what 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.530
 put first as this will stop you 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.920
 the turn the input back by 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.920
 default 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.079
 what I recommend is that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.849
 practice this trick on the floor without 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:18.250
 jump so that they do not go 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.250
 losing the fear of releasing the pedals
