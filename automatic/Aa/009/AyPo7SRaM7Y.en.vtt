 yeast with the flour and let's go 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:27.009
 working 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.009
 little by little 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.850
 then we are going to oil the mold 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.180
 and I'm going to put this paper 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 around the mold and now we throw 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.620
 minutes at 180 degrees with the oven

 pre-heated to 200 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.370
 once we have taken out in our 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.710
 cake of the oven we'll let it 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.950
 cool and then assemble the cake 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.130
 now we will miss the toilet cream 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.430
 in a bowl the butter that we already have 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.540
 previously softened then 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.540
 we throw the milk 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.220
 and the orange blossom water 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.070
 and now we will mix everything 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.570
 then we will add the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.570
 sugar little by little 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.760
 once we have our battery 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.799
 finished we will add the coloring 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.189
 we're going well so put a little bit with 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.189
 a toothpick 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.930
 and let's mix 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.709
 how we want it a little bit stronger 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.709
 let's add another little bit more 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.990
 now we will start to assemble our cake 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.820
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.460
 take off the cake from the base of the 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.010
 mold we will be cutting around until 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.130
 to give round the mold and 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.590
 have already taken off as you see already what 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.750
 we have of pegadito below 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.000
 we will cut a centimeter of the part of 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.000
 above that will serve us as a cover 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.420
 once we have cut the lid the 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.180
 we will remove to a plate to use it 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.130
 then we will take with care that 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.440
 do not break us 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.410
 then fill in our 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.450
 cake with the goodies for it 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.690
 we will help with a tiny knife 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.910
 that is well sharpened we will be emptying the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.590

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.630

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.949
 now we will be putting a little bit of 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.759
 battle cream on the edge so that we 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.759
 stick the lid 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.120
 next we are going to put our 

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:52.580
