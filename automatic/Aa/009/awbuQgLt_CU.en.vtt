00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.030 

this<00:00:04.980> set<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.399> wires<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:06.060> took<00:00:06.300> out<00:00:06.510> from<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.200> 12

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
this set of wires I took out from a 12

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.549 
this set of wires I took out from a 12
volt<00:00:08.370> 5<00:00:08.730> amp<00:00:09.030> hour<00:00:09.709> rechargeable<00:00:11.119> battery

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
volt 5 amp hour rechargeable battery

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.090 
volt 5 amp hour rechargeable battery
that<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:14.160> used<00:00:14.459> to<00:00:14.760> power<00:00:15.629> a<00:00:16.020> leaf<00:00:16.260> blower

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
that is used to power a leaf blower

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.330 
that is used to power a leaf blower
I<00:00:17.600> kept<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.810> wires<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.610> can<00:00:21.060> understand<00:00:22.340> how

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
I kept the wires so I can understand how

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.650 
I kept the wires so I can understand how
the<00:00:23.400> charging<00:00:24.240> circuit<00:00:24.480> works<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:26.660> basically

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the charging circuit works and basically

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.040 
the charging circuit works and basically
you<00:00:28.230> need<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:29.090> charger<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.690> is<00:00:30.900> not

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
you need a charger like this this is not

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.930 
you need a charger like this this is not
the<00:00:31.230> original<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:32.039> the<00:00:32.160> original<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the original one the original one is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.260 
the original one the original one is
actually<00:00:33.149> bigger<00:00:33.739> this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.090> three<00:00:36.090> hundred

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
actually bigger this is a three hundred

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.650 
actually bigger this is a three hundred
milli<00:00:36.780> amp<00:00:37.520> 12<00:00:38.520> volt<00:00:38.790> charger<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:40.940> I<00:00:41.940> looked

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
milli amp 12 volt charger and I looked

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.639 
milli amp 12 volt charger and I looked
at<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> circuit<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:45.110> you<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:46.470> LED

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
at the circuit here and you have an LED

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.790 
at the circuit here and you have an LED
which<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.309> always<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
which is always on and you have a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.850 
which is always on and you have a
resistor<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.059> guess<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.050> resistor<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
resistor here I guess the resistor is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
resistor here I guess the resistor is
too<00:00:53.070> low<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.280> voltage<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.840> under<00:00:55.170> three

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
too low the voltage so it's under three

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.440 
too low the voltage so it's under three
volt<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.420> power<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.079> LED<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> also<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
volt so it can power the LED and also a

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.709 
volt so it can power the LED and also a
diode<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.850> guess<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.299> power<00:01:06.299> from

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
diode here I guess is so the power from

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.139 
diode here I guess is so the power from
the<00:01:06.899> battery<00:01:07.289> won't<00:01:07.859> go<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
the battery won't go back up to the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.289 
the battery won't go back up to the
charger<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.009> have<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.549> wires<00:01:11.880> here

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
charger here so you have two wires here

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.069 
charger here so you have two wires here
that<00:01:12.569> connects<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> battery<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.079> you

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
that connects to the battery and you

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.989 
that connects to the battery and you
have<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:17.549> learn<00:01:18.020> why<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.079> here<00:01:19.679> that<00:01:20.490> connects

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
have to learn why is here that connects

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:27.649 
have to learn why is here that connects
to<00:01:23.060> your<00:01:24.060> motor<00:01:25.279> one<00:01:26.279> here<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.299> other<00:01:27.420> one

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
to your motor one here and the other one

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.699 
to your motor one here and the other one
here<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.719> I<00:01:30.899> said<00:01:31.009> this<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.249> basically

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
here so like I said this is basically

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.690 
here so like I said this is basically
more<00:01:34.709> like<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.899> dumb<00:01:37.069> battery<00:01:38.069> charging

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
more like a dumb battery charging

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.169 
more like a dumb battery charging
circuit

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.529 

it<00:01:42.179> won't<00:01:42.539> stop<00:01:43.380> charging<00:01:44.060> when<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.209> battery

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
it won't stop charging when the battery

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.559 
it won't stop charging when the battery
when<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.139> battery<00:01:46.469> is<00:01:46.619> full<00:01:47.130> okay<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> plucked

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
when the battery is full okay I plucked

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.839 
when the battery is full okay I plucked
them<00:01:48.719> that<00:01:49.039> transformer<00:01:50.039> you<00:01:50.279> can<00:01:50.459> see<00:01:50.669> the

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
them that transformer you can see the

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.709 
them that transformer you can see the
the<00:01:51.359> light<00:01:51.539> comes<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:54.060> battery

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
the light comes on and that battery

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.679 
the light comes on and that battery
charger<00:01:55.999> transformer<00:01:56.999> outputs<00:01:57.959> 300<00:01:58.739> ma

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
charger transformer outputs 300 ma

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.769 
charger transformer outputs 300 ma
actually<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> measured<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.349> it<00:02:01.909> is<00:02:02.909> about

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:03.779 
actually I measured it it is about

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:09.770 
actually I measured it it is about
fourteen<00:02:04.259> point<00:02:04.590> six<00:02:04.859> volts<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:08.119> three<00:02:09.119> 300

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
fourteen point six volts and three 300

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.340 
fourteen point six volts and three 300
ma<00:02:10.110> isn't<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.190> much<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:13.200> has

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
ma isn't it's not that much so it has

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.470 
ma isn't it's not that much so it has
like<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.920> said<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> switch<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:15.060> we

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
like I said a switch here we

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
like I said a switch here we
is<00:02:15.629> useful<00:02:16.260> if<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.470> were<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.950> use<00:02:17.159> this<00:02:17.400> setup

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
is useful if you were to use this setup

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.770 
is useful if you were to use this setup
or<00:02:18.300> something<00:02:18.330> else<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:20.250> have<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:23.510> have<00:02:24.510> this

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
or something else and I have I have this

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.809 
or something else and I have I have this
Epson<00:02:26.450> printer<00:02:27.450> motor<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.140> took<00:02:28.260> out<00:02:28.819> and

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
Epson printer motor that I took out and

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.460 
Epson printer motor that I took out and
I<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.269> playing<00:02:30.569> around<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.440> I

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
I was just playing around with it so I

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.760 
I was just playing around with it so I
hooked<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:31.920> up

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:45.580 

and<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.890> noisy<00:02:39.890> fan

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.699 

if<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.340> have<00:02:46.430> an<00:02:46.610> either<00:02:46.790> noisy<00:02:47.390> fan<00:02:47.720> we<00:02:48.470> got

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
if you have an either noisy fan we got

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.640 
if you have an either noisy fan we got
it<00:02:48.860> he's<00:02:49.819> got<00:02:50.030> one<00:02:50.239> here

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.059 

and<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.799> can<00:02:56.980> turn<00:02:57.189> it<00:02:57.340> off<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:57.909> on<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.010> I

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
and you can turn it off and on so I

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.920 
and you can turn it off and on so I
guess<00:03:00.489> if<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:01.000> have<00:03:01.209> something<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.780> you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
guess if you have something that you

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.380 
guess if you have something that you
need<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.379> charge<00:03:02.969> and<00:03:08.609> say<00:03:09.609> if<00:03:09.909> you<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.090> this

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
need to charge and say if you have this

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.179 
need to charge and say if you have this
hook<00:03:10.599> up<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.959> a<00:03:10.989> light<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.650> can<00:03:11.859> turn<00:03:12.069> the

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
hook up to a light you can turn the

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.710 
hook up to a light you can turn the
light<00:03:12.370> on<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.670> off<00:03:13.920> once<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.569> battery<00:03:16.569> is

the blades and this is a different kind
of<00:03:32.230> motor<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.540> actually<00:03:35.049> will<00:03:35.290> become
