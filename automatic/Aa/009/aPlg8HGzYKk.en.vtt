things like that so you have some really

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.980 
things like that so you have some really
large<00:02:55.860> apps<00:02:56.760> with<00:02:57.000> your<00:02:57.150> cards<00:02:57.450> there<00:02:57.540> because

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
the space but obviously since this is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.560 
the space but obviously since this is
replacing<00:03:02.580> control<00:03:03.000> center<00:03:03.270> you're<00:03:03.390> going<00:03:03.510> to

bow so if I slide up from the corner
oops

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
oops

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.180 
oops
like<00:05:51.479> that<00:05:51.690> you<00:05:52.650> could<00:05:52.770> see<00:05:52.919> I<00:05:52.950> can<00:05:53.159> actually

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
like that you could see I can actually

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.420 
like that you could see I can actually
close<00:05:53.640> that<00:05:53.669> app

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
close that app

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.880 
close that app
out<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:54.850> that<00:05:55.270> works<00:05:55.450> on<00:05:55.600> either<00:05:55.840> corner<00:05:56.350> just

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
out and that works on either corner just

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.350 
out and that works on either corner just
like<00:05:56.980> that<00:05:57.250> now<00:05:57.370> of<00:05:57.490> course<00:05:57.700> if<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:57.910> slide<00:05:58.120> up<00:05:58.240> in

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
like that now of course if I slide up in

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.940 
like that now of course if I slide up in
the<00:05:58.420> middle<00:05:58.750> I<00:05:58.870> get<00:05:59.230> the<00:05:59.320> app<00:05:59.440> switcher<00:05:59.800> with

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
the middle I get the app switcher with

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.620 
the middle I get the app switcher with
the<00:06:00.010> control<00:06:00.310> center<00:06:00.610> and<00:06:00.730> all<00:06:00.820> that<00:06:01.060> but<00:06:01.540> you

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
the control center and all that but you

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.330 
the control center and all that but you
can<00:06:01.780> actually<00:06:01.900> change<00:06:02.290> this<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:02.920> again<00:06:03.160> this

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
can actually change this and again this

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.280 
can actually change this and again this
is<00:06:03.520> all<00:06:03.760> on<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.000> fly<00:06:04.330> so<00:06:04.660> I<00:06:04.990> can<00:06:05.170> actually

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
is all on the fly so I can actually

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.320 
is all on the fly so I can actually
change<00:06:05.470> this<00:06:05.890> to<00:06:06.100> make<00:06:06.400> it<00:06:06.520> so<00:06:06.640> only<00:06:07.000> the<00:06:07.120> right

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
change this to make it so only the right

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.670 
change this to make it so only the right
side<00:06:07.630> is<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.580> method<00:06:09.580> for<00:06:09.820> closing<00:06:10.690> an<00:06:10.930> app<00:06:11.080> so

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
side is the method for closing an app so

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.860 
side is the method for closing an app so
if<00:06:11.770> I<00:06:11.830> do<00:06:11.890> that<00:06:11.980> on<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:12.310> left<00:06:12.550> side<00:06:12.690> it<00:06:13.690> just

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
if I do that on the left side it just

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.200 
if I do that on the left side it just
opens<00:06:14.140> up<00:06:14.260> the<00:06:14.440> app<00:06:14.590> switcher<00:06:15.010> so<00:06:15.700> all<00:06:16.000> that's

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
opens up the app switcher so all that's

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.760 
opens up the app switcher so all that's
done<00:06:16.480> on<00:06:16.540> the<00:06:16.750> fly<00:06:16.930> you<00:06:17.320> don't<00:06:17.500> have<00:06:17.650> the

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
done on the fly you don't have the

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.340 
done on the fly you don't have the
height<00:06:17.980> icons<00:06:18.580> option<00:06:19.090> I<00:06:19.300> have<00:06:19.810> that<00:06:19.960> enable

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
height icons option I have that enable

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.750 
height icons option I have that enable
because<00:06:20.500> I<00:06:20.560> think<00:06:20.620> it<00:06:20.800> looks<00:06:20.950> better<00:06:21.160> with<00:06:21.400> the

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
because I think it looks better with the

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.400 
because I think it looks better with the
app<00:06:22.120> switcher<00:06:22.570> cards<00:06:22.870> but<00:06:23.020> if<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.170> turn<00:06:23.380> that

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
app switcher cards but if you turn that

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.210 
app switcher cards but if you turn that
off<00:06:24.480> you'll<00:06:25.480> see<00:06:25.540> the<00:06:25.750> icon<00:06:26.200> underneath<00:06:26.770> each

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
off you'll see the icon underneath each

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.560 
off you'll see the icon underneath each
application<00:06:27.700> some<00:06:28.060> people<00:06:28.300> like<00:06:28.420> that

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
application some people like that

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.510 
application some people like that
because<00:06:28.750> it<00:06:28.840> helps<00:06:29.110> them<00:06:29.200> to<00:06:29.260> better<00:06:30.100> be<00:06:30.490> able

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
because it helps them to better be able

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.490 
because it helps them to better be able
to<00:06:30.700> identify<00:06:31.450> what's<00:06:31.780> actually<00:06:31.990> there

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
to identify what's actually there

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.250 
to identify what's actually there
sometimes<00:06:32.950> the<00:06:33.480> screenshots<00:06:34.480> for<00:06:34.780> the<00:06:34.990> app

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
sometimes the screenshots for the app

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.130 
sometimes the screenshots for the app
switcher<00:06:35.410> cards<00:06:35.830> aren't<00:06:36.040> exactly<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:37.140> best

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
switcher cards aren't exactly the best

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.870 
switcher cards aren't exactly the best
like<00:06:38.620> if<00:06:38.830> you're<00:06:38.980> on<00:06:39.100> the<00:06:39.190> page<00:06:39.400> that's<00:06:39.670> kind

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
like if you're on the page that's kind

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.060 
like if you're on the page that's kind
of<00:06:39.910> weird<00:06:40.150> if<00:06:40.450> it's<00:06:40.660> just<00:06:40.960> text<00:06:41.410> it's<00:06:41.800> hard<00:06:41.980> to

of weird if it's just text it's hard to
tell<00:06:42.220> quickly<00:06:42.700> what<00:06:43.090> that<00:06:43.120> app<00:06:43.480> is<00:06:43.660> well<00:06:44.260> this

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
tell quickly what that app is well this

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.130 
tell quickly what that app is well this
allows<00:06:44.650> you<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:44.920> quickly<00:06:45.100> gain<00:06:45.760> gauge<00:06:46.630> as<00:06:46.930> to

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
allows you to quickly gain gauge as to

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.160 
allows you to quickly gain gauge as to
what<00:06:47.590> the<00:06:47.710> app<00:06:47.830> is<00:06:48.070> by<00:06:48.820> looking<00:06:49.150> at<00:06:49.270> the<00:06:49.450> icon

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
what the app is by looking at the icon

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.440 
what the app is by looking at the icon
below<00:06:50.620> but<00:06:50.920> I<00:06:50.950> think<00:06:51.220> it<00:06:51.310> looks<00:06:51.460> cleaner<00:06:51.730> with

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.450 
below but I think it looks cleaner with

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.410 
below but I think it looks cleaner with
hide<00:06:52.900> icons<00:06:53.440> enabled<00:06:54.370> so<00:06:55.120> they<00:06:55.240> use<00:06:55.390> a

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
hide icons enabled so they use a

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.660 
hide icons enabled so they use a
gentleman<00:06:55.840> that<00:06:56.020> is<00:06:56.200> an<00:06:56.350> overview<00:06:56.830> of<00:06:56.890> song<00:06:57.340> it

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
gentleman that is an overview of song it
