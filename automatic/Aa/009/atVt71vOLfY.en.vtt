iPhone<00:00:04.020> 4<00:00:04.380> was<00:00:04.589> groundbreaking<00:00:05.180> it's<00:00:06.180> one<00:00:06.450> of

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
iPhone 4 was groundbreaking it's one of

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.629 
iPhone 4 was groundbreaking it's one of
the<00:00:06.690> best<00:00:07.020> products<00:00:07.649> we've<00:00:07.859> ever<00:00:08.189> designed

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
the best products we've ever designed

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.759 
the best products we've ever designed
and<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.480> gone<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.960> become<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.290> number

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and it's gone on to become the number

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.549 
and it's gone on to become the number
one<00:00:10.950> smartphone<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.790> world<00:00:12.259> so<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.380> had

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
one smartphone in the world so we had

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.620 
one smartphone in the world so we had
this<00:00:13.710> challenge<00:00:14.190> how<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.269> improve<00:00:15.540> on

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
this challenge how do you improve on

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.840 
this challenge how do you improve on
something<00:00:15.900> that's<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.289> extraordinary<00:00:16.850> well

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
something that's so extraordinary well

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.929 
something that's so extraordinary well
with<00:00:17.940> iPhone<00:00:18.359> 4s<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:19.350> did<00:00:19.529> exactly<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.039> by

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
with iPhone 4s we did exactly that by

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.790 
with iPhone 4s we did exactly that by
taking<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.390> amazing<00:00:21.990> design<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
taking this amazing design and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.359 
taking this amazing design and
completely<00:00:23.250> rethinking<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.539> inside<00:00:25.369> we

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
completely rethinking the inside we

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.390 
completely rethinking the inside we
started<00:00:26.760> by<00:00:26.880> adding<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.269> dual<00:00:27.449> core<00:00:27.750> a5<00:00:27.990> chip

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
started by adding the dual core a5 chip

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.890 
started by adding the dual core a5 chip
which<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.699> twice<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.240> fast

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
which is up to twice as fast

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.650 
which is up to twice as fast
then<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.859> completely<00:00:32.369> redesign<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> camera

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
then we completely redesign the camera

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.380 
then we completely redesign the camera
which<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:34.290> only<00:00:34.320> has<00:00:34.739> eight<00:00:35.130> megapixels<00:00:35.880> but

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
which not only has eight megapixels but

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.250 
which not only has eight megapixels but
