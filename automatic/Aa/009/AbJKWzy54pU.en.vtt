00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 I want to ask you a question in the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.750
 last week we had little and I 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.769
 I asked a question and above or none 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.250
 when the program was not yet 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.250
 Program 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.660
 the fact is that you know they have 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.769
 made a lot of guess about the relationship 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.369
 yours and the pgje or for nobody is a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.140
 secret that you are the only rival 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.480
 who has the pencil and I understand that the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.559
 only rival that you have health or 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.270
 they are each a strong exponent now 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.700
 many guesses have been made 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.190
 said a lot of things actually from 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.160
 where is the breaking of you to 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.440
 I know that the track has a lot 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.120
 dear, much respect, same also me 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.339
 I'm talking about things that we have 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.800
 talked about outside the artist that was 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.250
 everything or a guy who respects you 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.379
 much wants a package that was what 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.470
 I know what happened in reality 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.300
 there was a personal problem and there was such a 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.420
 expression that you enough of your 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.330
 home no no no no this never happened everything 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.399
 contrary everyone knows that is not 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.810
 a mystery that happens in everything you know or 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.750
 happens in any area of ​​life 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.670
 when a business when you enter the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.399
 money to any type of business 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.050
 start what is inconvenient begins what 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.929
 will use the groups do not work by 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.729
 that we the rogue lasted several years do not we 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.380
 I remember not even how much is 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.149
 working what was the charles family 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.610
 They gathered as a problem until 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.950
 we entered the commercial arena for tacos 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.790
 when we start to share pallets 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.630
 what 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.850
 came with a certain seasoning the rancher 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.140
 would come then there begin the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.550
 managed to start seeing what is a 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.020
 handler starts to see what they are 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.670
 personal interests I understand that 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.500
 everyone who wants to survive 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.330
 he wants to develop he understands me 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.040
 they were simply inconveniences that 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.500
 I feel at a certain moment everyone 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.120
 he understood that he had to welcome his career 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.070
 This alone was what we did for 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.660
 the benefit of each one if the people 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.550
 knew the money that he has taken 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.080
 to the musical inconvenience as had 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.210
 the support I saw it from another point of 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.040
 view understand me what was asked 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.959
 sit down to drink a coffee together as 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.270
 we have always done and we are 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.500
 killing not in any success knows 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.440
 exactly the situation that was seen and he 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.000
 at the exact moment that who said no 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.890
 I go I can not work and I do not 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.560
 asked in a moment he got off the group I 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.930
 I'll keep going up if I say so 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.630
 I say it was clearly the one that happened 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.160
 because it is understood that in certain 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.600
 moment I was shining a lot more in 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.430
 the group polka era I was the owner of 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.470
 recording studio as I always was 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.220
 when that had value because that already you 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.170
 you know 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.700
 the technology anybody has a 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.630
 study to talk computer that you 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.730
 they say study 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.710
 you know then I was also the one 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.420
 I had three for a half many years 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.830
 working in the middle of communications I 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.710
 he was the one who had the super on being 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.090
 the league on the street and so on 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.100
 they began to see certain misgivings 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.900
 understands that they translated into that 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.520
 also he painted very well highlighted the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.050
 dow that people do not know about their intern 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.450
 although the group will be called charles 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.980
 family in an internal battle that he 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.080
 it was to see him it was the same usually 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.940
 clear that if he was the miners but I 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.620
 I am Cullen, but I did not attack him 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.090
 that's why one attacked of his as he 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.580
 represents the talk because you know that 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.640
 I have a lot of fucking among people 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.340
 You know that there was a lot of pinche between 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.410
 talk and enlighten ie 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.240
 they were two waves that lived in that in 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.530
 total war on a musical level the people do not 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.360
 know the history of the underground in 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.890
 reality here you know a documentary what 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.450
 that we are doing here you 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.370
 you go out there was a lot of conflict with that 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.170
 because he would apply represents his area 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.330
 the mine I wanted to represent San Carlos 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.220
 but I understood that at the moment no sooner 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.140
 it did not suit that to throw him family because 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.760
 is not under a tutor with too much 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.110
 strength and too much respect at the level of 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.560
 urban music 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.560
