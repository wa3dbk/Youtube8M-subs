00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.819 
themes because I could be here forever
and<00:00:32.820> also<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.420> don't<00:00:33.899> feel<00:00:34.350> that's<00:00:34.559> how<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and also I don't feel that's how you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.920 
and also I don't feel that's how you
should<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.280> looking<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.940> episode<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
should be looking at this episode the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.690 
should be looking at this episode the
theme<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.440> series<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> blockbuster

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
theme for this series is blockbuster

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
theme for this series is blockbuster
every<00:00:39.030> week<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.870> didn't<00:00:40.110> know<00:00:40.140> from

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
every week as if you didn't know from

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.520 
every week as if you didn't know from
all<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> advertisement<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.320> fair

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
all of the advertisement and to be fair

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.350 
all of the advertisement and to be fair
I<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.129> sign<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> Daleks<00:00:44.910> does<00:00:45.120> that

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
I think a sign of the Daleks does that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
I think a sign of the Daleks does that
with<00:00:45.570> style<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> brilliant<00:00:46.620> script<00:00:47.039> maybe

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
with style and a brilliant script maybe

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.130 
with style and a brilliant script maybe
the<00:00:47.820> bigger<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> pawns<00:00:48.329> doesn't<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:48.870> work

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the bigger the pawns doesn't really work

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.080 
the bigger the pawns doesn't really work
but<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.980> episode<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.489> more<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> popcorn

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
but the episode is more of a popcorn

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.240 
but the episode is more of a popcorn
flick<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.050> enjoyable<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
flick and it's enjoyable just for that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
flick and it's enjoyable just for that
when<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:53.879> announced<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> Daleks

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
when it was announced that the Daleks

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
when it was announced that the Daleks
would<00:00:54.989> return<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.710> season<00:00:56.010> opener<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
would return for this season opener it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.119 
would return for this season opener it
was<00:00:57.180> hyped<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.840> having<00:00:57.960> every<00:00:58.500> Dalek<00:00:58.770> ever

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
was hyped up as having every Dalek ever

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.510 
was hyped up as having every Dalek ever
did<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.820> every<00:01:00.059> Dalek<00:01:00.270> ever<00:01:01.219> no<00:01:02.219> not

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
really but is that a problem for me no

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.250 
really but is that a problem for me no
because<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.150> was<00:01:06.330> too<00:01:06.450> caught<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.960> story

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
because I was too caught up in the story

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469 
because I was too caught up in the story
to<00:01:07.530> care<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.130> mean<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.820> nice<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380 
was only for 10 seconds to be fair this
was<00:01:13.860> definitely<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.369> most<00:01:14.490> Daleks<00:01:15.060> I've<00:01:15.180> seen

on screen at once and I mean practical
Daleks<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.900> doesn't<00:01:19.229> count<00:01:19.350> however<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.340> me

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
Daleks this doesn't count however for me

gonna be honest I never really had a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810

problem<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> paradigm<00:01:29.130> Dalek<00:01:29.610> my

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
problem with the paradigm Dalek my

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.730 
problem with the paradigm Dalek my
problem<00:01:30.210> came<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.570> their<00:01:30.750> colors<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
problem came from their colors not the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
problem came from their colors not the
fact<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> they<00:01:32.130> were<00:01:32.189> blue<00:01:32.490> white<00:01:33.180> red

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
fact that they were blue white red

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.510 
fact that they were blue white red
yellow<00:01:33.750> whatever<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.890> because<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.310> look

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
yellow whatever but because they look

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
yellow whatever but because they look
like<00:01:35.820> plastic<00:01:36.479> bits<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.869> pop<00:01:37.110> art<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:37.590> don't

like plastic bits of pop art they don't

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.480 
like plastic bits of pop art they don't
look<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:37.950> dalekanium<00:01:38.579> tanks<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.810> pop<00:01:40.200> up

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
look like dalekanium tanks just pop up

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.429 
look like dalekanium tanks just pop up
the<00:01:41.490> book<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.210> back<00:01:42.450> they<00:01:42.840> look<00:01:42.990> crow<00:01:43.200> mean

the book that back they look crow mean

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
the book that back they look crow mean
they've<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:43.860> deeper<00:01:44.460> shades<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.030> red<00:01:45.240> blue

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
they've got deeper shades of red blue

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.389 
they've got deeper shades of red blue
and<00:01:45.780> whatnot<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.979> look<00:01:47.159> really

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and whatnot and they just look really

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.940 
and whatnot and they just look really
powerful<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> threatening<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:48.990> ah<00:01:49.140> oh<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
powerful and threatening but ah oh it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.490 
powerful and threatening but ah oh it
can't<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.340> too<00:01:50.610> much<00:01:50.820> gold<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.409> would

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
can't see too much gold I think it would

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.749 
can't see too much gold I think it would
be<00:01:52.619> fair<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> say<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.250> answered<00:01:53.700> the

be fair to say that answered the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.730 
be fair to say that answered the
backlash<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> paradigm<00:01:54.960> Daleks<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
backlash at the paradigm Daleks the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.289 
backlash at the paradigm Daleks the
production<00:01:56.070> team<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.460> gone<00:01:56.610> too<00:01:56.850> far<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
production team have gone too far the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.749 
production team have gone too far the
other<00:01:57.329> way<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.619> too<00:01:58.860> many<00:01:59.040> bronze

other way with just one too many bronze
Daleks<00:02:00.270> now<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:00.899> I'd<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.229> been<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.530> control

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
Daleks now if I'd have been in control

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.160 
Daleks now if I'd have been in control
of<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.610> Dalek<00:02:02.969> goes<00:02:03.119> where<00:02:03.390> here's<00:02:03.960> how<00:02:04.140> I

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
of which Dalek goes where here's how I

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.080 
of which Dalek goes where here's how I
would<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.619> done<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> paradigm<00:02:05.430> Daleks<00:02:05.939> in

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
would have done it paradigm Daleks in

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.459 
would have done it paradigm Daleks in
the<00:02:06.180> spaceship<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.899> control<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the spaceship and in control of the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.059 
the spaceship and in control of the
situation

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
situation

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.160 
situation
then<00:02:08.670> when<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> team<00:02:09.179> entered<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> asylum

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
then when the team entered the asylum

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.140 
then when the team entered the asylum
that's<00:02:10.410> where<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.709> seen<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.129> time<00:02:11.400> war<00:02:11.670> model

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
that's where we seen the time war model

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940 
that's where we seen the time war model
and<00:02:12.239> then<00:02:12.810> when<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> doctor<00:02:13.560> goes<00:02:13.709> into

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and then when the doctor goes into

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.490 
and then when the doctor goes into
intensive<00:02:14.430> care<00:02:14.670> that's<00:02:15.299> where<00:02:15.629> we<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:16.049> all

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
intensive care that's where we see all

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.369 
intensive care that's where we see all
of<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.860> classic<00:02:17.220> Daleks<00:02:17.640> because<00:02:18.329> then<00:02:18.540> you

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
of the classic Daleks because then you

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.039 
of the classic Daleks because then you
know<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:20.370> actual<00:02:21.060> existence<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> story

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
know the actual existence in the story

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.780 
know the actual existence in the story
would<00:02:22.560> be<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.709> little<00:02:22.980> bit<00:02:23.069> more<00:02:23.220> justified

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
would be a little bit more justified

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.130 
would be a little bit more justified
those<00:02:24.180> are<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.480> magnetics

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
those are just magnetics

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.500 
those are just magnetics
because<00:02:25.409> overall<00:02:25.829> I<00:02:26.040> loved<00:02:26.519> this<00:02:26.790> story<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
because overall I loved this story and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.569 
because overall I loved this story and
especially<00:02:27.750> what<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.290> did<00:02:28.470> with<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.890> Daleks

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
especially what it did with the Daleks

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.640 
especially what it did with the Daleks
the<00:02:29.790> Daleks<00:02:30.209> themselves<00:02:30.750> are<00:02:30.930> really<00:02:31.230> well

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the Daleks themselves are really well

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.860 
the Daleks themselves are really well
treated<00:02:32.010> here<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.609> big<00:02:33.150> thing<00:02:33.359> about<00:02:33.629> bringing

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
treated here a big thing about bringing

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.660 
treated here a big thing about bringing
classic<00:02:34.379> monsters<00:02:34.680> back<00:02:34.829> is<00:02:35.099> only<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.579> if

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
classic monsters back is only do it if

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.710 
classic monsters back is only do it if
you're<00:02:35.730> gonna<00:02:35.849> add<00:02:36.030> something<00:02:36.209> new<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
you're gonna add something new to the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.589 
you're gonna add something new to the
mythology<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.879> makes<00:02:39.239> them<00:02:39.390> better

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
mythology and it just makes them better

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.960 
mythology and it just makes them better
and<00:02:39.959> that's<00:02:40.260> why<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.950> hungrier<00:02:41.310> thing<00:02:41.549> cocnut

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and that's why the hungrier thing cocnut

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.849 
and that's why the hungrier thing cocnut
not<00:02:42.359> really<00:02:42.689> good<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.079> lowering<00:02:43.409> stories

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
not really good so lowering stories

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.680 
not really good so lowering stories
because<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.310> rehashes<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.239> same<00:02:45.450> plot

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
because it just rehashes the same plot

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.240 
because it just rehashes the same plot
from<00:02:46.019> their<00:02:46.230> previous<00:02:46.650> three<00:02:46.680> appearances

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
from their previous three appearances

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.089 
from their previous three appearances
here<00:02:48.239> we<00:02:48.599> have<00:02:48.720> shown<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.200> Dalek<00:02:49.560> Parliament

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
here we have shown the Dalek Parliament

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.369 
here we have shown the Dalek Parliament
I'm<00:02:50.579> not<00:02:50.909> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.299> say<00:02:51.450> introduced<00:02:51.989> because

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
I'm not going to say introduced because

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.110 
I'm not going to say introduced because
it<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:52.859> cleans<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.579> some<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.909> mess

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
it actually cleans up some of the mess

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000 
it actually cleans up some of the mess
left<00:02:54.450> over<00:02:54.750> from<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.989> Doctor<00:02:55.230> Who<00:02:55.319> TV<00:02:55.500> movies

left over from the Doctor Who TV movies

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.720 
left over from the Doctor Who TV movies

we meet the Dalek Prime Minister no not
him<00:02:59.939> but<00:03:00.689> well<00:03:01.079> I<00:03:01.290> wouldn't<00:03:01.620> put<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.799> past<00:03:01.889> him

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
him but well I wouldn't put it past him

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.789 
him but well I wouldn't put it past him
to<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.519> controlled<00:03:02.879> by<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.079> slimy<00:03:04.079> hate-filled

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
to be controlled by a slimy hate-filled

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.970 
to be controlled by a slimy hate-filled
mutant<00:03:05.900> well<00:03:06.900> we<00:03:07.260> also<00:03:07.379> learn<00:03:07.650> about<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
mutant well we also learn about the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.309 
mutant well we also learn about the
Daleks<00:03:08.189> concept<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.849> beauty<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:10.109> think

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
Daleks concept of beauty and I think

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.569 
Daleks concept of beauty and I think
that's<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.590> brilliant<00:03:10.920> idea

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
that's a brilliant idea

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.000 
that's a brilliant idea
it<00:03:11.730> makes<00:03:12.209> sense<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.900> Daleks<00:03:13.170> would

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
it makes sense that the Daleks would

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.009 
it makes sense that the Daleks would
find<00:03:14.370> things<00:03:14.609> though<00:03:15.090> revolting<00:03:15.870> and

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
find things though revolting and

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.229 
find things though revolting and
disgusting<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.739> everyone<00:03:17.099> else<00:03:17.310> beautiful

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
disgusting to everyone else beautiful

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.729 
disgusting to everyone else beautiful
things<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.750> aspire<00:03:19.230> to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
things to aspire to

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.009 
things to aspire to
Steven<00:03:20.579> off<00:03:20.730> its<00:03:20.879> goal<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.449> episode<00:03:21.840> was

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
Steven off its goal in this episode was

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.900 
Steven off its goal in this episode was
to<00:03:22.260> make<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.560> Daleks<00:03:22.799> scary<00:03:23.310> again<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:23.849> I

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
to make the Daleks scary again and I

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.150 
to make the Daleks scary again and I
think<00:03:24.120> he's<00:03:24.239> done<00:03:24.419> this<00:03:24.599> hands<00:03:25.019> down<00:03:25.260> they<00:03:26.129> are

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
think he's done this hands down they are

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.129 
think he's done this hands down they are
still<00:03:26.459> able<00:03:26.669> to<00:03:26.879> be<00:03:27.060> big<00:03:27.359> malevolent

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
still able to be big malevolent

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.050 
still able to be big malevolent
screaming<00:03:28.799> creatures<00:03:29.250> but<00:03:29.669> they<00:03:29.790> are<00:03:29.909> now

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
screaming creatures but they are now

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.530 
screaming creatures but they are now
also<00:03:30.449> to<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.720> sorrowful<00:03:31.709> creepy<00:03:32.459> monsters<00:03:33.329> I

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
also to be sorrowful creepy monsters I

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.420 
also to be sorrowful creepy monsters I
think<00:03:34.019> they<00:03:34.079> work<00:03:34.230> best<00:03:34.560> when<00:03:34.980> they<00:03:35.159> are<00:03:35.280> in

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
think they work best when they are in

help to set up what they could be like
in<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.680> future<00:03:47.159> what<00:03:47.519> really<00:03:47.729> helps<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.150> that

role<00:06:55.180> model<00:06:55.330> to<00:06:55.630> be<00:06:55.750> the<00:06:56.200> story<00:06:56.440> itself<00:06:56.680> is

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
role model to be the story itself is

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.530 
role model to be the story itself is
quite<00:06:57.010> a<00:06:57.100> simple<00:06:57.340> setup<00:06:57.670> nothing<00:06:58.390> too

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
quite a simple setup nothing too

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.290 
quite a simple setup nothing too
confusing<00:06:59.730> except<00:07:00.730> from<00:07:00.850> her<00:07:01.030> but<00:07:01.210> I<00:07:01.240> think

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
confusing except from her but I think

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.460 
confusing except from her but I think
that's<00:07:01.690> meant<00:07:01.840> to<00:07:01.900> be<00:07:02.020> the<00:07:02.110> point

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
that's meant to be the point

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.200 
that's meant to be the point
yeah<00:07:02.860> I'm<00:07:03.070> confident<00:07:03.490> that<00:07:03.610> they've<00:07:03.880> got<00:07:04.090> it

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
yeah I'm confident that they've got it

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.360 
yeah I'm confident that they've got it
right<00:07:04.450> with<00:07:04.630> the<00:07:04.810> movie<00:07:05.350> style<00:07:05.620> blockbuster

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
right with the movie style blockbuster

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.910 
right with the movie style blockbuster
episodes<00:07:06.880> if<00:07:07.330> that<00:07:07.510> means<00:07:07.630> less<00:07:07.810> emotion<00:07:08.290> they

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.920 
episodes if that means less emotion they

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.500 
episodes if that means less emotion they
might<00:07:09.220> start<00:07:09.460> to<00:07:09.580> be<00:07:09.670> a<00:07:09.700> problem<00:07:09.970> but<00:07:10.270> at<00:07:10.390> the

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
might start to be a problem but at the

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.180 
might start to be a problem but at the
time<00:07:10.750> being<00:07:10.990> I<00:07:11.140> think<00:07:11.440> it<00:07:11.530> works<00:07:11.740> this<00:07:12.040> is<00:07:12.160> a

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
time being I think it works this is a

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:20.790 
time being I think it works this is a
nice<00:07:12.400> return<00:07:12.730> for<00:07:12.970> Doctor<00:07:13.210> Who<00:07:13.240> by<00:07:19.710> what<00:07:20.710> do
