00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.519
 Hi everyone, Your teacher lives in Zen. 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.409
 together with the osvaldo teacher am 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.899
 responsible for this discipline 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.089
 In this unit we will reflect on the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.370
 process of technological evolution and 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.489
 social importance of technology 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.530
 The goal is that you want the student to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.289
 end of this unit is capable of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.350
 conceptualize technology to understand its 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.229
 evolution and the influence on the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.570
 current moment in society worldwide 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.940
 this way you will understand better 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.690
 the social importance of technology and 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.209
 its unfolding in the health economy 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.770
 transport science education culture and 

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:19.409
 so many other areas 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.049
 the reflections and discussions promoted 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.000
 the contents of this unit will 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.890
 help identify the benefits and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.950
 problems brought about by technologies 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.350
 present for society very well. 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.110
 We are using the term technology 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.630
 including in the name of this discipline since 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 the beginning but after all what you understand 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.709
 by technology 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.269
 you could conceptualize this term 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.099
 which is currently increasingly 

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:47.039
 present in our lives 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.470
 think for a moment 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.160
 Let's talk a little more and soon 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.989
 you will have this clearer concept 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.929
 we know that in an organization the 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:02:01.170
 solutions are not always unique and many 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.750
 times are inconstant any element 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.899
 may lead to an imbalance in 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.090
 existing processes and there is always 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.550
 a new provision of all 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.099
 involved in order to enable the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.000
 necessary changes 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:20.129
 ie changes were already inevitable 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.069
 turbulence of technologies can 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.590
 assist in this process of change to 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.019
 support organizations and ensure 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.269
 improvements for society as a whole 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.610
 But how do we get to the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.810
 technological development 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.500
 we live today 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.540
 Is it always the way it happened? 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.010
 this continuous process of evolution 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.470
 technological 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.290
 technological changes are increasingly 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.840
 faster and we will get 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.400
 accompany this process 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.010
 but the consequences of these technologies 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.840
 in society's life 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.730
 this unit will allow you to 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.129
 clarify much of these questions 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.830
 that bothers us daily 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.400
 technology can be understood as 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.290
 mode of production a totality of 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.170
 devices and inventions that are part of 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.049
 of a society and at the same time a 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.290
 way of organizing and perpetuating or 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.299
 modify social relationships 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.610
 a manifestation of the thinking of 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.819
 dominant behavior patterns 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.829
 the instrument of control and domination 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.269
 technology can be conceptualized as 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.000
 various forms 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.280
 according to the context the word 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.739
 technology comes from a combination of the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.549
 technician of the guild tec nÃ© that is to know 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.849
 do 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.280
 compliments of the Greek logos reason can be 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.920
 summarize technology as the reason for 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.840
 know how to do with the study of the technique 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.180
 many times when talking about 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.890
 technology thinks of more 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.260
 designed to gain market 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.989
 quickly however the technology 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.299
 means much more than that 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.530
 the history of technology began 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.170
 when the man discovered that it was 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.000
 possible to change nature by improving 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.700
 the living conditions of the group in which 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.760
 was in fact discover the secret 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.109
 that we can unify the bone 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.239
 establishing a new use for the same 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.230
 beginning the conquest of the atom and 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.900
 space 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.930
 often view technology as 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.849
 in our society 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.580
 for causing unemployment problems of the environment 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.039
 environment etc 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.750
 currently rapid technological evolution 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.510
 guided by a technical community and 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.210
 scientifically committed and productive 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.070
 causes marked changes in the 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.780
 society life 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.510
 not only was there an increase in interest 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.020
 technology but also in the reflections 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.970
 philosophical and historical about it more 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.740
 strongly in its relations with the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.320
 science and society 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.990
 we are experiencing a technological era where 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.240
 understanding of the technology theme is 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.120
 used in a decisive and 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.760
 categorical but often wrong 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.070
 because it has been treated as a product or 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.410
 equipment 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.960
 technology can not be 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.980
 limited form related only to 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.050
 machines 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.540
 it is understood that technology involves 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.900
 certain types of knowledge 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.390
 generation of employment of products 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.550
 help to organize human relations 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.100
 the changes brought about by the new 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.320
 digital technologies occurs in all 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.930
 areas of human knowledge such as health 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.860
 education telecommunications transport 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.210
 etc 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.790
 in all areas of knowledge 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.650
 is interlinked with the 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.810
 technological development 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.060
 in such a way that it can not be launched 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.700
 between science and technology. 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.950
 because it is not possible to conceive 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.380
 science without its technique 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.120
 in turn, science can not cope 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.670
 with issues of values 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.260
 it says what can be done but not the 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.420
 what should be done 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.390
 As you can see we are surrounded 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.160
 technologies on all sides of the 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.260
 moment we wake up we take a 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.510
 Simple coffee the moment we play 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.020
 in the labor market using the 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.100
 more diverse support tools 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.430
 we are definitely dependent on the 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.050
 technologies and then it will be that from 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.630
 now you are able to present 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.060
 a definition for technology and 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.560
 understand the process of evolution in the 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.870
 which we are inserted 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.290
 we can not deny that technology is 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.300
 present anywhere we are 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.700
 we depend on it in computers 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.100
 the various sources and forms of 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.720
 energy we used in the studies 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.290
 space a camera 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.590
 in our most 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.620
 basic in everything we do we realize the 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.590
 influence the advancement of technologies but 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.410
 attention who is at the service of whom 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.440
 the human being to the service of technology 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.630
 vice versa as is the practicality of 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.960
 technology in relation to quality of 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.370
 life and how relationships are organized 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.650
 interpersonal 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.000
 the next units will help you 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.000
 reflect on these issues
