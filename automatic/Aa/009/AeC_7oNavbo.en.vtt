for your icons which I'm not really a

for your icons which I'm not really a
fan<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.979> shelf<00:01:26.400> themes<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.180> does<00:01:27.390> look

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
fan of shelf themes but this does look

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.140 
fan of shelf themes but this does look
really<00:01:27.750> cool<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.979> make<00:01:29.460> sure<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> check<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
really cool so make sure to check that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.130 
really cool so make sure to check that
out<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> icons<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:33.210> taken<00:01:33.630> from<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> SWA

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
out so the icons are taken from the SWA

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
theme and that's probably it for the SWA

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.469
