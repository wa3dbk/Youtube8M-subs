is<00:01:28.010> like<00:01:28.190> temporary

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.230 

adult<00:01:39.880> results<00:01:40.329> are<00:01:40.450> out

a<00:01:42.350> bit<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.500> permanent<00:01:43.950> now<00:01:44.210> thinking<00:01:45.210> about

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a bit more permanent now thinking about

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.499 
a bit more permanent now thinking about
a<00:01:45.420> gate<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> hinge<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.270> thought<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.329> was

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
a gate and hinge but I thought I was

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.340 
a gate and hinge but I thought I was
look<00:01:49.049> too<00:01:49.229> much<00:01:49.409> work<00:01:50.570> as<00:01:51.570> well<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.259> just

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
look too much work as well really just

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.279 
look too much work as well really just
keep<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> geese<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:55.610> well<00:01:56.750> probably<00:01:57.750> until

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
keep the geese here well probably until

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.950 
keep the geese here well probably until
the<00:01:58.500> beginning<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.920> October<00:01:59.960> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the beginning of October and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.570 
the beginning of October and
unfortunately<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:05.600> we'll<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:07.399> putting<00:02:08.399> them

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
unfortunately then we'll be putting them

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.680 
unfortunately then we'll be putting them
into<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.849> deep<00:02:09.149> freeze<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:11.160> having<00:02:11.940> well<00:02:12.360> one

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
into a deep freeze and having well one

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.449 
into a deep freeze and having well one
of<00:02:12.810> them<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.050> Christmas<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:14.069> really<00:02:14.280> just

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
of them for Christmas it's really just

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.340 
of them for Christmas it's really just
not<00:02:14.670> worth<00:02:14.940> keeping<00:02:15.239> them<00:02:15.980> over<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.069> winter

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
not worth keeping them over the winter

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.860 
not worth keeping them over the winter
there's<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> lot<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.680> snow<00:02:21.380> they<00:02:22.380> probably<00:02:23.870> have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
there's a lot of snow they probably have

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
there's a lot of snow they probably have
to<00:02:24.989> be<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.200> close<00:02:25.440> for<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> whole<00:02:25.769> time<00:02:26.100> we'd

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
to be in close for the whole time we'd

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.920 
to be in close for the whole time we'd
have<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.910> feed<00:02:27.120> them<00:02:27.360> every<00:02:27.600> day<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.480> it's

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
have to feed them every day so as it's

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.309 
have to feed them every day so as it's
from<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.769> one<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.780> I'm<00:02:33.780> afraid<00:02:34.110> they'll

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
from up one of you I'm afraid they'll

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.520 
from up one of you I'm afraid they'll
don't<00:02:34.739> have<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:36.360> they<00:02:37.110> will<00:02:37.290> be<00:02:37.440> even

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
don't have to go but they will be even

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.650 
don't have to go but they will be even
so<00:02:38.840> they've<00:02:39.840> had<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:39.989> happy<00:02:40.230> life<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.709> think<00:02:41.660> over

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
so they've had a happy life I think over

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.680 
so they've had a happy life I think over
the<00:02:42.750> summer<00:02:44.150> on<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:46.609> the<00:02:47.609> netting<00:02:48.390> would<00:02:48.510> just

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the summer on the the netting would just

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.670 
the summer on the the netting would just
use<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.250> fencing<00:02:50.250> wire<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.989> just<00:02:51.989> tied<00:02:52.650> it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
use this fencing wire and just tied it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.460 
use this fencing wire and just tied it
tighter<00:02:53.489> than<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.570> place<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
tighter than that to the place and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.920 
tighter than that to the place and
actually<00:02:55.769> at<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.950> bottom<00:02:56.329> it's<00:02:57.329> pretty

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
actually at the bottom it's pretty

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.420 
actually at the bottom it's pretty
secure<00:02:58.170> it's<00:02:58.890> quite<00:02:59.100> tight<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.840> don't<00:03:00.840> think

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
secure it's quite tight I don't think

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.479 
secure it's quite tight I don't think
like<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> dog<00:03:03.410> or<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> fox<00:03:04.829> would<00:03:05.070> be<00:03:05.160> able<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.340> get

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
like a dog or a fox would be able to get

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.890 
like a dog or a fox would be able to get
in<00:03:05.579> here<00:03:05.820> well<00:03:06.239> hopefully<00:03:06.709> hopefully<00:03:07.709> not<00:03:08.900> so

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
in here well hopefully hopefully not so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.110 
in here well hopefully hopefully not so
we're<00:03:10.739> very<00:03:10.769> pleased<00:03:11.190> we've<00:03:11.640> got<00:03:11.790> them<00:03:11.910> out<00:03:12.000> of

we've had full day of rain it's been

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.879 
we've had full day of rain it's been
very<00:04:11.409> dry<00:04:11.709> here<00:04:11.970> for<00:04:12.970> about<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.239> last<00:04:13.889> two

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889

very dry here for about the last two
weeks

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
weeks

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.200 
weeks
actually<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:17.229> waited<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.310> garden<00:04:20.729> where<00:04:21.729> maybe

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
actually I waited to garden where maybe

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.350 
actually I waited to garden where maybe
I<00:04:23.099> think<00:04:24.099> it<00:04:24.160> was<00:04:24.250> about<00:04:24.340> three<00:04:24.639> days<00:04:24.849> ago

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
I think it was about three days ago

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.850 
I think it was about three days ago
and<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:26.380> soil<00:04:26.620> was<00:04:26.830> rock<00:04:27.099> hard<00:04:28.259> very<00:04:29.259> very<00:04:29.530> dry

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
and the soil was rock hard very very dry

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.529 
and the soil was rock hard very very dry
like<00:04:30.430> no<00:04:30.610> moisture<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:32.410> this<00:04:32.680> rain<00:04:32.949> has<00:04:33.539> come

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
like no moisture so this rain has come

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.379 
like no moisture so this rain has come
just<00:04:34.599> in<00:04:34.960> time<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:36.550> it's<00:04:36.699> looking<00:04:36.820> pretty<00:04:37.030> good

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
just in time so it's looking pretty good

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.070 
just in time so it's looking pretty good
particularly<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.349> the<00:04:38.380> cabbages<00:04:39.360> are<00:04:40.360> doing

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
particularly the the cabbages are doing

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.450 
particularly the the cabbages are doing
well<00:04:41.260> this<00:04:41.440> year<00:04:42.479> by<00:04:43.479> our<00:04:43.510> neighbors<00:04:44.460> they're

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
well this year by our neighbors they're

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.279 
well this year by our neighbors they're
looking<00:04:45.760> pretty<00:04:45.789> weak<00:04:46.180> but<00:04:46.449> we've<00:04:46.930> been<00:04:47.110> quite

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
looking pretty weak but we've been quite

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.540 
looking pretty weak but we've been quite
lucky<00:04:47.680> with<00:04:48.419> ours<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:51.150> I<00:04:53.039> think<00:04:54.039> this<00:04:54.159> is<00:04:54.340> the

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
lucky with ours and I think this is the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.260 
lucky with ours and I think this is the
the<00:04:55.210> broccolis<00:04:55.720> doing<00:04:56.080> well<00:04:57.090> over<00:04:58.090> there

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
the broccolis doing well over there
