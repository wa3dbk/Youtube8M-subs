Kombat was the first one I remember

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.880 
Kombat was the first one I remember
really<00:00:41.460> enjoying<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> kid<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.630> wasn't<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.590> huge

really enjoying as a kid I wasn't a huge

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
really enjoying as a kid I wasn't a huge
fan<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.489> games<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.030> liked<00:00:45.360> them<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.780> fine

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
fan of the games I liked them just fine

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.080 
fan of the games I liked them just fine
and<00:00:46.350> had<00:00:46.440> both<00:00:46.620> Mortal<00:00:47.040> Kombat<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.670> Mortal

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and had both Mortal Kombat and Mortal

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
and had both Mortal Kombat and Mortal
Kombat<00:00:48.420> 2<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> Super<00:00:49.410> NES<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.040> time

Kombat 2 on the Super NES at the time

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
Kombat 2 on the Super NES at the time
but<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.300> felt<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> games<00:00:52.110> were<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> bit<00:00:52.559> on

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
but I felt that the games were a bit on

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.549 
but I felt that the games were a bit on
the<00:00:52.770> overrated<00:00:53.250> side<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.030> overall<00:00:54.870> inferior

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the overrated side and overall inferior

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.920 
the overrated side and overall inferior
to<00:00:55.800> Street<00:00:56.070> Fighter<00:00:56.100> 2<00:00:56.420> but<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.780> could

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
to Street Fighter 2 but if I could

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
to Street Fighter 2 but if I could
praise<00:00:58.140> Mortal<00:00:58.530> Kombat<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.250> thing<00:00:59.550> even

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
praise Mortal Kombat for one thing even

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.000 
praise Mortal Kombat for one thing even
back<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.050> was<00:01:01.230> having<00:01:01.530> interesting

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
back then it was having interesting

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.880 
back then it was having interesting
characters<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.760> an<00:01:02.879> interesting<00:01:03.329> story

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
characters and an interesting story

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
characters and an interesting story
looking<00:01:04.890> back<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.550> first<00:01:05.789> two<00:01:06.030> Mortal

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
looking back on it the first two Mortal

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
looking back on it the first two Mortal
Kombat<00:01:06.720> games<00:01:06.960> weren't<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> much<00:01:08.009> more

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
Kombat games weren't all that much more

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.790 
Kombat games weren't all that much more
fleshed<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.819> in<00:01:08.880> Street<00:01:09.330> Fighter<00:01:09.360> 2<00:01:09.660> but<00:01:10.619> for

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
fleshed out in Street Fighter 2 but for

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.080 
fleshed out in Street Fighter 2 but for
some<00:01:10.950> reason<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> characters<00:01:11.819> really

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
some reason the characters really

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.790 
some reason the characters really
resonated<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:12.810> me<00:01:12.959> and<00:01:13.319> the<00:01:13.560> thought<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
resonated with me and the thought of

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.650 
resonated with me and the thought of
seeing<00:01:14.069> a<00:01:14.220> movie<00:01:14.399> based<00:01:14.789> on<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.179> made<00:01:15.360> sense

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
seeing a movie based on it made sense

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.660 
seeing a movie based on it made sense
not<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.649> mention<00:01:17.069> that<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.340> Street<00:01:17.640> Fighter

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
not to mention that the Street Fighter

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.150 
not to mention that the Street Fighter
movie<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.479> such<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.690> disaster<00:01:19.410> surely

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
movie was such a disaster surely

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.589 
movie was such a disaster surely
Hollywood<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:20.789> have<00:01:20.910> learned<00:01:21.149> from<00:01:21.420> its

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:21.599 
Hollywood would have learned from its

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:24.290 
Hollywood would have learned from its
mistakes<00:01:22.050> right<00:01:22.670> when<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> saw<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:23.940> Mortal

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
mistakes right when I saw a Mortal

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.900 
mistakes right when I saw a Mortal
Kombat<00:01:24.690> as<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> kid<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.319> loved<00:01:25.679> it<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.369> me<00:01:26.550> this

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
Kombat as a kid I loved it to me this

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.730 
Kombat as a kid I loved it to me this
was<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.209> standard<00:01:27.810> by<00:01:27.959> which<00:01:27.990> every<00:01:28.590> video

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
was the standard by which every video

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.650 
was the standard by which every video
game<00:01:28.920> movie<00:01:29.399> that<00:01:29.580> came<00:01:29.789> after<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.300> would<00:01:30.539> be

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
game movie that came after it would be

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.199 
game movie that came after it would be
judged<00:01:30.959> and<00:01:31.229> many<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.069> them<00:01:32.220> came<00:01:32.399> up<00:01:32.459> short<00:01:32.819> as

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
judged and many of them came up short as

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.240 
judged and many of them came up short as
an<00:01:33.899> adult<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:34.709> of<00:01:34.770> interesting<00:01:35.039> how

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
an adult it's kind of interesting how

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.699 
an adult it's kind of interesting how
things<00:01:35.490> worked<00:01:35.819> out<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.080> one<00:01:37.229> part<00:01:37.530> when

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
things worked out for the one part when

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.650 
things worked out for the one part when
I<00:01:37.740> sat<00:01:38.009> down<00:01:38.039> to<00:01:38.369> rewatch<00:01:38.670> Mortal<00:01:39.119> Kombat<00:01:39.479> for

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
I sat down to rewatch Mortal Kombat for

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.380 
I sat down to rewatch Mortal Kombat for
the<00:01:39.750> first<00:01:40.020> time<00:01:40.319> in<00:01:40.530> many<00:01:40.770> years<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.520> did<00:01:42.240> have

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the first time in many years I did have

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.529 
the first time in many years I did have
it<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.599> VHS<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.560> haven't<00:01:43.950> had<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.069> VCR<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> ages

it on VHS but haven't had a VCR and ages

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.800 
it on VHS but haven't had a VCR and ages
I<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:46.649> some<00:01:46.830> reason<00:01:47.209> expected<00:01:48.209> not<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> like

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
I for some reason expected not to like

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.410 
I for some reason expected not to like
it<00:01:49.190> partly<00:01:50.190> because<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.640> lot<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:50.970> things<00:01:51.270> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it partly because a lot of things you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.389 
it partly because a lot of things you
like<00:01:51.599> as<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> teenager<00:01:52.110> seem<00:01:52.679> dumb<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.160> when

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
like as a teenager seem dumb to you when

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.339 
like as a teenager seem dumb to you when
you're<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.610> your<00:01:53.729> 30s<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.750> standards<00:01:55.229> are

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
you're in your 30s your standards are

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.320 
you're in your 30s your standards are
just<00:01:55.530> higher<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.099> teenager<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:56.940> really

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
just higher as a teenager I was really

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.059 
just higher as a teenager I was really
concerned<00:01:57.720> with<00:01:57.959> how<00:01:58.140> close<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.649> was<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:58.830> the

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
concerned with how close it was to the

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.400 
concerned with how close it was to the
games<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.179> pretty<00:02:00.420> damn<00:02:00.660> close<00:02:00.959> at

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
games and it was pretty damn close at

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.960 
games and it was pretty damn close at
least<00:02:01.470> for<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.830> movie<00:02:02.069> that<00:02:02.190> was<00:02:02.280> rated<00:02:02.429> pg-13

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
least for a movie that was rated pg-13

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.969 
least for a movie that was rated pg-13
and<00:02:03.420> didn't<00:02:03.959> show<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> kind<00:02:04.470> of<00:02:04.530> violence

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and didn't show the kind of violence

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.859 
and didn't show the kind of violence
shown<00:02:05.220> in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.429> games<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.569> was<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.750> very

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
shown in the games it was a very

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
shown in the games it was a very
reasonable<00:02:07.470> facsimile<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:08.250> both<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> tone

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
reasonable facsimile of both the tone

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.870 
reasonable facsimile of both the tone
and<00:02:09.330> plot<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> games<00:02:10.130> but<00:02:11.130> as<00:02:11.310> an<00:02:11.430> adult<00:02:11.730> I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
and plot of the games but as an adult I

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.759 
and plot of the games but as an adult I
worry<00:02:12.150> less<00:02:12.450> about<00:02:12.480> how<00:02:12.870> close<00:02:13.170> these<00:02:13.409> movies

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
worry less about how close these movies

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.309 
worry less about how close these movies
are<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.219> source<00:02:14.370> material<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.239> more<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
are to the source material and more of

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.080 
are to the source material and more of
how<00:02:16.500> well<00:02:16.799> they<00:02:17.040> tell<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> story

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
how well they tell a story

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.210 
how well they tell a story
it<00:02:18.720> doesn't<00:02:19.080> have<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.350> be<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.590> same<00:02:19.800> story

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
it doesn't have to be the same story

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.610 
it doesn't have to be the same story
from<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> games<00:02:20.820> exactly<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:22.260> want<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
from the games exactly but I do want to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.500 
from the games exactly but I do want to
be<00:02:22.710> entertained<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.460> my<00:02:23.610> intelligence<00:02:24.090> not

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
be entertained and my intelligence not

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.080 
be entertained and my intelligence not
insulted<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.860> other<00:02:26.070> words<00:02:26.340> when<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.670> comes<00:02:26.940> to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
insulted in other words when it comes to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.480 
insulted in other words when it comes to
movies<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.720> not<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.350> story<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.860> tell<00:02:29.070> but

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
movies it's not the story you tell but

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.940 
movies it's not the story you tell but
how<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.700> tell<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.320> reason<00:02:31.710> I

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
how you tell it so for that reason I

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.520 
how you tell it so for that reason I
reason<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.180> would<00:02:33.450> probably<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.260> less

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
reason that I would probably be less

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.530 
reason that I would probably be less
favorable<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.220> MORTAL<00:02:35.550> KOMBAT<00:02:35.580> than<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.330> was

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
favorable of MORTAL KOMBAT than I was

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.400 
favorable of MORTAL KOMBAT than I was
back<00:02:36.870> then

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
back then

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.590 
back then
another<00:02:38.400> interesting<00:02:38.880> thing<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.360> I've

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
another interesting thing is that I've

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.300 
another interesting thing is that I've
become<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.900> much<00:02:40.140> bigger<00:02:40.410> fan<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.040> game

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
become a much bigger fan of the game

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.640 
become a much bigger fan of the game
series<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.000> honestly<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.140> felt<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
series and honestly I felt that the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.710 
series and honestly I felt that the
latest<00:02:44.040> game<00:02:44.250> simply<00:02:44.700> called<00:02:44.910> Mortal<00:02:45.240> Kombat

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
latest game simply called Mortal Kombat

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170 
latest game simply called Mortal Kombat
was<00:02:45.930> better<00:02:46.170> than<00:02:46.410> Street<00:02:46.710> Fighter<00:02:46.920> 4<00:02:47.250> so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
was better than Street Fighter 4 so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.160 
was better than Street Fighter 4 so
there's<00:02:48.360> something<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.750> chew<00:02:48.960> on

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
there's something to chew on

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.080 
there's something to chew on
anyway<00:02:50.160> let's<00:02:50.370> talk<00:02:50.580> about<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.910> movie

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
anyway let's talk about the movie

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.060 
anyway let's talk about the movie
although<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.110> simply<00:02:52.440> called<00:02:52.650> Mortal

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
although it's simply called Mortal

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.370 
although it's simply called Mortal
Kombat<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.760> mostly<00:02:54.390> adapts<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.900> plot<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.320> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
Kombat and mostly adapts the plot of the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.080 
Kombat and mostly adapts the plot of the
first<00:02:55.590> game<00:02:55.920> there's<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.220> lot<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.490> elements<00:02:56.640> of

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
first game there's a lot of elements of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.360 
first game there's a lot of elements of
Mortal<00:02:57.360> Kombat<00:02:57.720> 2<00:02:57.990> including<00:02:58.890> characters

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
Mortal Kombat 2 including characters

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.370 
Mortal Kombat 2 including characters
like<00:02:59.610> katana<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> Outworld<00:03:00.900> setting

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
like katana and the Outworld setting

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.560 
like katana and the Outworld setting
near<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.650> end<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> movie<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.390> said

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
near the end of the movie like I said

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.600 
near the end of the movie like I said
the<00:03:03.690> plot<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> games<00:03:04.440> wasn't<00:03:05.130> too<00:03:05.250> fleshed

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
the plot of the games wasn't too fleshed

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.850 
the plot of the games wasn't too fleshed
out<00:03:05.820> back<00:03:06.090> then<00:03:06.330> now<00:03:06.990> Mortal<00:03:07.320> Kombat<00:03:07.680> had<00:03:07.830> a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
out back then now Mortal Kombat had a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680 
out back then now Mortal Kombat had a
pretty<00:03:08.130> good<00:03:08.310> mythology<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.330> but<00:03:09.510> back

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
pretty good mythology going but back

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.990 
pretty good mythology going but back
then<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.020> was<00:03:10.110> pretty<00:03:10.170> thin<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:11.430> lot<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
then it was pretty thin and a lot of the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.220 
then it was pretty thin and a lot of the
new<00:03:12.120> additions<00:03:12.630> seemed<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.020> have<00:03:13.140> been

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
new additions seemed to have been

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.500 
new additions seemed to have been

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
raided and therefore the fanbase was a

raided and therefore the fanbase was a

actually<00:05:23.909> support<00:05:24.449> this<00:05:24.689> for<00:05:24.990> two<00:05:25.110> reasons

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
actually support this for two reasons

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.769 
actually support this for two reasons
one<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:26.460> that<00:05:26.520> it<00:05:26.819> doesn't<00:05:27.029> alienate<00:05:27.300> the

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
one is that it doesn't alienate the

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.659 
one is that it doesn't alienate the
teenaged<00:05:28.199> audience<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:28.949> wanted<00:05:29.219> to<00:05:29.249> see<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
teenaged audience that wanted to see the

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.700 
teenaged audience that wanted to see the
movie<00:05:29.789> by<00:05:30.479> forcing<00:05:30.990> them<00:05:31.110> to<00:05:31.289> either<00:05:31.409> beg

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
movie by forcing them to either beg

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.619 
movie by forcing them to either beg
their<00:05:31.889> parents<00:05:32.279> to<00:05:32.400> take<00:05:32.580> them<00:05:32.819> or<00:05:33.029> sneak<00:05:33.389> in

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
their parents to take them or sneak in

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:35.959 
their parents to take them or sneak in
and<00:05:33.870> two<00:05:34.680> because<00:05:35.189> the<00:05:35.310> movie<00:05:35.610> is<00:05:35.639> already

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
and two because the movie is already

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.879 
and two because the movie is already
pretty<00:05:36.509> over<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.839> top<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.469> if<00:05:37.560> you<00:05:37.589> start
