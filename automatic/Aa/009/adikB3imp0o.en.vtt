00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
opposite of what we did on takeoff will

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.060 
opposite of what we did on takeoff will
be<00:04:59.400> reducing<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.330> power<00:05:00.539> and<00:05:01.070> dissipating

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
be reducing the power and dissipating

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.129 
be reducing the power and dissipating
our<00:05:02.190> flying<00:05:02.550> energy<00:05:03.120> so<00:05:03.510> that<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.810> airplane

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
our flying energy so that the airplane

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.920 
our flying energy so that the airplane
will<00:05:04.440> settle<00:05:04.710> back<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.280> pavement<00:05:05.930> when

will settle back to the pavement when

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.900 
will settle back to the pavement when
back<00:05:07.199> at<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.530> parking<00:05:07.889> area<00:05:08.100> you'll<00:05:08.669> go

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
back at the parking area you'll go

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.820 
back at the parking area you'll go
through<00:05:08.940> some<00:05:09.360> basic<00:05:09.810> steps<00:05:10.050> for<00:05:10.320> securing

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
the airplane this is also a great time

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.790

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
to reflect on the experience also ask

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.920 
to reflect on the experience also ask
any<00:05:17.220> questions<00:05:17.820> that<00:05:18.060> may<00:05:18.210> be<00:05:18.270> on<00:05:18.510> your<00:05:18.660> mind
