00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Elena is a little over a week ago happy under 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.810
 leadership parrubiya 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.300
 Groysman castle adopted in first reading 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.290
 bill on the legal regime of military 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.509
 provisions 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.719
 which poroshenko carried on the initiative 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 MP Kashinsky what are the possible 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.390
 implications for citizens 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.800
 Well, you probably understand why 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.109
 may at such a time enter military 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.539
 position only to our with 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 you country did not live by the peace rules in 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.050
 including could not democratically 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.920
 reelect that power which is already 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 done kili wonders for what probably and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.989
 sent to the dustbin of history everything is done 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 just to conserve 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.890
 mode as it is now 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.870
 there is in line with European 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.489
 principles of democracy 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.350
 true democracy medieval on 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.629
 Ukraine is coming 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.449
 oppression fight against dissent 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.609
 I do not call names but from quite a lot 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.850
 you know start even begin from 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.189
 those who have 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.760
 deputy mandates novinski searches 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.659
 Efremov planted you know probably 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.479
 queues of suicides are rather strange 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.979
 almost all people possessed 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.860
 party tickets of the party of regions and 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.310
 so on and you personally are experiencing for yourself 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.500
 pressure but more at the household level and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.780
 Of course, yes, and in this case you need 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.259
 understand that at the present moment you need 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.490
 be extremely careful to 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.979
 avoid attacks against yourself a 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.200
 in this case, the deputies are under 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.450
 great 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.149
 I will say this under more attention in the country 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.460
 they would have said any 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.320
 did not become any position there are pluses and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.969
 cons on the one hand well what now 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.880
 immunity she 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.590
 formally at least for the same deputy 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.360
 Novinsky can judge what can 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.929
 quietly go to the office to carry out 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.600
 searches 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.729
 as far as I know there were also searches 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.369
 other deputies who do not want to 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.510
 this to say and those who are not included 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.000
 most are groove fractional 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.010
 they understand that for them it is too much 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.430
 attracting attention therefore this is not 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.940
 speak these cripples I know that 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.930
 concerns the status itself maybe it gives 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.250
 some kind of public defense maybe he 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.010
 attracts more attention but in 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.370
 normal country if you look at it 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.870
 what is the official Ukrainian doing now 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.030
 media in 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.030
 Most I do not speak totally but in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.769
 most of them just do not notice 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.519
 what happens to the representatives 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.430
 opposition that's all and in this regard 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:53.319
 Well, do you think the current Ukrainian 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.220
 journalists are just propagandists 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.889
 or something more given their role 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.049
 accomplices of war crimes 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.639
 accomplices because they are not only 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.480
 cover the individual facts and even 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.480
 encourages
