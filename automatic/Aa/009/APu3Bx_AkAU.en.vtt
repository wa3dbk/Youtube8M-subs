00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
to the loop around and down through

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.350 
to the loop around and down through
which<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> good<00:00:40.079> way<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.290> tie<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:41.270> but<00:00:42.270> it

which is a good way to tie it but it

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.729 
which is a good way to tie it but it
takes<00:00:42.570> more<00:00:42.719> time<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> there's<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.440> not

itself that is the bowline knot and
