hello<00:00:00.539> everyone<00:00:00.930> and<00:00:01.110> welcome<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:01.949> video

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hello everyone and welcome in this video

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.770 
hello everyone and welcome in this video
I'm<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.460> be<00:00:02.520> performing<00:00:02.970> some<00:00:03.120> tests<00:00:03.510> to

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
I'm going to be performing some tests to

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.150 
I'm going to be performing some tests to
show<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.080> actual<00:00:04.380> differences<00:00:04.980> in

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
show the actual differences in

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.249 
show the actual differences in
acceleration<00:00:05.640> before<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.720> after<00:00:07.049> removing

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
acceleration before and after removing

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.290 
acceleration before and after removing
some<00:00:07.589> wait<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:07.950> my<00:00:08.040> Integra<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.000> in<00:00:09.179> my

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
some wait for my Integra so in my

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.509 
some wait for my Integra so in my
previous<00:00:09.690> video<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:09.990> my<00:00:10.290> Integra<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.889> removed<00:00:11.370> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
previous video on my Integra I removed a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.360 
previous video on my Integra I removed a
3.8<00:00:12.330> pounds<00:00:12.900> from<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.980> want<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.190> know

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
3.8 pounds from it and I want to know

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.310 
3.8 pounds from it and I want to know
how<00:00:14.790> much<00:00:14.969> does<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.330> actually<00:00:15.690> improve<00:00:16.049> my

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
how much does this actually improve my

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.769 
how much does this actually improve my
acceleration<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.430> designed<00:00:18.000> some<00:00:18.090> tests<00:00:18.600> in

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
acceleration so I designed some tests in

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.870 
acceleration so I designed some tests in
order<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.350> figure<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.770> out<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.760> basically

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
order to figure that out so basically

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.010 
order to figure that out so basically
I'm<00:00:21.150> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.390> doing<00:00:21.570> some<00:00:21.750> acceleration

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I'm going to be doing some acceleration

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.259 
I'm going to be doing some acceleration
testing<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> want<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> eliminate<00:00:23.880> as

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
testing and you want to eliminate as

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
testing and you want to eliminate as
many<00:00:24.660> variables<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.800> you

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
many variables as you can so that you

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.410 
many variables as you can so that you
know<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> only<00:00:26.730> difference<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.269> in

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
know that the only difference is in

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.810 
know that the only difference is in
those<00:00:27.510> two<00:00:27.750> tests<00:00:28.260> before<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.920> after<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
those two tests before and after is the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.099 
those two tests before and after is the
weight<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.420> weight<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.630> what's<00:00:30.960> giving

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
weight and the weight is what's giving

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.049 
weight and the weight is what's giving
you<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> difference<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.830> your<00:00:31.949> results<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you the difference in your results so

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.389 
you the difference in your results so
what<00:00:33.420> I've<00:00:33.510> got<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.989> second<00:00:34.590> gear<00:00:34.770> tests<00:00:35.219> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
what I've got is a second gear tests and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.440 
what I've got is a second gear tests and
what<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> leave<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
what I'm going to do is leave it in

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.970 
what I'm going to do is leave it in
second<00:00:36.780> gear<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.050> drive<00:00:37.200> from<00:00:37.440> 20<00:00:37.710> miles<00:00:37.890> per

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
second gear and drive from 20 miles per

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.819 
second gear and drive from 20 miles per
hour<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.550> 45<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.420> 40<00:00:39.690> miles<00:00:39.840> per<00:00:39.989> hour<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.559> wide

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
hour to 45 to 40 miles per hour at wide

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
hour to 45 to 40 miles per hour at wide
open<00:00:41.100> throttle<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
open throttle and then I'm going to do a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
open throttle and then I'm going to do a
third<00:00:42.989> gear<00:00:43.200> test<00:00:43.680> where<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> go<00:00:44.370> from<00:00:44.579> 20<00:00:44.850> miles

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
third gear test where I go from 20 miles

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
third gear test where I go from 20 miles
per<00:00:45.120> hour<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.450> 40<00:00:45.660> miles<00:00:45.809> per<00:00:45.930> hour<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.320> wide

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
per hour to 40 miles per hour at wide

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049 
per hour to 40 miles per hour at wide
open<00:00:46.770> throttle<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.399> basically<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
open throttle and basically what this is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 
open throttle and basically what this is
going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.360> doing<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> second<00:00:49.739> year<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
going to be doing for the second year it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.279 
going to be doing for the second year it
will<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.100> testing<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> mid<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> high<00:00:50.910> rpm<00:00:51.420> revs

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
will be testing the mid to high rpm revs

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.990 
will be testing the mid to high rpm revs
of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> engine<00:00:52.890> versus<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> low<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> mid<00:00:53.820> rpm

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
of the engine versus the low to mid rpm

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360 
of the engine versus the low to mid rpm
revs<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.110> third<00:00:55.350> gear<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.039> reason<00:00:56.280> I'm

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
revs for third gear and the reason I'm

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
revs for third gear and the reason I'm
doing<00:00:56.489> these<00:00:56.760> two<00:00:57.000> separately<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.870> basically

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
doing these two separately is basically

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
doing these two separately is basically
if<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.010> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.789> engine<00:01:00.149> testing

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
if I do want to do some engine testing

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.299 
if I do want to do some engine testing
in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> future<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.530> want<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.890> hey<00:01:02.070> did

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in the future and I want to see hey did

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.060 
in the future and I want to see hey did
the<00:01:02.460> higher<00:01:02.760> rpm<00:01:03.180> engine<00:01:04.070> performance

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the higher rpm engine performance

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
the higher rpm engine performance
characteristics<00:01:05.760> change<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> low-to-mid

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
characteristics change or the low-to-mid

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.810 
characteristics change or the low-to-mid
change<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:08.280> already<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
change then I will already have this

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020 
change then I will already have this
data<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> past<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.560> reference<00:01:11.030> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
data in the past that I can reference so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.270 
data in the past that I can reference so
what<00:01:12.810> variables<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.590> eliminated<00:01:14.010> in

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
what variables have I eliminated in

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.670 
what variables have I eliminated in
creating<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.820> test<00:01:15.180> well<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.110> reason<00:01:16.500> I'm

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
creating this test well the reason I'm

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
creating this test well the reason I'm
leaving<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> single<00:01:17.700> gear<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.180> starting

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
leaving it in a single gear and starting

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
leaving it in a single gear and starting
from<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.229> rolling<00:01:19.439> start<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> eliminate

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
from a rolling start is to eliminate

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
from a rolling start is to eliminate
wheel<00:01:21.150> slip<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.080> want<00:01:22.200> those<00:01:22.290> tires

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
wheel slip so I don't want those tires

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.200 
wheel slip so I don't want those tires
spinning<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> change<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.880> time

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
spinning that's going to change my time

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.810 
spinning that's going to change my time
in<00:01:25.049> acceleration<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.729> know

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in acceleration and so then you know

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
in acceleration and so then you know
you've<00:01:26.939> got<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.119> variable<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.020> eliminate<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you've got that variable to eliminate I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
you've got that variable to eliminate I
don't<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.130> shift<00:01:29.340> gears<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
don't want to shift gears because you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.520 
don't want to shift gears because you
can<00:01:30.540> shift<00:01:30.750> gears<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> different

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
can shift gears with a different

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.649 
can shift gears with a different
duration<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.820> some<00:01:33.000> clutch<00:01:33.210> slip<00:01:33.509> in

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
duration and have some clutch slip in

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.789 
duration and have some clutch slip in
there<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> give<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> all

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
there and that's going to give you all

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.410 
there and that's going to give you all
kinds<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.159> different<00:01:35.310> results<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> want<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
kinds of different results so I want to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.210 
kinds of different results so I want to
leave<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> same<00:01:37.140> gear<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> test

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
leave it in the same gear for the test

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.310 
leave it in the same gear for the test
my<00:01:39.210> weight<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> remain<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> same

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
my weight is going to remain the same

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.840 
my weight is going to remain the same
I'm<00:01:40.530> not<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> change<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.310> clothes<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.759> my

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
I'm not going to change my clothes or my

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.399 
I'm not going to change my clothes or my
shoes<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.299> anything<00:01:42.479> I'm<00:01:42.930> not<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> eat

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
shoes or anything I'm not going to eat

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.319 
shoes or anything I'm not going to eat
or<00:01:43.530> drink<00:01:43.560> before<00:01:44.130> removing<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> weight<00:01:45.090> or

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
or drink before removing the weight or

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.649 
or drink before removing the weight or
after<00:01:46.399> removing<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> weight<00:01:47.670> basically<00:01:48.210> my

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
after removing the weight basically my

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.120 
after removing the weight basically my
weight<00:01:48.869> will<00:01:49.079> stay<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> exact<00:01:49.740> same<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
weight will stay the exact same I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.499 
weight will stay the exact same I
measured<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.520> before<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.939> after<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
measured it before and after it was the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.069 
measured it before and after it was the
same<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> kept<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.220> constant<00:01:54.079> throttle

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
same so I kept that constant throttle

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.679 
same so I kept that constant throttle
delay<00:01:55.380> basically<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> did<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.540> I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
delay basically so what I did was I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.200 
delay basically so what I did was I
started<00:01:57.799> accelerating<00:01:58.799> at<00:01:59.219> about<00:01:59.399> 17<00:02:00.000> miles

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
started accelerating at about 17 miles

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.810 
started accelerating at about 17 miles
per<00:02:00.450> hour<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:01.110> allowed<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.920> throttle<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.700> be

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
per hour that allowed the throttle to be

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850 
per hour that allowed the throttle to be
open<00:02:03.149> fully<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.110> once<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.469> throttle

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
open fully and then once the throttle

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.859 
open fully and then once the throttle
was<00:02:04.950> open<00:02:05.189> fully<00:02:05.399> once<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.030> hit<00:02:06.180> 20<00:02:06.479> miles<00:02:06.750> per

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
was open fully once you hit 20 miles per

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.160 
was open fully once you hit 20 miles per
hour

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
hour

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.410 
hour
I<00:02:07.290> started<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> timing<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> throttle

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
I started the timing so the throttle

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.180 
I started the timing so the throttle
basically<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.259> wanted<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.619> eliminate<00:02:10.770> any

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
basically I wanted to eliminate any

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.340 
basically I wanted to eliminate any
delay<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.790> meet

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
delay and meet

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.230 
delay and meet
pressing<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> gas<00:02:13.130> pedal<00:02:13.460> from<00:02:13.760> starting<00:02:14.180> at

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
pressing the gas pedal from starting at

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.150 
pressing the gas pedal from starting at
20<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.660> put<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:14.930> before<00:02:15.530> 20<00:02:15.890> miles<00:02:16.040> per

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
20 so I put that before 20 miles per

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.010 
20 so I put that before 20 miles per
hour<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.240> would<00:02:17.360> always<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.660> at<00:02:17.870> wide

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
hour so that it would always be at wide

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.660 
hour so that it would always be at wide
open<00:02:18.050> throttle<00:02:18.320> once<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.950> hits<00:02:19.100> 20<00:02:19.430> miles<00:02:19.550> per

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
open throttle once it hits 20 miles per

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.450 
open throttle once it hits 20 miles per
hour<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:20.410> did<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.530> at<00:02:21.680> relatively<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.190> same

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
hour I did this at relatively the same

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.050 
hour I did this at relatively the same
time<00:02:22.670> today<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.510> basically<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.730> did<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.820> test

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
time today so basically I did the test

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.550 
time today so basically I did the test
took<00:02:26.630> all<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.900> weight<00:02:27.020> out<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.380> then

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
took all the weight out and then

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.960 
took all the weight out and then
repeated<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.070> test<00:02:28.280> about<00:02:28.430> an<00:02:28.640> hour<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.910> a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
repeated the test about an hour and a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.350 
repeated the test about an hour and a
half<00:02:29.120> or<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:29.840> later<00:02:30.110> um<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:31.580> did<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.120> with<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
half or so later um I did this with the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.790 
half or so later um I did this with the
same<00:02:32.630> ambient<00:02:32.990> temperature<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.470> temperature

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
same ambient temperature the temperature

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.530 
same ambient temperature the temperature
actually<00:02:33.920> outside<00:02:34.700> did<00:02:34.880> not<00:02:35.000> change<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.450> was

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
actually outside did not change it was

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.170 
actually outside did not change it was
61<00:02:36.020> degrees<00:02:36.230> Fahrenheit<00:02:36.590> for<00:02:36.770> both<00:02:37.180> humidity

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
61 degrees Fahrenheit for both humidity

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.840 
61 degrees Fahrenheit for both humidity
did<00:02:38.780> change<00:02:39.110> very<00:02:39.440> slightly<00:02:39.740> between<00:02:39.980> test<00:02:40.400> 38

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
did change very slightly between test 38

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.120 
did change very slightly between test 38
to<00:02:40.970> 41<00:02:41.210> percent<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.380> pretty<00:02:42.560> small<00:02:42.860> I

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
to 41 percent but that is pretty small I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.410 
to 41 percent but that is pretty small I
don't<00:02:43.520> know<00:02:43.610> what<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.760> actual<00:02:44.030> difference<00:02:44.300> is

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
don't know what the actual difference is

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.300 
don't know what the actual difference is
that<00:02:44.540> what<00:02:44.660> causes<00:02:45.050> but<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.530> recorded<00:02:46.220> it

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
that what causes but I recorded it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.190 
that what causes but I recorded it
nonetheless<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:47.480> was<00:02:47.600> done<00:02:47.780> with<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.990> full

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
nonetheless this was done with a full

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.590 
nonetheless this was done with a full
tank<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.560> gas<00:02:48.620> for<00:02:49.280> both<00:02:49.430> first<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.210> second

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
tank of gas for both first and second

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.590 
tank of gas for both first and second
tests<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.140> if<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:51.770> future<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:52.070> want<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.310> do

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
tests so if in the future I want to do

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.730 
tests so if in the future I want to do
acceleration<00:02:53.600> tests<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:53.990> know<00:02:54.110> you've<00:02:54.560> got

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
acceleration tests you know you've got

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.770 
acceleration tests you know you've got
all<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.040> weight<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.340> fuel<00:02:55.640> there<00:02:56.180> so

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
all the weight of the fuel there so

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.510 
all the weight of the fuel there so
that's<00:02:56.960> not<00:02:57.140> going<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.380> affect<00:02:57.590> anything<00:02:57.860> the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
that's not going to affect anything the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.980 
that's not going to affect anything the
car<00:02:58.730> was<00:02:58.910> warmed<00:02:59.240> up<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.540> that's<00:02:59.720> kind<00:02:59.930> of

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
car was warmed up and that's kind of

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.450 
car was warmed up and that's kind of
critical<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.440> want<00:03:00.620> all<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.890> coolant<00:03:01.340> and

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
critical you want all the coolant and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.100 
critical you want all the coolant and
the<00:03:01.520> oil<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.940> be<00:03:01.970> at<00:03:02.450> operating<00:03:02.930> temperature

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
the oil to be at operating temperature

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.960 
the oil to be at operating temperature
that<00:03:03.740> will<00:03:03.830> definitely<00:03:04.010> change<00:03:04.460> your

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
that will definitely change your

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.840 
that will definitely change your
acceleration<00:03:05.480> if<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:06.140> not<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.590> same<00:03:06.920> this

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
acceleration if it's not the same this

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.300 
acceleration if it's not the same this
was<00:03:07.970> all<00:03:08.120> done<00:03:08.270> on<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.450> same<00:03:08.750> road<00:03:09.200> from<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
was all done on the same road from the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.100 
was all done on the same road from the
same<00:03:10.550> starting<00:03:11.000> point<00:03:11.300> in<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.870> same

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
same starting point in the same

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.650 
same starting point in the same
direction<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.770> all<00:03:12.980> my<00:03:13.340> second<00:03:13.760> gear<00:03:14.000> tests

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
direction so all my second gear tests

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.480 
direction so all my second gear tests
start<00:03:15.230> at<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.380> same<00:03:15.530> point<00:03:15.800> on<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.070> same<00:03:16.310> road

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
start at the same point on the same road

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.520 
start at the same point on the same road
going<00:03:16.700> in<00:03:16.880> same<00:03:17.420> direction<00:03:17.600> on<00:03:17.960> my<00:03:18.260> third<00:03:18.500> year

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
going in same direction on my third year

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.680 
going in same direction on my third year
same<00:03:19.370> road<00:03:19.640> but<00:03:19.940> different<00:03:20.270> direction<00:03:20.570> is

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
same road but different direction is

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.930 
same road but different direction is
just<00:03:20.720> coming<00:03:21.140> back<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:22.370> basically<00:03:22.610> all<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
just coming back but basically all the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.550 
just coming back but basically all the
third<00:03:23.120> gear<00:03:23.270> tests<00:03:23.660> are<00:03:23.780> done<00:03:23.930> one<00:03:24.170> direction

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
third gear tests are done one direction

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.200 
third gear tests are done one direction
all<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.740> second<00:03:25.100> gear<00:03:25.220> tests<00:03:25.490> are<00:03:25.610> done<00:03:25.970> what

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
all the second gear tests are done what

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.120 
all the second gear tests are done what
one<00:03:26.480> direction<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.230> that's<00:03:27.320> eliminating<00:03:27.920> any

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
one direction so that's eliminating any

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.010 
one direction so that's eliminating any
variables<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.790> could<00:03:28.940> occur<00:03:29.210> due<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
variables that could occur due to the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.660 
variables that could occur due to the
road<00:03:30.200> conditions<00:03:30.800> you<00:03:31.130> know<00:03:31.250> going<00:03:31.460> uphill

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
road conditions you know going uphill

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.790 
road conditions you know going uphill
downhill<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.810> fairly<00:03:33.080> flat<00:03:33.350> road<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.740> I

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
downhill it is a fairly flat road that I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.440 
downhill it is a fairly flat road that I
chose<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:34.370> basically<00:03:34.940> tried<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.270> eliminate

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
chose so basically tried to eliminate

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.260 
chose so basically tried to eliminate
all<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.350> those<00:03:36.500> factors<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.520> that<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.850> only

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
all of those factors so that the only

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.090 
all of those factors so that the only
difference<00:03:38.720> between<00:03:39.110> these<00:03:39.230> few<00:03:39.470> tests<00:03:39.800> will

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
difference between these few tests will

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.740 
difference between these few tests will
be<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.460> weight<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.240> will<00:03:41.360> give<00:03:41.510> us<00:03:41.540> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
be the weight and that will give us the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.930 
be the weight and that will give us the
actual<00:03:41.960> improvement<00:03:42.620> from<00:03:43.100> removing<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.850> way

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
actual improvement from removing the way

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.850 
actual improvement from removing the way
so<00:03:44.510> let's<00:03:44.780> check<00:03:44.960> out<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:45.170> first<00:03:45.320> test<00:03:45.590> this

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
so let's check out the first test this

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.310 
so let's check out the first test this
will<00:03:45.980> be<00:03:46.070> second<00:03:46.490> gear<00:03:46.930> accelerating<00:03:47.930> from<00:03:48.050> 20

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
will be second gear accelerating from 20

00:03:48.320 --> 00:04:03.410 
will be second gear accelerating from 20
to<00:03:48.350> 40<00:03:48.590> before<00:03:49.070> removing<00:03:49.880> any<00:03:50.090> weight

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.729 

so<00:04:04.420> that<00:04:04.690> may<00:04:04.810> have<00:04:04.900> been<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.080> bit<00:04:05.260> fast<00:04:05.560> to

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
so that may have been a bit fast to

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.550 
so that may have been a bit fast to
watch<00:04:05.920> but<00:04:06.250> every<00:04:06.730> run<00:04:07.000> was<00:04:07.330> exactly<00:04:07.840> 3.1

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
watch but every run was exactly 3.1

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.710 
watch but every run was exactly 3.1
seconds<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.580> test<00:04:09.790> was<00:04:09.970> incredibly

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
seconds so the test was incredibly

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.420 
seconds so the test was incredibly
repeatable<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.319> that's<00:04:11.440> something<00:04:12.159> kind<00:04:12.340> of

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
repeatable and that's something kind of

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.460 
repeatable and that's something kind of
hard<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.790> do<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:13.690> showing<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.110> all<00:04:14.349> of

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
hard to do and it's showing that all of

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.809 
hard to do and it's showing that all of
these<00:04:14.590> factors<00:04:14.830> that<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.280> kind<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.519> put<00:04:15.700> in

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
these factors that I kind of put in

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.610 
these factors that I kind of put in
designing<00:04:16.449> the<00:04:16.660> test<00:04:16.900> are<00:04:17.109> actually<00:04:17.380> working

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
designing the test are actually working

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.289 
designing the test are actually working
because<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.459> test<00:04:18.669> is<00:04:18.790> where<00:04:18.940> people<00:04:19.209> were

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
because the test is where people were

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.360 
because the test is where people were
not<00:04:19.329> getting<00:04:19.449> differences<00:04:20.169> in<00:04:20.350> time<00:04:20.560> with<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
not getting differences in time with the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.150 
not getting differences in time with the
stock<00:04:21.669> run<00:04:22.000> from<00:04:22.479> second<00:04:22.900> gear<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.770> it's

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
stock run from second gear and it's

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.400 
stock run from second gear and it's
pretty<00:04:24.400> incredible<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.880> me<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.990> was<00:04:26.139> the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
pretty incredible to me that it was the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.100 
pretty incredible to me that it was the
same<00:04:26.620> 3.1<00:04:27.250> seconds<00:04:27.639> for<00:04:27.790> all<00:04:27.820> three<00:04:28.180> runs<00:04:28.419> and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
same 3.1 seconds for all three runs and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.110 
same 3.1 seconds for all three runs and
the<00:04:29.440> way<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.590> measured<00:04:30.070> this<00:04:30.220> was<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.699> took<00:04:30.970> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
the way I measured this was I took the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.659 
the way I measured this was I took the
frames<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.650> very<00:04:32.860> first<00:04:33.039> frame<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.580> it

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
frames so the very first frame that it

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.310 
frames so the very first frame that it
hit<00:04:33.820> 20<00:04:34.120> miles<00:04:34.270> per<00:04:34.389> hour<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:35.050> was<00:04:35.199> my

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
hit 20 miles per hour that was my

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.140 
hit 20 miles per hour that was my
starting<00:04:35.650> point<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.220> last<00:04:36.430> frame<00:04:36.760> was<00:04:36.970> when

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
starting point the last frame was when

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.090 
starting point the last frame was when
the<00:04:37.449> speedometer<00:04:37.900> hits<00:04:37.960> 40<00:04:38.680> miles<00:04:38.860> per<00:04:38.949> hour

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
the speedometer hits 40 miles per hour

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.740 
the speedometer hits 40 miles per hour
and<00:04:39.520> basically<00:04:39.820> each<00:04:40.030> frame<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.570> one

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
and basically each frame is one

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.689 
and basically each frame is one
thirtieth<00:04:41.199> of<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.620> second<00:04:42.039> because<00:04:42.130> it's<00:04:42.430> 30

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
thirtieth of a second because it's 30

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.730 
thirtieth of a second because it's 30
frames<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.330> second<00:04:43.750> so<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.199> took<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.530> total

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
frames in a second so I took the total

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.560 
frames in a second so I took the total
number<00:04:45.039> of<00:04:45.070> frames<00:04:45.370> multiplied<00:04:46.120> by<00:04:46.330> one

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
number of frames multiplied by one

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.120 
number of frames multiplied by one
thirtieth<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.110> second<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.889> gives<00:04:48.070> me

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
thirtieth of a second and that gives me

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.710 
thirtieth of a second and that gives me
the<00:04:48.280> total<00:04:48.430> duration<00:04:48.820> so<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.449> all<00:04:49.539> going<00:04:49.690> to

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
the total duration so it's all going to

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.659 
the total duration so it's all going to
be<00:04:49.780> in<00:04:49.870> increments<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.590> one<00:04:50.949> thirtieth<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.550> a

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
be in increments of one thirtieth of a

00:04:51.669 --> 00:05:10.219 
be in increments of one thirtieth of a
second

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.200 

so<00:05:10.889> for<00:05:11.129> our<00:05:11.159> third<00:05:11.219> year<00:05:11.520> runs<00:05:11.909> with<00:05:12.090> the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
so for our third year runs with the

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.809 
so for our third year runs with the
stock<00:05:12.509> weight<00:05:12.840> we've<00:05:13.110> got<00:05:13.319> an<00:05:13.499> average<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.919> 4.7

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
stock weight we've got an average of 4.7

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.369 
stock weight we've got an average of 4.7
seconds<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.419> there<00:05:15.779> was<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:15.900> little<00:05:16.169> bit<00:05:16.259> more

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
seconds and there was a little bit more

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.869 
seconds and there was a little bit more
variability<00:05:16.919> than<00:05:17.069> second<00:05:17.430> year<00:05:17.580> but<00:05:17.699> it<00:05:17.789> was

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
variability than second year but it was

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:31.510 
variability than second year but it was
all<00:05:18.060> within<00:05:18.300> two<00:05:18.689> frames

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.190 

so<00:05:32.520> with<00:05:32.790> the<00:05:32.940> weight<00:05:33.090> reduction<00:05:33.630> in<00:05:33.750> second

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
so with the weight reduction in second

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.950 
so with the weight reduction in second
gear<00:05:34.410> we<00:05:34.800> have<00:05:34.920> an<00:05:35.010> average<00:05:35.160> time<00:05:35.460> of<00:05:35.640> 2.9<00:05:36.180> 67

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
gear we have an average time of 2.9 67

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.900 
gear we have an average time of 2.9 67
now<00:05:37.290> once<00:05:37.590> again<00:05:37.710> all<00:05:38.160> of<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.430> tests<00:05:38.700> were<00:05:38.790> the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
now once again all of the tests were the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.180 
now once again all of the tests were the
exact<00:05:39.360> same<00:05:39.480> duration<00:05:39.960> which<00:05:40.560> is<00:05:40.590> awesome

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
exact same duration which is awesome

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.310 
exact same duration which is awesome
because<00:05:41.430> that's<00:05:42.090> just<00:05:42.330> very<00:05:42.450> hard<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.020> do<00:05:43.140> to

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
because that's just very hard to do to

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.010 
because that's just very hard to do to
get<00:05:43.440> perfectly<00:05:44.160> repeatable<00:05:44.700> tests<00:05:45.150> so<00:05:45.900> it's

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
get perfectly repeatable tests so it's

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.270 
get perfectly repeatable tests so it's
very<00:05:46.140> cool<00:05:46.440> they<00:05:46.740> were<00:05:46.800> all<00:05:46.950> at<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.070> same<00:05:47.220> time

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
very cool they were all at the same time

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.620 
very cool they were all at the same time
and<00:05:47.760> that<00:05:48.060> gives<00:05:48.240> us<00:05:48.360> an<00:05:48.480> accurate

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
and that gives us an accurate

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.660 
and that gives us an accurate
representation<00:05:49.170> of<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.740> difference<00:05:50.460> in

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
representation of the difference in

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.710 
representation of the difference in
weight<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.300> difference<00:05:51.600> in

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
weight and the difference in

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:09.900 
weight and the difference in
acceleration

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.940 

so<00:06:10.540> now<00:06:10.780> that<00:06:10.870> we've<00:06:11.020> completed<00:06:11.470> all<00:06:11.680> of<00:06:11.860> the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
so now that we've completed all of the

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.470 
so now that we've completed all of the
tests<00:06:12.340> we<00:06:12.370> can<00:06:12.640> actually<00:06:12.790> look<00:06:13.030> at<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.360> real

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
tests we can actually look at the real

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.720 
tests we can actually look at the real
differences<00:06:13.990> between<00:06:14.200> them<00:06:14.500> all<00:06:14.620> so<00:06:15.220> for<00:06:15.610> our

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
differences between them all so for our

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.380 
differences between them all so for our
second<00:06:16.210> gear<00:06:16.420> and<00:06:16.450> for<00:06:17.200> the<00:06:18.160> stock<00:06:18.430> versus<00:06:18.940> the

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
second gear and for the stock versus the

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.210 
second gear and for the stock versus the
weight<00:06:19.960> removed<00:06:20.380> we've<00:06:20.800> got<00:06:20.950> a<00:06:20.980> time

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
weight removed we've got a time

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.630 
weight removed we've got a time
difference<00:06:21.580> of<00:06:21.700> 0.1<00:06:21.820> 3<00:06:22.570> 3<00:06:22.840> seconds<00:06:23.320> so<00:06:23.800> 0.133

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
difference of 0.1 3 3 seconds so 0.133

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.700 
difference of 0.1 3 3 seconds so 0.133
seconds<00:06:25.270> over<00:06:25.750> an<00:06:25.840> eighth<00:06:26.020> of<00:06:26.230> a<00:06:26.320> second

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
seconds over an eighth of a second

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.190 
seconds over an eighth of a second
removed<00:06:27.100> simply<00:06:27.820> by<00:06:27.940> taking<00:06:28.180> out<00:06:28.510> 84<00:06:28.990> pounds

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
removed simply by taking out 84 pounds

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.900 
removed simply by taking out 84 pounds
from<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.560> car<00:06:29.860> which<00:06:30.340> you<00:06:30.370> know<00:06:30.580> maybe<00:06:30.790> that

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
from the car which you know maybe that

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.980 
from the car which you know maybe that
doesn't<00:06:31.270> sound<00:06:31.360> like<00:06:31.480> a<00:06:31.600> whole<00:06:31.810> lot<00:06:31.840> but

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
doesn't sound like a whole lot but

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.690 
doesn't sound like a whole lot but
that's<00:06:32.530> pretty<00:06:32.680> significant<00:06:33.250> I<00:06:33.280> mean<00:06:33.430> this<00:06:33.520> is

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
that's pretty significant I mean this is

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.610 
that's pretty significant I mean this is
only<00:06:33.820> a<00:06:33.910> 20<00:06:34.510> mile<00:06:34.660> per<00:06:34.870> hour<00:06:34.930> difference<00:06:35.440> and

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
only a 20 mile per hour difference and

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.470 
only a 20 mile per hour difference and
you're<00:06:35.710> talking<00:06:36.010> about<00:06:36.190> saving<00:06:36.490> over<00:06:37.180> a<00:06:37.210> 10th

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
you're talking about saving over a 10th

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.630 
you're talking about saving over a 10th
of<00:06:37.600> a<00:06:37.720> second<00:06:38.170> so<00:06:38.560> I<00:06:38.590> mean<00:06:38.860> if<00:06:39.070> you're<00:06:39.310> going<00:06:39.490> to

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
of a second so I mean if you're going to

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.580 
of a second so I mean if you're going to
60<00:06:39.970> miles<00:06:40.150> per<00:06:40.270> hour<00:06:40.450> and<00:06:40.750> that<00:06:40.780> could<00:06:41.050> be<00:06:41.200> you

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
60 miles per hour and that could be you

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.680 
60 miles per hour and that could be you
know<00:06:41.650> around<00:06:42.060> 0.3<00:06:43.060> seconds<00:06:43.480> that<00:06:43.630> you're

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
know around 0.3 seconds that you're

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.260 
know around 0.3 seconds that you're
shaving<00:06:43.960> off<00:06:44.230> your<00:06:44.710> 60<00:06:45.190> if<00:06:45.850> that<00:06:46.090> does

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
shaving off your 60 if that does

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.150 
shaving off your 60 if that does
translate<00:06:46.750> pretty<00:06:46.990> well<00:06:47.230> across<00:06:47.590> throughout

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
translate pretty well across throughout

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.920 
translate pretty well across throughout
that<00:06:48.370> range<00:06:48.580> of<00:06:48.760> 0<00:06:49.000> to<00:06:49.060> 60<00:06:49.330> miles<00:06:49.480> per<00:06:49.570> hour<00:06:49.690> so

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
that range of 0 to 60 miles per hour so

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.220 
that range of 0 to 60 miles per hour so
that's<00:06:50.110> actually<00:06:50.260> pretty<00:06:50.620> significant<00:06:51.190> 0.133

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
that's actually pretty significant 0.133

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.840 
that's actually pretty significant 0.133
seconds<00:06:53.230> for<00:06:53.710> our<00:06:53.830> 3rd<00:06:54.100> year<00:06:54.340> the<00:06:54.580> time

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360
