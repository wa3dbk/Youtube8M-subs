was<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.390> did<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.540> right<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.960> Kepler

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
was the one that did it right not Kepler

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
of the anxiety and stress that's it's

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.950 
of the anxiety and stress that's it's
coming<00:01:59.170> from<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.920> whole<00:02:00.100> toilet<00:02:00.310> thing<00:02:00.960> so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
coming from the whole toilet thing so

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.570 
coming from the whole toilet thing so
that's<00:02:02.170> that's<00:02:02.410> kind<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.950> I'm<00:02:03.130> guessing<00:02:03.310> but

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
that's that's kind of I'm guessing but

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.840 
that's that's kind of I'm guessing but
when<00:02:03.700> we<00:02:03.790> give<00:02:04.120> him<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.570> wet<00:02:05.200> food<00:02:05.670> he<00:02:06.670> won't

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
when we give him the wet food he won't

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.020 
when we give him the wet food he won't
eat<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.290> he<00:02:08.290> will<00:02:08.560> know<00:02:09.130> who<00:02:09.369> might<00:02:09.580> start<00:02:09.910> to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
eat it he will know who might start to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.550 
eat it he will know who might start to
kind<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.390> lick<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.899> then<00:02:11.350> he<00:02:11.470> immediately

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
kind of lick it and then he immediately

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.540 
kind of lick it and then he immediately
like<00:02:12.100> tries<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.490> cover<00:02:12.670> up<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.000> bowl<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:14.550> we

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
like tries to cover up the bowl and we

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.640 
like tries to cover up the bowl and we
thought<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.420> maybe<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.840> was<00:02:16.870> several

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
thought that maybe it was several

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.100 
thought that maybe it was several
factors<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.240> can't<00:02:22.810> really<00:02:22.900> find

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
factors and the I I I can't really find

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.080 
factors and the I I I can't really find
a<00:02:23.260> rhyme<00:02:23.410> or<00:02:23.560> reason<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.980> we<00:02:24.820> give<00:02:24.970> them

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
a rhyme or reason to it we give them

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.940 
a rhyme or reason to it we give them
half<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:26.320> put<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> fridge<00:02:26.800> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
half a can and we put in the fridge and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.230 
half a can and we put in the fridge and
give<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.220> him<00:02:27.340> later<00:02:27.520> we<00:02:27.820> thought<00:02:28.030> that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
give it to him later we thought that

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.660 
give it to him later we thought that
maybe<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:29.410> problem<00:02:29.620> was<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.459> food's

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
maybe the problem was that the food's

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.040 
maybe the problem was that the food's
cold<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.300> he<00:02:31.390> didn't<00:02:31.630> want<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.780> eat<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.930> because

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
cold so he didn't want to eat it because

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.580 
cold so he didn't want to eat it because
it's<00:02:32.290> cold<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:34.390> gave<00:02:34.600> them<00:02:34.840> more

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
it's cold but we gave them more

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.650 
it's cold but we gave them more
room-temperature<00:02:36.340> food<00:02:36.670> again<00:02:36.970> still<00:02:37.570> won't

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
room-temperature food again still won't

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.440 
room-temperature food again still won't
eat<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.959> we<00:02:38.860> thought<00:02:39.040> maybe<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.430> was<00:02:39.580> Sagan

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
eat it we thought maybe it was Sagan

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.060 
eat it we thought maybe it was Sagan
being<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.780> there<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.230> gave<00:02:41.350> him<00:02:41.590> his<00:02:41.650> food

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
being in there so we gave him his food

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.900 
being in there so we gave him his food
separate<00:02:42.490> from<00:02:42.610> Sagan<00:02:43.470> wouldn't<00:02:44.470> eat<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.910> so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
separate from Sagan wouldn't eat it so

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.860 
separate from Sagan wouldn't eat it so
what<00:02:46.030> I'm<00:02:46.120> guessing<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.570> he's<00:02:46.810> having

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
what I'm guessing is that he's having

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.660 
what I'm guessing is that he's having
anxiety<00:02:47.290> about<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:47.980> whole<00:02:48.130> toilet<00:02:48.400> issue

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
anxiety about this whole toilet issue

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.000 
anxiety about this whole toilet issue
and<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.300> causing<00:02:49.990> loss<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.890> appetite

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
and it's causing loss of appetite

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.310 
and it's causing loss of appetite
although<00:02:51.910> he<00:02:52.060> will<00:02:52.240> eat<00:02:52.390> dry<00:02:52.660> food<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.140> fact

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
although he will eat dry food in fact

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.250 
although he will eat dry food in fact
when<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.280> gave<00:02:54.550> him<00:02:54.730> his<00:02:54.850> wet<00:02:55.120> food<00:02:55.360> yesterday

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
when I gave him his wet food yesterday

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.680 
when I gave him his wet food yesterday
he<00:02:57.250> he<00:02:57.610> nibbled<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.090> little<00:02:58.269> bit<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.570> then

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
he he nibbled it a little bit and then

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.180 
he he nibbled it a little bit and then
just<00:02:58.840> stopped<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.230> started<00:02:59.530> eating<00:02:59.560> dry<00:02:59.950> food

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
just stopped and started eating dry food

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.810 
just stopped and started eating dry food
so<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.430> don't<00:03:00.670> know<00:03:00.760> what's<00:03:00.970> up<00:03:01.120> with<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.239> but

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
so I don't know what's up with that but

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.930 
so I don't know what's up with that but
whatever<00:03:04.800> he's<00:03:05.800> probably<00:03:06.010> standing<00:03:06.519> in<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
whatever he's probably standing in the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.690 
whatever he's probably standing in the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
just fine but maybe I should start

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.409

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.680 
not to be completely fair I was talking
about<00:05:40.250> this<00:05:40.490> little<00:05:40.639> earlier<00:05:41.030> but<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.570> know

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
about this little earlier but you know

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.149 
about this little earlier but you know
there<00:05:41.810> has<00:05:41.930> been<00:05:41.960> some<00:05:42.139> anxiety<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:42.919> stress

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
there has been some anxiety and stress

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.310 
there has been some anxiety and stress
from<00:05:43.789> switching<00:05:44.060> to<00:05:44.270> this<00:05:44.389> new<00:05:44.720> litter<00:05:45.080> thing

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
from switching to this new litter thing

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.640 
from switching to this new litter thing
in<00:05:45.710> addition<00:05:46.520> to<00:05:46.669> that<00:05:47.229> he<00:05:48.229> hasn't<00:05:48.560> been

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
in addition to that he hasn't been

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.189 
in addition to that he hasn't been
pooping<00:05:49.130> a<00:05:49.190> lot<00:05:49.729> so<00:05:50.449> maybe<00:05:50.750> he's<00:05:50.990> got<00:05:51.139> a

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
pooping a lot so maybe he's got a

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.960 
pooping a lot so maybe he's got a
stomachache<00:05:51.800> and<00:05:52.070> hasn't<00:05:52.370> really<00:05:52.639> been<00:05:52.849> in

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
stomachache and hasn't really been in

the<00:05:53.000> mood<00:05:53.180> to<00:05:53.270> eat<00:05:53.330> because<00:05:53.840> he<00:05:53.870> is<00:05:54.800> kind<00:05:55.159> of

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
the mood to eat because he is kind of

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.490

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
went and did his business earlier

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.309 
went and did his business earlier
without<00:06:43.280> me<00:06:43.639> having<00:06:43.819> to<00:06:44.090> coax<00:06:44.659> him<00:06:44.840> to<00:06:44.900> do<00:06:45.139> it

without me having to coax him to do it

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.529 
without me having to coax him to do it
so<00:06:45.530> I<00:06:45.770> think<00:06:46.669> it's<00:06:46.789> gonna<00:06:46.909> work<00:06:47.120> it's<00:06:47.449> gonna

guys get this vlog probably already know

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.379

that<00:06:59.830> the<00:07:00.830> tourists<00:07:01.520> were<00:07:01.909> supposed<00:07:02.210> to<00:07:02.270> be

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:02.389 
that the tourists were supposed to be

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.719 
that the tourists were supposed to be
like<00:07:02.479> a<00:07:02.539> 4-hour<00:07:02.960> map<00:07:03.289> and<00:07:03.740> then<00:07:03.889> it<00:07:04.009> ended<00:07:04.639> up

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:04.729 
like a 4-hour map and then it ended up

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:08.709 
like a 4-hour map and then it ended up
being<00:07:04.940> a<00:07:05.620> two-hour<00:07:06.620> map<00:07:06.860> and<00:07:07.419> it's<00:07:08.419> probably

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:08.719 
being a two-hour map and it's probably

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.680
