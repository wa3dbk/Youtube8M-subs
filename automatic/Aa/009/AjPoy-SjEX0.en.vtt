 leave in the description for this video and there I am 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 I show how I draw this picture from 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 the very beginning from the primary sketch to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.529
 finished carcass vova contour in this 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.029

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.230
 scanned 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.510
 and stuck in photoshop first i separate 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.990
 shower circuit from the sheet how to do it 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.730
 I show in detail here in this video 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.309
 Along the way, I'm still modifying all kinds of shoals 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.270
 If they of course are and I do not draw 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.270
 gripping parts 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.980
 then i paint the picture in shades 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.440
 gray 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.390
 I lay out in tones to understand what 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.390
 I will be dark that will be light 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.869
 speed 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.090
 after that i start looking for myself 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.130
 some kind of palette which most 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.049
 this picture links to 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.209
 the resources that I use will leave in 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.280
 description of this video I usually find 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.200
 favorite picture on the internet do 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.420
 printscreen for his very photoshop 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.549
 the label is picking up colors from there then I 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.680
 starting to apply colors over tone 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.600
 the gray layer which I have already done 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.910
 Naturally the palette that they won 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.799
 Churov that I do not use it right at all 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.830
 one hundred percent accurate colors then 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.530
 I twist-twist dropwise, I will always want 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.299
 I paint the contour also do not 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.920
 it seems to me black 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.920
 it turns out softer and more alive 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.480
 Well, actually everything when I decided to 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.549
 fill in the blanks with colors to 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.680
 the composition looked more holistic 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.450
 slightly turned the color settings 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.489
 Photoshop and voila 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.959
