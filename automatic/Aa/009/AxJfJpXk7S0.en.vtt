00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240 

hey<00:00:00.420> everyone<00:00:00.960> and<00:00:01.199> today<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.740> want<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.100> show

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hey everyone and today I want to show

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.679 
hey everyone and today I want to show
you<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.370> design<00:00:02.730> I've<00:00:02.909> made<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.419> daylight

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
you a design I've made for a daylight

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.480 
you a design I've made for a daylight
sensor<00:00:04.110> button<00:00:04.380> so<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.920> idea<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.220> this

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
sensor button so the idea is that this

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.039 
sensor button so the idea is that this
left<00:00:05.819> daylight<00:00:06.210> sensor<00:00:06.540> right<00:00:06.690> here<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.020> a

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
left daylight sensor right here is a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.169 
left daylight sensor right here is a
trigger<00:00:07.440> daylight<00:00:07.770> sensor<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.340> every<00:00:08.940> time

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
trigger daylight sensor and every time

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.580 
trigger daylight sensor and every time
to<00:00:09.360> read<00:00:09.480> right<00:00:09.719> click<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.349> we're<00:00:10.500> gonna

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
to read right click on it we're gonna

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.680 
to read right click on it we're gonna
get<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.860> quick<00:00:11.130> pulse<00:00:11.370> out<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.820> much<00:00:12.330> like<00:00:12.540> we

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
get a quick pulse out of it much like we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.690 
get a quick pulse out of it much like we
would<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> button<00:00:13.469> right<00:00:14.160> now<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.370> have

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
would out of a button right now and have

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.400 
would out of a button right now and have
it<00:00:14.730> activating<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.599> lamp<00:00:15.870> here<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
it activating this lamp here in the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.470 
it activating this lamp here in the
center<00:00:16.710> but<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.279> course<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.940> go<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
center but of course we get out it go to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.740 
center but of course we get out it go to
anything<00:00:18.869> one<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.180> video<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.630> in

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
anything one so this video is in

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
anything one so this video is in
response<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> video<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.859> Exuma<00:00:23.279> put<00:00:23.430> out

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
response to a video that Exuma put out

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.950 
response to a video that Exuma put out
yesterday<00:00:23.939> where<00:00:24.180> he<00:00:24.210> should<00:00:24.510> add<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.810> light

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
yesterday where he should add a light

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.599 
yesterday where he should add a light
sensor<00:00:25.350> button<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.800> he<00:00:26.130> was<00:00:26.220> looking<00:00:26.430> for

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
sensor button and he was looking for

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.759 
sensor button and he was looking for
ways<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.789> compact<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.840> by<00:00:28.230> far<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.529> most

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
ways to compact it and by far the most

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.980 
ways to compact it and by far the most
commented<00:00:29.400> thing<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.699> his<00:00:29.849> video<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.660> asking

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
commented thing on his video was asking

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.359 
commented thing on his video was asking
him<00:00:31.080> why<00:00:31.230> he<00:00:31.349> didn't<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> bud<00:00:31.949> switch<00:00:32.160> for

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
him why he didn't use a bud switch for

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
him why he didn't use a bud switch for
the<00:00:32.460> design<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.450> right<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> flood

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the design so right now we have a flood

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.840 
the design so right now we have a flood
switch<00:00:34.500> right<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.579> place<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
switch right here but if we place a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.549 
switch right here but if we place a
daylight<00:00:36.210> sensor<00:00:36.390> next<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> gonna

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
daylight sensor next to it are you gonna

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.020 
daylight sensor next to it are you gonna
see<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> piston<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.340> stays<00:00:38.579> extended

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
see the piston just stays extended

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.549 
see the piston just stays extended
that's<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> daylight<00:00:40.200> sensor

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that's because the daylight sensor

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920 
that's because the daylight sensor
outputs<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> redstone<00:00:41.760> signal<00:00:41.910> next<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.809> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
outputs a redstone signal next to it so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
outputs a redstone signal next to it so
you<00:00:43.020> can't<00:00:43.260> use<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> piston<00:00:43.890> right<00:00:44.070> next<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you can't use a piston right next to the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
you can't use a piston right next to the
daylight<00:00:44.730> sensor<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.050> gonna

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
daylight sensor because it's just gonna

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.420 
daylight sensor because it's just gonna
always<00:00:46.469> stay<00:00:46.649> powered<00:00:47.010> you're<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.340> gonna

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
always stay powered you're not gonna

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
always stay powered you're not gonna
build<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> tell<00:00:47.940> when<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.239> update<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
build a tell when you update it there is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.990 
build a tell when you update it there is
a<00:00:49.710> bit<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.190> workaround<00:00:50.550> though<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.879> can

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a bit of a workaround though we can

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
a bit of a workaround though we can
actually<00:00:51.300> detect<00:00:51.739> redstone<00:00:52.739> dust<00:00:52.920> signal

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
actually detect redstone dust signal

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
actually detect redstone dust signal
strength<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> bud<00:00:54.360> switch<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.989> whenever

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
strength with the bud switch so whenever

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080 
strength with the bud switch so whenever
we<00:00:55.739> right-click<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.399> daylight<00:00:56.699> sensor

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
we right-click on this daylight sensor

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
we right-click on this daylight sensor
the<00:00:57.600> redstone<00:00:57.960> dust<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the redstone dust here is going to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.740 
the redstone dust here is going to
change<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.309> signal<00:00:59.640> strength<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.629> can

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
change the signal strength and we can

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.599 
change the signal strength and we can
detect<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> bud<00:01:02.010> switch<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
detect that with the bud switch and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.640 
detect that with the bud switch and
since<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> redstone<00:01:03.719> dust<00:01:03.870> isn't<00:01:04.110> facing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
since the redstone dust isn't facing

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.039 
since the redstone dust isn't facing
into<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> piston<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> stay

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
into the piston it's not going to stay

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.929 
into the piston it's not going to stay
extended<00:01:07.380> permanently<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.610> actually

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
extended permanently so we can actually

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.179 
extended permanently so we can actually
detect<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.479> using<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> bud<00:01:10.470> switch<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
detect it using a bud switch with this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.490 
detect it using a bud switch with this
little<00:01:11.490> workaround<00:01:11.840> now<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.200> detect

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
little workaround now that we can detect

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
little workaround now that we can detect
when<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.010> daylight<00:01:14.369> sensor<00:01:14.729> has<00:01:14.909> an<00:01:15.060> update

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
when the daylight sensor has an update

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.510 
when the daylight sensor has an update
we<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.439> make<00:01:16.619> sure<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.040> updating

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
we have to make sure that it's updating

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.740 
we have to make sure that it's updating
because<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.909> player<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.299> clicks<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
because the player right clicks on it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.050 
because the player right clicks on it
and<00:01:18.960> not<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.400> day<00:01:20.610> changes

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and not because the time of day changes

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.700 
and not because the time of day changes
so<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.330> see<00:01:21.600> every<00:01:22.259> time<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.500> right-click

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so you can see every time we right-click

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.590 
so you can see every time we right-click
here<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> lamp<00:01:23.340> turns<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.390> change

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
here the lamp turns on but if we change

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
here the lamp turns on but if we change
the<00:01:24.720> time<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> day<00:01:25.070> even<00:01:26.070> though<00:01:26.159> these<00:01:26.310> buds

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the time of day even though these buds

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.580 
the time of day even though these buds
which<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.850> activate<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.810> lamp<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.259> stays

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
which is activate the lamp here stays

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
which is activate the lamp here stays
off<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.430> where<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> redstone<00:01:30.119> comes

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
off and that's where the redstone comes

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.330 
off and that's where the redstone comes
in<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.560> built<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.189> little

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
in so this has just built up a little

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.560 
in so this has just built up a little
bit<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.030> what's<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.479> on

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
bit so you can see what's going on

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.960 
bit so you can see what's going on
underground<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:35.310> see<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:35.729> right

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
underground and you can see if we right

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.789 
underground and you can see if we right
click<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.509> daylight<00:01:36.869> sensor<00:01:37.229> what's

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
click on this daylight sensor what's

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.679 
click on this daylight sensor what's
gonna<00:01:37.950> happen<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> turn<00:01:39.450> on

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
gonna happen is this is going to turn on

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.109 
gonna happen is this is going to turn on
the<00:01:40.409> torch<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.189> will<00:01:41.369> turn<00:01:41.549> off<00:01:41.820> along<00:01:42.060> with

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the torch here will turn off along with

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.389 
the torch here will turn off along with
the<00:01:42.299> redstone<00:01:42.630> dust<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.770> torch<00:01:44.100> there

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the redstone dust and that torch there

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.850 
the redstone dust and that torch there
our<00:01:44.850> center<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:46.079> output<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.710> every

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
our center one is the output so every

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.319 
our center one is the output so every
time<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.100> right-click<00:01:47.280> we're<00:01:47.970> gonna<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
time we right-click we're gonna get a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.810 
time we right-click we're gonna get a
pulse<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> time<00:01:50.640> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
pulse but if we have to do the time of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.819 
pulse but if we have to do the time of
day<00:01:51.030> both<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.810> these<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> activate

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
day both of these are going to activate

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.780 
day both of these are going to activate
and<00:01:53.040> that's<00:01:53.159> when<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.399> need<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> make<00:01:53.729> sure

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and that's when we need to make sure

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.450 
and that's when we need to make sure
that<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.210> torch<00:01:54.479> stays<00:01:54.780> off<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.979> even<00:01:56.250> though

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that this torch stays off so even though

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.039 
that this torch stays off so even though
this<00:01:56.640> torch<00:01:56.909> turns<00:01:57.090> off<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> same<00:01:57.810> time

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this torch turns off at the same time

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.959 
this torch turns off at the same time
this<00:01:58.619> repeater<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.009> gonna<00:01:59.159> turn<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.850> it's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this repeater is gonna turn on so it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.580 
this repeater is gonna turn on so it's
going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.180> keep<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.570> redstone<00:02:00.899> dust<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
going to keep this redstone dust on and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
going to keep this redstone dust on and
keep<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.670> torch<00:02:03.030> off<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.509> means<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.869> your

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
keep this torch off that means that your

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.990 
keep this torch off that means that your
output<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.500> anywhere<00:02:05.159> along<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.640> redstone

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
output is anywhere along this redstone

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.850 
output is anywhere along this redstone
dust<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:07.079> place<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> torch<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.680> these

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
dust you just place a torch on these

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.619 
dust you just place a torch on these
blocks<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.030> want<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> invert<00:02:09.569> it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
blocks or if you want to invert it

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
blocks or if you want to invert it
signal<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.379> take<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> directly

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
signal you can just take it directly

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.870 
signal you can just take it directly
from<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.790> redstone<00:02:12.120> dust<00:02:12.270> right<00:02:12.720> here

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
from the redstone dust right here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.550 
from the redstone dust right here
and<00:02:13.970> I'm<00:02:14.780> not<00:02:14.930> gonna<00:02:15.050> show<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.260> how<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.410> build

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and I'm not gonna show you how to build

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.810 
and I'm not gonna show you how to build
this<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:15.920> think<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.280> pretty<00:02:16.640> straightforward

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
this I think it's pretty straightforward

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.930 
this I think it's pretty straightforward
and<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.320> probably<00:02:18.530> want<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.980> maybe<00:02:19.490> hide<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
and you probably want to maybe hide the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.400 
and you probably want to maybe hide the
redstone<00:02:20.420> or<00:02:20.600> change<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.960> up<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.140> little<00:02:21.200> bit

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
redstone or change it up a little bit

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.900 
redstone or change it up a little bit
depending<00:02:21.710> on<00:02:21.890> how<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.160> want<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.610> look

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
depending on how you want this to look

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.760 
depending on how you want this to look
you<00:02:23.390> might<00:02:23.540> not<00:02:23.690> want<00:02:23.900> both<00:02:24.110> daylight<00:02:24.470> sensors

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
you might not want both daylight sensors

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.070 
you might not want both daylight sensors
right<00:02:25.010> next<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.400> each<00:02:25.520> other<00:02:25.700> stuff<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.840> that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
right next to each other stuff like that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.170 
right next to each other stuff like that
but<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> couple<00:02:28.280> things<00:02:28.490> if<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.790> do<00:02:28.910> want<00:02:29.090> to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
but a couple things if you do want to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.700 
but a couple things if you do want to
build<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.900> make<00:02:30.320> sure<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.620> you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
build it just to make sure that you

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.320 
build it just to make sure that you
don't<00:02:30.860> run<00:02:30.950> into<00:02:31.130> any<00:02:31.310> problems<00:02:31.550> this

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
don't run into any problems this

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.690 
don't run into any problems this
repeaters<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:32.930> two<00:02:33.230> ticks<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.620> delay<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.130> this

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
repeaters on two ticks of delay and this

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.010 
repeaters on two ticks of delay and this
repeaters<00:02:35.060> on<00:02:35.210> three<00:02:35.510> because<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.840> have<00:02:35.930> that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
repeaters on three because you have that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.350 
repeaters on three because you have that
added<00:02:36.320> delay<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.190> torch<00:02:37.490> one<00:02:37.850> Tek<00:02:38.150> and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
added delay of the torch one Tek and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.270 
added delay of the torch one Tek and
right<00:02:39.350> here<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:39.770> have<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.980> make<00:02:40.100> sure<00:02:40.130> that

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
right here we have to make sure that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.310 
right here we have to make sure that
this<00:02:40.670> block<00:02:41.120> can't<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.630> moved<00:02:41.750> by<00:02:41.990> piston

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
this block can't be moved by piston

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.170 
this block can't be moved by piston
because<00:02:42.980> otherwise<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.580> slime<00:02:43.820> block<00:02:43.970> is

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
because otherwise the slime block is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.640 
because otherwise the slime block is
gonna<00:02:44.300> move<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.140> gonna<00:02:45.230> break<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
gonna move it and it's gonna break the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.200 
gonna move it and it's gonna break the
redstone<00:02:46.040> they're<00:02:46.250> right<00:02:46.850> here<00:02:46.970> I'm<00:02:47.060> just

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
redstone they're right here I'm just

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.240 
redstone they're right here I'm just
using<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.690> furnace<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.440> can<00:02:48.560> use<00:02:48.740> obsidian

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250
