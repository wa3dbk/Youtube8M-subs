00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:13.660
 I was designed to save the world 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:21.700
 humans contemplate the sky they 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:26.350
 saw hope this is the first 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:32.850
 thing that I would take away from them there is that 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.850
 a path to peace their extraction 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.240
 I only intended to 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.160
 protect the world I created some 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.910
 monstrous thing 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 artificial intelligence 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.230
 it's called the ultra program 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.310
 I'm tired of seeing innocents 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.310
 pay for our mistakes 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.280
 that's not why we're here for 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.500
 end the war and go home 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.930
 we 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.930
 Well, this is a mega defeat 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.570
 here we are 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.340
 nothing but our spirit and our 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.310
 will to save the world then in 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.159
 before you fight 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.939
 we will surely not feel young and 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.939
 ryan scheduled tomorrow night 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.290
 you always that I go back behind 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.290
 you boys 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.590
 we can destroy them 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.180
 inside 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.590
 really believe that you are the best 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.530
