00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.650
 go get the motorcycle road then get 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.380
 prepare something that can not forget the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 raincoat a chest of preferably 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.010
 lock with key 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 I never forget the speed glove 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.700
 Bigger and longer piloting ask 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.469
 folded care 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.719
 be clever to split the track with 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.300
 Keep trucks away to power 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.160
 react to a brake and never stay in the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.210
 side of a cart we do not know when 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.210
 She will do a conversion. 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.680
 these two have more than 10 years of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 experience on the road already cross 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.800
 continent have covered over 100 thousand 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.000
 kilometers 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.000
 everything on the bike 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.549
 the long preparation for the journey begins 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:22.130
 two to three months before 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.100
 so to make 8 to 10 thousand 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.590
 miles, we end up studying the 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.439
 where there is a gas station for 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.899
 not stay in the hand and at this distance 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.329
 how is the croup more than one? 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.369
 person means extra weight on the bike for 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.219
 This is all overloaded. 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.289
 especially the brake system that 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.939
 people work as a team on the bike one of the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.349
 tips so okay back 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.560
 this prevents you from having to hit the 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:51.530
 helmet and that you restrict 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.319
 his movements avoid walking on high 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.810
 speed and fry gently 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.879
 in a curve you have to keep the body 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.920
 as light as possible and follow the curve 

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:02.920
 along with it never the other way around 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.030
 my luggage can accommodate 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.820
 it's the clothes have to be the most 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.220
 possible that any weight in the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.020
 bike ends up hurting 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.140
 In this neighborhood we put everything in your 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.880
 Luggage is to have a suitcase for me was with 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.670
 the clothes in a suitcase for him 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.680
 the raincoats slipper and a 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.070
 necessary because makeup can not 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.070
 miss 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.760
 ten thousand kilometers with this line, let's 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.760
 see what flavia takes inside 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.310
 and the equipment has the highest 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.510
 speed more risk you run 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.510
 caprice in safety 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.850
 on the road time can suddenly change 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.770
 carries a raincoat in his luggage 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.500
 it is also very useful to 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.690
 cold once we were crossing the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.580
 past black in Chile where there are glaciers 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.580
 in January and we put a little 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.800
 snow wetsuit had to pay for the cover for 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.100
 do not freeze with the right equipment 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.230
 You will not suffer any second skin 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.270
 protects both the cold and the heat 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.790
 it serves as a thermal insulation and also 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.290
 facilitates the exit of thor already balaclava 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.290
 protects the face from the cold wind 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.190
 also prefer the tongue and 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.870
 register that better resist entry 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.480
 of water and not in gansu on the pedalboard 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.020
 longer gloves and warm too 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020
 help 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.880
 the last said never travel from visor 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.040
 smokes 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.020
 you may have left home but with sun 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.280
 if nightfall in the middle of the way goes 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:09.290
 not even see everything right prepared 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.290
 good trip and care on the road
