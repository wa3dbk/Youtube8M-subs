over<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.490> sometimes<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.150> think<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.630> little

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
over but sometimes I think it's a little

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349 
over but sometimes I think it's a little
fishy<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.070> don't<00:00:17.520> know<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:18.029> I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
fishy so I don't know what I think I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.570 
fishy so I don't know what I think I
should<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:20.460> know

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
should do about all of this you know

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.550 
should do about all of this you know
it's<00:00:20.820> really<00:00:20.970> weird<00:00:21.300> I'll<00:00:21.779> put<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> fighter<00:00:22.260> in

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
it's really weird I'll put a fighter in

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.220 
it's really weird I'll put a fighter in
the<00:00:22.590> UFC<00:00:23.029> maybe<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.300> would<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.539> better<00:00:24.869> huh

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the UFC maybe that would be better huh

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.950 
the UFC maybe that would be better huh
I'll<00:00:25.920> become<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> UFC<00:00:26.789> player<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.660> would<00:00:27.810> be

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
I'll become a UFC player that would be

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
I'll become a UFC player that would be
good<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.740> would<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:29.039> pretty<00:00:29.189> good

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
good that would be pretty good

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.840 
good that would be pretty good
completely<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.449> think<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.590> me<00:00:31.850> but

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
completely I think that would be me but

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.920 
completely I think that would be me but
then<00:00:33.239> again<00:00:33.390> maybe<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:36.300> stops

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.250 
then again maybe I need some like stops
