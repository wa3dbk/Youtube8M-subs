00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
you mix up do you have got to keep her

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.540 
you mix up do you have got to keep her
around<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> back<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.950> could<00:02:22.069> send<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.370> high

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
around the back you could send it high

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.920 
around the back you could send it high
and<00:02:22.760> leave<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.240> forget<00:02:23.300> about<00:02:23.510> it

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
and leave it and forget about it

frequencies of the high and low be these

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.590 
frequencies of the high and low be these
little<00:02:27.620> switches<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.060> actually<00:02:29.209> tune

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
little switches so you can actually tune

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.210 
little switches so you can actually tune

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.640 
the speaker high up come on I know you
can<00:02:31.459> do<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.580> by<00:02:31.790> your<00:02:31.970> mixer<00:02:32.360> with<00:02:32.480> your<00:02:32.660> EQ<00:02:33.050> but

if you want to leave it a flat response

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.809 
if you want to leave it a flat response
you<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:35.870> actually<00:02:36.020> tune<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.800> speaker<00:02:37.310> bit

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
you can actually tune the speaker bit

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.760 
you can actually tune the speaker bit
more<00:02:38.030> treble<00:02:38.330> or<00:02:38.540> let's<00:02:38.780> travel<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.290> bit<00:02:39.440> more

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
come straight out of the back if you've

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.970 
come straight out of the back if you've
got<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.580> near<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> wall<00:02:56.060> as<00:02:56.300> that<00:02:56.450> that's<00:02:56.660> that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
got it near a wall as that that's that

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.110 
got it near a wall as that that's that
sound<00:02:57.980> will<00:02:58.130> then<00:02:58.250> bounce<00:02:58.430> off<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.850> give

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
sound will then bounce off to give

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.990 
sound will then bounce off to give
almost<00:02:59.420> like<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> sub<00:03:00.050> bass<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.459> increases

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
almost like a sub bass so it increases

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880 
almost like a sub bass so it increases
the<00:03:02.300> bass<00:03:02.480> performance<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.350> speaker<00:03:03.590> some

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
the bass performance of the speaker some

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.770 
the bass performance of the speaker some
have<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.370> front<00:03:04.610> typically<00:03:05.569> there's<00:03:05.720> a

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
have it on the front typically there's a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.570 
have it on the front typically there's a
little<00:03:06.019> bit<00:03:06.140> better<00:03:06.290> on<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.620> back<00:03:06.800> especially

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
little bit better on the back especially

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.770 
little bit better on the back especially
if<00:03:07.640> you've<00:03:07.790> got<00:03:07.970> them<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.209> little<00:03:08.569> way<00:03:08.690> away

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
if you've got them a little way away

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.390 
if you've got them a little way away
from<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.230> wall<00:03:09.410> as<00:03:09.650> well<00:03:09.830> because<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.280> will

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
from a wall as well because that will

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.830 
from a wall as well because that will
rebound<00:03:10.819> off<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.030> wall<00:03:11.330> gives<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.720> that

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
rebound off the wall gives you that

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.190 
rebound off the wall gives you that
extra<00:03:11.989> warmth<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.070> need<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.750> overall

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
extra warmth that you need so overall
