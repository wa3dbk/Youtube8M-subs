are looking for a gps the advanced

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.590 
are looking for a gps the advanced
runners<00:00:16.320> will<00:00:16.770> probably<00:00:17.279> prefer<00:00:18.060> pull<00:00:18.330> are

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
runners will probably prefer pull are

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.109 
runners will probably prefer pull are
some<00:00:19.050> other<00:00:19.460> manufacturers<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.670> just<00:00:20.880> give

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
some other manufacturers but just give

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.599 
some other manufacturers but just give
you<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> quick<00:00:22.289> comparison<00:00:22.920> between<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you just a quick comparison between the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.019 
you just a quick comparison between the
two<00:00:23.990> it<00:00:24.990> will<00:00:25.140> help<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.699> decide<00:00:26.699> which<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.000> we

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
two it will help you decide which one we

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.339 
two it will help you decide which one we
want<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.480> both<00:00:28.050> are<00:00:28.349> pretty<00:00:28.500> good<00:00:28.910> units

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
want to get both are pretty good units

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.069 
want to get both are pretty good units
the<00:00:31.349> 305<00:00:31.890> been<00:00:32.160> around<00:00:32.570> for<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> little<00:00:33.780> longer

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the 305 been around for a little longer

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.889 
the 305 been around for a little longer
and<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.520> tell<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and you can tell it's you know the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.569 
and you can tell it's you know the
square<00:00:37.170> now<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> model<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
square now this is the model that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
square now this is the model that
doesn't<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> heart<00:00:39.390> rate<00:00:39.510> monitor<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
doesn't have a heart rate monitor the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.770 
doesn't have a heart rate monitor the
model<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.190> has<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> hard<00:00:41.879> water<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.300> red<00:00:42.570> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
model that has the hard water is red but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
model that has the hard water is red but
essentially<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> same<00:00:43.410> thing<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.579> 405<00:00:45.120> will

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
essentially the same thing the 405 will

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.290 
essentially the same thing the 405 will
come<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.809> two<00:00:46.230> different<00:00:46.350> colors<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.300> does

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
come in two different colors and does

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.630 
come in two different colors and does
come<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> heart<00:00:49.410> rate<00:00:49.559> monitor<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.489> can

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
come with a heart rate monitor you can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.260 
come with a heart rate monitor you can
see<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.600> form<00:00:51.840> factor<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> quite<00:00:52.980> different

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
see the form factor is a quite different

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.680 
see the form factor is a quite different
however<00:00:54.410> they<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.440> essentially<00:00:56.629> more<00:00:57.629> or

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
however they are essentially more or

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
however they are essentially more or
less<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> same<00:00:57.960> form<00:00:58.530> factor<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.280> one

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
less the same form factor but this one

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
less the same form factor but this one
is<00:00:59.550> obviously<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.329> bit<00:01:00.420> more<00:01:00.600> four<00:01:01.079> or

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
is obviously a little bit more four or

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
is obviously a little bit more four or
five<00:01:01.289> being<00:01:01.500> more<00:01:01.680> round<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:03.059> little<00:01:03.449> bit

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
five being more round and a little bit

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 
five being more round and a little bit
smaller<00:01:03.840> than<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.229> 305<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.220> other<00:01:05.369> than<00:01:05.519> that

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
smaller than the 305 but other than that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.149 
smaller than the 305 but other than that
for<00:01:06.270> size<00:01:06.510> wise<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.770> pretty<00:01:08.070> much

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
for size wise it's you know pretty much

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.100 
for size wise it's you know pretty much
the<00:01:08.310> same<00:01:08.430> thickness<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.630> little

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the same thickness is just a little

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
the same thickness is just a little
thinner<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> four<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.580> five<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
thinner so the four or five is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
thinner so the four or five is
definitely<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.720> bit<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:12.990> nicer

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
definitely a little bit more nicer

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.940 
definitely a little bit more nicer
watched<00:01:14.280> where<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.930> feel<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.590> wearing

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
watched where if you feel like wearing

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.690 
watched where if you feel like wearing
your<00:01:17.490> GPS<00:01:17.939> Network<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:20.159> won't<00:01:20.369> look<00:01:20.520> as

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
your GPS Network and you won't look as

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.910 
your GPS Network and you won't look as
silly<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.090> wearing<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.720> work<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.290> that's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
silly as wearing this to work so that's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.850 
silly as wearing this to work so that's
one<00:01:23.159> thing<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.570> thing<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.020> say<00:01:25.229> quickly

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
one thing the one thing to say quickly

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.310 
one thing the one thing to say quickly
about<00:01:26.460> battery<00:01:27.420> consumption<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
about battery consumption which is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.539 
about battery consumption which is
probably<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> second<00:01:29.130> biggest<00:01:29.189> thing<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
probably the second biggest thing you

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
probably the second biggest thing you
want<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.759> look<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.500> 305<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.549> 30<00:01:32.850> ones<00:01:33.320> are

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
want to look at the 305 or 30 ones are

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.160 
want to look at the 305 or 30 ones are
definitely<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.310> lot<00:01:35.610> better<00:01:35.780> simply<00:01:36.780> because

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
definitely a lot better simply because

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.030 
definitely a lot better simply because
has<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.130> 13<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.640> 15<00:01:39.000> hour<00:01:39.420> battery<00:01:39.810> life<00:01:40.049> it

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
has about 13 or 15 hour battery life it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.350 
has about 13 or 15 hour battery life it
made<00:01:41.250> because<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.240> off

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
made because you have the on and off

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560 
made because you have the on and off
switch<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:43.229> 405<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.399> always<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.479> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
switch the 405 is always on and you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
switch the 405 is always on and you
really<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> look<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.530> manual<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
really have to look at the manual at the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.460 
really have to look at the manual at the
fine<00:01:47.460> print<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> figure<00:01:49.229> out

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
fine print for them to figure out

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.219 
fine print for them to figure out
exactly<00:01:50.460> how<00:01:50.579> does<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> power<00:01:51.570> thing<00:01:51.990> work

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
exactly how does the power thing work

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.609 
exactly how does the power thing work
out<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.220> essentially<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.240> will<00:01:54.600> stay<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.079> for

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
out so essentially this will stay on for

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.450 
out so essentially this will stay on for
a<00:01:55.860> week<00:01:56.990> continuously<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.860> long<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.280> do

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
a week continuously as long as you do

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.530 
a week continuously as long as you do
three<00:02:00.240> 30-minute<00:02:01.200> runs<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
three 30-minute runs and that this

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
only issue I had with this one was that

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.970 
only issue I had with this one was that
you<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.510> need<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.840> charge<00:04:15.200> this<00:04:15.500> out<00:04:15.740> of

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
you really need to charge this out of

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.130 
you really need to charge this out of
the<00:04:16.100> box<00:04:16.340> as<00:04:16.790> soon<00:04:16.970> as<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.180> get<00:04:17.329> it<00:04:17.510> don't<00:04:17.690> play

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
the box as soon as you get it don't play

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.039 
the box as soon as you get it don't play
with<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.739> initialize<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.430> or<00:04:19.549> set<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.880> up

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
with it to initialize it or set it up

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.960 
with it to initialize it or set it up
charge<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.230> up<00:04:21.350> because<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:22.280> battery<00:04:22.670> gauge

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
charge it up because the battery gauge

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.820 
charge it up because the battery gauge
really<00:04:23.600> needs<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.900> be<00:04:24.020> calibrated<00:04:24.200> properly

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
really needs to be calibrated properly

really needs to be calibrated properly
there's<00:04:25.640> a<00:04:25.700> few<00:04:25.970> issues<00:04:26.180> on<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.750> forums<00:04:27.080> about

there's a few issues on the forums about

there's a few issues on the forums about
battery<00:04:27.740> life<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:28.610> know<00:04:28.700> in<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.480> morning<00:04:30.020> you

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
battery life you know in the morning you

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.020 
battery life you know in the morning you
look<00:04:30.380> at<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.590> battery<00:04:30.920> gauge<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.460> says<00:04:31.670> fifty

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
look at the battery gauge it says fifty

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.700 
look at the battery gauge it says fifty
percent<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.600> then<00:04:32.690> at<00:04:32.840> lunchtime<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.500> thing

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
percent and then at lunchtime the thing

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.980 
percent and then at lunchtime the thing
dies<00:04:33.950> or<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.550> dies<00:04:34.730> during<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.210> run<00:04:35.420> it's

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
dies or it dies during the run it's

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.630 
dies or it dies during the run it's
probably<00:04:36.410> because<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.770> improperly

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
probably because of improperly

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.970 
probably because of improperly
calibrated<00:04:38.360> battery<00:04:39.080> gauge<00:04:39.290> so<00:04:39.560> best<00:04:39.920> thing

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
calibrated battery gauge so best thing

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.500 
calibrated battery gauge so best thing
to<00:04:40.160> do<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.430> when<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:40.730> get<00:04:40.850> this<00:04:41.030> out<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.390> the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
to do is when you get this out of the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.470 
to do is when you get this out of the
box<00:04:41.750> charge<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:44.090> don't<00:04:44.300> have<00:04:44.390> the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
box charge it and I don't have the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.060 
box charge it and I don't have the
charger<00:04:44.660> with<00:04:44.960> me<00:04:44.990> it's<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.320> city<00:04:45.770> little

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
charger with me it's the city little

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.700 
charger with me it's the city little
thing<00:04:46.370> this<00:04:46.760> looks<00:04:47.030> like<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.210> clip<00:04:47.870> it's<00:04:48.350> like<00:04:48.590> a

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
thing this looks like a clip it's like a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.760 
thing this looks like a clip it's like a
laundry<00:04:49.340> clip<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.990> need<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.230> charger<00:04:51.530> out<00:04:51.560> the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
laundry clip you need to charger out the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.010 
laundry clip you need to charger out the
box<00:04:51.980> right<00:04:52.280> away<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.880> then<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.390> play<00:04:53.720> with<00:04:53.900> it

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
box right away and then you play with it

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.510 
box right away and then you play with it
afterwards<00:04:54.320> otherwise<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:55.070> have<00:04:55.100> to<00:04:55.250> do<00:04:55.490> a

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
afterwards otherwise you have to do a

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.610 
afterwards otherwise you have to do a
reset<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.360> drain<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.780> battery<00:04:57.110> it's<00:04:57.560> a

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
reset and drain the battery it's a

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.590 
reset and drain the battery it's a
little<00:04:57.800> bit<00:04:57.890> more<00:04:58.010> painful<00:04:58.550> but<00:04:58.790> other<00:04:59.510> than

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
little bit more painful but other than

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.580 
little bit more painful but other than
that<00:05:00.430> that's<00:05:01.430> about<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:01.790> initial<00:05:02.630> glance<00:05:03.260> out

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
that that's about it initial glance out

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.760 
that that's about it initial glance out
of<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:03.980> people<00:05:04.940> will<00:05:05.210> probably<00:05:06.050> gravitate

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
of it people will probably gravitate

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.150 
of it people will probably gravitate
towards<00:05:07.100> 301<00:05:07.880> or<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.120> 305<00:05:08.540> because<00:05:09.160> since

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
towards 301 or the 305 because since

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.730 
towards 301 or the 305 because since
this<00:05:10.340> came<00:05:10.610> out<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:11.480> get<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.660> nice<00:05:11.900> price<00:05:12.380> drop

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
this came out you get a nice price drop

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.620 
this came out you get a nice price drop
for<00:05:13.190> this<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.580> this<00:05:13.669> is<00:05:13.729> still<00:05:14.030> a<00:05:14.090> pretty<00:05:14.390> good

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
for this and this is still a pretty good

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.600 
for this and this is still a pretty good
model<00:05:14.990> for<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.200> if<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:16.070> like<00:05:16.220> a<00:05:16.250> more

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
model for that if you like a more

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.420 
model for that if you like a more
stylish<00:05:16.910> or<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.810> latest<00:05:18.020> greatest<00:05:18.470> four<00:05:19.340> or

stylish or the latest greatest four or

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.890 
stylish or the latest greatest four or
five<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:19.760> I<00:05:19.790> was<00:05:19.910> good<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.270> little<00:05:20.510> more<00:05:20.630> pricey

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
five so I was good a little more pricey

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.350 
five so I was good a little more pricey
but<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:22.520> know<00:05:22.640> you<00:05:22.700> get<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.060> latest<00:05:23.210> version

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
but you know you get the latest version

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.510 
but you know you get the latest version
sound<00:05:23.930> like<00:05:24.080> acquisition<00:05:24.830> again<00:05:27.490> probably<00:05:28.490> a

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
sound like acquisition again probably a

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.820 
sound like acquisition again probably a
little<00:05:28.580> bit<00:05:28.760> better<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.300> antenna<00:05:29.690> is<00:05:29.990> here

little bit better the antenna is here

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.460 
little bit better the antenna is here
and<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.190> attendants<00:05:31.700> here<00:05:31.910> so<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:33.140> can

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
and the attendants here so it can

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.840 
and the attendants here so it can
acquire<00:05:33.770> satellites<00:05:34.040> a<00:05:34.370> little<00:05:34.550> bit<00:05:34.640> faster

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
acquire satellites a little bit faster

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.330 
acquire satellites a little bit faster

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
stationary when you first start up so

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.390 
stationary when you first start up so
that<00:05:56.620> you<00:05:57.620> know<00:05:57.710> you<00:05:57.800> can<00:05:58.070> find<00:05:58.310> the

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
that you know you can find the

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.980 
that you know you can find the
satellites<00:05:58.729> and<00:05:58.880> all<00:05:58.940> that<00:05:59.120> so<00:05:59.360> i'll<00:05:59.840> do

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
satellites and all that so i'll do

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.810 
satellites and all that so i'll do
another<00:06:00.020> video<00:06:00.440> on<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.950> training<00:06:01.430> centers

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
another video on the training centers

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.690 
another video on the training centers
and<00:06:02.120> this<00:06:02.600> is<00:06:02.690> just<00:06:02.830> very<00:06:03.830> broad<00:06:04.280> overview

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
and this is just very broad overview

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.510 
and this is just very broad overview
