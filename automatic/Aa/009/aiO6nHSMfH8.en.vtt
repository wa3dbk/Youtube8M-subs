00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.070
 good that also plaster mobile and politicized 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.189
 today we are going to see 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:10.080
 the application 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.159
 I commented on an application 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:13.809
 that takes time 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.659
 in you or want but that the 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.039
 updating with respect to the output of the system with respect to the output of 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.589
 devices for example with the Basque country of epa you do not and what it becomes 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.589
 update to offer 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.230
 to offer 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.950
 the hundred best options when controlling remote equipment 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.450
 on this occasion 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.050
 we can exchange files 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.380
 has almost two since 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.400
 remote team to our there is peace 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.160
 control 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.780
 files and folders 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.960
 of our remote equipment and even handle several - equipment at the same time 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.050
 renewed application what is really worth it and what 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.160
 in his free account he offers us this because we are going to teach 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.140
 the first thing we do weighing we are alone - equipment we already have 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.980
 a few teams that we manage with this one with this service 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.090
 i you the ones that you have to do is able to stop 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.030
 lomelí installed on the computer 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.240
 have the percent pressure updated to be compatible with the latest 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.400
 version 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.290
 the updated version is automatically downloaded from the recent 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.880
 start 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.820
 you can make the free account 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.079
 i do not require configuration and defeated percent 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.979
 or nothing simply to have the application running on the computer with the same 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.970
 account with which we access 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 we have these equipment and if we look 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.149
 percent are waste this equipment i observed file sharing the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.960
 choir that we have in between are not available 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.000
 that's because the version installed on this computer is old 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.030
 with which we can simply control 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.860
 Yeah come on 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.250
 seeing the rest of the teams we will see that this team does have 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.009
 all the full options 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.869
 this one also has the complete solutions so keep that in mind 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.079
 we could both manage files 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.179
 we click on the icon 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.339
 we are loaded 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.049
 that team 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.349
 and how can you pose alba 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.669
 we have here 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.979
 let's go back 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.299
 the volumes ds server this case a server 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.309
 we can choose 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.309
 the irp sailing 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.269
 by the different folders 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.769
 we can put the indicators of the upper cut to come back comfortably 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 backward 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.860
 we can select for example file and in the lower part we will have 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.919
 the elements the space of that volume 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.569
 agreement 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.639
 how much or how much the files weigh 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.199
 we will have the option to open the option to 'copy move option 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.720
 rename even 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.740
 remotely deletes files in that system 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.839
 we are going to collect 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.839
 this file that is smaller we are going to unmark one we can do double 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:25.839
 selection 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:26.829
 I remember 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.849
 we remark and we only choose for the test 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.109
 the one that weighs less 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.529
 we use the option of copying in agreement and then it becomes 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.010
 now this increase desk where we see we have 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.489
 a file 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.429
 captured an asset from bolivia 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.749
 in this case that is the name of the team we go to the option 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.739
 of local files this month the space that reserves the mail 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.370
 the cuty liza the free space of the ipad 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.059
 and copy files 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:59.250
 in this case 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.250
 we have seven days and half available 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.149
 As you can see it is very easy to use 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:06.599
 It is already 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.129
 noticing where we can let go 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.139
 we have a selected file we can click on the button step be here 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.900
 but we can 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.699
 we organize the folders 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.719
 this series l folders has chaired I hope 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.259
 using the button 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.840
 from the upper right corner we could create a new folder 

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.180
 order 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.949
 eye select all for example 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.889
 we are going to use the folder of remote computers 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.259
 Double click 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.460
 we are already inside 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.620
 we click on drop here 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.680
 and immediately 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.809
 in carchi is not going to copy gives us a warning you what is going to occupy we say 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.259
 yes 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.400
 and we see the progress well we already have that file directly our alpha 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.229
 yes we look at the part 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.240
 top right on top of the other we've seen to create new folder 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.850
 we will see that we have 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.900
 a button that now indicates 3 this serves us does not serve to return to the sector 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.409
 and be able to change 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.360
 between the different open sessions for example to be able to come back again 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.550
 to the server 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.870
 we could 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.180
 choose any other volume 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.000
 for example 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.180
 this 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.610
 and as you can see 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.669
 we work with ease that we can but changing between the different resources 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.530
 we are going to open 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.310
 another session on another team 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.410
 we have the possibility to control remotely as you can see 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.159
 we open files again 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.089
 it opens 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.319
 window 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.770
 in this case we are 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.629
 accessing the file system of another 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.379
 team 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.339
 in this case we are 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:58.339
 in another team we will access 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.400
 to our folders 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.669
 in agreement 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.020
 we go 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.020
 for example 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.869
 ana folder images 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:13.929
 we select the directory we can select as we have seen several in 

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:16.159
 this case we select this directory 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.289
 and we could 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.809
 use the option to delete 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.169
 agreement breasts 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.729
 our message 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.559
 that we percent 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.930
 that gives us the confirmation of if we want to eliminate 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.240
 neighbors yes 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.919
 to everything 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.240
 and immediately 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.270
 the directory is deleted 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.559
 agreement we are eliminating those that remotely 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:38.770
 and him how can you 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.770
 observe the top brand 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:47.400
 and that is that we are four windows that I have open 2 are teams that 

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:48.310
 We can see 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.129
 col la x to be able to close 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:52.509
 that session 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.789
 and kelati leave only open the one that interests us 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.129
 as well 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:59.689
 the doctors offer us the possibility 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.839
 to control the equipment 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.839
 we can open several computers to madden 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:09.619
 we are accessing one of the equipment 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.409
 to end remote session in this type makes us see 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.159
 to another 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:19.449
 we are going to give 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:22.449
 to this server 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.740
 and the same as you can see this application of 

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:29.400
 frankly 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.759
 Very powerful 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:34.649
 offers us some great results when it comes to connecting remotely 

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:40.149
 with an interface and they help me very carefully we will get much benefit on 

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:42.060
 everything if we use it 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.669
 on him in a sword 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:46.669
 accord also country a version for halfón 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.040
 Well that's all we see in a next video
