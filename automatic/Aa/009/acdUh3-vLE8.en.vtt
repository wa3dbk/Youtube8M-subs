00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
second quart of paint and I've actually

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.970 
second quart of paint and I've actually
painted<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.240> our<00:00:12.650> product<00:00:13.650> called

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
painted it with our product called

painted it with our product called
Porsche<00:00:14.340> 15<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.740> follow<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> hype<00:00:17.119> that

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
Porsche 15 and a follow the hype that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.750 
Porsche 15 and a follow the hype that
I've<00:00:18.210> read<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> boat<00:00:18.800> is<00:00:19.800> true<00:00:20.160> then<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
I've read the boat is true then it

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.599 
I've read the boat is true then it
should<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.270> pretty<00:00:21.510> much<00:00:21.600> permanent

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
should be pretty much permanent

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.660 
should be pretty much permanent
supposedly<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.730> doesn't<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.289> crack<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.670> check

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
supposedly it doesn't in crack or check

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.929 
supposedly it doesn't in crack or check
put<00:00:26.849> anything<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.420> really<00:00:28.050> tough<00:00:28.349> stuff<00:00:28.650> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
put anything it's really tough stuff and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.130 
put anything it's really tough stuff and
so<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.000> kind<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> hoping<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.869> will<00:00:30.990> do

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
so I'm kind of hoping it that will do

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.310 
so I'm kind of hoping it that will do
the<00:00:31.260> trick<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.329> only<00:00:33.570> thing<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> st

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the trick and the only thing with the st

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
the trick and the only thing with the st
swinging<00:00:34.649> arms<00:00:34.829> quit<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> lot<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.399> areas<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
swinging arms quit a lot of areas that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.229 
swinging arms quit a lot of areas that
aren't<00:00:36.210> really<00:00:36.870> welded<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.440> fully<00:00:38.120> if<00:00:39.120> you

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
aren't really welded up fully if you

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
aren't really welded up fully if you
look<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> original

swing arm i got repaired and the one

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
swing arm i got repaired and the one
that's<00:00:44.040> painted<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.480> not

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that's painted up there is one not

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
that's painted up there is one not

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
bought and there you can see there was a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.410 
bought and there you can see there was a
lot<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.329> areas<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.870> aren't<00:00:49.110> fully<00:00:49.770> welded<00:00:50.160> up

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
lot of areas that aren't fully welded up

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.529 
lot of areas that aren't fully welded up
and<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.649> great<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.770> her<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> swing<00:00:53.280> arm

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
and it's great at her in the swing arm

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
and it's great at her in the swing arm
and<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.719> seat<00:00:54.989> came<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.890> between<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.309> seams

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and your seat came up between the seams

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.240 
and your seat came up between the seams
there<00:00:57.710> just<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.660> what<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:02.070> see

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there just then here what it is you see

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.690 
there just then here what it is you see
these<00:01:02.399> gaps<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:03.059> well<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:04.189> think<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.519> must

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
these gaps as well I think it just must

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.149 
these gaps as well I think it just must
be<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> cost<00:01:06.240> thing<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> 5<00:01:07.290> 3<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.830> welded

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
be a cost thing at the 5 3 it is welded

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
be a cost thing at the 5 3 it is welded
up<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:09.540> make<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> strong<00:01:10.140> enough<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> no<00:01:10.680> more

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
up to make it strong enough and no more

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.570 
up to make it strong enough and no more
and<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:12.960> these<00:01:13.200> gaps<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.799> it's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and but you see all these gaps here it's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.969 
and but you see all these gaps here it's
just<00:01:14.640> water<00:01:15.210> traps<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.650> I've<00:01:16.770> done<00:01:16.920> is

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
just water traps so what I've done is

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
just water traps so what I've done is
seal<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.759> our<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.780> i<00:01:18.900> Chemical

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
seal them up with our can i Chemical

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.760 
seal them up with our can i Chemical
party<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.030> sex<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.630> steel<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.560> can

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
party and it's sex like steel so you can

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.700 
party and it's sex like steel so you can
actually<00:01:23.100> draw<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.610> tap<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.180> fail<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
actually draw it and tap it fail it and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
actually draw it and tap it fail it and
you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.220> areas<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.380> not<00:01:28.380> pier

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you can see areas there with of not pier

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.490 
you can see areas there with of not pier
as<00:01:28.799> well<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.600> I've<00:01:30.750> kind<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.020> filled<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.409> all

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
as well but I've kind of filled in all

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.649 
as well but I've kind of filled in all
these<00:01:31.650> gaps<00:01:32.180> seam<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.360> middle<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
these gaps seam in the middle there so

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.149 
these gaps seam in the middle there so
the<00:01:36.659> hopefully<00:01:37.200> shouldn't<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.710> anywhere

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the hopefully shouldn't be anywhere

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.600 
the hopefully shouldn't be anywhere
we're<00:01:38.970> rare<00:01:39.299> water<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.920> using

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
we're rare water can get in and using

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
we're rare water can get in and using
this<00:01:41.729> new<00:01:42.119> super<00:01:42.630> paint<00:01:42.960> hopefully<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.890> as

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this new super paint hopefully it's as

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.560 
this new super paint hopefully it's as
good<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.180> should<00:01:45.420> be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
good as they see it as it should be

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.170 
good as they see it as it should be
sealed<00:01:45.899> pretty<00:01:46.530> much<00:01:46.740> relief<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:48.030> it's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
sealed pretty much relief and it's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.550 
sealed pretty much relief and it's
actually<00:01:48.479> very<00:01:48.600> nice<00:01:48.869> stuff<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.259> work<00:01:49.530> with

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
actually very nice stuff to work with

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.530 
actually very nice stuff to work with
you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.310> see<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.820> goes<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.119> well

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you can see that it goes on really well

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.359 
you can see that it goes on really well
it's<00:01:51.810> nice<00:01:52.380> high<00:01:52.680> gloss<00:01:52.890> finish<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> I'm

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
it's nice high gloss finish and so I'm

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
it's nice high gloss finish and so I'm
kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> hoping<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:57.390> protect<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
kind of hoping it that will protect it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.170 
kind of hoping it that will protect it
and<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.380> won't<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.860> touch<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.219> again<00:01:59.280> not

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
and I won't have to touch it again not

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.020
