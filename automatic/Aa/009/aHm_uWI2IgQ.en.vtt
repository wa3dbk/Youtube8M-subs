think the key ingredient for all of this

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.420 
think the key ingredient for all of this
is<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:21.470> liquid<00:00:22.470> mixture<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> put<00:00:23.279> on

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
for sure it would last for a week it may

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.040 
for sure it would last for a week it may
last<00:01:59.730> more<00:02:00.060> than<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.660> add<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> bit<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
last more than that you can add a bit of

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.540 
last more than that you can add a bit of
lemon<00:02:01.290> juice<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.740> there<00:02:01.920> even<00:02:02.190> if<00:02:02.280> you'd<00:02:02.430> like

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
lemon juice in there even if you'd like

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.810 
lemon juice in there even if you'd like
to<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.690> make<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.930> last<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.230> little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.410> longer

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
to to make it last a little bit longer

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.250 
to to make it last a little bit longer
but<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.510> we<00:02:06.600> did<00:02:06.780> before<00:02:07.110> too

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
but that's one that we did before too

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.040 
but that's one that we did before too
and<00:02:07.620> we<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.430> did<00:02:08.550> lime<00:02:08.790> juice<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.330> pure

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and we just did lime juice just pure

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.380 
and we just did lime juice just pure
lime<00:02:10.350> juice<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> juiced<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.850> limes<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
lime juice so I juiced the limes and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.550 
lime juice so I juiced the limes and
then<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.570> made<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.870> snow<00:02:13.080> cones<00:02:13.320> where<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
then we made the snow cones where you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.530 
then we made the snow cones where you
put<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.070> lime<00:02:14.250> juice<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.640> top<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> crushed

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
put the lime juice on top of the crushed

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.780 
put the lime juice on top of the crushed
ice<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.020> my<00:02:16.140> kids<00:02:16.380> absolutely<00:02:16.560> loved<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.310> we

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
ice and my kids absolutely loved it we

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.370 
ice and my kids absolutely loved it we
did<00:02:18.060> put<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.270> little<00:02:18.450> bit<00:02:18.570> steeped<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.170> too

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
did put a little bit steeped in that too

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.600 
did put a little bit steeped in that too
though<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.860> sweeten<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.190> up<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.430> little

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
though just to sweeten it up a little

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.430 
though just to sweeten it up a little
bit<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.630> all<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.290> need<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.590> your<00:02:22.890> juice<00:02:23.640> your

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
bit so all you need is your juice your

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.020 
bit so all you need is your juice your
liquid<00:02:25.440> mixtures<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.640> you're<00:02:26.760> going<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.910> put

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
liquid mixtures that you're going to put

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.720 
liquid mixtures that you're going to put
on<00:02:27.120> top<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.660> crushed<00:02:28.440> ice<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.130> a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
on top of the crushed ice and a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.150 
on top of the crushed ice and a
high-powered<00:02:30.480> blender<00:02:30.720> I'm<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> haven't

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
high-powered blender I'm not I haven't

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.030 
high-powered blender I'm not I haven't
tried<00:02:32.460> making<00:02:32.940> snow<00:02:33.810> cones<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.650> regular

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
tried making snow cones in a regular

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.090 
tried making snow cones in a regular
blender<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.900> probably<00:02:37.680> definitely<00:02:37.800> want

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
blender but you probably definitely want

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.560 
blender but you probably definitely want
high<00:02:38.250> powered<00:02:38.550> blender<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.270> Blendtec

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
high powered blender I have a Blendtec

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.800 
high powered blender I have a Blendtec
and<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.110> has<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.350> setting<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.220> says<00:02:41.400> milk

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
and it has a setting on it it says milk

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
and it has a setting on it it says milk
milkshake<00:02:42.810> or<00:02:42.990> ice<00:02:43.290> crush<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.430> that's<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
milkshake or ice crush so that's the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.290 
milkshake or ice crush so that's the
setting<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.570> I'm<00:02:45.690> using<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.300> five

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
setting that I'm using and I have five

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.780 
setting that I'm using and I have five
cups<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.870> ice<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:50.160> regular<00:02:50.610> ice

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
cups of ice in here just regular ice

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.210 
cups of ice in here just regular ice
cubes<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:52.260> we're<00:02:52.440> going<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.590> crush<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:52.890> up

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
cubes so we're going to crush that up

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.840 
cubes so we're going to crush that up
right<00:02:53.400> now

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.510 

okay<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.390> it's<00:02:59.600> nice<00:02:59.780> and<00:02:59.990> crushed<00:03:00.200> now<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.650> just

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
okay so it's nice and crushed now I just

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.680 
okay so it's nice and crushed now I just
use<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:03.130> measuring<00:03:04.130> cup<00:03:04.160> it's<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.550> 1/4<00:03:04.970> measuring

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
use a measuring cup it's a 1/4 measuring

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.350 
use a measuring cup it's a 1/4 measuring
cup<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.020> kind<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.230> has<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.410> rounded<00:03:06.980> bottom<00:03:07.360> so

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
cup it kind of has a rounded bottom so

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.940 
cup it kind of has a rounded bottom so
it<00:03:08.450> can<00:03:08.600> have<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.780> nice<00:03:08.959> little<00:03:09.170> rounded<00:03:09.560> top<00:03:09.740> on

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
it can have a nice little rounded top on

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.590 
it can have a nice little rounded top on
top<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.490> can<00:03:10.610> find<00:03:10.910> anything<00:03:11.240> that<00:03:11.390> works

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
top so you can find anything that works

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.699 
top so you can find anything that works
I<00:03:11.810> mean<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.050> didn't<00:03:12.260> have<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.500> have<00:03:12.590> these

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
I mean you didn't have to have these

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.380 
I mean you didn't have to have these
fancy<00:03:13.069> little<00:03:13.100> bottles<00:03:13.640> these<00:03:13.819> are<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.120> ones

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
fancy little bottles these are just ones

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.360 
fancy little bottles these are just ones
that<00:03:14.510> we<00:03:14.690> got<00:03:14.840> are<00:03:14.959> from<00:03:14.989> our<00:03:15.350> local<00:03:15.709> health

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
that we got are from our local health

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.809 
that we got are from our local health
food<00:03:16.550> store<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:18.709> usually<00:03:19.010> put<00:03:19.130> honey<00:03:19.370> and

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
food store that we usually put honey and

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.510 
food store that we usually put honey and
I<00:03:19.880> just<00:03:20.060> happen<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.330> scrape<00:03:20.630> up<00:03:20.840> some<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:24.520> now

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
I just happen to scrape up some so now

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.460 
I just happen to scrape up some so now
we're<00:03:25.910> just<00:03:26.030> gonna<00:03:26.239> transfer<00:03:27.020> some<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.260> this

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
we're just gonna transfer some of this

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.920 
we're just gonna transfer some of this
ice<00:03:27.739> into<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.430> cup<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:28.970> can<00:03:29.090> use<00:03:29.270> any<00:03:29.540> cup<00:03:29.780> that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
ice into a cup you can use any cup that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.840 
ice into a cup you can use any cup that
you<00:03:29.989> like<00:03:30.580> so<00:03:31.580> just<00:03:31.820> fill<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.420> up<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.959> top

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
you like so just fill it up to the top

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.400 
you like so just fill it up to the top
and<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.030> think<00:03:35.300> one<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.630> key<00:03:35.930> things<00:03:36.230> with

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
and I think one of the key things with

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.110 
and I think one of the key things with
making<00:03:36.620> snow<00:03:36.950> cones<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.550> is<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:38.030> you

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
making snow cones of you is that you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.670 
making snow cones of you is that you
want<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.300> smash<00:03:38.660> as<00:03:38.930> much<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.350> there<00:03:39.500> as<00:03:39.530> you

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
want to smash as much in there as you

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.640 
want to smash as much in there as you
can<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.550> get<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> little<00:03:41.150> messy<00:03:41.510> but<00:03:41.780> it's

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
can so I get a little messy but it's

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.559 
can so I get a little messy but it's
just<00:03:42.920> nice<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.989> I'm<00:03:45.080> just<00:03:45.230> going<00:03:45.410> to<00:03:45.440> smash<00:03:45.860> a

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
just nice so I'm just going to smash a
