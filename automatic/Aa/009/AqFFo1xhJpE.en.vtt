00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.390 
where your you know wrist goes and it
gets<00:03:30.959> noticeably<00:03:31.959> hot<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.890> point<00:03:33.160> where

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
gets noticeably hot to a point where

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.270 
gets noticeably hot to a point where
it's<00:03:34.150> kind<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.720> uncomfortable<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.950> that's<00:03:36.160> the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
it's kind of uncomfortable so that's the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.680 
it's kind of uncomfortable so that's the
only<00:03:36.489> thing<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.820> I<00:03:36.880> have<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.090> problem<00:03:37.360> with

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
only thing that I have a problem with

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.470 
only thing that I have a problem with
it's<00:03:38.500> not<00:03:38.709> like<00:03:39.220> it's<00:03:39.400> not<00:03:39.519> unbearable<00:03:40.239> but

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
it's not like it's not unbearable but

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.170 
it's not like it's not unbearable but
it's<00:03:41.140> hot<00:03:41.410> it's<00:03:41.650> like<00:03:41.709> it's<00:03:41.950> warm<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:44.160> I

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
it's hot it's like it's warm it's and I

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.460 
it's hot it's like it's warm it's and I
would<00:03:46.180> imagine<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:46.900> would<00:03:47.019> get<00:03:47.200> hotter

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
would imagine that it would get hotter

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.250 
would imagine that it would get hotter
as<00:03:47.799> time<00:03:48.430> goes<00:03:48.640> on<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:48.930> that's<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.049> only

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
as time goes on so that's the only

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.770 
as time goes on so that's the only
problem<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.799> have<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:52.090> fan<00:03:52.480> over

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
problem that I have and the fan over

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.330 
problem that I have and the fan over
here<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:53.290> doesn't<00:03:53.500> make<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:53.890> much<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:54.160> a

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
here it doesn't make that much of a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.960 
here it doesn't make that much of a
noise<00:03:55.560> or<00:03:56.560> not<00:03:57.040> at<00:03:57.190> all<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.459> my<00:03:57.579> opinion

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
noise or not at all in my opinion

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.770 
noise or not at all in my opinion
because<00:03:58.150> like<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.720> can't<00:03:58.959> really<00:03:59.170> hear<00:03:59.440> it

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
because like you can't really hear it

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.960 
because like you can't really hear it
right<00:04:01.780> now<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.200> I'm<00:04:02.650> running<00:04:03.220> they'll<00:04:03.880> be

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
right now and I'm running they'll be

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.620 
right now and I'm running they'll be
premiere<00:04:04.329> so<00:04:05.700> but<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.790> does<00:04:06.910> get<00:04:07.120> hot<00:04:07.299> once

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
premiere so but it does get hot once

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.690 
premiere so but it does get hot once
again<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:07.930> think<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.500> heat<00:04:08.830> is<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.370> problem

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
again I think that heat is the problem

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.180 
again I think that heat is the problem
with<00:04:09.819> this<00:04:09.940> left
