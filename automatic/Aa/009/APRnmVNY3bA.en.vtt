00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.570
 to make a good result on the outside 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.670
 seems possible

 saw the state of châteauroux right now 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.699
 the people of Brest who are the first to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.289
 attack and the opening of the score 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.399

 never won outside this season 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.010
 it's gone 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.380
 Châteauroux hopes to return quickly 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.210
 this is the case thanks to gregory thil five 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.710
 minutes after opening the score for 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.120

 equalization 1 everywhere and the third 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.310

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.899
 Berry striker Gregory Thil 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.420
 which relieves his whole team 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.330
 one everywhere very quickly between 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.680
 two teams 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.369

 is refused 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.240

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.020
 theatrical the meeting gets excited a lot 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.040
 opportunities and both sides in 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.990
 this first period 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.820
 here's news for this Brest 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.000
 flush with the pole at the half time a 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.170
 goal everywhere between the two formations 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.240
 there was only one win this season 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.060
 for Châteauroux with a little bit of 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.409
 success it could come back from 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.860
 castelroussins who are on two 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.860
 consecutive defeats 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.869
 the Berry is the worst team 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.810
 of championship at home 4 points taken 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.280
 out of twelve possible 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.659
 brest on its side loses very little 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.149
 only defeat since the beginning of the 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.399
 season so has a relatively 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.290
 logical and both teams engage 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.819
 to try to take the three points 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.670
 of victory 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.099
 and too much commitment on this action 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.650
 for elsa sacchi the player of 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.909
 Châteauroux is excluded in the 63rd minute 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.980
 direct red card 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.959
 châteauroux must therefore finish the match at 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.209
 ten against eleven it does not help 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.459
 pascal gastian players' business 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.799

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.879
 head resumption and parry 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.510
 terrific landry goodfoi for 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.769

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.750

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.889
 goodfoi who saves his training 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.959
