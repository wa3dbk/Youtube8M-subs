00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
happened to be on f1 2013 I try to

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.940 
happened to be on f1 2013 I try to
install<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.870> mod<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.290> made<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
install this mod that made the the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.359

current<00:00:17.700> Lotus<00:00:18.210> card<00:00:18.570> into<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.230> golden<00:00:20.040> color

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
current Lotus card into a golden color

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.479 
current Lotus card into a golden color
scheme<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.060> think<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.140> kind<00:00:22.739> of<00:00:22.890> messed<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.340> I

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:23.489 
scheme I think it kind of messed up I

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.069 
scheme I think it kind of messed up I
think<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.759> probably<00:00:24.090> did<00:00:24.419> something<00:00:24.450> a<00:00:24.840> little

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
think I probably did something a little

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.920 
think I probably did something a little
bit<00:00:25.320> wrong<00:00:25.560> because<00:00:25.829> this<00:00:25.919> looks<00:00:26.099> more<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
bit wrong because this looks more like a

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.409 
bit wrong because this looks more like a
McLaren<00:00:27.930> leutis<00:00:28.619> you'll<00:00:28.829> see<00:00:29.040> here<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.610> we<00:00:30.239> go

McLaren leutis you'll see here as we go

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.450 
McLaren leutis you'll see here as we go
on<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.960> through<00:00:31.200> the<00:00:31.349> grid<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.309> their

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

make<00:00:34.770> their<00:00:34.980> keep<00:00:35.160> rocking<00:00:35.519> looks<00:00:35.670> very

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
make their keep rocking looks very

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.450 
make their keep rocking looks very
strange<00:00:36.390> there<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.350> almost<00:00:37.500> looks<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:37.949> as<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
strange there it almost looks like as I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.090 
strange there it almost looks like as I
said<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.760> McLaren<00:00:39.510> Lotus<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
said a McLaren Lotus and I think I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.430

installed<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.059> mod<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.140> wrong

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
installed this mod a little bit wrong

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770 
installed this mod a little bit wrong
but<00:00:44.250> nonetheless<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.030> wanted<00:00:45.269> to<00:00:45.329> show<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.539> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
but nonetheless I wanted to show you it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.709 
but nonetheless I wanted to show you it
because<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.559> kind<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.980> kind<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.149> crazy<00:00:48.480> how

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because it's kind of kind of crazy how

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
because it's kind of kind of crazy how
this<00:00:49.019> race<00:00:49.260> ends<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:49.769> because<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.429> get

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this race ends up because I just get

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
this race ends up because I just get
totally<00:00:50.789> blinded<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.079> see

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
totally blinded because you can see

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.860 
totally blinded because you can see
there<00:00:52.499> the<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.550> sunlight<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.089> just<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
there the the sunlight is just think and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
there the the sunlight is just think and
reflected<00:00:55.379> off<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.559> cards<00:00:56.129> by<00:00:56.280> mirrors<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
reflected off the cards by mirrors I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
reflected off the cards by mirrors I
can't<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.089> anything<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.929> it's<00:00:58.589> kind<00:00:58.769> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
can't see anything but it's kind of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
can't see anything but it's kind of
funny<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.190> mean<00:00:59.429> I<00:00:59.820> didn't<00:01:00.449> obviously<00:01:00.570> mean<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
funny I mean I didn't obviously mean to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.660 
funny I mean I didn't obviously mean to
install<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.589> wrong<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.249> thought<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> might

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
install it wrong but I thought it might

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.610 
install it wrong but I thought it might
be<00:01:02.969> worth<00:01:03.179> me<00:01:03.449> uploading<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.019> does<00:01:04.320> show<00:01:04.559> you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
place by like a sort of chrome effect

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.069 
place by like a sort of chrome effect
you<00:02:02.429> could<00:02:02.670> say<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.240> car<00:02:03.479> which<00:02:03.750> makes<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
you could say on the car which makes it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
see if it's going to change it but it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.990 
see if it's going to change it but it
didn't<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.370> help<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.730> much<00:02:15.090> but

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
didn't really help that much but

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.430 
didn't really help that much but
