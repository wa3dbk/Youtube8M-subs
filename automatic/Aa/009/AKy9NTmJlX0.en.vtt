00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
in this video I'm gonna give you my

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.919 
in this video I'm gonna give you my
number<00:00:01.740> one<00:00:02.220> exercise<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.850> improve<00:00:03.270> your<00:00:03.689> shot

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
number one exercise to improve your shot

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.510 
number one exercise to improve your shot
power<00:00:04.279> ok

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
power ok

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.030 
power ok
so<00:00:05.700> when<00:00:05.819> we're<00:00:05.940> talking<00:00:06.120> about<00:00:06.330> power<00:00:07.040> power

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
so when we're talking about power power

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.879 
so when we're talking about power power
is<00:00:08.519> brought<00:00:09.000> first<00:00:09.450> through<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.110> ground<00:00:10.440> and

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
is brought first through the ground and

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.700 
is brought first through the ground and
then<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.790> expressed<00:00:12.570> through<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.440> core<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
then is expressed through the core and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.029 
then is expressed through the core and
the<00:00:14.009> hips<00:00:14.280> out<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.509> extremities<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.830> we're

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the hips out of the extremities so we're

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.160 
the hips out of the extremities so we're
talking<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.520> something<00:00:17.910> that's<00:00:18.170> created

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
talking about something that's created

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.810 
talking about something that's created
in<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> ground<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.920> expressed<00:00:20.430> through<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
in the ground and expressed through the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.300 
in the ground and expressed through the
extremities<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:22.350> involves<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.039> ton<00:00:23.279> of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
extremities that involves a ton of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.800 
extremities that involves a ton of
muscle<00:00:23.789> groups<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.150> we're<00:00:24.269> talking<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
muscle groups so we're talking about a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.320 
muscle groups so we're talking about a
lot<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.289> things<00:00:25.500> right<00:00:25.710> now<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.550> squat<00:00:26.939> can

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
lot of things right now the squat can

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.060 
lot of things right now the squat can
improve<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:27.810> shot<00:00:28.080> power<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.619> pull-up<00:00:28.830> can

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
improve your shot power a pull-up can

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650 
improve your shot power a pull-up can
improve<00:00:29.400> your<00:00:29.490> Shopp<00:00:29.670> our<00:00:29.910> bench<00:00:30.240> press<00:00:30.480> can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
improve your Shopp our bench press can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
improve your Shopp our bench press can
improve<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:30.990> shot<00:00:31.170> power<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.650> lot<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.309> things

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
improve your shot power a lot of things

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.569 
improve your shot power a lot of things
can<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.300> should<00:00:34.050> play<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> role<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:35.100> improving

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
can and should play a role in improving

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
can and should play a role in improving
your<00:00:36.059> shot<00:00:36.300> power<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.989> need<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
your shot power because you need a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.990 
your shot power because you need a
well-rounded<00:00:37.739> development<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.610> can't<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
well-rounded development you can't be a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600 
well-rounded development you can't be a
structurally<00:00:39.540> imbalanced<00:00:39.680> athlete<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
structurally imbalanced athlete but a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
structurally imbalanced athlete but a
problem<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.719> athletes<00:00:43.170> make<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
problem that a lot of athletes make is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
problem that a lot of athletes make is
they<00:00:43.829> focus<00:00:43.980> too<00:00:44.190> much<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.670> trunk<00:00:45.090> rotators

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
they focus too much on trunk rotators

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
they focus too much on trunk rotators
because<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.800> you're<00:00:46.920> doing<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.219> slap<00:00:47.460> shot

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
because when you're doing a slap shot

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
because when you're doing a slap shot
you're<00:00:48.120> rotating<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> lot<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.890> people

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
you're rotating right so a lot of people

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.850 
you're rotating right so a lot of people
think<00:00:50.489> rotation<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.360> trunk<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
think rotation at the trunk is going to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
think rotation at the trunk is going to
improve<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.610> shot<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.120> lot<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.199> just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
improve your shot a lot and this just

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.250 
improve your shot a lot and this just
isn't<00:00:56.039> true<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:57.000> trunk<00:00:57.300> rotators<00:00:57.930> although

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
isn't true the trunk rotators although

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
isn't true the trunk rotators although
they're<00:00:58.440> involved<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> shot<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
they're involved in the shot they have a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.450 
they're involved in the shot they have a
very<00:01:00.300> low<00:01:00.570> strength<00:01:00.930> potential<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.190> although

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
very low strength potential so although

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820 
very low strength potential so although
you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.969> strengthen<00:01:03.359> them<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.049> potential<00:01:04.650> at

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you can strengthen them the potential at

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
you can strengthen them the potential at
which<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.640> strengthened<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.360> very

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
which they can be strengthened is very

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.230 
which they can be strengthened is very
low<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.860> although<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> may<00:01:08.580> strengthen<00:01:09.090> them

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
low so although you may strengthen them

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
low so although you may strengthen them
their<00:01:09.479> actual<00:01:09.900> contribution<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.860> your<00:01:11.010> shot

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
their actual contribution to your shot

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.480 
their actual contribution to your shot
is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.420> very<00:01:12.659> low<00:01:12.900> percentage<00:01:13.530> whereas

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
is a very very low percentage whereas

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.570 
is a very very low percentage whereas
two<00:01:15.299> other<00:01:15.570> major<00:01:15.960> factors<00:01:16.710> play<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> much

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
two other major factors play a much

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.929 
two other major factors play a much
bigger<00:01:17.610> role<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.960> overall<00:01:19.799> potential<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
bigger role in overall potential to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.539 
bigger role in overall potential to
improving<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.450> shot<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.110> those<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:23.009> your

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
improving your shot and those are your

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.999 
improving your shot and those are your
relative<00:01:24.060> grip<00:01:24.299> strength<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.590> relative

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
relative grip strength and your relative

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.249 
relative grip strength and your relative
LAT<00:01:26.310> strength<00:01:26.820> okay<00:01:27.150> these<00:01:27.750> two<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
LAT strength okay these two have a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.609 
LAT strength okay these two have a
tremendous<00:01:29.250> potential<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.810> significantly

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
tremendous potential to be significantly

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
tremendous potential to be significantly
improved<00:01:32.189> from<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.670> they're<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.270> what

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
improved from where they're at to what

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350 
improved from where they're at to what
their<00:01:33.600> actual<00:01:33.990> potential<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.280> once<00:01:36.119> those

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
their actual potential is and once those

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.719 
their actual potential is and once those
are<00:01:36.570> increased<00:01:37.079> shot<00:01:37.740> power<00:01:37.979> both<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
are increased shot power both on the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.490 
are increased shot power both on the
rickshaw<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> slap<00:01:39.990> shot<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
rickshaw and in the slap shot is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.469 
rickshaw and in the slap shot is
increased<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.670> ton<00:01:42.210> okay<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:43.799> about

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
increased a ton okay you can think about

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.499 
increased a ton okay you can think about
developing<00:01:45.479> bigger<00:01:45.810> muscle<00:01:46.409> groups<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
developing bigger muscle groups to

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.120 
developing bigger muscle groups to
contributing<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:48.720> slap<00:01:49.079> shot<00:01:49.409> kind<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
contributing to your slap shot kind of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.800 
contributing to your slap shot kind of
like<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> machine<00:01:50.790> okay

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
like a machine okay

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
like a machine okay
you<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.140> building<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.829> bigger<00:01:53.130> bigger

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you are building a bigger bigger
