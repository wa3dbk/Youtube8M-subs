number and the name which is really nice

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.570 
number and the name which is really nice
because<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.590> color<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> bottom<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
because the color on the bottom is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.240 
because the color on the bottom is
pretty<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.780> identical<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> color<00:01:17.009> in

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pretty much identical to the color in

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
pretty much identical to the color in
the<00:01:17.400> tube<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.030> scent<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> lipstick<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the tube the scent of the lipstick is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
the tube the scent of the lipstick is
something<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.130> noted<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
something to be noted I think because it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.560 
something to be noted I think because it
does<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.740> strong<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:24.060> fruity

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
does have a really strong very fruity

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.289 
does have a really strong very fruity
like<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> watermelon<00:01:25.350> type<00:01:25.890> scent<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
like a watermelon type scent so it is

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.850 
like a watermelon type scent so it is
something<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.080> would<00:01:28.229> recommend<00:01:28.740> maybe

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
something that I would recommend maybe

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.350 
something that I would recommend maybe
going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> store<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> getting<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.329> or

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
going to the store and getting one or

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.870 
going to the store and getting one or
two<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.439> colors<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> appeal<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
two of the colors that appeal to you and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.520 
two of the colors that appeal to you and
then<00:01:33.060> seeing<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> scent<00:01:34.049> doesn't<00:01:34.259> bother

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
then seeing if the scent doesn't bother

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.740 
then seeing if the scent doesn't bother
you<00:01:34.799> especially<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.790> someone<00:01:36.390> who<00:01:36.420> is

surprisingly<00:03:47.829> not<00:03:48.519> very<00:03:48.850> drying<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.810> goes

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
surprisingly not very drying and it goes

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.280 
surprisingly not very drying and it goes
on<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:51.010> nicely<00:03:51.370> now<00:03:52.209> they<00:03:52.390> say<00:03:52.660> it's<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.900> matte<00:03:53.109> I

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
on so nicely now they say it's a matte I

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.960 
on so nicely now they say it's a matte I
would<00:03:53.440> say<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.739> more<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:53.980> like<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.250> semi<00:03:54.640> matte

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
would say it's more of like a semi matte

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.720 
would say it's more of like a semi matte
finish<00:03:55.420> because<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.440> does<00:03:56.620> have<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.829> little<00:03:57.609> bit

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
finish because it does have a little bit

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.610 
finish because it does have a little bit
of<00:03:57.760> something<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.269> it<00:03:58.540> it's<00:03:58.720> not<00:03:58.840> super<00:03:59.319> flat
