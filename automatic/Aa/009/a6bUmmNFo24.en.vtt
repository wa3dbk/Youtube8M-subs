know I have them on all the shelves and

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.840 
know I have them on all the shelves and
they<00:00:46.929> take<00:00:47.109> up<00:00:47.229> a<00:00:47.319> lot<00:00:47.440> of<00:00:47.499> space<00:00:47.890> but<00:00:48.519> once<00:00:48.699> you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
they take up a lot of space but once you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.399 
they take up a lot of space but once you
pull<00:00:49.149> them<00:00:49.269> down<00:00:49.329> from<00:00:49.899> where<00:00:50.109> they're<00:00:50.260> all

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
pull them down from where they're all

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.299 
pull them down from where they're all
condensed<00:00:51.129> into<00:00:51.399> storage<00:00:51.780> man<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:53.139> is<00:00:53.309> crazy

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
condensed into storage man it is crazy

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.610 
condensed into storage man it is crazy
how<00:00:54.670> much<00:00:54.789> space<00:00:55.089> they<00:00:55.329> actually<00:00:55.690> take<00:00:55.960> this

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
how much space they actually take this

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.119 
how much space they actually take this
is<00:00:56.859> probably<00:00:58.170> probably<00:00:59.170> half<00:00:59.799> of<00:00:59.979> my

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
is probably probably half of my

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.009 
is probably probably half of my
collection<00:01:00.429> I<00:01:00.729> guess<00:01:00.940> maybe<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.569> little<00:01:01.809> bit

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
collection I guess maybe a little bit

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.229 
collection I guess maybe a little bit
more<00:01:02.229> and<00:01:02.440> I<00:01:02.949> still<00:01:03.219> have<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.399> lot<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.699> boxed
