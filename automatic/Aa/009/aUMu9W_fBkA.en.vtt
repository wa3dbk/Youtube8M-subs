so<00:00:01.079> we<00:00:01.170> get<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.790> technique<00:00:02.790> or<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.449> Marseille

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
so we get the technique or the Marseille

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.800 
so we get the technique or the Marseille
corner<00:00:04.620> so<00:00:04.859> Marseille<00:00:05.549> Marseille<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.600> a

restoration noise reduction in addition
to<00:03:06.040> up<00:03:06.189> conversion<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.260> it's<00:03:08.409> everything

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
to up conversion so so it's everything

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.920 
to up conversion so so it's everything
together<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.430> really<00:03:09.849> gives<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.659> full

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930

announcements so I'd see two HDMI

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.190 
announcements so I'd see two HDMI
outputs<00:03:32.530> here<00:03:32.650> why<00:03:33.069> is<00:03:33.129> that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
outputs here why is that

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.830 
outputs here why is that
on<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.319> board<00:03:35.590> one's<00:03:36.159> an<00:03:36.400> HDMI<00:03:37.000> input<00:03:37.030> and

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
on this board one's an HDMI input and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.410 
on this board one's an HDMI input and
one<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.139> an<00:03:38.290> output<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.099> it's<00:03:39.370> like<00:03:39.549> it's<00:03:39.760> HDMI

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
one is an output so it's like it's HDMI

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.289 
one is an output so it's like it's HDMI
in<00:03:40.629> HDMI<00:03:41.379> out<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:42.519> basically<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:43.120> can<00:03:43.269> take

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
in HDMI out so basically you can take

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.690 
in HDMI out so basically you can take
any<00:03:43.810> even<00:03:44.319> put<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.650> after<00:03:45.220> any<00:03:45.459> blu-ray

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
any even put this after any blu-ray

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.819 
any even put this after any blu-ray
player<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.389> put<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.260> under<00:03:47.439> cooking<00:03:47.799> a

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
player and put it under cooking a

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.550 
player and put it under cooking a
trireme<00:03:48.129> let's<00:03:48.819> try<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.419> so<00:03:50.019> are<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.410> gonna

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
trireme let's try and so are you gonna

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.100 
trireme let's try and so are you gonna
sell<00:03:50.859> something<00:03:51.250> like<00:03:51.519> this<00:03:51.870> somebody

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
sell something like this somebody

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.740 
sell something like this somebody
so<00:03:53.230> something<00:03:53.680> like<00:03:53.710> ii<00:03:54.640> even<00:03:54.910> external

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
so something like ii even external

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.540 
so something like ii even external
external<00:03:56.230> life<00:03:56.590> scaler<00:03:56.980> there<00:03:57.280> are<00:03:57.370> some

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
external life scaler there are some

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.080 
external life scaler there are some
companies<00:03:57.880> doing<00:03:58.390> planning<00:03:59.020> to<00:03:59.260> do<00:03:59.380> that<00:03:59.410> yeah

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
companies doing planning to do that yeah

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.580 
companies doing planning to do that yeah
how<00:04:01.090> much<00:04:01.240> keeping<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:01.780> my<00:04:01.900> cost

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
how much keeping in my cost

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.830 
how much keeping in my cost
for<00:04:04.190> an<00:04:04.280> external<00:04:04.670> accessory<00:04:05.420> like<00:04:05.630> that

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
for an external accessory like that

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.020 
for an external accessory like that
would<00:04:05.989> be<00:04:06.080> affordable<00:04:06.319> I<00:04:06.739> think<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.489> would<00:04:07.640> oh

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
would be affordable I think it would oh

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.540 
would be affordable I think it would oh
I<00:04:08.060> think<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.599> would<00:04:08.690> be<00:04:08.900> well<00:04:09.080> under<00:04:09.470> $99<00:04:10.370> it

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
I think it would be well under $99 it

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.130 
I think it would be well under $99 it
would<00:04:10.640> be<00:04:10.730> very<00:04:10.970> affordable<00:04:11.239> nice<00:04:11.870> so

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
would be very affordable nice so

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.339 
would be very affordable nice so
basically<00:04:13.720> everybody<00:04:14.720> can<00:04:14.870> just<00:04:15.050> use<00:04:15.170> their

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
basically everybody can just use their

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.270 
basically everybody can just use their
own<00:04:15.500> blu-ray<00:04:16.250> player<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.730> just<00:04:16.940> sit<00:04:17.419> this<00:04:17.570> on

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
own blu-ray player and just sit this on

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.570 
own blu-ray player and just sit this on
that's<00:04:19.820> that's<00:04:20.299> possible<00:04:20.900> with<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.530> 4k<00:04:22.040> TV<00:04:22.280> of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
that's that's possible with a 4k TV of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.820 
that's that's possible with a 4k TV of
course<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.660> how<00:04:23.720> much<00:04:23.870> better<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.380> it<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.680> use

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
course so how much better is it to use

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.660 
course so how much better is it to use
this<00:04:25.150> not<00:04:26.150> using<00:04:26.510> any<00:04:26.630> ups<00:04:26.900> giving<00:04:27.170> at<00:04:27.260> all

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
this not using any ups giving at all
