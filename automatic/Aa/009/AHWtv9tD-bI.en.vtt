00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.750
 what is going on at the ideal line with a 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.580
 new gta 5 video for you in this 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.400
 video I'll show you a place on the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.260
 the rare western which others rare 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.019
 vehicles and cars the senses and 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.880
 you need to step number one 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.099
 starts a session only for players 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.949
 invitation or a solo session 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.590
 Step two then you drive to 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:38.230
 car dealership from simon finds the car dealership 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.309
 here on the map step nomad three 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.660
 now you are always driving away from the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.820
 dealership and returns 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.430
 You must not get too close to the car 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.680
 you should stay at least 600 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.450
 meters far away after the fourth 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.829
 or fifth time driving back and forth 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.370
 with me then the western one 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.530
 curious; excited 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.020
 pay attention not only in the parking lot 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.239
 the car dealership but respects completely 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.949
 the whole environment with me is last 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.109
 the cadenza and then not at the car from 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.290
 cocked but on the side strip 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.540
 I also read that opposite 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.100
 They also use the motorcycle from franklin 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.020
 the offline mode should tons 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.150
 with me is unfortunately not curious 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.130
 but maybe you have more luck 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.259
 the probability of a rare 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.450
 getting a vehicle is higher if you 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.869
 have a sms from simon in the he you 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.670
 says that he builds certain vehicles 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.380
 Step number four if you are ten times 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.540
 I drove back and forth and I build 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.340
 just do not want to stretch you looking for her 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.689
 Just have a new meeting just for you 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.850
 player with invitation 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.740
 a little trick from me the fastest 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.590
 is that if you press start and then 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.180
 the editor starts in the editor arrived 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.100
 can you then immediately a new meeting 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.079
 only for players with invitation to start 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.509
 is definitely much faster 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.180
 than to return to the offline mode 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.049
 so that 's it from me, I hope so 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.979
 could you guys with this video 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:58.780
 help 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.780
 thanks for watching and as always free
