clear and gives us the information we
need<00:00:50.839> so<00:00:51.260> number<00:00:51.829> one<00:00:52.069> after<00:00:52.760> next<00:00:52.940> year

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
need so number one after next year

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.789 
need so number one after next year
you're<00:00:53.749> not<00:00:53.870> gonna<00:00:53.959> see<00:00:54.229> a<00:00:54.260> number<00:00:54.469> higher

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
you're not gonna see a number higher

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.949 
you're not gonna see a number higher
than<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.100> 50<00:00:55.399> on<00:00:55.519> a<00:00:55.549> sunscreen<00:00:55.940> bottle<00:00:56.269> okay<00:00:56.690> and

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:56.959 
than a 50 on a sunscreen bottle okay and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.079 
than a 50 on a sunscreen bottle okay and
why<00:00:57.079> is<00:00:57.109> that<00:00:57.260> because<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.829> there's<00:00:58.729> no<00:00:58.879> real

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
why is that because the there's no real

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.719 
why is that because the there's no real
study<00:00:59.479> that<00:00:59.749> says<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.229> a<00:01:00.260> hundred<00:01:00.589> is<00:01:00.979> really

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
study that says that a hundred is really

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.789 
study that says that a hundred is really
materially<00:01:02.089> better<00:01:02.329> than<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.539> 50<00:01:02.989> but<00:01:03.559> there's

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
materially better than a 50 but there's

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.920 
materially better than a 50 but there's
a<00:01:03.859> caveat<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.369> that<00:01:04.549> these<00:01:05.269> studies<00:01:05.720> are<00:01:05.750> done

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
a caveat to that these studies are done

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.930 
a caveat to that these studies are done
in<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.470> laboratory<00:01:06.710> where<00:01:07.310> they're<00:01:07.460> putting<00:01:07.640> a

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
in a laboratory where they're putting a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.910 
in a laboratory where they're putting a
large<00:01:08.240> amount<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.750> sunscreen<00:01:08.960> on<00:01:09.290> an<00:01:09.650> ounce

large amount of sunscreen on an ounce

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.220 
large amount of sunscreen on an ounce
for<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.310> whole<00:01:10.490> body<00:01:10.730> which<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.000> about<00:01:11.360> two<00:01:12.110> to

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
for a whole body which is about two to

for a whole body which is about two to
four<00:01:12.380> times<00:01:12.620> as<00:01:12.860> much<00:01:13.010> as<00:01:13.220> probably<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:13.790> or<00:01:13.880> I

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
four times as much as probably you or I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.900 
four times as much as probably you or I
put<00:01:14.270> on<00:01:14.360> okay<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.280> there<00:01:16.280> might<00:01:16.490> be<00:01:16.550> some

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
put on okay so there might be some

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.940 
put on okay so there might be some
benefit<00:01:17.270> for<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.480> higher<00:01:17.660> SPF<00:01:17.930> but<00:01:18.500> that<00:01:18.740> will

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
benefit for a higher SPF but that will

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.350 
benefit for a higher SPF but that will
not<00:01:19.070> be<00:01:19.130> something<00:01:19.670> we'll<00:01:19.820> be<00:01:19.940> able<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.150> judge

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
not be something we'll be able to judge

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.940 
not be something we'll be able to judge
anymore<00:01:20.780> it's<00:01:20.900> all<00:01:20.990> going<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.170> be<00:01:21.230> 50<00:01:21.710> that's

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
anymore it's all going to be 50 that's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.390 
anymore it's all going to be 50 that's
it<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.850> second<00:01:23.240> thing<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.890> broad<00:01:24.890> spectrum
