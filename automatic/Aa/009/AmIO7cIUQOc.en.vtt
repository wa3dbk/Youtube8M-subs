00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.630 

now<00:04:19.270> here's<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.570> figure<00:04:19.990> stands<00:04:20.860> around<00:04:21.190> six

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
now here's a figure stands around six

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.180 
now here's a figure stands around six
inches<00:04:22.030> tall<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:24.580> highly<00:04:25.330> detailed<00:04:25.600> I

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
inches tall and it's highly detailed I

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.620 
inches tall and it's highly detailed I
feel<00:04:27.190> they<00:04:27.340> made<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.820> very<00:04:28.360> accurate

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
feel they made a very accurate

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.250 
feel they made a very accurate
representation<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:31.530> samus<00:04:32.700> from<00:04:34.260> metroid

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
same kind of glossy paint job that we

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.240 
same kind of glossy paint job that we
saw<00:04:46.810> with<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.560> morph<00:04:47.800> ball<00:04:52.710> now<00:04:53.710> i'll<00:04:53.860> do<00:04:54.040> some

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
saw with the morph ball now i'll do some

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.210 
saw with the morph ball now i'll do some
neck<00:04:54.520> articulation<00:04:55.590> which<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.770> doesn't<00:04:56.950> have

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
neck articulation which it doesn't have

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.790 
neck articulation which it doesn't have
much<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:58.840> could<00:04:58.990> just<00:04:59.110> go<00:04:59.350> up<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.650> little

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
much of you could just go up a little

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.190 
much of you could just go up a little
bit

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
bit

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.470 
bit
and<00:05:01.730> move<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.540> right<00:05:03.810> just<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.890> tiny<00:05:05.130> bit

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
and move to the right just a tiny bit

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:14.840 
and move to the right just a tiny bit
there's<00:05:06.480> not<00:05:06.660> much<00:05:12.980> now<00:05:13.980> do<00:05:14.040> some<00:05:14.520> elbow

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
there's not much now do some elbow

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.300 
there's not much now do some elbow
articulation<00:05:15.690> on<00:05:15.810> our<00:05:15.960> arm<00:05:16.200> cannon<00:05:16.710> side

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
articulation on our arm cannon side

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.110 
articulation on our arm cannon side
she<00:05:18.940> could<00:05:19.090> only<00:05:19.180> go<00:05:19.480> about<00:05:20.550> 90<00:05:21.550> degrees

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
she could only go about 90 degrees

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.220 
she could only go about 90 degrees
and<00:05:23.690> stops

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.650 

and<00:05:26.470> to<00:05:26.920> let<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.340> know<00:05:27.490> her<00:05:27.820> shoulders<00:05:28.270> can<00:05:28.480> do

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
and to let you know her shoulders can do

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.820 
and to let you know her shoulders can do
a<00:05:28.900> full<00:05:29.020> 360<00:05:30.900> nothing<00:05:31.900> really<00:05:32.020> hinders<00:05:32.590> that

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
a full 360 nothing really hinders that

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.330 
a full 360 nothing really hinders that
area<00:05:34.230> now<00:05:35.230> we'll<00:05:35.380> go<00:05:35.410> to<00:05:35.590> her<00:05:35.800> left<00:05:36.010> elbow

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
area now we'll go to her left elbow

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.080 
area now we'll go to her left elbow
we<00:05:37.880> could<00:05:38.060> see<00:05:38.590> it<00:05:39.590> goes<00:05:39.860> up<00:05:40.100> pretty<00:05:40.880> much

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
we could see it goes up pretty much

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.810 
we could see it goes up pretty much
about<00:05:42.400> where<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.490> suit<00:05:43.730> stops<00:05:44.720> it<00:05:45.610> which<00:05:46.610> is

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
about where the suit stops it which is

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.800 
about where the suit stops it which is
pretty<00:05:46.850> good<00:05:47.180> to<00:05:47.870> me<00:05:49.090> now<00:05:50.090> we'll<00:05:50.240> do<00:05:50.360> some<00:05:50.570> leg

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
pretty good to me now we'll do some leg

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.770 
pretty good to me now we'll do some leg
and<00:05:50.990> knee<00:05:51.139> articulation<00:05:52.180> she<00:05:53.180> goes<00:05:53.360> about<00:05:53.510> as

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
and knee articulation she goes about as

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.119 
and knee articulation she goes about as
far<00:05:54.020> as<00:05:54.080> her<00:05:54.410> suit<00:05:55.250> letter

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.080 

now<00:06:00.129> we'll<00:06:00.280> do<00:06:00.430> some<00:06:00.669> ankle<00:06:00.940> articulation

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
now we'll do some ankle articulation

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
now we'll do some ankle articulation
which<00:06:04.090> it<00:06:04.300> has<00:06:04.479> a<00:06:04.509> pretty<00:06:04.900> good<00:06:04.990> amount<00:06:05.349> of<00:06:07.110> now

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
which it has a pretty good amount of now

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.899 
which it has a pretty good amount of now
for<00:06:08.379> the<00:06:08.500> end<00:06:08.680> of<00:06:08.800> this<00:06:08.889> review<00:06:09.099> I<00:06:09.280> had<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.729> say

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
for the end of this review I had to say

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.469 
for the end of this review I had to say
that<00:06:10.020> that<00:06:11.020> this<00:06:11.259> figure<00:06:11.620> is<00:06:12.479> absolutely

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
that that this figure is absolutely

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.950 
that that this figure is absolutely
perfect<00:06:13.720> I

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
perfect I

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
with the missile and we could have

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.430 
with the missile and we could have
gotten<00:06:26.759> a<00:06:28.340> grenade<00:06:29.340> for<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.699> most<00:06:29.940> of<00:06:30.090> all<00:06:30.440> but
