00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
really good point at the end about how

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.500 
really good point at the end about how
uh<00:00:20.300> um<00:00:21.890> closing<00:00:22.890> off<00:00:22.980> tax<00:00:23.369> shelters<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.180> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
requiring sacrifice from the top end is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.230 
requiring sacrifice from the top end is
not<00:00:26.939> morally<00:00:27.750> equivalent<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.890> taking<00:00:29.849> away

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
not morally equivalent to taking away

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.540 
not morally equivalent to taking away
food<00:00:30.599> from<00:00:30.990> old<00:00:31.230> people<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.130> think<00:00:32.160> that

food from old people and I think that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.330 
food from old people and I think that
that<00:00:32.820> needs<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.989> brought<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:34.980> more<00:00:35.190> often

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
that needs to be brought up more often

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.600
