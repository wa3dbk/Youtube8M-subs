00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.006
 [South Lebanon, 2006] 

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.000
 The place is packed with small munitions 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.008
 Yes, we've seen a lot of them here 

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:17.002
 Approximately 4 million submunitions were fired in just five weeks 

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.024
 [UNMACC did not explode hundreds of thousands of them on impact, data] 

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:22.014
 So we really have the worst picture 

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:24.019
 Of what can happen when cluster munitions are used 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.010
 In large quantities and in diverse environments 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.015
 They were used, for example, in or near populated areas 

00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:38.005
 They were used in agricultural areas 

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:41.004
 We therefore see what lies ahead 

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:53.023
 If you do not address this problem sooner 

00:00:53.023 --> 00:00:56.018
 The problem is the quantity of these munitions 

00:00:56.018 --> 00:01:01.000
 Because it can be launched in hundreds and hundreds of thousands 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.021
 In a few hours, and in millions in a few days 

00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:06.007
 These are large numbers, in addition to 

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.018
 10 to 40 per cent did not explode 

00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:10.004
 Create a huge pollution problem 

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:15.006
 And a huge threat to the civilian population 

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:16.023
 The population is returning home 

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:19.020
 Even if they were absent at the time of the shelling 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.001
 They only find debris. They try to enter 

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.013
 Cluster munitions are often mixed with debris 

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:27.013
 May be found by chance 

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:34.003
 Perhaps the residents saw and tried to get rid of them 

00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:36.019
 And if cluster munitions are scattered 

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:39.000
 In agricultural land, for example 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.007
 Can destroy the livelihoods of individuals 

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:47.015
 Who depend on those fields or orchards 

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.022
 It is an invaluable source of income 

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:51.020
 The season has ended 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.019
 Agriculture follows the seasons 

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:56.001
 Now my hands are broken and I am suffocated 

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:57.022
 I can not move 

00:01:57.022 --> 00:02:01.001
 It is unfortunate that the population remains prisoners of war 

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.017
 They are suffering unbelievable dreams, and their parts 

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:07.009
 And displacement during the conflict 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.023
 But what disgusts us 

00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:13.019
 That civilians should continue to be killed and wounded for many years 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.023
 Or tens of years just to choose 

00:02:15.023 --> 00:02:19.356
 Weapon in armed conflict
