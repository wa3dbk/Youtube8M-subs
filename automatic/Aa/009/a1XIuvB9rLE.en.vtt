00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
a week because we saw live 3d images you

could see the 3d right there on set and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.139 
could see the 3d right there on set and
you<00:02:07.229> know<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.100> itself<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> way<00:02:08.850> they<00:02:09.000> can

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you know it itself the way they can

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.960 
you know it itself the way they can
post-ops<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.590> changed<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.130> way<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.610> I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
post-ops it it changed the way that I I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.180 
post-ops it it changed the way that I I
moved<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> camera<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.350> even<00:02:13.590> changed<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.070> way

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
moved the camera it even changed the way

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.890 
moved the camera it even changed the way
we<00:02:14.370> edited<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.880> movie<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.330> pacing<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
we edited the movie the pacing of the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.190 
we edited the movie the pacing of the
film<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.709> they<00:02:17.070> really<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:18.239> my<00:02:18.450> opinion<00:02:18.480> 3ds

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
film and they really in my opinion 3ds

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.430 
film and they really in my opinion 3ds
revolutionized

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
revolutionized

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.260 
revolutionized
I<00:02:20.470> think<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:21.460> going<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.610> be<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> paradigm

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
I think it's going to be a paradigm

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.380 
I think it's going to be a paradigm
shift<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:23.350> as<00:02:23.620> when<00:02:24.490> movies<00:02:24.850> went<00:02:25.060> from

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
shift just as when movies went from

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.300 
shift just as when movies went from
silent<00:02:26.110> movies<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.470> talkies<00:02:26.860> will<00:02:27.040> provide

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
silent movies to talkies will provide

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.410 
silent movies to talkies will provide
the<00:02:27.490> white<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.880> color

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the white to color

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.270 
the white to color
I<00:02:28.450> do<00:02:28.690> think<00:02:29.080> 3d<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.830> become<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.100> new

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
I do think 3d is going to become the new

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.370 
I do think 3d is going to become the new
benchmark<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.360> really<00:02:31.540> does<00:02:31.780> change<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
benchmark and it really does change the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.040 
benchmark and it really does change the
way<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.100> move<00:02:34.000> even<00:02:34.480> when<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.750> design

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
way that you move even when you design

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.900 
way that you move even when you design
the<00:02:35.080> sets<00:02:35.500> either<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.400> design<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:39.010> was<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.700> huge

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
the sets either you design it was a huge

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.520 
the sets either you design it was a huge
challenge<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.570> was<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.720> very<00:02:40.900> exciting<00:02:41.170> one

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
challenge but it was a very exciting one

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.630 
challenge but it was a very exciting one
because<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.770> kind<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.010> felt<00:02:42.220> like<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.370> was<00:02:42.520> making

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
because I kind of felt like I was making

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.120 
because I kind of felt like I was making
my<00:02:42.850> first<00:02:43.120> movie<00:02:43.450> ever<00:02:43.480> again<00:02:44.050> well<00:02:45.010> the

I used to be such skinny little as a

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.900 
I used to be such skinny little as a
little<00:04:14.750> boy<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:19.840> know<00:04:20.840> nothing<00:04:21.290> is

impossible in a car Resident Evil world

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.930 
impossible in a car Resident Evil world
you<00:04:26.780> know<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.199> it's<00:04:27.350> also<00:04:27.680> challenging<00:04:28.220> but

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
you know and it's also challenging but

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.360 
you know and it's also challenging but
at<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.150> same<00:04:29.330> time<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:30.530> know<00:04:30.650> we<00:04:30.889> all<00:04:31.040> train

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
at the same time you know we all train

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.700 
at the same time you know we all train
really<00:04:31.669> hard<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:32.360> meet<00:04:32.510> those<00:04:32.690> challenges<00:04:32.750> and

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
really hard to meet those challenges and

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.100 
really hard to meet those challenges and
I<00:04:33.919> mean<00:04:34.580> there<00:04:34.790> was<00:04:34.940> there<00:04:35.419> was<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.600> couple<00:04:35.900> of

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
I mean there was there was a couple of

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.040 
I mean there was there was a couple of
long<00:04:37.039> nights<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:37.639> we<00:04:37.760> followed<00:04:38.270> with<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:38.449> 3d

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
long nights that we followed with the 3d

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.270 
long nights that we followed with the 3d
and<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:41.270> know<00:04:41.389> some<00:04:41.780> stuff<00:04:42.289> for<00:04:42.500> me<00:04:42.740> at<00:04:43.010> least

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
and you know some stuff for me at least

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.310 
and you know some stuff for me at least
is<00:04:43.520> speaking<00:04:43.850> for<00:04:43.970> myself<00:04:44.090> for<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.870> long

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
is speaking for myself for the long

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.500 
is speaking for myself for the long
sequences<00:04:46.039> for<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.370> needle<00:04:46.699> that<00:04:46.880> one<00:04:47.210> which

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
sequences for the needle that one which

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.230 
sequences for the needle that one which
she's<00:04:47.750> pouring<00:04:48.050> down<00:04:48.320> that<00:04:48.680> were<00:04:49.120> really<00:04:50.120> you

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
she's pouring down that were really you

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.820 
she's pouring down that were really you
kind<00:04:50.510> of<00:04:50.539> felt<00:04:50.810> like<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:51.020> needed<00:04:51.229> a<00:04:51.410> degree<00:04:51.590> in

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
kind of felt like you needed a degree in

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.879 
kind of felt like you needed a degree in
physics<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.580> figure<00:04:52.910> out<00:04:53.120> how<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.539> make<00:04:54.440> things

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
physics to figure out how to make things

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.050 
physics to figure out how to make things
work<00:04:55.160> depth<00:04:56.120> wise<00:04:56.889> visual<00:04:57.889> effects<00:04:58.280> wise<00:04:58.639> and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
work depth wise visual effects wise and

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.790 
work depth wise visual effects wise and
it's<00:04:59.240> worked<00:04:59.570> well<00:04:59.720> good<00:04:59.930> morning<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.590> people

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
it's worked well good morning and people

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.830 
it's worked well good morning and people
are<00:05:01.130> just<00:05:01.280> like<00:05:03.250> how<00:05:04.250> far<00:05:04.490> we<00:05:04.669> came<00:05:04.850> in<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
are just like how far we came in the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.350 
are just like how far we came in the
mathematics<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:06.889> this<00:05:07.100> all<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.550> work<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:08.180> know

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
mathematics of this all to work you know

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.029 
mathematics of this all to work you know
but

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.469 

for<00:05:14.039> me<00:05:14.129> one<00:05:14.279> of<00:05:14.309> the<00:05:14.400> challenges<00:05:14.879> in<00:05:15.330> the

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
for me one of the challenges in the

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.839 
for me one of the challenges in the
beginning<00:05:15.779> of<00:05:15.960> themself<00:05:16.379> when<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:17.490> see

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
beginning of themself when you see

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.689 
beginning of themself when you see
Claire<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.659> she's<00:05:19.139> highlights<00:05:20.099> of<00:05:20.460> an

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
Claire and she's highlights of an

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.629 
Claire and she's highlights of an
airplane<00:05:21.120> graveyard<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:22.259> it<00:05:23.129> was<00:05:23.249> we<00:05:23.490> were

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
airplane graveyard and it was we were

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.730 
airplane graveyard and it was we were
battling<00:05:23.849> such<00:05:24.360> extreme<00:05:24.870> weather<00:05:25.110> I<00:05:25.469> mean<00:05:25.650> it

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
battling such extreme weather I mean it

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.999 
battling such extreme weather I mean it
was<00:05:25.860> torrential<00:05:26.159> rain<00:05:26.639> are<00:05:27.199> all<00:05:28.199> our<00:05:28.469> tractors

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
was torrential rain are all our tractors

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.980 
was torrential rain are all our tractors
were<00:05:29.279> stuck<00:05:29.580> in<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:29.819> mud<00:05:30.029> I<00:05:30.419> was<00:05:30.569> blamed<00:05:30.870> on

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
were stuck in the mud I was blamed on

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.559 
were stuck in the mud I was blamed on
the<00:05:31.080> mud<00:05:31.289> I<00:05:31.499> got<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:31.860> doused<00:05:32.129> in<00:05:32.400> water<00:05:32.569> you

the mud I got it doused in water you

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.209 
the mud I got it doused in water you
know<00:05:33.659> we<00:05:33.809> are<00:05:33.930> fight<00:05:34.169> sequences<00:05:34.889> we're

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219 
know we are fight sequences we're

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.640 
know we are fight sequences we're
slipping<00:05:35.460> or<00:05:35.879> sliding<00:05:36.020> you<00:05:37.020> know<00:05:37.139> but<00:05:37.319> it's

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
slipping or sliding you know but it's

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.350 
slipping or sliding you know but it's
part<00:05:37.919> of<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.099> fun<00:05:38.249> of<00:05:38.430> it<00:05:38.520> it's<00:05:38.789> because<00:05:39.210> you

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
part of the fun of it it's because you

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.999 
part of the fun of it it's because you
know<00:05:39.539> it's<00:05:39.749> gonna<00:05:39.900> look<00:05:40.110> kick-ass<00:05:40.559> at<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.889> end

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
know it's gonna look kick-ass at the end

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.159 
know it's gonna look kick-ass at the end
of<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:41.159> day<00:05:41.309> so<00:05:41.879> you<00:05:41.909> just<00:05:42.270> swallow<00:05:42.719> it<00:05:42.870> and

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
of the day so you just swallow it and

of the day so you just swallow it and
you<00:05:43.229> get<00:05:43.349> out<00:05:43.499> there<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:43.770> think<00:05:44.129> about<00:05:44.159> your

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
you get out there and think about your

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.179 
you get out there and think about your
character<00:05:44.909> and<00:05:44.939> you<00:05:45.150> dive<00:05:45.360> into<00:05:45.599> it<00:05:46.069> one<00:05:47.069> of

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
character and you dive into it one of

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:48.320 
character and you dive into it one of
the<00:05:47.249> funny<00:05:47.490> things<00:05:47.550> that<00:05:47.789> happens<00:05:48.240> when

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
the funny things that happens when

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.390 
the funny things that happens when
you're<00:05:48.569> shooting<00:05:48.719> actually<00:05:49.139> that<00:05:49.800> sequence

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
you're shooting actually that sequence
