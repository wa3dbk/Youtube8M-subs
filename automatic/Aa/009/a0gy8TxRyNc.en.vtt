00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.710 
Fusarium head blight is it the later
part<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.190> crop<00:03:46.400> after<00:03:46.760> it's<00:03:47.150> too<00:03:47.390> late<00:03:47.510> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
part of the crop after it's too late to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.050 
part of the crop after it's too late to
spray<00:03:47.989> because<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:48.980> tells<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.610> what<00:03:50.030> the

disease is like in your area and let you

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.910 
disease is like in your area and let you
plan<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.820> next<00:03:53.000> year<00:03:53.450> I'm<00:03:54.380> looking<00:03:54.620> at

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
plan for the next year I'm looking at

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.820 
plan for the next year I'm looking at
these<00:03:55.070> two<00:03:55.130> wheat<00:03:55.549> plants<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.239> they<00:03:56.570> show

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
these two wheat plants and they show

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.350 
these two wheat plants and they show

characteristic fusee remember light you

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.229 
characteristic fusee remember light you
can<00:03:59.510> see<00:03:59.750> the<00:04:00.019> whitish<00:04:00.560> tan<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.489> pinkish

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
can see the whitish tan to pinkish

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.050 
can see the whitish tan to pinkish
florets<00:04:03.230> these<00:04:03.950> are<00:04:04.160> individual<00:04:04.820> wheat

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
florets these are individual wheat

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.460 
florets these are individual wheat
flowers<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.660> have<00:04:05.720> been<00:04:05.840> affected<00:04:06.290> by<00:04:06.410> the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
flowers that have been affected by the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.520 
flowers that have been affected by the
disease<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.150> also<00:04:08.360> tells<00:04:08.750> me<00:04:08.930> when<00:04:09.350> this

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
disease and this also tells me when this

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.130 
disease and this also tells me when this
plant<00:04:09.890> was<00:04:10.100> infected<00:04:10.730> because<00:04:11.329> wheat<00:04:11.720> starts

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
plant was infected because wheat starts

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.960 
plant was infected because wheat starts
flowering<00:04:12.709> in<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:12.950> middle<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.760> head

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.319 
flowering in the middle of the head
who's<00:04:14.810> above<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.500> below<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.640> this<00:04:16.850> tells<00:04:17.120> me

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
who's above and below so this tells me

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.300 
who's above and below so this tells me
that<00:04:17.660> these<00:04:17.810> two<00:04:17.870> plants<00:04:18.620> were<00:04:18.770> affected

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
that these two plants were affected

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.449 
that these two plants were affected
early<00:04:19.910> in<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.120> flowering<00:04:20.599> stage

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
early in the flowering stage

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.909 
early in the flowering stage
and<00:04:21.759> an<00:04:21.970> application<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.870> fungicide<00:04:23.380> prior<00:04:23.740> to

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
and an application of fungicide prior to

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.590 
and an application of fungicide prior to
this<00:04:24.039> stage<00:04:24.340> or<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:24.820> prior<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.330> stage

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
this stage or just prior to the stage

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.810 
this stage or just prior to the stage
would<00:04:26.169> have<00:04:26.289> prevented<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.949> yield<00:04:27.190> loss<00:04:27.430> and

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
would have prevented the yield loss and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.730 
would have prevented the yield loss and
the<00:04:28.000> quality<00:04:28.479> loss<00:04:28.690> it'll<00:04:29.050> incur<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:29.560> this

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
the quality loss it'll incur in this

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.659 
the quality loss it'll incur in this
head<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.060> can<00:04:31.150> see<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:32.199> damage<00:04:32.669> confined

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
head so you can see the damage confined

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
thing in this field is that the flag

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.719 
thing in this field is that the flag
leaf<00:05:13.509> was<00:05:13.750> not<00:05:13.960> protective<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:15.430> all<00:05:15.610> the

product<00:05:17.949> the<00:05:18.250> flag<00:05:18.520> was<00:05:18.729> left<00:05:18.970> unprotected

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
product the flag was left unprotected

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.290 
product the flag was left unprotected
and<00:05:19.810> a<00:05:19.870> lot<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.110> leaf<00:05:20.380> damage<00:05:20.970> occurred<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.180> the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
and a lot of leaf damage occurred to the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.610 
and a lot of leaf damage occurred to the
flag<00:05:22.539> leaf<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:23.710> in<00:05:24.070> every<00:05:24.430> port<00:05:25.090> a<00:05:25.419> lot<00:05:26.349> of<00:05:26.470> leaf

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
flag leaf so in every port a lot of leaf

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.430 
flag leaf so in every port a lot of leaf
damage<00:05:26.919> occurred<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:27.940> that<00:05:28.090> flag<00:05:28.330> leaf<00:05:28.570> that

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
damage occurred to that flag leaf that

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.770 
damage occurred to that flag leaf that
damage<00:05:29.979> translates<00:05:30.610> directly<00:05:30.880> into<00:05:31.570> yield

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
damage translates directly into yield

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.560 
damage translates directly into yield
loss<00:05:32.070> so<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.190> bushels<00:05:33.610> will<00:05:33.760> not<00:05:33.940> be<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.389> this

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
loss so the bushels will not be in this

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.409 
loss so the bushels will not be in this
field<00:05:34.870> because<00:05:35.440> this<00:05:35.650> field<00:05:35.949> required<00:05:36.490> leaf

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
field because this field required leaf

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.649 
field because this field required leaf
protection<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.320> head<00:05:38.860> protection<00:05:39.539> it's<00:05:40.539> a

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
protection and head protection it's a

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.830 
protection and head protection it's a
