inserting<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.390> key<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> see<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:28.500> would

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
inserting a key just to see what would

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.209

I<00:03:03.790> tried<00:03:04.790> installing<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:07.540> original<00:03:08.540> key

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
I tried installing the original key

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.460 
I tried installing the original key
pressing<00:03:09.980> W<00:03:10.220> with<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.299> original<00:03:11.810> key<00:03:12.019> pressed

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
pressing W with the original key pressed

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.250 
pressing W with the original key pressed
and<00:03:12.560> W<00:03:12.950> with<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.220> new<00:03:13.430> key<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.260> nothing

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
and W with the new key and nothing

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.430 
and W with the new key and nothing
worked<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:16.540> just<00:03:17.540> kept<00:03:17.720> getting<00:03:17.900> that<00:03:18.200> will

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
worked so I just kept getting that will

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.930 
worked so I just kept getting that will
be<00:03:18.620> ready<00:03:18.890> soon<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.890> edited<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.670> it's

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
be ready soon so this is edited so it's

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.960 
be ready soon so this is edited so it's
not<00:03:23.299> showing<00:03:24.140> all<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.069> time<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.520> it's<00:03:25.670> spent

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
not showing all the time that it's spent

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.699 
not showing all the time that it's spent
but<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.569> will<00:03:26.780> be<00:03:26.810> ready

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.440 

but<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.740> had<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.280> cup<00:03:34.640> there<00:03:34.910> for<00:03:35.209> quite<00:03:35.420> a

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
but I had that cup there for quite a

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.680 
but I had that cup there for quite a
while<00:03:36.580> just<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.700> see<00:03:37.880> if<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.150> would<00:03:38.240> kick<00:03:38.480> on

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
while just to see if it would kick on

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.559 
while just to see if it would kick on
and<00:03:38.720> do<00:03:39.050> anything<00:03:42.280> now<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.340> press<00:03:43.819> escape<00:03:44.330> if

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
and do anything now you press escape if

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.780 
and do anything now you press escape if
you<00:03:44.660> ever<00:03:44.780> get<00:03:45.020> stuck<00:03:45.290> in<00:03:45.500> anything<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.430> it

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
you ever get stuck in anything and it

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.220 
you ever get stuck in anything and it
brings<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.270> back<00:03:47.510> out<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.080> previous<00:03:48.880> menu

the<00:03:54.230> next<00:03:54.530> thing<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.100> tried<00:03:59.050> today<00:04:00.370> at<00:04:01.370> this

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
the next thing I tried today at this

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.699 
the next thing I tried today at this
point<00:04:02.030> I'm<00:04:02.269> because<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.630> tried<00:04:02.959> reading<00:04:03.230> again

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
point I'm because I tried reading again

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:13.509 
point I'm because I tried reading again
here<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:09.370> tried<00:04:10.390> different<00:04:11.390> keys<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:12.519> tried

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
here I tried different keys I tried

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.790 
here I tried different keys I tried
reading<00:04:14.269> all<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.810> key<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.110> make<00:04:15.260> sure<00:04:15.590> that

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
reading all the key and make sure that

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.159 
reading all the key and make sure that
it<00:04:15.890> was<00:04:16.010> actually<00:04:16.430> pulling<00:04:16.669> up<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.720> actual

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
it was actually pulling up the actual

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.860 
it was actually pulling up the actual
data<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:19.430> for<00:04:19.700> different<00:04:19.850> Keys<00:04:20.239> different

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
data and for different Keys different

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.420 
data and for different Keys different
transponders<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.530> put<00:04:21.739> in<00:04:21.890> there<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.130> got

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
transponders I put in there I got

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.630 
transponders I put in there I got
different<00:04:22.669> numbers<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:24.590> then<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.830> try<00:04:25.190> looking

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
different numbers so then I try looking

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.640 
different numbers so then I try looking
under<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.970> manual<00:04:26.540> programming<00:04:27.139> and<00:04:27.440> see<00:04:27.560> if

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
under the manual programming and see if

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.219 
under the manual programming and see if
it<00:04:27.740> can<00:04:27.830> be<00:04:27.919> done<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.310> way<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.870> at<00:04:30.110> the

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
it can be done that way and at the

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.890 
it can be done that way and at the
bottom<00:04:30.440> is<00:04:30.740> Texas<00:04:31.190> force<00:04:31.550> II<00:04:31.970> tried<00:04:32.660> going

bottom is Texas force II tried going
down<00:04:33.229> and<00:04:33.500> see<00:04:33.620> if<00:04:33.710> we'll<00:04:33.830> go<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.250> number<00:04:34.460> 7

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
down and see if we'll go to a number 7

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:43.170 
down and see if we'll go to a number 7
but<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.360> didn't<00:04:35.919> come<00:04:36.919> on<00:04:37.160> is<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.460> Texas<00:04:37.850> 4d
