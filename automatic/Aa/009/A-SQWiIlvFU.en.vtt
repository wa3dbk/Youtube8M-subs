of<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.979> thumb<00:02:05.310> drive<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.759> that's<00:02:05.939> how<00:02:06.030> you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
of your thumb drive so that's how you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.089 
of your thumb drive so that's how you
set<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.560> hopefully<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.950> makes

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
set that up so hopefully that makes

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.249 
set that up so hopefully that makes
sense<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.869> originally<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.959> thought<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.140> was

other memory cards it saved that
configuration<00:04:17.159> file<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.940> then<00:04:18.299> what<00:04:18.509> happens

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
configuration file and then what happens

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.360 
configuration file and then what happens
is<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.049> just<00:04:19.229> load<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.530> configuration<00:04:20.070> file

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
is you just load the configuration file

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.370 
is you just load the configuration file
from<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.639> USB<00:04:21.000> thumb<00:04:21.209> drive<00:04:21.449> and<00:04:21.630> save<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.289> to

from the USB thumb drive and save it to
your<00:04:22.409> memory<00:04:22.740> card<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.159> like<00:04:23.279> for<00:04:23.460> example

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
your memory card so like for example

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.110 
your memory card so like for example
here<00:04:24.930> we<00:04:25.020> go<00:04:25.169> free<00:04:25.950> mcboot<00:04:26.130> configurator<00:04:26.880> so

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
here we go free mcboot configurator so

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.560 
here we go free mcboot configurator so
let's<00:04:27.270> do

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
let's do

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.660 
let's do
yeah<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.930> you'll<00:04:28.410> see<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:29.430> might<00:04:29.580> be

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
yeah and you'll see that it might be

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.740 
yeah and you'll see that it might be

save CNF to MC 0 since i am in MC zero
memory<00:04:55.560> card<00:04:55.890> and<00:04:56.100> then<00:04:56.640> psu<00:04:57.030> browser<00:04:57.270> fnc<00:04:57.810> be
