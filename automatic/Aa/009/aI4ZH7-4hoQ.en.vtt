00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
very own eraser clay so what you're

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.369 
very own eraser clay so what you're
gonna<00:00:11.429> need<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:13.009> firm<00:00:14.009> eraser<00:00:15.109> and<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.260> high

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
gonna need is a firm eraser and a high

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.330 
gonna need is a firm eraser and a high
polymer<00:00:16.890> eraser<00:00:18.289> optionally<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.439> container<00:00:20.039> to

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
polymer eraser optionally a container to

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.769 
polymer eraser optionally a container to
keep<00:00:20.880> your<00:00:21.119> racer<00:00:21.960> clay<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.220> first<00:00:23.779> you're

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
keep your racer clay in so first you're

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.460 
keep your racer clay in so first you're
going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.109> want<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:26.070> your<00:00:26.580> firm<00:00:26.970> eraser

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
going to want to get your firm eraser

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.900 
going to want to get your firm eraser
and<00:00:28.470> hold<00:00:28.710> your<00:00:28.920> high<00:00:29.010> poly<00:00:29.279> memory<00:00:29.519> eraser

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
and hold your high poly memory eraser

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.450 
and hold your high poly memory eraser
down<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> then<00:00:33.920> use<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> Fermi

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
down like this so then use the Fermi

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.760 
down like this so then use the Fermi
research<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.000> start<00:00:36.300> erasing<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.380> high<00:00:37.500> poly

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
research to start erasing the high poly

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:52.279 
research to start erasing the high poly
mary<00:00:38.070> racer<00:00:47.989> know<00:00:49.160> you're<00:00:50.160> gonna<00:00:50.340> race<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:51.289> as

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
mary racer know you're gonna race for as

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.970 
mary racer know you're gonna race for as
long<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.829> want<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:54.829> yeah<00:00:57.379> I'm<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.440> gonna

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
long as you want so yeah I'm just gonna

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.520 
long as you want so yeah I'm just gonna
erase<00:00:59.449> until<00:01:00.449> my<00:01:00.600> arm<00:01:00.840> starts<00:01:01.230> getting

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
erase until my arm starts getting

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:13.490 
erase until my arm starts getting
extremely<00:01:02.010> tired<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:11.570> my<00:01:12.570> arm<00:01:12.780> hurts<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.290> I'm

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
extremely tired and my arm hurts so I'm

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:28.710 
extremely tired and my arm hurts so I'm
stopping

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.960 

so<00:01:29.580> just<00:01:30.580> by<00:01:31.090> erasing<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:33.040> less<00:01:33.310> than<00:01:33.910> a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
so just by erasing for less than a

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.920 
so just by erasing for less than a
minute<00:01:34.240> or<00:01:34.600> two<00:01:34.900> I<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.790> piece<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.390> eraser

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
minute or two I got a piece of eraser

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.720 
minute or two I got a piece of eraser
clay<00:01:38.110> that<00:01:38.410> big<00:01:38.650> so<00:01:40.980> I'm<00:01:41.980> just<00:01:42.310> gonna<00:01:42.460> add<00:01:42.700> it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
clay that big so I'm just gonna add it

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.770 
clay that big so I'm just gonna add it
to<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.240> eraser<00:01:43.600> clay<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.960> already<00:01:44.260> have<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
to the eraser clay I already have and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.660 
to the eraser clay I already have and
there<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:47.560> get<00:01:47.890> eraser<00:01:48.460> clay

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
there you have it you get eraser clay

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.790 
there you have it you get eraser clay
just<00:01:48.910> by<00:01:49.150> using<00:01:49.870> high<00:01:50.170> polymer

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
just by using high polymer

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.080 
just by using high polymer
other<00:01:51.310> erasers<00:01:51.850> don't<00:01:52.600> really<00:01:53.110> work<00:01:54.090> when

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
other erasers don't really work when

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.210 
other erasers don't really work when
you're<00:01:55.240> making<00:01:55.420> eraser<00:01:55.960> clay<00:01:56.170> but<00:01:57.070> high

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
you're making eraser clay but high

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.510 
you're making eraser clay but high
polymer<00:01:57.700> does<00:01:58.420> work<00:01:59.080> because<00:02:00.070> it's<00:02:00.400> like

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
polymer does work because it's like

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.170 
polymer does work because it's like
plastic<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.530> yeah<00:02:02.920> thank<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.940> for<00:02:04.030> watching

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
plastic so yeah thank you for watching

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.080 
plastic so yeah thank you for watching
bye
