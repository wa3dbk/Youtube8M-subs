00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.240 
difference with the spin-off team is
that<00:05:19.260> they're<00:05:19.380> trying<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.680> save<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.040> world

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
that they're trying to save the world

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.790 
that they're trying to save the world
not<00:05:20.610> just<00:05:20.670> one<00:05:21.330> city<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.320> it'll<00:05:22.530> feel<00:05:22.650> like<00:05:22.680> a

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
not just one city so it'll feel like a

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.800 
not just one city so it'll feel like a
much<00:05:23.010> more<00:05:23.040> international<00:05:23.550> show<00:05:24.210> they're

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
much more international show they're

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.780 
much more international show they're
making<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.230> to<00:05:25.380> be<00:05:25.530> like<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.770> 13<00:05:26.280> hour<00:05:26.400> movie

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
making it to be like a 13 hour movie

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.270 
making it to be like a 13 hour movie
like<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.090> Netflix<00:05:27.390> series<00:05:27.840> almost<00:05:28.320> it<00:05:28.800> will<00:05:29.130> be

taking it to a whole new level we do get
to<00:05:47.460> see<00:05:47.670> the<00:05:47.820> atom<00:05:48.120> shrink<00:05:48.450> down<00:05:48.570> for<00:05:48.840> the

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
to see the atom shrink down for the

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.540 
to see the atom shrink down for the
first<00:05:49.140> time<00:05:49.380> I<00:05:49.590> know<00:05:49.680> some<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.100> you<00:05:50.220> guys<00:05:50.340> had<00:05:50.520> a

video about what happened to Ray Palmer

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.130 
video about what happened to Ray Palmer
that<00:05:54.150> was<00:05:54.240> ever<00:05:54.390> just<00:05:54.600> him<00:05:54.720> like<00:05:54.900> getting

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
that was ever just him like getting

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.850 
that was ever just him like getting
embedded<00:05:55.680> with

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
embedded with

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.679 
embedded with
the<00:05:55.949> nanotech<00:05:56.490> so<00:05:56.819> now<00:05:56.939> he<00:05:57.000> can<00:05:57.150> shrink<00:05:57.479> down

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
the nanotech so now he can shrink down

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.719 
the nanotech so now he can shrink down
that's<00:05:58.620> why<00:05:58.740> they<00:05:58.889> said<00:05:59.039> in<00:05:59.129> the<00:05:59.219> trailer<00:05:59.550> so

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
that's why they said in the trailer so

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.879 
that's why they said in the trailer so
you<00:06:00.000> weren't<00:06:00.360> dead<00:06:00.599> no<00:06:01.020> I<00:06:01.050> was<00:06:01.349> just<00:06:01.469> shrunk

you weren't dead no I was just shrunk
down<00:06:02.069> that<00:06:02.789> kind<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.030> makes<00:06:03.180> it<00:06:03.240> sound<00:06:03.449> like

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
down that kind of makes it sound like

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:05.149 
down that kind of makes it sound like
team<00:06:03.930> arrows<00:06:04.199> gonna<00:06:04.289> think<00:06:04.620> that<00:06:04.740> he's<00:06:04.860> dead

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
team arrows gonna think that he's dead
