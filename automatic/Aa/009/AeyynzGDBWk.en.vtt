are<00:03:07.320> there<00:03:07.560> any<00:03:07.709> teams<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.070> particular<00:03:08.520> in

your group that you're concerned about

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.650 
your group that you're concerned about
well<00:03:10.680> first<00:03:10.920> rounds<00:03:11.190> against<00:03:11.400> pulse<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.030> we

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
well first rounds against pulse and we

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.479 
well first rounds against pulse and we
have<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.780> decent<00:03:13.320> track<00:03:13.709> record<00:03:14.010> against<00:03:14.250> them

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
have a decent track record against them

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.490 
have a decent track record against them
but<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.660> still<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.020> be<00:03:16.080> cautious<00:03:16.260> we

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
but we still have to be cautious we

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.810 
but we still have to be cautious we
can't<00:03:16.650> underestimate<00:03:16.860> them<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.580> we<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.760> to

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
can't underestimate them so we have to

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.880 
can't underestimate them so we have to
go<00:03:17.910> into<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.209> like<00:03:18.450> headstrong<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.260> then<00:03:19.769> of

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
go into it like headstrong and then of

you think if you guys played against
them<00:03:31.320> before<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.769> ever<00:03:31.799> screamed<00:03:32.100> or

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
them before have you ever screamed or

them before have you ever screamed or
anything<00:03:32.549> like<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.790> do<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.239> pretty

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
anything like that do you have a pretty

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.729 
anything like that do you have a pretty
good<00:03:33.780> track<00:03:33.930> record<00:03:34.260> against<00:03:34.470> some<00:03:34.590> where<00:03:34.709> you

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
good track record against some where you

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.060 
good track record against some where you
really<00:03:35.010> intimidated<00:03:35.690> we<00:03:36.690> well<00:03:37.530> when<00:03:37.799> we<00:03:37.860> first

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
really intimidated we well when we first

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.190 
really intimidated we well when we first
made<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.370> team<00:03:38.549> like<00:03:39.120> us<00:03:39.269> five<00:03:39.540> like<00:03:39.989> first

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
made the team like us five like first

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960 
made the team like us five like first
time<00:03:40.320> playing<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.650> played<00:03:40.799> against<00:03:41.010> curse<00:03:41.190> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
time playing we played against curse and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.440 
time playing we played against curse and
didn't<00:03:42.959> really<00:03:43.110> go<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.260> well<00:03:43.590> okay<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.670> I

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
didn't really go so well okay and I

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.050 
didn't really go so well okay and I
think<00:03:46.260> we've<00:03:46.590> won<00:03:46.829> like<00:03:47.220> once<00:03:47.459> or<00:03:47.640> twice<00:03:47.790> maybe

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
think we've won like once or twice maybe

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.170 
think we've won like once or twice maybe
okay<00:03:48.660> maybe<00:03:49.019> so<00:03:49.769> you're<00:03:49.950> luring<00:03:50.459> them<00:03:50.820> into<00:03:50.940> a

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
okay maybe so you're luring them into a

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.150 
okay maybe so you're luring them into a
false<00:03:51.630> sense<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.989> security<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.739> that<00:03:52.890> they

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
false sense of security so that they

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.250 
false sense of security so that they
don't<00:03:53.280> study<00:03:53.640> up<00:03:53.850> on<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.930> guys<00:03:55.079> can

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
don't study up on you and you guys can

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.979 
don't study up on you and you guys can
smash<00:03:55.530> face<00:03:55.769> right<00:03:56.070> yeah<00:03:56.250> pretty<00:03:56.519> much<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.959> a

didn't make it in for what some strange
of<00:04:28.169> reasons<00:04:28.560> would<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.490> continue<00:04:29.819> to

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
of reasons would you continue to

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.969 
of reasons would you continue to
possibly<00:04:30.900> keep<00:04:31.259> you<00:04:31.379> doing<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.680> League<00:04:31.889> of

possibly keep you doing the League of
Legends<00:04:32.220> pro<00:04:32.370> thing<00:04:32.580> we've<00:04:33.300> talked<00:04:33.509> about<00:04:33.599> a

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
Legends pro thing we've talked about a

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.869 
Legends pro thing we've talked about a
lot<00:04:33.930> with<00:04:34.050> our<00:04:34.080> team<00:04:34.439> and<00:04:34.680> we<00:04:35.520> still<00:04:35.729> aren't

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
lot with our team and we still aren't

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.189 
lot with our team and we still aren't
sure<00:04:36.060> on<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> answer<00:04:36.569> I<00:04:36.750> guess<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.139> probably

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
sure on the answer I guess it probably

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.110 
sure on the answer I guess it probably
depends<00:04:37.740> on<00:04:37.830> how<00:04:37.949> well<00:04:38.129> we<00:04:38.280> play<00:04:38.490> here<00:04:38.669> I<00:04:38.879> mean

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
depends on how well we play here I mean

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.450 
depends on how well we play here I mean
if<00:04:39.240> we<00:04:39.389> go<00:04:39.599> out<00:04:39.780> with<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.169> know<00:04:40.319> a<00:04:40.560> big<00:04:41.250> bang

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
if we go out with you know a big bang

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.730 
if we go out with you know a big bang
you<00:04:41.759> know<00:04:41.789> and<00:04:41.879> we're<00:04:42.120> closed<00:04:42.360> maybe<00:04:42.719> and<00:04:43.469> then

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
you know and we're closed maybe and then

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.119 
you know and we're closed maybe and then
maybe<00:04:43.919> if<00:04:44.099> we<00:04:44.280> get<00:04:44.400> stomped<00:04:44.939> by<00:04:45.150> complexity

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
maybe if we get stomped by complexity

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.830 
maybe if we get stomped by complexity
then<00:04:47.129> you<00:04:48.030> know<00:04:48.120> maybe<00:04:48.330> it's<00:04:48.539> time<00:04:48.599> to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
then you know maybe it's time to

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.830 
then you know maybe it's time to
reevaluate<00:04:49.050> what<00:04:49.530> I'm<00:04:49.800> doing<00:04:50.039> with<00:04:50.159> my<00:04:50.189> life

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
reevaluate what I'm doing with my life
