00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.140
 today with pancakes fishnet on 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.820
 yogurt 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.880
 for these pancakes on 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.310
 recipe 2 cups kefir warm slightly 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.380
 heated not hot but slightly higher than 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.150
 room temperature is almost two full 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.939
 cups of flour 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.669
 a glass of milk 2-3 tablespoons 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.180
 vegetable oil 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:38.390
 half a teaspoon of salt 1 tablespoon 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.949
 a spoon of sugar and half a teaspoon 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.000
 salt 2 eggs 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.070
 for a start we put milk to bask 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.559
 we need milk 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.370
 we can put it boiling 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.370
 warm up 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.620
 the next stage we are in kefir 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.620
 dissolve soda 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:34.880
 here I add sugar here as well 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:38.270
 there is salt and here we have eggs eggs 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.800
 we do not whip only mix for 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:47.740
 so that we have mixed yolk 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.740
 protein and respectively with kefir and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.890
 sift 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:28.600
 and gradually begin to enter into the flour 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.680
 kefir with eggs and so 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.510
 gradually interfering we achieve that 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.880
 effect 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.880
 that in flour we won't have lumps 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.470
 gradually add 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.020
 knead rather thick dough 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:57.080
 will have us look like a dough for 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.870
 pancakes inject residual liquid 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.160
 the dough was perfect 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.200
 smooth without lumps of consistency 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.670
 About how we bake fritters 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.800
 now we boil milk and constantly 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.090
 stirring 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:20.710
 we inject boiling milk and our mucus 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.710
 as if we make dough 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.230
 our dough is ready all we have left 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.570
 the last stage we introduce here two three 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.570
 tablespoons of vegetable oil 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.510
 here they have the test exactly this 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.709
 consistency as we need can 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.709
 start baking pancakes 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.319
 fry pancakes on a very well heated 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.099
 skillet remember better warmed up 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.040
 pan 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:19.539
 the more pimples we get 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:24.340
 we make creamy pancakes 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:26.949
 Butter principle is quite possible to fry on 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.690
 two pans no longer can here 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:37.889
 adjust from behind the camera but such here 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.889
 fishnet thin pancakes are obtained 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.290
 you can see everything at once 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.290
 the whole surface is covered with pores 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.289
 if you had a little dough 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.139
 thickly you can dilute 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.150
 his hot water was no longer kefir 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.849
 do not add anything if pancakes 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.889
 They are torn, you probably should report it and 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.889
 chick well and accordingly if you have dough 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:35.060
 liquid add a little flour 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:37.340
 so sorry for him all the pancakes but 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.469
 I can only say that from this 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.400
 quantities of products I got 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:46.219
 37 thin pancakes so golden 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.740
 which is possible with milk and sour cream 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.319
 with jam and stuff and pancakes top 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.280
 did everything you want and I wish you 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.599
