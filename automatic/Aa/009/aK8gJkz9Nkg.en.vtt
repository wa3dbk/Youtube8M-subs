running<00:01:28.049> back<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.470> lined<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.860> behind<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
running back is lined up behind the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
running back is lined up behind the
tackle<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.939> opposed<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> guard<00:01:31.079> because

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
tackle as opposed to the guard because

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440 
tackle as opposed to the guard because
the<00:01:31.829> quarterback<00:01:32.250> needs<00:01:32.579> more<00:01:32.820> time<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> read

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the quarterback needs more time to read

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.850 
the quarterback needs more time to read
the<00:01:33.600> defense<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.259> we'll<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the defense but we'll get to that in a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.679 
the defense but we'll get to that in a
second<00:01:35.220> he's<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> tight<00:01:36.060> end<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> his<00:01:36.479> right

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
second he's got a tight end to his right

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
second he's got a tight end to his right
three<00:01:37.320> wide<00:01:37.470> receivers<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:38.100> his<00:01:38.220> left<00:01:38.460> running

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
three wide receivers to his left running

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.100 
three wide receivers to his left running
plays<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.540> don't<00:01:39.689> matter<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.930> much

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
plays so they don't matter that much

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.260 
plays so they don't matter that much
they're<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.130> decoy<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.729> spread<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
they're more so of a decoy to spread the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
they're more so of a decoy to spread the
defense<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.810> way<00:01:42.960> what<00:01:43.829> he<00:01:43.950> does<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.159> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
defense that way what he does is this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
defense that way what he does is this
the<00:01:44.909> ball<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.180> snapped<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> shotgun<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the ball is snapped in the shotgun and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
the ball is snapped in the shotgun and
it's<00:01:47.430> either<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.000> running<00:01:48.360> play

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
it's either going to be a running play

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
it's either going to be a running play
to<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> running<00:01:48.930> back<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> right<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:50.070> he's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
to the running back to the right or he's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
to the running back to the right or he's
going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> run<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.909> left<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.810> lot<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
going to run to the left the lot the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.139 
going to run to the left the lot the
blocking<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> difficult<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.939> right

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
blocking is difficult because the right

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.090 
blocking is difficult because the right
side<00:01:54.420> has<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.810> block<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.740> blaie<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
side has to block as if the blaie is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
side has to block as if the blaie is
going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.790> while<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> left<00:01:57.600> side

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
going to the right while the left side

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.209 
going to the right while the left side
blocks<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> run<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
blocks as if the run is going to the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.130 
blocks as if the run is going to the
left<00:01:59.369> we'll<00:01:59.909> start<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.329> right<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
left we'll start with the right the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
left we'll start with the right the
tight<00:02:01.439> end<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:02.070> has<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> easiest

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
tight end right here has the easiest

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
tight end right here has the easiest
block<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> mall<00:02:03.509> he<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.049> has<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> simple

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
block of the mall he just has a simple

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.740 
block of the mall he just has a simple
hook<00:02:04.860> block<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.369> defense

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
hook block on the defense

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.330 
hook block on the defense
then<00:02:05.960> he<00:02:06.410> works<00:02:06.650> through<00:02:06.830> his<00:02:06.980> outside

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
then he works through his outside

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.310 
then he works through his outside
shoulder<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.910> keeps<00:02:08.119> contained<00:02:08.570> so<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.200> if

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
shoulder and keeps contained so that if

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.719 
shoulder and keeps contained so that if
the<00:02:09.440> money<00:02:09.590> back<00:02:09.800> goes<00:02:10.039> this<00:02:10.190> way<00:02:10.369> he<00:02:10.520> can<00:02:10.640> get

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
the money back goes this way he can get

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.110 
the money back goes this way he can get
to<00:02:10.880> his<00:02:10.910> outside<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:12.410> defense<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.700> the

to his outside the defense of the the

to his outside the defense of the the
right<00:02:14.330> guard<00:02:14.660> goes<00:02:15.530> down<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> defensive

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
right guard goes down on the defensive

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.550 
right guard goes down on the defensive
tackle<00:02:17.180> which<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.720> traditional<00:02:17.900> drive

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
tackle which is a traditional drive

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.020 
tackle which is a traditional drive
block<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.220> into<00:02:19.430> his<00:02:19.580> chest<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:19.970> you

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
block you get into his chest and you

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.000 
block you get into his chest and you
push<00:02:20.210> him<00:02:20.330> as<00:02:20.450> far<00:02:20.660> as<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.800> right

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
push him as far as you can the right

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.310 
push him as far as you can the right
guard<00:02:22.310> he<00:02:22.730> pulls<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:23.450> he<00:02:23.540> takes<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.810> step<00:02:24.080> back

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
guard he pulls so he takes a step back

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.920 
guard he pulls so he takes a step back
and<00:02:24.350> then<00:02:25.160> he<00:02:25.280> comes<00:02:25.430> outside<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.180> defect<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
and then he comes outside the defect the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.810 
and then he comes outside the defect the
tight<00:02:27.380> end<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.740> looks<00:02:28.190> for<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> first<00:02:28.610> guy<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
tight end and looks for the first guy to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.820 
tight end and looks for the first guy to
block<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.480> case<00:02:29.720> it'll<00:02:30.170> likely<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.680> the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
block in this case it'll likely be the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.820 
block in this case it'll likely be the
linebacker<00:02:31.660> now<00:02:32.660> on<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:32.990> side<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.590> little

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
linebacker now on this side is a little

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.080 
linebacker now on this side is a little
bit<00:02:34.130> different<00:02:34.490> because<00:02:34.580> like<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.030> said

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
bit different because like I said

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.880 
bit different because like I said
they're<00:02:35.570> there<00:02:35.959> assuming<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.680> plate

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
they're there assuming that the plate

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.729 
they're there assuming that the plate
could<00:02:37.070> go<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.430> left<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:39.290> left<00:02:39.320> tackle

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
could go to the left the left tackle

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.040 
could go to the left the left tackle
goes<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.730> second<00:02:41.180> level<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.600> cuts<00:02:41.870> off

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
goes to the second level and cuts off

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.810 
goes to the second level and cuts off
the<00:02:42.230> linebacker<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.890> could<00:02:43.220> be<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.489> corner<00:02:43.790> of

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
the linebacker it could be the corner of

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.820 
the linebacker it could be the corner of
the<00:02:43.970> safety<00:02:44.360> but<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.080> particular<00:02:45.290> case

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
the safety but in this particular case

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.310 
the safety but in this particular case
it's<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.190> linebacker<00:02:46.640> while<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.420> guard<00:02:47.720> he

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
it's the linebacker while the guard he

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.070 
it's the linebacker while the guard he
pulls<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.370> right<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.940> comes<00:02:50.570> in<00:02:50.750> between

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
the back side help which in this case

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.580 
the back side help which in this case
would<00:02:55.459> probably<00:02:55.910> be<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.150> safety<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.380> here's

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
would probably be the safety so here's

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.840 
would probably be the safety so here's
where<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.860> gets<00:02:57.920> interesting<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.730> we're

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
where it gets interesting and we're

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.160 
where it gets interesting and we're
going<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.000> use<00:02:59.180> an<00:02:59.300> orange<00:02:59.570> marker<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.020> show

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
going to use an orange marker to show

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.120 
going to use an orange marker to show
you<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.350> this<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.680> where<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.950> most

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
you that this is where the most

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.520 
you that this is where the most
important<00:03:01.640> part<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.270> play<00:03:02.450> goes<00:03:02.660> down<00:03:02.930> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
important part of the play goes down the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.260 
important part of the play goes down the
key<00:03:03.770> read<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.310> play<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.790> defensive

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
key read in this play is the defensive

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.840 
key read in this play is the defensive
end<00:03:05.770> what<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.860> quarterback<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.280> looking<00:03:07.670> for

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
end what the quarterback is looking for

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.699 
end what the quarterback is looking for
is<00:03:07.970> what<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.510> left<00:03:08.750> defensive<00:03:09.290> end<00:03:09.470> does

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
is what the left defensive end does

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.460 
is what the left defensive end does
because<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.910> reed<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.390> either<00:03:11.660> defensive<00:03:12.290> end

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
because the reed is either defensive end

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.320 
because the reed is either defensive end
based<00:03:12.830> on<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.100> opposite<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.850> where<00:03:14.180> the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
based on the opposite of where the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.699 
based on the opposite of where the
running<00:03:14.570> back<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.260> if<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.470> running

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
running back is going so if the running

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.860 
running back is going so if the running
backs<00:03:15.860> going<00:03:16.190> right<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:17.060> read<00:03:17.269> would<00:03:17.420> be<00:03:17.510> this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
backs going right the read would be this

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.870 
backs going right the read would be this
defensive<00:03:18.380> end<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.400> when<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.670> ball<00:03:19.850> is

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
defensive end so when the ball is

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
defense of it let's say in this

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.110 
defense of it let's say in this
particular<00:03:23.840> case<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:25.130> defensive<00:03:25.670> end<00:03:25.760> stays

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
particular case the defensive end stays

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.270 
particular case the defensive end stays
put<00:03:26.450> he<00:03:26.750> just<00:03:26.959> stays<00:03:27.140> right<00:03:27.170> there<00:03:27.410> doesn't

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280

his<00:03:31.130> spot<00:03:31.370> but<00:03:32.030> slowly<00:03:32.239> would<00:03:32.510> then<00:03:32.750> as<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
his spot but slowly would then as the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.160 
his spot but slowly would then as the
running<00:03:33.860> back<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.250> taking<00:03:34.970> his<00:03:35.120> steps<00:03:35.450> three

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
running back is taking his steps three

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.690 
running back is taking his steps three
steps<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.650> takes<00:03:36.799> him<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.160> get<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.549> middle

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
steps it takes him to get to the middle

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.960 
steps it takes him to get to the middle
he<00:03:38.299> sees<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.840> end<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.739> not<00:03:39.920> moving<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:40.790> he

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
he sees that the end is not moving so he

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.180 
he sees that the end is not moving so he
hands<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.299> off<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.110> running<00:03:42.410> back<00:03:42.560> goes

hands it off and the running back goes

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.830 
hands it off and the running back goes
to<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.489> outside<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.030> gets<00:03:44.150> as<00:03:44.269> many<00:03:44.390> yards<00:03:44.750> as

he can behind these blockers if the
