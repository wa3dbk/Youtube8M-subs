00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 Seconds 5 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.160
 Well divorce 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.160
 I think that's because of it. 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.029
 Hmm. 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:23.710
 I got married 13 years ago . 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:28.990
 We got married only on the pillow Oh so much to love 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:32.379
 Curiosity 9 Two good emotions meet and live 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.859
 The woman who worked with Jo Hye-ryun gradually changed. 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.090
 4 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:41.719
 I just want you to be on the air, 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:48.129
 A woman always does something 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.129
 I'm going to go to Japan and challenge another thing. 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:01:00.629
 I am a woman, but I am born to take the energy of your man like this . 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:05.629
 Coming period of five did so, uh watching live such a low 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.629
 There are some parts that my husband was very burdened with . 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:15.040
 4 There is such a story in a month . Yes, I fought every day. 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.980
 Ah oh 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:25.470
 Or someone who has an affection, does not raise children. 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.650
 That's what the stories are about. Yeah. It's not like that. 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.430
 U 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:37.200
 But my husband is a very ordinary person. 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:42.740
 I met an unusual person called Cho Hye-ryun and named him Kim Hyun-ki. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.740
 How hard it was to live as a husband who could not write 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.780
 The fact is negative 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.110
 If I had not met a man named I, I would meet my long, 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.850
 I think I'm going to live well. 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.990
 4 So let's decide today 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.070
 In such a life, I also think about why I first met suicide 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:13.100
 Oh, I've heard even thought that ugly now a few months passed and so sleeps Lee 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.100
 I thought I was sorry to see you go 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.310
 Still air 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.310
 I feel so sick 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:35.890
 There's only one thing like that between you and your mother-in-law. 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:38.439
 That's the theme. Nobody knows it. Yeah, it 's officially a profit. 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.980
 When it was announced, there was a lot of trouble. 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:48.110
 Well Well even that weekly recording 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:53.120
 We did not know that, but suddenly something like this happened. 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.220
 Well, I concluded some cash, but I hid it a little bit . 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.220
 Or 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.660
 If you really talk very frankly when Artemisia something that last December 5 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.500
 I got off. 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.500
 Oh , it was our 13th wedding anniversary. 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.240
 I'm really sorry, but if you finish it now 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.610
 Until I think about it 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:34.280
 I really think that I should finish the day when I started to get married. 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.280
 But I did not say that prophesied ever lived for 13 years 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:45.079
 When finished these words of Senator easily walk like that meow like a petrified 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:49.700
 Since the story will probably never have not been shocked, so why now 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:54.860
 I do not want to talk about it, 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:58.790
 I used to write my dad before. 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:03.549
 I did not even call you. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.549
 I will not be able to lose design for you . 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.420
 So then I Yoon Heaven 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:16.209
 Four months after huh Korea 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:21.579
 Yeah, well, it 's such a special thing. 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:25.650
 Everything that we accumulated over the years of May was 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.650
 Well, you decided that. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:36.610
 Other than that, the fact is that I gave you details in detail . 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.340
 I thought it was not a story about the leaf tea gag and the other person. 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.770
 Let's talk about it. 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:50.560
 I have another opinion. I think I'm really okay. 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.880
 About my friends and how I pursue a life I think 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.950
 uh 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:02.050
 I have a lot of short term, and when my husband has made such an opinion, 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:05.010
 And the part that I do not understand about my husband is my husband 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.010
 Did not understand
