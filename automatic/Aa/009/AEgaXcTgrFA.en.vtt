there's some more formal wear on this
page<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.789> well<00:01:03.059> prom<00:01:04.049> king<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.439> guess<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
page as well prom king I guess that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.890 
page as well prom king I guess that
makes<00:01:05.040> sense<00:01:05.159> cuz<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.850> prom<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
makes sense cuz the prom you know at the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.050 
makes sense cuz the prom you know at the
end<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> year<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.890> course<00:01:08.430> lots<00:01:08.850> of
