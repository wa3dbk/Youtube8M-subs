00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
playing here as the soldier with the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.040 
playing here as the soldier with the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
black box set up this is probably one of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.660 
black box set up this is probably one of
my<00:00:22.140> favorite<00:00:22.529> setups<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.980> use<00:00:23.189> when<00:00:23.430> playing

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670

as the soldier is because you do not

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.500 
as the soldier is because you do not
have<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.160> worry<00:00:26.369> about<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> medic<00:00:26.970> being<00:00:27.240> next

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
second while we start just owning up

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
second while we start just owning up
some<00:01:12.479> guys<00:01:12.659> why<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:12.990> guys<00:01:13.170> watch<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.130> black

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
some guys why you guys watch the black

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.370 
some guys why you guys watch the black
box<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> rocket<00:01:15.659> launcher<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> course<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
box is a rocket launcher of course the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.039 
box is a rocket launcher of course the
primary<00:01:16.950> weapon<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.880> every<00:01:18.119> rocket<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.840> hit

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
primary weapon for every rocket you hit

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.530 
primary weapon for every rocket you hit
someone<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.830> plus<00:01:20.549> 15<00:01:20.909> HP<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.390> your

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
someone with is plus 15 HP to your

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
someone with is plus 15 HP to your
health<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.009> downside<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
health now the downside to that is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.210 
health now the downside to that is
because<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.689> cannot<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.770> fourth

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
because you cannot have that fourth

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
because you cannot have that fourth
rocket<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.270> only<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.750> three<00:01:28.259> rockets<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
rocket you only have three rockets to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.249 
rocket you only have three rockets to
shoot<00:01:28.860> which<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.600> effective<00:01:31.170> because

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
shoot which is really effective because

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.050 
shoot which is really effective because
the<00:01:31.500> property<00:01:31.860> narrow<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.610> racket

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the property narrow is just one racket

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390 
the property narrow is just one racket
you<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.450> pussy<00:01:33.659> no<00:01:34.380> actually<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.950> really

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you little pussy no actually that really

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.069 
you little pussy no actually that really
that<00:01:35.790> rocket<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:36.750> does<00:01:36.900> matter

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that rocket really really does matter

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.319 
that rocket really really does matter
but<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.740> guess<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> does<00:01:38.460> balance<00:01:38.850> off<00:01:39.000> because

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
but I guess it does balance off because

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.960 
but I guess it does balance off because
you<00:01:39.540> get<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.840> plus<00:01:40.110> 15<00:01:40.500> HP<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.579> really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you get that plus 15 HP which is really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.700 
you get that plus 15 HP which is really
effective<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
effective and I really really do like it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.969 
effective and I really really do like it
a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.939> made<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.299> spam<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.049> groups<00:01:46.380> so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
a lot and it's made to spam in groups so

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.469 
a lot and it's made to spam in groups so
if<00:01:47.130> you're<00:01:47.280> facing<00:01:47.549> off<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> group<00:01:48.360> of
