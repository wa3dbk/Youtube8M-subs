it the Guangzhou beauty is also a direct
service<00:02:39.260> brt<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.549> that<00:02:40.760> means<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.389> buses

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
service brt so that means that the buses

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.199 
service brt so that means that the buses
come<00:02:42.019> in<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.470> out<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.430> brt<00:02:43.790> corridor
