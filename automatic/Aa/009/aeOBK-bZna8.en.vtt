see<00:00:33.850> here<00:00:34.090> I<00:00:34.210> have<00:00:34.420> simply<00:00:34.840> drove<00:00:35.199> my<00:00:35.440> tank

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859 
see here I have simply drove my tank

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.979 
see here I have simply drove my tank
into<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.460> wall<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:36.879> before<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:37.539> hit<00:00:37.749> the<00:00:37.839> wall

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
into the wall and before I hit the wall

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.290 
into the wall and before I hit the wall
I<00:00:38.019> pressed<00:00:38.409> Y<00:00:38.769> to<00:00:38.829> basically<00:00:39.730> jump<00:00:40.059> up<00:00:40.210> with

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
I pressed Y to basically jump up with

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.389 
I pressed Y to basically jump up with
the<00:00:40.359> vehicle<00:00:40.780> so<00:00:41.319> it<00:00:41.440> does<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.829> jump<00:00:42.249> in<00:00:42.339> our

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
the vehicle so it does the jump in our

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.459 
the vehicle so it does the jump in our
animation<00:00:42.819> and<00:00:43.210> once<00:00:43.749> that<00:00:43.960> happens<00:00:44.319> you

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
animation and once that happens you

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.649 
animation and once that happens you
should<00:00:44.499> eventually<00:00:45.249> end<00:00:45.729> up<00:00:45.879> going

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
should eventually end up going

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.029 
should eventually end up going
underneath<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.109> tank<00:00:47.409> and<00:00:47.620> kind<00:00:47.829> of<00:00:47.890> like

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
underneath the tank and kind of like

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.680 
underneath the tank and kind of like
kind<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.789> glitch<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.179> know<00:00:49.300> a<00:00:49.329> little<00:00:49.569> bit

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
kind of glitch you know a little bit

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.239 
kind of glitch you know a little bit
your<00:00:49.839> body<00:00:50.170> should<00:00:50.409> start<00:00:50.679> moving<00:00:50.949> about

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
your body should start moving about

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.549 
your body should start moving about
weirdly<00:00:51.819> and<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.539> should<00:00:52.719> eventually<00:00:52.989> start

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
weirdly and you should eventually start

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.649 
weirdly and you should eventually start
glitching<00:00:54.190> through<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.639> wall<00:00:54.789> into<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.269> spot

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
glitching through the wall into the spot

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.660 
glitching through the wall into the spot
that<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.989> want<00:00:56.019> to<00:00:56.319> get<00:00:56.469> into<00:00:56.739> so<00:00:57.339> I<00:00:57.370> actually

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
that you want to get into so I actually

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.340 
that you want to get into so I actually
glitched<00:00:57.909> into<00:00:58.210> this<00:00:58.359> little<00:00:58.659> kind<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.079> mall

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
glitched into this little kind of mall

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.250 
glitched into this little kind of mall
place<00:00:59.649> and<00:00:59.979> as<00:01:00.819> you<00:01:01.149> seen<00:01:01.329> I<00:01:01.449> glitched<00:01:01.749> into

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
place and as you seen I glitched into

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.110 
place and as you seen I glitched into
and<00:01:02.409> I<00:01:02.469> kind<00:01:02.679> of<00:01:02.709> spaz<00:01:03.010> though<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.489> got

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
and I kind of spaz though and got

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.510 
and I kind of spaz though and got
eventually<00:01:04.479> behind<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.320> wall<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.650> then<00:01:06.280> now

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
eventually behind the wall and then now

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.130 
eventually behind the wall and then now
I'm<00:01:06.670> just<00:01:06.850> kind<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.120> in<00:01:07.390> whether<00:01:07.690> the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
I'm just kind of in whether the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.289 
I'm just kind of in whether the
mannequins<00:01:08.590> should<00:01:08.799> be<00:01:08.920> just<00:01:09.189> kind<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.700> in<00:01:09.939> a

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
mannequins should be just kind of in a

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.630 
mannequins should be just kind of in a
close<00:01:10.539> kind<00:01:10.869> of<00:01:10.930> part<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.680> overall<00:01:12.189> this<00:01:12.460> is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
close kind of part so overall this is

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.029 
close kind of part so overall this is
quite<00:01:13.030> hard<00:01:13.240> glitch<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.689> master<00:01:14.110> but<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:15.009> a

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
quite hard glitch to master but it is a

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.440 
quite hard glitch to master but it is a
so<00:01:15.340> love<00:01:15.490> method<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.030> if<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:16.240> want<00:01:16.390> to

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
so love method so if you want to

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.480 
so love method so if you want to
experiment<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:17.020> single-player<00:01:17.619> or<00:01:17.770> do

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
experiment on single-player or do

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.950 
experiment on single-player or do
whatever<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:18.880> want<00:01:19.030> on<00:01:19.149> Mele<00:01:19.390> player<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:19.840> if

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
whatever you want on Mele player and if

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.660 
whatever you want on Mele player and if
you<00:01:20.109> don't<00:01:20.289> have<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.770> friend<00:01:21.100> online<00:01:21.310> at<00:01:21.579> the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
you don't have a friend online at the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.580 
you don't have a friend online at the
moment<00:01:21.700> time<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.359> can<00:01:22.509> just<00:01:22.539> always<00:01:23.079> do<00:01:23.229> this

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
moment time you can just always do this

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.490 
moment time you can just always do this
so<00:01:24.039> you<00:01:24.159> see<00:01:24.340> once<00:01:24.520> again<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:24.939> reversed<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.840> drove

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
so you see once again I reversed I drove

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.319 
so you see once again I reversed I drove
into<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.979> wall<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.369> before<00:01:27.759> I<00:01:27.789> hit<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.090> I

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
into the wall and before I hit it I

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.810 
into the wall and before I hit it I
pressed<00:01:28.600> Y<00:01:28.899> and<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.740> actually<00:01:29.890> managed<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.460> wall

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
pressed Y and I actually managed to wall

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.270 
pressed Y and I actually managed to wall
breach<00:01:31.030> into<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.719> wall<00:01:31.899> so<00:01:32.530> this<00:01:32.950> kind<00:01:33.219> of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
breach into the wall so this kind of

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.490 
breach into the wall so this kind of
takes<00:01:34.090> over<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.570> wall<00:01:34.780> breach<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.289> you<00:01:35.409> were

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
takes over the wall breach that you were

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.560 
takes over the wall breach that you were
able<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.770> do<00:01:35.950> with<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.159> car<00:01:36.399> but<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.179> rocks

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
able to do with the car but the rocks

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.840 
able to do with the car but the rocks
armor<00:01:37.899> must<00:01:38.320> have<00:01:38.469> not<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:39.310> kind<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.549> patched

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
armor must have not the kind of patched

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.520 
armor must have not the kind of patched
it<00:01:40.119> with<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.359> tank<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.140> it's<00:01:41.289> always<00:01:41.409> a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
it with the tank so it's always a

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.620 
it with the tank so it's always a
benefit<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:42.189> if<00:01:42.429> you<00:01:42.700> guys<00:01:42.909> want<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.299> get<00:01:43.420> back

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630
