a ham sandwich pretty plain and very

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.990 
a ham sandwich pretty plain and very
simple<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.220> think<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.820> great

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.150 
simple but I think this would be great
for<00:02:06.420> someone<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.869> doesn't<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.439> crusts<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
for someone that doesn't like crusts and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.460 
for someone that doesn't like crusts and
I<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:08.970> say<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.450> sandwich<00:02:10.200> patch

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
I would say that this sandwich patch

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.400 
I would say that this sandwich patch
