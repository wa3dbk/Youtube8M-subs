00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.469
 Hello everyone and welcome one more day to 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.960
 my channel and today I bring you a video 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.990
 little different from all I've done 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.320
 these last weeks and they bring a 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.689
 video explaining is a subject that as 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.140
 you can see in the title I leave beautiful 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.900
 arts and I'm going to start by answering 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.720
 this question and the truth is that yes yes 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.840
 that I'm going to leave fine arts and I continue 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.390
 thinking that it is a beautiful race with 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.659
 many outings that are worth doing 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.470
 if it's really what you like what 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.909
 It happens that a point has arrived that I have 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.220
 decided that I want to do what 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.799
 I 've really wanted to do all my life 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.379
 and what I've wanted to do forever 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.440
 design that more writing between by 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.019
 note this time of design that was the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.280
 first and fine arts the second as 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.310
 can not enter into design between 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.630
 thinking that I also wanted to talk 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.850
 but not fine arts is not assimilated to the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.340
 idea that I had 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.830
 would be closer to what is design and I 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.990
 he realized no and I want to do 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.140
 design so I've adopted to do 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.210
 something else like I can not get into the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.049
 race because I do not have is not my 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.080
 bridge is to make a superior module or a 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.520
 top module of graphic design that is 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.640
 one of the things that I wanted to do 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.770
 always work with computers or 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.380
 session images 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.250
 all this subject yes I 've always wanted 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.429
 do with the module this lasts two years and 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.149
 if I get good grades I could go into the 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:55.159
 design career and nothing this was a 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.290
 video explaining 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.540
 and explaining this topic of 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.830
 who left fine arts since I made you a 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.490
 video explaining 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.410
 my first semester of fine arts 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.020
 I thought it was convenient that I knew 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.000
 I was going to make a video of the base of 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.860
 second quarter but the risk that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.940
 it's not worth it has been very similar to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.760
 first to the first quarter but 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.720
 I only had two new subjects that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.030
 they were photography 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.110
 nothing to say photos and they are all nothing 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.440
 more and another thing from the technical drawing that 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.310
 it is not explained much 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.560
 and that the truth is that it saddens me 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.520
 quite leave me the arts because it was 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.200
 a career that I find very beautiful and 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.180
 what makes you grow as a person and 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.850
 also the experience of being in another 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.090
 city I have also met people 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.390
 wonderful and I felt very comfortable there 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.470
 but I've noticed that 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.780
 that I have a preference for the design and if 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.330
 I want to design design though 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.430
 fine arts I like this was a video 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.090
 simply explaining sixth I wanted 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.130
 explain you 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.770
 I leave my social networks below and 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.080
 during this week you will have more videos 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.080
 and a very big kiss arias
