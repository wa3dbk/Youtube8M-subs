just made this little choker deal with

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939 
just made this little choker deal with
the<00:00:24.150> wire<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.449> had<00:00:24.840> from<00:00:25.080> pulling<00:00:25.289> my<00:00:25.470> SATs<00:00:25.740> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the wire I had from pulling my SATs I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
the wire I had from pulling my SATs I
didn't<00:00:26.160> bring<00:00:26.310> any<00:00:26.570> if<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:27.960> there's<00:00:28.140> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
didn't bring any if you see there's a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.650 
didn't bring any if you see there's a
loop<00:00:28.439> right<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:32.090> loop<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
loop right here and loop right here that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.319 
loop right here and loop right here that
it's<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.290> through<00:00:35.210> retired

another<00:00:41.640> loop<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> pretty<00:00:42.930> much<00:00:42.989> gonna

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
another loop and pretty much gonna

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.869 
another loop and pretty much gonna
tighten<00:00:44.430> down<00:00:44.460> around<00:00:44.850> his<00:00:45.030> neck<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:48.440> um<00:00:49.879> tie

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
tighten down around his neck and um tie

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.939 
tighten down around his neck and um tie
this<00:00:50.940> end<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> tree<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:54.469> try<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.739> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this end to a tree and try to get it to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.029 
this end to a tree and try to get it to
where<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.510> can<00:00:57.510> open<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.199> wolf<00:00:58.440> trap<00:00:58.770> which

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
where I can open up that wolf trap which

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.760 
where I can open up that wolf trap which
is<00:00:59.390> really<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.480> mean<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.989> wicked<00:01:01.140> trap<00:01:01.530> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
is really I mean it's a wicked trap to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.650 
is really I mean it's a wicked trap to
open<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.190> especially<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> live<00:01:03.180> crater

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
open up especially with the live crater

00:01:03.660 --> 00:03:29.569 
open up especially with the live crater
on<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> give<00:01:06.450> her<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> shot

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.960 

there<00:03:30.579> is<00:03:32.069> so<00:03:33.069> it's<00:03:33.220> pretty<00:03:33.430> fucked<00:03:33.790> up

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
there is so it's pretty fucked up

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.800 
there is so it's pretty fucked up
hopefully<00:03:34.269> makes<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:36.239> can't<00:03:37.239> keep<00:03:37.480> them<00:03:37.660> it's

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
hopefully makes it can't keep them it's

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.240 
hopefully makes it can't keep them it's
after<00:03:38.139> season<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:38.769> till<00:03:38.980> they<00:03:39.100> struggle<00:03:39.519> on

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
after season just till they struggle on

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.880 
after season just till they struggle on
it's<00:03:42.250> too<00:03:42.730> bad
