00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.280
 it means you need to do to us 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.680
 have a smooth color transition with 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.580
 using a pasta machine my world I 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.510
 I want to go from green to white 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:44.270
 I take a green piece of mash it 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:48.410
 he has become soft again and is forming 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.809
 it's a triangle here 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.260
 about a triangle I turned out 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.680
 and make the second triangle of white 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.680
 colors 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.840
 Then I combine these two triangles 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.210
 so that we have one common 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.210
 you see a rectangle suffered what 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.490
 so here's what I will do with 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.020
 using the post machine is quite possible to do 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.610
 from push it will just be a little bit longer 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.400
 so the meaning is that we 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.530
 here is this plate 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.770
 roll out then fold in half 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.290
 again roll out again fold in half and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.869
 this edge will be white this one 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.090
 the edge will be green and in the middle of us 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.650
 it will turn from green to white 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.080
 because we have these colors here 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.390
 will begin to mix and here will 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.030
 more green and the closer we move 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.490
 there will be more white now 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.490
 see how it happens on 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:05.259
 own two rollers how to install 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:10.959
 distance on the map here we have our this 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:13.090
 little thing folded it in half right here 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.830
 in which direction it is not 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.959
 other side and we have it again casco 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.390
 car and now this operation is repeated and 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.150
 we repeat until we have colors 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.150
 mix dollars a evenly 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:42.689
 what we do files we can 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.689
 make cups 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.700
 and we are already quietly starting 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.140
 become visible as here here on 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.830
 border they are a little disturb 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.370
 stir now let's continue 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.560
 we will see it better and better 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.810
 better you see there already started 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.790
 shine through the middle also a piece 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.020
 we need this thing to not 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:38.890
 striped pro with exactly exactly 5 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:41.860
 Upnut direct but you see we are already straight 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.950
 getting closer to our desired 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.950
 the result 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.710
 already almost we have an even color 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.570
 if now we are this one here we are 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.250
 can stretch and for example 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.350
 chop fold over each other you 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.800
 it turns out the petals are like a lily in 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.299
 a book can stretch it the other way around 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.190
 in this direction let's get a piece of it 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.190
 cut and here's an example 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.280
 stretch it in such a direction otherwise 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.699
 we can pull the main thing do not pull 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.490
 for ends so as not to break 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:43.159
 move along this piece by 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.199
 little by little, headphones can be 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.889
 again to make a typewriter but the machine 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:51.680
 you just flatten him well, that is, you 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.330
 make the minimum thickness and all you 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.939
 you need for example to do this thing longer 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.889
 that's when I pull it in my hands 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.690
 lengthened not only due to the fact that 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.759
 it gets thinner but due to the fact that 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.500
 he becomes already that is, see me 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.259
 Here was such a corner and when 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.789
 pulled he became narrower here's the car 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.740
 you will not do this that is you 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:16.819
 can do the top hands here 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:17.990
 It turned out such a piece and now 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.620
 this one 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:25.689
 as a roll as we wrapped 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:30.800
 we will roll and roll away from lighter 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:33.379
 to a darker here we have again 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.750
 It turned out a kind of sausage with a pattern on 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:39.770
 I’ll cut a little bit and ride what I’ve got 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:43.520
 all its there and stuck to each other after 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.639
 this we cut off earlier and we get 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.009
 color transition like the one we did 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.110
 with your pieces but here it is much 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:54.139
 more uniform because we got 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.020
 here it is the uniform stretching and after 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.979
 this turned and and here is such a thing you can 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.319
 it was not the thing to twist and roll 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.300
 start folding the harmonica from over 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.069
 light to darker then you 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.509
 got a little bar which with one 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.719
 sides to bright sides 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:13.430
 dark has between now these extreme 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.589
 the color transition itself is also in the book 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.790
 used when you're done here these 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:19.540
 flowers 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.540
 on the bracelet
