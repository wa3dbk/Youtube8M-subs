around<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.850> corner<00:01:30.890> okay<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:31.950> now<00:01:32.340> we're

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
around the corner okay so now we're

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
around the corner okay so now we're
going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> lighter<00:01:33.360> color<00:01:33.720> over<00:01:34.320> the

going to put a lighter color over the
dark<00:01:35.040> wall<00:01:35.630> normally<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> situation

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
dark wall normally this is a situation

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
dark wall normally this is a situation
where<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.890> would<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> prime<00:01:38.759> over<00:01:38.970> this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
where you would have to prime over this

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.270 
where you would have to prime over this
dark<00:01:39.420> color<00:01:39.600> first<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.860> since<00:01:41.070> we're<00:01:41.250> using

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
dark color first but since we're using

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.210 
dark color first but since we're using
the<00:01:41.759> aura<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.509> self<00:01:42.810> priming<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:44.009> won't

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the aura which is self priming it won't

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.999 
the aura which is self priming it won't
be<00:01:44.369> necessary

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
be necessary

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.460 
be necessary

first when you open the paint and you
look<00:01:52.380> at<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> that's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.460> an<00:01:53.820> accurate

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
look at it that's not really an accurate

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.850 
look at it that's not really an accurate
description<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> color<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.680> gonna

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
then we're going to begin to cut in

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860 
then we're going to begin to cut in
these<00:02:13.489> walls<00:02:13.730> are<00:02:13.879> really<00:02:14.030> bumpy<00:02:14.450> I'm<00:02:14.540> having

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
these walls are really bumpy I'm having

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.600 
these walls are really bumpy I'm having
trouble<00:02:15.200> coming<00:02:15.349> in<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.620> straight<00:02:15.860> line<00:02:16.099> so<00:02:16.340> I'm

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
trouble coming in a straight line so I'm

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.330 
trouble coming in a straight line so I'm
gonna<00:02:16.849> revert<00:02:17.359> to<00:02:17.659> taping<00:02:18.049> this<00:02:18.349> off<00:02:18.590> just

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
gonna revert to taping this off just

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.369 
gonna revert to taping this off just
make<00:02:19.489> sure<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.150> really<00:02:20.780> press<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.230> down

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
make sure that you really press it down

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.199 
make sure that you really press it down
really<00:02:21.739> well<00:02:21.859> because<00:02:22.219> if<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:22.609> don't<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.060> pad

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
really well because if you don't the pad

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.140 
really well because if you don't the pad
will<00:02:23.359> bleed<00:02:23.599> underneath<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.620> tape<00:02:24.939> so<00:02:25.939> once

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
will bleed underneath the tape so once

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.780 
will bleed underneath the tape so once
we've<00:02:26.329> got<00:02:26.359> this<00:02:26.719> all<00:02:27.019> for<00:02:27.349> us<00:02:27.409> down<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:28.459> should

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
we've got this all for us down it should

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.679 
we've got this all for us down it should
help<00:02:29.090> us<00:02:29.359> get<00:02:29.659> a<00:02:29.689> nice<00:02:29.959> straight<00:02:30.409> line<00:02:31.689> okay

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
help us get a nice straight line okay

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.369 
help us get a nice straight line okay
and<00:02:32.840> now<00:02:33.290> we're<00:02:33.500> going<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:34.989> just<00:02:35.989> make<00:02:36.170> sure

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
and now we're going to just make sure

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.869 
and now we're going to just make sure
that<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.620> don't<00:02:36.739> load<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.159> paint<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.579> too

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
that you don't load the paint on too

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.360 
that you don't load the paint on too
heavy<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.480> too<00:02:38.959> thick<00:02:39.290> because<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.189> don't

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
heavy and too thick because you don't

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.149 
heavy and too thick because you don't
want<00:02:40.549> it<00:02:40.609> to<00:02:40.730> bleed<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.359> can<00:02:41.540> cut<00:02:41.780> in

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.949 

so<00:02:46.159> we've<00:02:46.579> started<00:02:46.939> with<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.329> green<00:02:47.689> color

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
so we've started with the green color

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.920 
so we've started with the green color
the<00:02:48.230> Aussie<00:02:48.379> pair<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.099> I've<00:02:50.060> turned<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
the Aussie pair and I've turned the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.860 
the Aussie pair and I've turned the
corner<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.519> when<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:52.939> cut<00:02:53.239> in<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.750> don't

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
corner so that when we cut in you don't

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.460 
corner so that when we cut in you don't
see<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.470> existing<00:02:55.040> underlying<00:02:55.730> color

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
see the existing underlying color

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.050 
see the existing underlying color
underneath<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.220> now<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.669> I've<00:02:58.760> turned<00:02:58.909> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
underneath and now that I've turned the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.849 
underneath and now that I've turned the
corner<00:02:59.209> I'm<00:02:59.419> going<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.629> let<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.750> dry<00:03:00.019> I'm<00:03:00.560> going

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859

second<00:04:05.269> or<00:04:05.359> third<00:04:05.419> pass<00:04:06.430> it'll<00:04:07.430> be<00:04:07.579> pretty

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819

well<00:04:08.090> loaded<00:04:08.299> up<00:04:09.159> and<00:04:10.159> we're<00:04:10.400> going<00:04:10.639> to<00:04:12.519> test

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
well loaded up and we're going to test

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.249 
well loaded up and we're going to test
out<00:04:13.729> the<00:04:13.879> aura<00:04:14.030> paint<00:04:14.269> using<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.810> light<00:04:14.989> color

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
out the aura paint using the light color

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.229 
out the aura paint using the light color
over<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.739> dark<00:04:16.009> color<00:04:16.280> now<00:04:16.549> normally<00:04:16.970> we<00:04:17.090> go

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
over a dark color now normally we go

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.270 
over a dark color now normally we go
over<00:04:17.479> a<00:04:17.509> dark<00:04:17.750> brown<00:04:18.049> like<00:04:18.349> this<00:04:18.380> normally<00:04:18.979> you

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
over a dark brown like this normally you

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.819 
over a dark brown like this normally you
have<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.790> prime<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.209> color<00:04:20.570> like<00:04:20.870> this<00:04:21.109> but

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
have to prime a color like this but

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.620 
have to prime a color like this but
since<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.250> order<00:04:22.550> has<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.850> primer<00:04:23.120> right<00:04:23.420> in

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
since the order has the primer right in

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.040 
since the order has the primer right in
the<00:04:23.750> paint<00:04:24.790> priming<00:04:25.790> is<00:04:25.910> not<00:04:26.090> necessary<00:04:26.780> let's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
the paint priming is not necessary let's

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.990 
the paint priming is not necessary let's
see<00:04:27.260> how<00:04:27.410> well<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.919> aura<00:04:28.130> covers<00:04:28.639> over<00:04:28.850> the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
see how well the aura covers over the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.170 
see how well the aura covers over the
chocolate<00:04:29.510> brown<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:30.110> like<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.190> use<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.400> W<00:04:33.070> motion

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
chocolate brown I like to use a W motion

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.150 
chocolate brown I like to use a W motion
going<00:04:35.180> across<00:04:35.630> I'm<00:04:36.110> applying<00:04:36.680> even<00:04:36.980> pressure

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
going across I'm applying even pressure

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:47.220 
going across I'm applying even pressure
and<00:04:42.760> then<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:43.910> want<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.180> pass<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.630> back<00:04:44.810> over

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.379 

now<00:04:48.230> if<00:04:48.290> this<00:04:48.410> was<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.680> bigger<00:04:48.980> wall<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.730> would

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
now if this was a bigger wall I would

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.870 
now if this was a bigger wall I would
have<00:04:50.840> attached<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.500> long<00:04:51.710> extension<00:04:52.190> pole<00:04:52.580> so

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
have attached a long extension pole so

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.270 
have attached a long extension pole so
that<00:04:52.910> I<00:04:53.060> can<00:04:53.300> reach<00:04:53.650> further<00:04:54.650> away<00:04:54.919> but<00:04:55.130> since

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
that I can reach further away but since

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.720 
that I can reach further away but since
I'm<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.910> small<00:04:56.500> wall<00:04:57.500> oven<00:04:57.890> it's<00:04:58.220> not<00:04:58.490> very

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730

00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:54.559 
until the weather's nice and dry because

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:56.469 
until the weather's nice and dry because
when<00:06:54.889> you<00:06:55.009> pull<00:06:55.279> the<00:06:55.459> tape<00:06:55.699> off<00:06:55.729> the<00:06:56.300> wall

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 
when you pull the tape off the wall

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.779 
when you pull the tape off the wall
you'll<00:06:56.930> probably<00:06:57.229> pull<00:06:57.770> the<00:06:57.889> paint<00:06:58.129> off<00:06:58.459> with

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
you'll probably pull the paint off with

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.149 
you'll probably pull the paint off with
it<00:06:58.969> so<00:06:59.330> wait<00:06:59.629> for<00:06:59.659> a<00:07:00.050> nice<00:07:00.199> cool<00:07:00.469> day<00:07:00.680> or<00:07:00.889> turn

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159 
it so wait for a nice cool day or turn

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.829 
it so wait for a nice cool day or turn
that<00:07:01.339> air<00:07:01.520> on<00:07:01.699> before<00:07:02.089> you<00:07:02.209> do<00:07:02.389> this<00:07:02.539> project

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:02.839 
that air on before you do this project

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.499 
that air on before you do this project
okay<00:07:03.800> so<00:07:03.860> let's<00:07:04.219> take<00:07:04.430> that<00:07:04.490> tape<00:07:04.909> off<00:07:05.089> slow

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 
okay so let's take that tape off slow

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:48.330 
okay so let's take that tape off slow
and<00:07:05.539> steady

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:48.340 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.499 

there<00:07:49.340> you<00:07:49.460> go<00:07:49.639> that's<00:07:49.850> how<00:07:49.970> you<00:07:50.120> get<00:07:50.240> a<00:07:50.300> nice

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:50.509 
there you go that's how you get a nice

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:52.090 
there you go that's how you get a nice
clean<00:07:50.840> line<00:07:51.050> and<00:07:51.350> that's<00:07:51.500> how<00:07:51.650> you<00:07:51.710> do<00:07:51.949> an

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.100 
clean line and that's how you do an

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.380 
clean line and that's how you do an
accent<00:07:52.520> wall<00:07:52.729> looks<00:07:53.090> great<00:07:53.389> delicious
