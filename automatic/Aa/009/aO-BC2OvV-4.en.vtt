00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.389
 that although they like bows and 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 welcome to a new video of fifa 15 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.360
 since his son of 16 and they bathed me good 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.150
 9 were worth but they gave me a strike and 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.880
 they deleted my video but well that's not 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.340
 matter what important gentlemen is that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.630
 we are in a new video of frank 15 and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.940
 as you can see in the image are the orchids 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 awards that are the arquillos awards 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.239
 good a very good way to dismiss 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 this game is rewarding everything that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.469
 was better in this game for example at 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.540
 best goalkeeper to the best defense to 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:53.560
 revelation defense to the best goal 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.560
 It is the best letter 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.280
 anything gentlemen and how are you going to 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.260
 choose these these categories 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.500
 well here is where you are going to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.040
 interact with me and with the channel and they go 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.600
 to put the triples today is Wednesday the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.060
 I want to start the series on Friday 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.280
 so they have two days emerged for 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.560
 leave me in the comments 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.460
 what is your category for example 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:27.770
 suppose that alfredito jimÃ©nez said 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 that his category is the best player in 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.039
 bronze ok then when I do the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.159
 video can say good and in the 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.700
 category of alfredito jimÃ©nez 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.859
 the best bronze player we have these 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.500
 participants and I'll put them and the 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:48.140
 winner was such total and there goes to 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.450
 appear your image when I say of 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.119
 who is the category I do not know if I gave 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.649
 understand then what you have 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.189
 what to do here in the comments of 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:02.119
 expose what categories they would like to see 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.590
 these awards today orchids like them 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.730
 I'm giving an idea the team more 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.970
 funny 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.270
 which the player who makes the most goal 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.970
 better is killer the best goalkeeper the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.180
 best best lateral defense 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.870
 the funniest technical director or the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.480
 Ugly player I do not know about you if this one 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.480
 this idea will obviously be going to be 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.820
 with the footballers that I have approved 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.850
 if I maybe the best to the best letter 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.800
 of the game well for me it was I do not know 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.010
 not lent and for someone who tried to 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.110
 Cristiano Ronaldo has of the year 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.920
 It was the best, but I did not try it 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.410
 then it will be according to the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.510
 players or the teams or the cards that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.340
 I tried then in the comments 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.650
 here they have to put their category 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.990
 and when I introduced her I will say her 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.720
 names to do a little bit of 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.720
 interaction with the channel and well this 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.740
 series is going to be the last of the 15th fa 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 obviously it's going to go up before it's 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.840
 between 16 some other videos like 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.270
 golazos teams and so knowing yet 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.910
 will be then but this base as 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.760
 being important to dismiss what 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.110
 was this good fifa 15 game so 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.090
 do not forget to put your comments 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.430
 categories files and we'll see you until a 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.450
 next video on Friday starts this 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.970
 series 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.810
