00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.349
 so contrary to popular belief the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.570
 practice of running requires a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.340
 warming up a quality of 15 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.660
 minutes of warm-up and counselor 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.000
 to prepare the body for the effort 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.380
 the preparation of the musculo system 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.539
 tendinous at the ankles of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.010
 knee and pelvis is advised so the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.420
 first exercise is a betting exercise 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.910
 on the way to working in 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.980
 straight line with cups lay 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 regular intervals one can choose 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 a distance of 15 meters to have 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.210
 a cup then we ask 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.250
 athlete 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.379
 to perform a series of races 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 alternate which is a work of support 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.629
 specific so the runner goes on by 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.220
 a talent exercise then makes a 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.519
 racing work he then goes on 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.899
 an exercise of knee climbs and one 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.129
 back on a race job and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.129
 come back slowly trotting 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.940
 so the second exercise allows for 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.580
 prepare the region of the ankles 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.580
 knees and pelvis we will alternate 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.520
 specific stretching on the calves 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.050
 on the hamstrings and we will alternate 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.360
 his specific stretching with a 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.800
 cladding work on the high level of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.550
 basin at first we have a 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.869
 stretching exercise on the calves 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.869
 so we control the basin well 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.330
 nan men's leg forward and 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.460
 an extension of the back leg that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.440
 allows you to stretch your calf 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.080
 be careful well controlled well 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.369
 stay win at the basin level have 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.050
 do his exercises for 6 seconds 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.580
 then we change legs alternates 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.560
 we go on the other leg 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.020
 here with a little time of relaxation 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.259
 between the two we take the same position 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.869
 here is basin well in position he comes 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.250
 control well gain then relax 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.380
 completely and we go on a 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.250
 dynamic exercise we hop on the spot 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.920
 for 6 seconds 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.070
 we see small jumps very reactive 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.229
 the ground on one tries to multiply 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.910
 ground contact time in a second 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.149
 time we go on an exercise of 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.950
 ventral sheathing so the athlete comes to 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.250
 put in position in support of 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.630
 elbows 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.300
 he fixes his pelvis people but dismissed 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.120
 the quarters of people must be 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.160
 about that of the hips gap 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.510
 the gaze firmly fixed to the ground one can 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.310
 look from time to time 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.920
 is what it takes is that the basin 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.540
 is really fixed in the tale 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.580
 is an alignment of the body almost 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.760
 perfect third time of exercise 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.880
 we come and pull the region now 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.820
 hamstrings standing 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.200
 the athlete but pose kids this heel 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.700
 in the soil and gradually goes down 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.640
 forward up the tip of 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.710
 feet the support leg stays well camped 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.150
 also in the ground to the back and 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.790
 then we end with an action 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.670
 dynamic heels buttocks this is where 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.350
 also while in frequency we increase the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.680
 rhythm protection during 5 to 6 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.750
 seconds 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.070
 we try to bere it is well to win 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.650
 also at the basin level throughout 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.420
 the duration of the exercise and let go 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.400
 gradually we finish with a 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.020
 lateral sheathing therefore in ground position 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.210
 resting on the forearm 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.740
 that's the key to the smeda position in 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.810
 extension at the basin level we support 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.330
 on the forearm the head to stay well 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.709
 in the extension of the body and the soul 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.830
 a book is set at the level of 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.830
 hips 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.620
 so this third exercise is a 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.330
 speed training exercise 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.380
 in the first zone in demand to 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.360
 runners doing exercises 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.420
 Specific rise knee heels buttocks 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.709
 and then chained them with a race 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.060
 and crowds is far more important 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.709
 to prepare your body for the effort 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.420
 and at speed 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.850
 the first support zone takes place on 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.030
 a distance of 20 to 30 meters and one 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.459
 can go on 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.959
 distant 50 to 80 m on the second 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.150
 phase of work it is necessary to insist 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.950
 on the fact that the race lure on the 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.120
 second part must be progressive and 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.470
 we have to finish that a crowd is 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.910
 important to come prepare for the 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.280
 speed so this last exercise and a 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.860
 exercise that ends the warm up 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.870
 it's an interval training exercise where 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.200
 runners are asked to make a 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.270
 race lasting 15 to 20 seconds at 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.459
 the end of that race she recovers 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.900
 its maintenance by either walking in 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.690
 a recovery area 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.660
 the recovery time is equal or 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.100
 so much effort after twenty-five to 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.169
 twenty seconds he's coming back into 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.520
 the starting area and at the signal he leaves 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.030
 for a second race on the same 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.980
 pace so this last phase 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.920
 warm-up is for the purpose of 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.780
 although raising the locker single file 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.630
 the cardiac system is also a moment 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.420
 given to keep an effective impact on 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.780
 the muscular system 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.200
 this exercise can be repeated 5 6 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.200
 7 times
