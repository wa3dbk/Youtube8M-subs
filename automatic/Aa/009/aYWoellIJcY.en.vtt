pair starts we disassemble a with a like
then<00:01:02.050> right<00:01:02.409> now<00:01:02.620> here<00:01:03.040> we<00:01:03.220> have<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.550> elements

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
then right now here we have the elements

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.530 
then right now here we have the elements
these<00:01:04.780> are<00:01:04.839> these<00:01:05.649> elements<00:01:06.550> are<00:01:06.729> never<00:01:07.300> the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
these are these elements are never the

these are these elements are never the
assemble<00:01:08.020> there<00:01:08.200> will<00:01:08.710> be<00:01:08.740> elements<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.399> we

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
assemble there will be elements and we

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.150 
assemble there will be elements and we
just<00:01:09.700> assemble<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.570> elements<00:01:11.140> with<00:01:11.800> an<00:01:11.979> easy

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
just assemble the elements with an easy

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.690 
just assemble the elements with an easy
knot<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.880> you'll<00:01:13.090> see<00:01:13.360> soon<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:15.190> made<00:01:15.520> with

the same inner tubes but is it different

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:31.840 
the same inner tubes but is it different
not<00:01:18.399> so<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.700> can<00:01:18.970> do<00:01:19.690> it<00:01:19.780> very<00:01:19.960> cool<00:01:20.259> quick

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850

each<00:01:32.450> one<00:01:32.810> has<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.920> be<00:01:34.100> like<00:01:35.590> halfway<00:01:37.360> caballo

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
each one has to be like halfway caballo

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:48.090 
each one has to be like halfway caballo
squirtle<00:01:38.900> Vera

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.940 

from<00:01:49.100> here<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.970> then<00:01:50.690> we<00:01:50.960> put<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.650> up<00:01:51.770> like

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
from here and then we put it up like

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:09.639 
from here and then we put it up like
that<00:01:56.080> move<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.229> like<00:01:57.320> that<00:02:07.570> yeah<00:02:08.570> we<00:02:08.840> cover<00:02:09.410> the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
that move it like that yeah we cover the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.229 
that move it like that yeah we cover the
distance<00:02:11.020> with<00:02:12.190> recycled<00:02:13.190> billboards<00:02:13.760> or<00:02:13.970> you
