with<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:15.680> less<00:00:16.680> sweet<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:19.609> don't<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
with a less sweet so I don't have to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.970 
with a less sweet so I don't have to
look<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> contact<00:00:21.810> point<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.500> shot<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
look at the contact point on this shot I

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.590 
look at the contact point on this shot I
don't<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.490> get<00:00:23.609> behind<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.150> 9<00:00:24.330> over

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
don't have to get behind the 9 over

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.210 
don't have to get behind the 9 over
there<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.019> lineup<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> contact<00:00:25.980> point

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
there in the lineup the contact point

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.790 
there in the lineup the contact point
the<00:00:26.760> system<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> take<00:00:27.720> me<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the system is going to take me to the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.030 
the system is going to take me to the
proper<00:00:29.279> aim<00:00:29.849> line<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.199> doing<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.769> I'm

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
proper aim line and in doing so I'm

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.319 
proper aim line and in doing so I'm
going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.520> slight<00:00:32.790> over<00:00:33.120> cut

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
going to be in a slight over cut

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.959 
going to be in a slight over cut
position<00:00:33.980> now<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> wanted<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> bank<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
position now if I wanted to bank this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.360 
position now if I wanted to bank this
ball<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.440> outside<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.190> I'm

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
ball here of the a and outside of it I'm

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360 
ball here of the a and outside of it I'm
not<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.879> shoot<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.329> shot<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.100> I<00:00:41.100> bench

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
not going to shoot that shot so I bench

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.350 
not going to shoot that shot so I bench
to<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.750> Center<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> edge<00:00:43.670> sweep<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
to a Center to edge sweep right into the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:01:00.529 
to a Center to edge sweep right into the
slide<00:00:45.660> over<00:00:46.050> cut<00:00:55.940> now<00:00:58.070> I'm<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.539> use

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
slide over cut now I'm just going to use

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.130 
slide over cut now I'm just going to use
a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.730> logic<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.719> knowledge

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
a little bit of logic with my knowledge

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.320 
a little bit of logic with my knowledge
of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> system<00:01:04.880> if<00:01:05.880> inside<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> takes<00:01:07.080> me<00:01:07.290> here

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
of the system if inside a takes me here

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
of the system if inside a takes me here
then<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> ask<00:01:09.659> myself<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.500> does<00:01:10.710> inside<00:01:11.340> B<00:01:11.610> do

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
then I ask myself what does inside B do

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.810 
then I ask myself what does inside B do
well<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.840> thinner<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> it's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
well it's going to be thinner so it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.460 
well it's going to be thinner so it's
going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.090> take<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.450> somewhere<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
going to take me somewhere in here I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.980 
going to take me somewhere in here I
don't<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.250> might<00:01:18.180> want<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> stand

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
don't know I might want to have to stand

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870 
don't know I might want to have to stand
behind<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.409> line<00:01:19.680> over<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.520> look<00:01:20.700> at

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
behind that line over there and look at

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.950 
behind that line over there and look at
a<00:01:21.799> contact<00:01:22.799> pick<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> spot<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.479> rail<00:01:24.689> if

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
a contact pick out a spot on the rail if

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.070 
a contact pick out a spot on the rail if
I<00:01:25.080> had<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:26.360> I'd<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> creek

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
I had to do that I'd be up the creek

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
I had to do that I'd be up the creek
without<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.009> paddle

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
without a paddle

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.480 
without a paddle
and<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.700> inside<00:01:36.360> B

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
and so what I'm going to do is inside B

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
and so what I'm going to do is inside B
and<00:01:38.869> it's<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> carry<00:01:40.290> me<00:01:40.530> here

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and it's going to carry me here

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.940 
and it's going to carry me here
which<00:01:41.250> means<00:01:41.549> 1<00:01:42.180> 2<00:01:42.450> 3<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> pocket<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
which means 1 2 3 to this pocket and so

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.999 
which means 1 2 3 to this pocket and so
what<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.000> control<00:01:48.420> my<00:01:48.720> speed

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
what I have to do is control my speed

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.100 
what I have to do is control my speed
and<00:01:50.009> my<00:01:50.070> spin<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.299> I'm<00:01:51.390> actually<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.840> using

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and my spin and I'm actually not using

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
and my spin and I'm actually not using
spin<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:52.829> I'm<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> vertical<00:01:53.460> axis<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
spin here I'm on the vertical axis of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.120 
spin here I'm on the vertical axis of
the<00:01:54.149> ball<00:01:54.530> it's<00:01:55.530> getting<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> little<00:01:55.860> bit<00:01:56.040> low

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
the ball it's getting a little bit low

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.520 
the ball it's getting a little bit low
I've<00:01:59.130> got<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.729> stroke<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.380> see<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I've got to have a good stroke to see to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.280 
I've got to have a good stroke to see to
ease<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.920> visual<00:02:02.430> system<00:02:02.869> but<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> must

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
ease the visual system but you must

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.570 
ease the visual system but you must
bring<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.920> good<00:02:06.500> reliable<00:02:07.500> stroke<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
bring a good reliable stroke to the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.870 
bring a good reliable stroke to the
to<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.910> table<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.810> age<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.200> be

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
to the table so I have age to be

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:25.920 
to the table so I have age to be
centered<00:02:11.880> age<00:02:13.130> inside<00:02:14.130> sweet

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.420 

and<00:02:26.930> that's<00:02:27.379> a<00:02:27.500> pretty<00:02:27.709> good<00:02:27.950> effort<00:02:28.099> on<00:02:28.400> that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and that's a pretty good effort on that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.530 
and that's a pretty good effort on that
ball<00:02:30.340> if<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.459> were<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> game<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.030> one<00:02:32.299> pocket

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
ball if I were in a game of one pocket

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.920 
ball if I were in a game of one pocket
and<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.049> I<00:02:33.409> got<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.640> close<00:02:34.909> to<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.420> angle<00:02:35.840> I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and I I got that close to the angle I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.080 
and I I got that close to the angle I
feel<00:02:36.230> real<00:02:36.470> good<00:02:36.500> about<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.430> system<00:02:37.849> did

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
feel real good about it the system did
