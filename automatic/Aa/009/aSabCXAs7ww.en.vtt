00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.990
 the green digital control unit max 94 80 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.210
 automates lawn watering 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.920
 of the garden as well as of the plants both those 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.259
 in pots than those at home 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.789
 the package includes the control unit alla 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.710
 as already seen a reducer for i 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.180
 three-quarter-inch taps the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.400
 quick connector for the tube 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.760
 irrigation is a practical door 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.470
 protective for the display 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.730
 the control unit to an inlet connection 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.399
 with mesh filter to clean 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.710
 periodically an exit connection from 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.999
 three quarters of an inch dial with 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.629
 push-button panel and crystal display 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:43.719
 outgoing liquids screw up the attack 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.549
 quick included in this case we have 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.289
 faucet with the exit from three quarters of 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:48.940
 inch we must then use 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.149
 the special reducer to screw to 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.799
 control unit screws the control unit to 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.969
 tap 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:58.499
 in the end it remains free to be 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.499
 oriented at will 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.680
 now we can graft our tube 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.480
 irrigation as a preliminary action 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.510
 the battery compartment must be opened for 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.920
 insert a 9 volt alkaline battery 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.710
 when the compartment is closed, the door is applied 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.930
 protective the water supply opens 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.490
 and we proceed with the programming that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.920
 start by setting the current day 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.590
 of the week the cursor scrolls 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.660
 by pressing the buttons 10 to confirm the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.110
 highlighted day you press the ha button 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.810
 the next item is time and refers 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.119
 then current with the keys b and si 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 make the hours slide before you 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.040
 confirms the choice with the a allo key 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.369
 the same way the minutes are set 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.500
 with the next start phase you enter 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.880
 in the midst of programming because yes 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.360
 then establishes from the video 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.360
 irrigation 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.020
 while runtime determines the 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:59.090
 duration the value can go from 1 to 100 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.650
 99 minutes with the item miss cycle yes 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.740
 determines if the watering session 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.720
 is continuous zero value or 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.450
 fragmented by as many breaks as the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.310
 set number with cycle times set 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.310
 the frequency of irrigation that can 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.110
 be repeated throughout the day 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.990
 setting values ​​from one to 12 hours 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.210
 or from one to seven days choosing 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.330
 one day for example is done one 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.430
 the only step in the newsroom daily 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.110
 next allows you to indicate the days 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.840
 of the week in which you want 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.760
 irrigate by pressing the keys bec si 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.100
 turns on or off the icon of a 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.010
 drop by the side of the day with key 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.510
 you save the setting with this one 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.370
 programming has ended 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.440
 the display flashes twice and the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.210
 system starts working though 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.370
 irrigation in progress on the display 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.680
 flashes at runtime and at the same time 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.680
 the remaining time is displayed
