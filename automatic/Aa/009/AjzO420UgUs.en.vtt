well the biggest obstacle is I'd say

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.370 
well the biggest obstacle is I'd say
believing<00:03:41.060> your<00:03:41.180> own<00:03:41.270> hype<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.840> know<00:03:41.960> like

believing your own hype you know like

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.840 
believing your own hype you know like
the<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:44.510> first<00:03:44.900> album<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.320> put<00:03:45.590> out<00:03:45.740> was<00:03:46.460> before

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
the the first album I put out was before

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.280 
the the first album I put out was before
I<00:03:46.880> did<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.240> one-man<00:03:47.510> band<00:03:47.570> or<00:03:48.050> really<00:03:48.260> even

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
I did the one-man band or really even

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.960 
I did the one-man band or really even
had<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> very<00:03:48.890> good<00:03:49.070> live<00:03:49.310> show<00:03:49.580> in<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.790> first

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
had a very good live show in the first

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.850 
had a very good live show in the first
place<00:03:50.150> but<00:03:50.270> I<00:03:50.330> love<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.780> album<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.320> it's<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
place but I love that album and it's the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.340 
place but I love that album and it's the
reason<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.340> developed<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:54.020> one-man<00:03:54.290> band

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
reason that I developed the one-man band

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.950 
reason that I developed the one-man band
was<00:03:54.710> to<00:03:54.830> get<00:03:54.980> these<00:03:55.070> songs<00:03:55.340> across<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:56.090> I<00:03:56.480> feel

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
was to get these songs across so I feel

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.870 
was to get these songs across so I feel
like<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.350> biggest<00:03:57.710> mistake<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.280> could<00:03:58.340> make<00:03:58.640> is

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
like the biggest mistake I could make is

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.330 
like the biggest mistake I could make is
not<00:03:59.180> making<00:03:59.570> something<00:04:00.010> farther<00:04:01.010> ahead<00:04:01.130> of

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
not making something farther ahead of

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.680 
not making something farther ahead of
myself<00:04:01.700> right<00:04:01.850> now<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.240> the<00:04:02.330> next<00:04:02.480> thing<00:04:02.630> I'm

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
myself right now so the next thing I'm

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.820 
myself right now so the next thing I'm
trying<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.990> make<00:04:03.110> is<00:04:03.260> something<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.710> have

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
trying to make is something that I have

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.120 
trying to make is something that I have
no<00:04:03.980> idea<00:04:04.250> how<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.430> do<00:04:04.640> live<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.900> then<00:04:06.560> if<00:04:06.710> if
