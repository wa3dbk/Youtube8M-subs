 swami skeletor and this is already the forty fifth 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.470
 The anniversary edition was of the Russian city in 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.450
 minecraft 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.929
 Well today's edition I built 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.940
 Casey and residential complex in eco style 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.020
 Well, eco is such a style of type 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.650
 eco-friendly 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.390
 let's start watching before or 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 then it looks like this here 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.109
 it turned out 6 further all the same residential 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.640
 complex as you copy they are all the same 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.920
 but there is no time 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 look looks awesome so 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.200
 beautiful yes it turns out that's the main color 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.410
 this green is also white 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.690
 Well, in general, the stack is green and white 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.660
 now take the campus in your hands so be it 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.059
 much easier miracle that on the street they are all 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.000

 got to take and fly around them here they are 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.550
 In general, all are the same, even on the sides 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.250
 same here if you hurt these not they 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.109
 all the same well and let's of course 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.579
 look at the planning let's start with 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.250
 this building seems to me the most 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.930
 the best views and by the way also to or what 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.439
 next to the park there is even a way out 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.630
 special park here in this park la 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.310
 let's see the planning before it comes 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 inside we got here in the apartment 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.200
 studio they are very small well in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.270
 principle but cheap and i'm a son 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.820
 something that did not build a toilet and bathroom 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.770
 gives apologize what i know i will 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.540
 rob a comment difficult thing 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.400
 society I apologize in advance go in 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.159
 there are four of us on the floor here 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.219
 apartments will start 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.990
 and here and from us such plans open 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.329
 of course comes lockers can 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.399
 put your clothes here too us 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.560
 It has a built-in kitchen as well as talking 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.750
 same in the room this studio is completely here 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.030
 these creak fridge of course where 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.459
 we can sit and eat well here we are 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.069
 and of course on the first floor the views are not very 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.929
 but we will be better of them here in general of us 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.219
 there are two beds exactly two people 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.770
 these all studios 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.439
 there are little books deputies something 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.390
 read and of course there are such 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.179
 let's go up the tradition to 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.690
 top floor all apartments are the same 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.150
 if only as different kinds so you 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.910
 so let's fly to the top and climb 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.069
 19 floor here is only 20 although yes for sure 20 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.220
 floor to rise is already better exit 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.569
 there is no roof but I decided not to do 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.190
 okay let's see the view from the same 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.290
 flat 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.910
 vodka because we are all the same and when 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.799
 we sit we eat already that kefir and 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.769
 interesting are the reality we eat 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.049
 and watch the window well, and then basically 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.620
 also the most views of the city and here the most 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.480
 the best views are that we have a park and 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.989
 another high-rise well, still there is a nozzle too 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.030
 20 floors that ’s different views of the high-rise 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.630
 so we know that there is the highest skyscraper 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.669
 on of okay, well let's see 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.530
 views from the roof 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:53.389
 Here is just such a dream to get if 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.220
 I looked at the top and then I made a map 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.930
 readings 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.540
 these somehow so it all looks 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.700
 above well let's see 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.430
 the next update by the way is still here 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.920
 as you can see made new streets and 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.110
 Well, so to speak extended the zone 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.750
 construction, that is, there will be everything here too 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.910
 you build a city ​​after all 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.710
 somehow expand la let's 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.920
 let's see the case that is in this way 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.830
 Casey looks standard searches Isis 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.980
 white with red 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.070
 why did this plus began to give type 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.560
 patterns already entangled himself such us patterns 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.630
 turned out and of course the brush and so here 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.090
 glass mainly showcases such 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.280
 big us so we go in the case with us 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.709
 there is the same big room where there is 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.920
 many places to sit in principle 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.650

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.180
 standard someone director and 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.540
