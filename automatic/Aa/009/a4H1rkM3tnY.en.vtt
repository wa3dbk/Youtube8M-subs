 usual 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.379

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.140
 of the products that are becoming more and more 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.060
 cutting out an important space in the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.230
 market for technological products 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.080
 We then show you the unboxing of the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.029
 number ones dg a smartwatch clone del 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.289
 well-known samsung her2 galaxy 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.789
 of the Korean house 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.650
 I apologize for this horrible 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.449
 celotto but unfortunately this morning I am 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.580
 cut and continue unboxing immediately 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.870
 going to discover together what the 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.420
 standard equipment 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.640
 then we go to open the box for 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.830
 see that it contains a manual 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.450
 of instructions both in Chinese and in 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.580
 English which can therefore be useful 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.380
 we, too, Italian users , ours 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.960
 smartwatch we're going to see between 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.180
 very little the classic cable of 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.490
 micro usb connection for connection 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.670
 to the computer and charging the watch 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.230
 it is also a small connector that must 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.420
 be recessed in the back 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.269
 of the smartwatch to be able to do so 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.950
 connect the microusb cable as it is 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.140
 smartwatch i remember it doesn't have a real e 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.990
 own micro usb connection but needs 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.670
 of this connector we take then the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.470
 our smartwatch and we immediately notice a 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.690
 pleasant design as clearly 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.720
 copied that of a much more device 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.340
 expensive than this number one g2 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.440
 characterized by a metal case 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.510
 pleasant to look at and also a lot 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.430
 Solid to the touch is a rubber strap 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.380
 adjustable according to the plath 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.970
 of the width of your wrist will suffice 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.820
 indeed move this tab into the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.470
 wished hole I would say to go to it 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.090
 turn on and effects happens with the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.180
 main features of this 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.960
 smartwatch we find a glass display 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.110
 1.54-inch sapphire very durable 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.250
 to scratches with 240 x 240 resolution 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.479
 pixel 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.049
 immediately notice that it is a display 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.220
 backlit lcd not a e ink like 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.729
 what we find for example on a 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.060
 pub all 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.690
 and this will have a big impact on autonomy 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.159
 mediatek processor 25 02 m to a type 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.479
 of specially designed processors 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.830
 for this type of bluetooth products 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.990
 4.0 low consumption and 350 mm battery 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.010
 the manufacturer declares five days of 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.320
 autonomy in stand by 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.570
 it is a single day with intensive use with 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.830
 perennially lit display being 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.600
 this is a must unboxing 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.160
 simply an overview of those 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.290
 which are the features offered by 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.880
 this smartwatch we see immediately that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.500
 this screen can be changed e 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.870
 custom indeed holding 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.180
 crushed access to alternatives like 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.220
 for example this one that looks more like a 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.470
 classic wrist watch you see is 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.880
 very pretty though now back to 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.830
 the main one that comes to me the most 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.050
 comfortable from here for example we can 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.560
 access settings like those 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.600
 bluetooth 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.820
 I remind you that this smartwatch must 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.890
 be absolutely associated away 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.200
 bluetooth to a smartphone to be able to 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.120
 take advantage of all the features like 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.410
 call reception and notification e 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.600
 messages the different settings like the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.280
 I play for the nights to personalize the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.550
 Notify the volume la 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 display backlight and time 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.410
 out of the screen you see that I move 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.120
 always through her as they are 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.920
 absent the hardware keys 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.459
 apart from that which only serves to 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.500
 turn the display on and off 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.080
 then he quickly showed me some TV 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.930

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.690

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.730
 notifications and convenient for example this 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.590
 smartwatch because if you have it 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.269
