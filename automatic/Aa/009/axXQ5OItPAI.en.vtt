in<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> sky<00:02:07.230> we<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.710> saw<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.160> couldn't<00:02:09.119> be

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
in the sky we all saw it couldn't be

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.560 
in the sky we all saw it couldn't be
explained<00:02:09.720> by<00:02:09.869> anything<00:02:10.470> else<00:02:10.680> of<00:02:11.570> anything

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
sudden took off like a shot and we were

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.230 
sudden took off like a shot and we were
able<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.070> run<00:02:20.370> through<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> front<00:02:20.910> door<00:02:21.120> of

time to see it whizzing off that left a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.620 
time to see it whizzing off that left a
really<00:02:31.110> deep<00:02:31.680> imprint<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.580> my<00:02:32.880> mind<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.540> my

early 20s the rest of the UFOs I've seen

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.610 
early 20s the rest of the UFOs I've seen
have<00:02:53.940> been<00:02:53.970> very<00:02:54.450> far<00:02:54.780> away<00:02:54.930> never<00:02:55.320> anything

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
have been very far away never anything

have been very far away never anything
real<00:02:55.950> close<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.459> those<00:02:56.760> two<00:02:57.140> looking<00:02:58.140> like<00:02:58.380> a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
real close like those two looking like a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.360 
real close like those two looking like a
star<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.340> the<00:03:00.240> one<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.990> saw<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.560> my<00:03:01.680> 20s

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
star and the one that I saw in my 20s

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.160 
star and the one that I saw in my 20s
I'm<00:03:02.550> taking<00:03:02.910> astronomy<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.630> we<00:03:03.720> had<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.050> you

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
I'm taking astronomy and we had to you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.020 
I'm taking astronomy and we had to you
know<00:03:04.320> go<00:03:04.470> out<00:03:04.500> at<00:03:04.800> night<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.250> look<00:03:05.550> for

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
know go out at night and look for

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.240 
know go out at night and look for
constellations<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.110> planets<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.950> different

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
constellations and planets and different

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.980 
constellations and planets and different
things<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.700> while<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.630> doing<00:03:09.810> that

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
things and while I was doing that

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.990 
things and while I was doing that
learning<00:03:10.530> about<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.920> ecliptic<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.459> all<00:03:11.760> this

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
learning about the ecliptic and all this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.250 
learning about the ecliptic and all this
I<00:03:12.440> saw<00:03:13.440> one<00:03:13.860> thing<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.459> moved<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:15.060> across

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
I saw one thing just moved in across

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.590 
I saw one thing just moved in across
moving<00:03:16.260> across<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:18.030> couldn't<00:03:18.450> have<00:03:18.570> been

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
moving across and it couldn't have been

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.660 
moving across and it couldn't have been
a<00:03:18.720> satellite<00:03:19.470> because<00:03:19.800> I<00:03:19.830> explained<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.519> my

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
a satellite because I explained it to my

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.759 
a satellite because I explained it to my
professor<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.450> next<00:03:21.720> day<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:21.900> he<00:03:22.140> explained

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
professor the next day and he explained

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.250 
professor the next day and he explained
away<00:03:22.920> why<00:03:23.280> should<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.790> didn't<00:03:24.060> satellite<00:03:24.570> then

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
away why should I didn't satellite then

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.890 
away why should I didn't satellite then
again<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.280> saw<00:03:26.700> another<00:03:27.180> one<00:03:27.269> when<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.810> was

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
again I saw another one when I was

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.320 
again I saw another one when I was
staying<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.560> at<00:03:28.680> my<00:03:28.800> in-laws<00:03:28.980> where<00:03:29.519> we<00:03:29.850> have<00:03:30.300> a

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
staying up at my in-laws where we have a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.479 
staying up at my in-laws where we have a
very<00:03:30.540> clear<00:03:31.019> night<00:03:31.320> sky<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.070> saw<00:03:32.280> one<00:03:32.459> that

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
very clear night sky and I saw one that

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.460 
very clear night sky and I saw one that
was<00:03:32.610> moving<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.239> satellite<00:03:33.780> nice<00:03:34.170> and

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
was moving like a satellite nice and

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.880 
was moving like a satellite nice and
slow<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.580> sped<00:03:36.420> up<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.900> then<00:03:37.709> it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
slow and then it sped up and then it

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.430 
slow and then it sped up and then it
slowed<00:03:38.550> down<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.930> kind<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.260> just

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
slowed down and then it kind of just

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.650 
slowed down and then it kind of just
