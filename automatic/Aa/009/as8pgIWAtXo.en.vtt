to<00:00:52.720> be<00:00:52.809> pretty<00:00:53.140> accurate<00:00:53.440> while<00:00:54.370> we're<00:00:54.579> there

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
to be pretty accurate while we're there

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.759 
to be pretty accurate while we're there
we<00:00:54.760> must<00:00:55.150> well<00:00:55.299> compare<00:00:55.809> this<00:00:55.989> graphics<00:00:56.530> card

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
we must well compare this graphics card

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.679 
we must well compare this graphics card
to<00:00:56.890> some<00:00:57.070> of<00:00:57.189> the<00:00:57.280> competition<00:00:57.790> or<00:00:58.390> some<00:00:58.659> of

00:00:58.679 --> 00:00:58.689 
to some of the competition or some of

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:00.530 
to some of the competition or some of
the<00:00:58.839> other<00:00:58.960> cards<00:00:59.350> out<00:00:59.439> there<00:00:59.500> so<00:01:00.040> we<00:01:00.159> get<00:01:00.339> a

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
the other cards out there so we get a

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.270 
the other cards out there so we get a
comfort<00:01:01.540> feeling<00:01:01.720> for<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.260> audio<00:01:02.739> levels<00:01:03.129> off

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
comfort feeling for the audio levels off

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.550 
comfort feeling for the audio levels off
this<00:01:03.580> card<00:01:03.879> so<00:01:04.330> let's<00:01:04.510> load<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:04.900> card<00:01:05.199> up<00:01:05.379> and

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
this card so let's load this card up and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:28.620 
this card so let's load this card up and
see<00:01:06.040> exactly<00:01:06.130> how<00:01:06.850> loud<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.630> is

okay<00:01:29.350> this<00:01:29.530> is<00:01:29.710> test<00:01:30.070> one<00:01:30.340> we're<00:01:30.700> going<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.909> be

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
okay this is test one we're going to be

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.760 
okay this is test one we're going to be
checking<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.539> some<00:01:31.810> levels<00:01:32.229> going<00:01:32.500> off<00:01:32.619> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
checking the some levels going off the

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
okay and now we have the gtx 590 loaded

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.470 
okay and now we have the gtx 590 loaded
up<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.930> let's<00:03:36.349> take<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.799> fan<00:03:37.310> speed<00:03:37.519> all<00:03:38.420> the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
up so let's take the fan speed all the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.380 
up so let's take the fan speed all the
way<00:03:38.689> to<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.079> max<00:03:39.319> take<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.400> off<00:03:40.489> automatic<00:03:41.180> and

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
way to the max take it off automatic and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.899 
way to the max take it off automatic and
let's<00:03:42.049> see<00:03:42.290> exactly<00:03:42.739> what<00:03:43.099> this<00:03:43.250> card<00:03:43.549> sounds

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
let's see exactly what this card sounds

00:03:43.909 --> 00:04:33.939 
let's see exactly what this card sounds
like

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949
