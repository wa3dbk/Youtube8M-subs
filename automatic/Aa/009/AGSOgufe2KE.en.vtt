00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
you type in jailbreakme.com and way that
was<00:01:19.830> difficult<00:01:20.040> try<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:20.820> oh<00:01:21.090> yeah<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.840> then

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
was difficult try to go oh yeah and then

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.140 
was difficult try to go oh yeah and then
just<00:01:22.860> hit<00:01:22.979> install<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
ipad well you can do some cool things on

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.920 
ipad well you can do some cool things on
there<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> launch<00:01:43.950> apps<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:45.119> retina

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
there like you can launch apps in retina

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.160 
there like you can launch apps in retina
mode<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.000> iphone<00:01:48.720> 4<00:01:48.960> there's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
mode so like on the iphone 4 there's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.870 
mode so like on the iphone 4 there's
apps<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.619> higher<00:01:49.799> resolution<00:01:50.369> normally

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
apps that are higher resolution normally

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
apps that are higher resolution normally
on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> ipad<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.869> displays<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.710> lower

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
on the ipad it just displays the lower

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.749 
on the ipad it just displays the lower
resolution<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.909> stupid<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.579> hack

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
resolution which is stupid so this hack

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.609 
resolution which is stupid so this hack
enables<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.630> higher<00:01:57.780> resolution<00:01:58.350> mode<00:01:58.469> on

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
enables the higher resolution mode on

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.620 
enables the higher resolution mode on
the<00:01:58.710> ipad<00:01:58.950> 2<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.790> there's<00:02:00.299> tons<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.540> things

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
the ipad 2 and there's tons of things

the exploit used to jailbreak a device

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.640 
the exploit used to jailbreak a device
well<00:03:37.209> this<00:03:37.389> is<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:37.540> first<00:03:37.629> this<00:03:38.079> is<00:03:38.229> a<00:03:38.290> third

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
well this is the first this is a third

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.710 
well this is the first this is a third
time<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.370> iOS<00:03:40.150> from<00:03:40.750> for<00:03:40.959> iPhones<00:03:41.319> and<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:42.849> know

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
time on iOS from for iPhones and I know

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.770 
time on iOS from for iPhones and I know
the<00:03:44.019> PSP<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:45.220> PSP<00:03:45.609> it<00:03:45.790> happened<00:03:46.150> like<00:03:46.299> five<00:03:46.599> or

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
the PSP the PSP it happened like five or

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.159 
the PSP the PSP it happened like five or
six<00:03:46.959> times<00:03:47.079> with<00:03:47.889> the<00:03:48.040> TIFF<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:49.780> think<00:03:50.019> it's

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
six times with the TIFF and I think it's

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.909 
six times with the TIFF and I think it's
happened<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:51.280> couple<00:03:52.269> other<00:03:52.389> devices<00:03:52.919> it's

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
happened on a couple other devices it's

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.699 
happened on a couple other devices it's
pretty<00:03:54.389> it's<00:03:55.389> like<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.689> go-to<00:03:55.900> tool<00:03:56.290> for
