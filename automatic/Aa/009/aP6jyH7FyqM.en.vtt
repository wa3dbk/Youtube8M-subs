00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello to all we find ourselves for a 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.580
 little bonus video so to show 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.390
 how to stay with a shadow 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.849
 Constituent 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.660
 because it's true that sometimes but 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.969
 I forget 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.559
 so I 'm watched or now I 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.020
 make a short video for those who 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.580
 so look for times with some 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.359
 images we get a package order 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.600
 Constituent 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.369
 we double click so we get an orb 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.800
 in account resources 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 so he will allow to re stage his 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 character then where to go so 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.870
 simply go to the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.040
 position where I am currently at 3.1 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.129
 so the simplest is either 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 take the 5.7 zap and lifts are 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.820
 simply to have less than zero and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.969
 to go right and so we come to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.120
 xelor temple so have a standard go 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.329
 at the temple xelor so I'm here 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 arrive we went back to the xelor temple 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.280
 so here is it going to have to talk to amine 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.670
 so not buy sell and see him 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.460
 speak 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.799
 so we will get information on the orb 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.180
 magical 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.570
 then there are two powers the first 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.460
 power 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.360
 that's what will allow us to re 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.880
 stats and all to zero so here I will have 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.040
 all to zero and I will have the capital here the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.110
 second power that will allow to re 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.299
 stats and all at 101 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.549
 so that's for the people who have who 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 are not rejected for example so here if 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.380
 I do it for example all that is ok 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.320
 stay there and I'll have 101 wisdom without 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.350
 invited and all the rest in capital so 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.729
 often when one is fit 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.439
 I am still expected because 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.979
 rich enough to cram all my 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.170
 characters 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.790
 so we learn more so the first 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.630
 power makes it possible to completely forget the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.579
 characteristics 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.079
 so what I said are identical to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.850
 the ones you had when you arrived 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.799
 and so when you were at level 1 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.710
 so there attention can decide 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.659
 to use power so there is 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.490
 always a second posting thing 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.450
 that validates does not fight for not 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.540
 we are wrong 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.810
 are you sure you want to continue 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.000
 so weeds and so here and there I lost 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.399
 so a restorative orb that were 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.079
 here my i had two comedians a 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.700
 and so if I go to see my 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.840
 characteristics so I'm going fast 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:21.750
 take off the three stuff I have on me 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.760
 tak tak and vitality 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.079
 so here I really have everything that is 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:34.109
 returned to capital so why did I 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:36.549
 a true vitality is weird 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.540
 I had a peasant once so I see 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.459
 there I have all the stats 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.370
 so if I would have made the second power 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.019
 I remained invited to end wisdom and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.930
 so after you are quiet so 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.299
 come talk to amine retake power 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.370
 number one to reset everything and 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.409
 so I'm a sacrieur I'm going 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.909
 restore everything in vitality and so here 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.489
 I well what seemed to me that the 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.500
 family a little that I missed a little bit of 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.480
 2.1 vitality that I had put a wisdom 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.159
 so here's this little tutorial so 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.159
 how to use a constituent shadow
