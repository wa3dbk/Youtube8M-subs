00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:21.360 

this<00:06:15.910> spin<00:06:16.180> oh<00:06:16.389> it<00:06:16.629> does<00:06:16.870> look<00:06:16.900> at<00:06:17.500> that<00:06:20.370> no

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
this spin oh it does look at that no

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.830 
this spin oh it does look at that no
it's<00:06:21.550> not<00:06:21.669> a<00:06:21.729> button<00:06:22.050> your<00:06:23.050> bass<00:06:23.470> volume

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
it's not a button your bass volume

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.460 
it's not a button your bass volume
pretty<00:06:25.840> cool<00:06:26.110> axillary<00:06:26.590> in<00:06:26.800> your<00:06:27.310> headphone

mute that's off that's on and I guess
this<00:06:33.129> is<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.280> way<00:06:33.370> you<00:06:33.430> control<00:06:33.879> I<00:06:34.060> guess<00:06:34.300> the

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
this is the way you control I guess the

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:40.020 
this is the way you control I guess the
overall<00:06:35.190> volume<00:06:36.190> might<00:06:37.120> think<00:06:38.340> yeah<00:06:39.370> I'm<00:06:39.789> just

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
overall volume might think yeah I'm just

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:47.219 
overall volume might think yeah I'm just
connects<00:06:40.330> to<00:06:40.509> the<00:06:41.379> sub<00:06:42.960> like<00:06:43.960> so<00:06:45.960> let's<00:06:46.960> see

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:47.229 
connects to the sub like so let's see

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.439 
connects to the sub like so let's see
look<00:06:47.650> at<00:06:47.740> the<00:06:47.830> back<00:06:48.069> just<00:06:49.590> like<00:06:50.590> that

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
look at the back just like that

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:55.409 
look at the back just like that
that's<00:06:52.449> the<00:06:52.720> way<00:06:52.840> you<00:06:52.900> connected<00:06:54.270> it's<00:06:55.270> got<00:06:55.389> a

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
that's the way you connected it's got a

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:55.920 
that's the way you connected it's got a
part

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
part

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.390 
part
I<00:06:55.960> guess<00:06:56.199> you<00:06:56.349> sit<00:06:56.530> this<00:06:56.650> on<00:06:56.800> your<00:06:56.919> desk<00:06:57.130> and
