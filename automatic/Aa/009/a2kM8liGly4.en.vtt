00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
furthermore to even money it looks like

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.870 
furthermore to even money it looks like
they're<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.069> oh<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> know<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> first

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
they're like oh you know the first

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.580 
they're like oh you know the first
thousand<00:02:09.479> people<00:02:09.750> money<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.200> almost<00:02:10.350> would<00:02:10.500> be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
thousand people money it almost would be

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
thousand people money it almost would be
one<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.830> top<00:02:11.009> thousand<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.150> when<00:02:12.240> you

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
one of the top thousand but when you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.030 
one of the top thousand but when you
really<00:02:12.510> look<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.020> from<00:02:13.110> an<00:02:13.230> odd<00:02:13.380> standpoint

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
really look at it from an odd standpoint

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.580 
really look at it from an odd standpoint
you<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.700> top<00:02:14.880> ten<00:02:15.120> percent

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
you have to be in the top ten percent

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.050 
you have to be in the top ten percent
whereas<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.980> play<00:02:17.160> head<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.400> head<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> mean

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
whereas if you play head to head I mean

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.790 
whereas if you play head to head I mean
you<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.600> one<00:02:18.780> person<00:02:19.110> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
you just have to be one person and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.809 
you just have to be one person and
that's<00:02:19.980> it

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
that's it

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.640 
that's it
obviously<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.750> payouts<00:02:22.110> not<00:02:22.290> gonna<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.560> as

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
obviously the payouts not gonna be as

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.650 
obviously the payouts not gonna be as
big<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.430> your<00:02:23.790> success<00:02:24.000> rates<00:02:24.390> going<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.630> go

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
big but your success rates going to go

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.780 
big but your success rates going to go
up<00:02:24.750> big-time<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.920> say<00:02:26.370> ditch<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
up big-time so I say ditch the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.130 
up big-time so I say ditch the
tournaments<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.300> know<00:02:27.360> that's<00:02:27.569> their<00:02:27.750> big<00:02:27.930> pole

forty<00:03:18.180> dollars<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> played<00:03:18.810> 14

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
forty dollars and so I played 14

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.340 
forty dollars and so I played 14
head-to-head<00:03:20.730> $10<00:03:21.060> matches<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.630> won<00:03:21.840> 13<00:03:22.320> of

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
head-to-head $10 matches and I won 13 of

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.020 
head-to-head $10 matches and I won 13 of
the<00:03:22.530> 14<00:03:22.950> which<00:03:23.280> was<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> really<00:03:23.610> good<00:03:23.820> week<00:03:24.000> for

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the 14 which was a really good week for

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.310 
the 14 which was a really good week for
me<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:27.269> thing<00:03:27.480> about<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.049> is<00:03:28.290> that

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
me but the thing about it is is that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.870 
me but the thing about it is is that
you're<00:03:28.860> gonna<00:03:29.040> win<00:03:29.220> something<00:03:29.549> gonna<00:03:29.640> lose

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
you're gonna win something gonna lose

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.010 
you're gonna win something gonna lose
some<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.329> when<00:03:30.510> you

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
some and when you

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.990 
some and when you
go<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.380> take<00:03:31.860> your<00:03:32.070> bankroll<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.760> split

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
go to take your bankroll and you split

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.270 
go to take your bankroll and you split
it<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.180> half<00:03:33.240> if<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.810> lose<00:03:34.140> one<00:03:34.710> match<00:03:34.980> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
it in half if you lose one match the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.170 
it in half if you lose one match the
Indy<00:03:35.490> guy<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.670> happen<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.150> playing

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
Indy guy you happen to be playing

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.500 
Indy guy you happen to be playing
against<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.690> really<00:03:36.930> excellent<00:03:37.740> lineup

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
against this really excellent lineup

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.820 
against this really excellent lineup
then<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.810> lose<00:03:39.930> half<00:03:40.080> your<00:03:40.140> bankroll<00:03:40.590> where

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
then you lose half your bankroll where

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.230 
then you lose half your bankroll where
as<00:03:40.920> opposed<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.700> have<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.090> better

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
as opposed to this you have a better

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.110 
as opposed to this you have a better
chance<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.990> coming<00:03:43.440> out<00:03:43.560> ahead<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:44.820> that's<00:03:44.970> my

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
chance of coming out ahead so that's my

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.240 
chance of coming out ahead so that's my
second<00:03:45.480> thing<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:46.290> third<00:03:46.410> thing<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.680> think<00:03:46.710> you

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
second thing the third thing I think you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.580 
second thing the third thing I think you
got<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.490> do<00:03:47.580> is<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.760> got<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.940> do<00:03:48.030> your<00:03:48.150> research

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
got to do is you got to do your research

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.830 
got to do is you got to do your research
when<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.680> play<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> lot<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:51.420> play<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.630> lot<00:03:51.810> of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
when you play a lot of you play a lot of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.180 
when you play a lot of you play a lot of
this<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.110> see<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.320> lot<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.590> people<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:53.010> come

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
this you see a lot of people that come

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.910 
this you see a lot of people that come
up<00:03:53.340> with<00:03:53.490> some<00:03:53.700> lineups<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.870> say<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.500> can

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
up with some lineups and you say I can

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.620 
up with some lineups and you say I can
tell<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.550> you<00:03:56.790> hadn't<00:03:57.120> went<00:03:57.180> with<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.390> gut

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
tell that you hadn't went with a gut

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.240 
tell that you hadn't went with a gut
feeling<00:03:57.870> thing<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.200> didn't<00:03:58.410> really<00:03:58.920> look<00:03:59.100> at

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
feeling thing you didn't really look at

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.680 
feeling thing you didn't really look at
the<00:03:59.340> research<00:03:59.640> because<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.150> salary<00:04:00.510> cap

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
the research because in salary cap

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.420 
the research because in salary cap
football<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.500> can't<00:04:01.740> have<00:04:01.920> all<00:04:02.040> studs<00:04:02.310> in

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
football you can't have all studs in

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.550 
football you can't have all studs in
your<00:04:02.580> team<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.540> have<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.810> couple<00:04:04.080> one<00:04:04.470> or

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
your team you can have a couple one or

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.050 
your team you can have a couple one or
two<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:05.310> I'll<00:04:05.400> get<00:04:05.550> into<00:04:05.700> roster

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
two and I'll get into roster

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.520 
two and I'll get into roster
construction<00:04:06.570> in<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.750> second<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.200> kind<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.410> why

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
construction in a second and kind of why

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.890 
construction in a second and kind of why
or<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.130> think<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.430> should<00:04:08.580> go<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.570> really

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
or I think you should go but you really

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.410 
or I think you should go but you really
got<00:04:10.020> to<00:04:10.050> do<00:04:10.170> your<00:04:10.320> research<00:04:10.850> it<00:04:11.850> really

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
got to do your research it really

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.760 
got to do your research it really
doesn't<00:04:12.660> take<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.810> much<00:04:12.990> time<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.440> honestly

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
doesn't take that much time and honestly

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.050 
doesn't take that much time and honestly
that's<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.070> most<00:04:14.190> fun<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:14.880> actually

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
that's the most fun I have is actually

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.210 
that's the most fun I have is actually
sitting<00:04:15.420> there<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.630> probably<00:04:16.200> spend<00:04:16.530> maybe<00:04:16.739> a

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
sitting there I probably spend maybe a

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.920 
sitting there I probably spend maybe a
half<00:04:17.640> hour<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:17.850> week<00:04:17.940> at<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.390> most

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
half hour a week at the most

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.800 
half hour a week at the most
doing<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.770> research<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:21.060> listen<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.720> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
doing the research I listen to the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.750 
doing the research I listen to the
analysts<00:04:22.200> on<00:04:22.290> ESPN<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.160> those<00:04:23.310> other<00:04:23.550> sites

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
analysts on ESPN and those other sites

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.400 
analysts on ESPN and those other sites
like<00:04:23.910> that<00:04:24.030> CBS<00:04:24.660> those<00:04:24.900> kinds<00:04:25.140> of<00:04:25.230> sites

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
like that CBS those kinds of sites

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.860 
like that CBS those kinds of sites
however<00:04:25.940> doing<00:04:26.940> your<00:04:27.060> own<00:04:27.150> research<00:04:27.180> really

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
however doing your own research really

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.600 
however doing your own research really
helps<00:04:28.770> if<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.220> makes<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.460> feel<00:04:29.550> more

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
helps if it makes you feel more

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.810 
helps if it makes you feel more
confident<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.270> kind<00:04:30.480> of<00:04:30.540> your<00:04:30.630> choices<00:04:31.820> you

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
confident and kind of your choices you

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.040 
confident and kind of your choices you
kind<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.150> want<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.330> look<00:04:33.480> when<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.930> do

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
kind of want to look when you do

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.380 
kind of want to look when you do
research<00:04:34.440> not<00:04:35.010> just<00:04:35.040> how<00:04:35.820> well<00:04:36.030> certain

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
research not just how well certain

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.910 
research not just how well certain
players<00:04:36.690> have<00:04:36.930> been<00:04:37.020> doing<00:04:37.290> but<00:04:37.500> obviously

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
players have been doing but obviously

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.280 
players have been doing but obviously
their<00:04:38.190> matchups<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.660> lot<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.020> comes

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
their matchups and a lot of that comes

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.660 
their matchups and a lot of that comes
from<00:04:40.380> when<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:41.010> I<00:04:41.100> said<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:41.340> can't<00:04:41.490> have<00:04:41.580> all

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
from when like I said you can't have all

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.400 
from when like I said you can't have all
studs<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.360> there<00:04:42.690> are<00:04:42.720> certain<00:04:42.990> players

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
studs and so there are certain players

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.850 
studs and so there are certain players
like<00:04:44.190> last<00:04:44.400> week<00:04:44.550> for<00:04:44.670> example<00:04:45.620> bolo<00:04:46.620> power

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
like last week for example bolo power

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.880 
like last week for example bolo power
was<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.430> great<00:04:48.030> value<00:04:48.450> player<00:04:48.720> because<00:04:49.530> he<00:04:49.770> was

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:06.359 
the next thing before you go to do the

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:07.369 
the next thing before you go to do the
roster<00:05:06.659> construction<00:05:07.079> something<00:05:07.289> I've

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
roster construction something I've

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.629 
roster construction something I've
figured<00:05:07.589> out<00:05:07.739> the<00:05:07.799> hard<00:05:08.039> way<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.279> first<00:05:08.429> time

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
figured out the hard way the first time

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.129 
figured out the hard way the first time
is<00:05:08.819> you<00:05:09.269> got<00:05:09.479> a<00:05:09.509> look<00:05:09.749> at<00:05:09.779> their<00:05:09.929> scoring

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
is you got a look at their scoring

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.489 
is you got a look at their scoring
system<00:05:10.589> it's<00:05:11.459> important<00:05:12.179> to<00:05:12.299> note<00:05:12.539> that<00:05:12.899> it<00:05:13.289> is

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:13.499 
system it's important to note that it is

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:15.289 
system it's important to note that it is
it's<00:05:13.799> not<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.949> full<00:05:14.249> PPR<00:05:14.699> but<00:05:14.969> it's<00:05:15.059> a<00:05:15.119> half

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:15.299 
it's not a full PPR but it's a half

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:19.189 
it's not a full PPR but it's a half
point<00:05:15.569> PPR<00:05:15.839> and<00:05:16.279> what<00:05:17.279> I<00:05:17.549> have<00:05:18.359> found<00:05:18.749> when<00:05:19.169> I

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
point PPR and what I have found when I

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.289 
point PPR and what I have found when I
go<00:05:19.349> to<00:05:19.409> my<00:05:19.589> roster<00:05:19.949> construction<00:05:20.489> is<00:05:20.669> that<00:05:20.879> you

you really look at the whole thing and

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.329 
you really look at the whole thing and
you<00:05:30.749> gotta<00:05:31.019> put<00:05:31.499> two<00:05:31.739> of<00:05:31.829> them<00:05:31.979> got<00:05:32.129> to<00:05:32.249> be

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:32.339 
you gotta put two of them got to be

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.219

angiogram<00:05:35.779> because<00:05:36.779> those<00:05:37.289> guys<00:05:37.499> that<00:05:37.769> are

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
angiogram because those guys that are

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.409 
angiogram because those guys that are
consistent<00:05:38.429> thirds<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:38.789> that<00:05:38.849> positions

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
consistent thirds of that positions

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.619 
consistent thirds of that positions
score<00:05:40.129> higher<00:05:41.129> and<00:05:41.579> honestly<00:05:42.119> have<00:05:42.329> been<00:05:42.449> more

score higher and honestly have been more
consistent<00:05:42.989> this<00:05:43.379> year<00:05:43.879> so<00:05:44.899> well<00:05:45.899> I<00:05:45.929> think<00:05:46.919> you

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
consistent this year so well I think you

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.829 
consistent this year so well I think you

got a look at the scoring system look at

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.469 
got a look at the scoring system look at
where<00:05:48.989> the<00:05:49.079> points<00:05:49.379> come<00:05:49.559> from<00:05:50.449> place<00:05:51.449> a

where the points come from place a

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.139 
where the points come from place a
higher<00:05:51.839> value<00:05:51.869> in<00:05:52.589> the<00:05:53.099> wide<00:05:53.489> receivers<00:05:53.999> or
