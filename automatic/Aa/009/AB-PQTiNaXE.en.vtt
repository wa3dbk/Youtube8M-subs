for us you don't have stuff like kennel

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.840 
for us you don't have stuff like kennel
cough<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.650> all<00:01:48.740> out<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.100> India<00:01:49.400> so<00:01:49.550> much<00:01:49.700> as

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
cough and all out in India so much as

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.240 
cough and all out in India so much as
you<00:01:49.940> do<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.300> broad<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:51.470> we<00:01:51.950> don't<00:01:52.100> really

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
you do have a broad so we don't really

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.770 
you do have a broad so we don't really
in<00:01:52.460> system<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:52.970> but<00:01:53.150> we<00:01:53.270> actually<00:01:53.360> need<00:01:53.750> a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
in system that but we actually need a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.390 
in system that but we actually need a
full<00:01:54.020> vaccination<00:01:54.650> well<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:54.920> think<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.370> just

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
full vaccination well I think that just

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.820 
full vaccination well I think that just
that's<00:01:55.820> because<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.360> whole<00:01:56.840> lot<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.590> lot

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
that's because of the whole lot in a lot

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.440 
that's because of the whole lot in a lot
of<00:01:58.040> canons<00:01:58.550> they<00:01:58.670> used<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.000> have<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> lot<00:01:59.390> of

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
of canons they used to have a lot of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.080 
of canons they used to have a lot of
indoor<00:02:00.020> clothes<00:02:00.470> kennel<00:02:00.950> searcher<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.910> just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
indoor clothes kennel searcher it just

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:24.920 
indoor clothes kennel searcher it just
