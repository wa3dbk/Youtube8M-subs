00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
size specifically ran out here you have

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.560 
size specifically ran out here you have
them<00:00:53.809> super<00:00:54.809> nice<00:00:55.760> this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.030> hybrid<00:00:57.329> between

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
them super nice this is a hybrid between

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.520 
them super nice this is a hybrid between
the<00:00:57.960> Jordan<00:00:58.770> Retro<00:00:59.190> 6<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> Jordan<00:01:00.530> Retro

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the Jordan Retro 6 and the Jordan Retro

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.189 
the Jordan Retro 6 and the Jordan Retro
17<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.489> then<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> add<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.030> 17<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> 6

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
17 so then when you add the 17 and the 6

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.000 
17 so then when you add the 17 and the 6
together<00:01:04.350> equals<00:01:04.920> 23<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> 23<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.860> in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
together equals 23 so a lot of 23 is in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.550 
together equals 23 so a lot of 23 is in
this<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.600> infrared<00:01:09.960> 23

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
