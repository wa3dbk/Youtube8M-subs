00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello good afternoon Friday 2 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.620
 02/05/2011 Friday May 2nd we go with 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.440
 this exemplar of glaucous pizza 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.560
 official the conical uca and let's make it 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.140
 what a little brush touches today we are going to 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.540
 make a little brush let's start with 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.160
 the upper part as always so that everything 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.220
 what is falling is falling by 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.669
 here and as I go manipulating I fall towards 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.669
 down it's worth 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.920
 well let's use two fingers for 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.180
 grab the branch and two fingers for 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.380
 stay with him with the circulate in the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.260
 hand with the tip of the bud with the tip 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.839
 of the needles of our pineapple 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.880
 perhaps the enemy cochineal uca 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.900
 cottony 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.900
 Red spider 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 the 2 good the spider easier to avoid 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:08.060
 but the spider or the cochineal is a 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.750
 little bit more you have to be on top 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.750
 good 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.080
 we are painting the one a little bit so that 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.080
 do not give us trees all this to see 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.790
 let's remove that 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.530
 let's avoid 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.500
 I'm not going to take anything away I will not leave 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.500
 which are two branches one on top of another that 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 do not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 because I do not want to remove wood 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.930
 I do not want to remove wood but 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.430
 well there we are, we continue with our 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.700
 pintadito 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.940
 more pasta cutting pasta sealer 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.680
 cicatrizante very well very well come out very 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.680
 above I'm just going to remove the zero 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.720
 we are going to click where we 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.930
 let's find 2 only the biggest 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.930
 OK 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.630
 when we meet two only the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.630
 mother 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.909
 well what I say spring is coming 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.340
 the summer these people need food 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:40.010
 all are all these buds all the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.010
 with movements they need food 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.360
 adif or good spring you know that 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.360
 it's simple 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.450
 it is worth remembering what he said that there is 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.850
 go increasing the risks and not 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.790
 you are accustomed or do not return as a rule 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.910
 habit 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.380
 leaving 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.380
 leaving puddle in 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.180
 the dish is used the dish is better 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.010
 do not use dishes but the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.459
 plate 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.970
 do not leave puddle because what is rotting 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.970
 they are the roots 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.470
 if the root rot 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.690
 it rots all the whole tree worth 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.910
 the Greek has to be abundant has 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.180
 what to be 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.880
 complete but can not be left can not 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.490
 there is very little water retention 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.920
 plants in nature that can stand 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.290
 be in places that have 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.670
 constantly the wet root which is 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.670
 very very little 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.750
 and the water in the substrate earth the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.510
 plant need the need 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.170
 that root is ventilated to be able to catch 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.170
 new water 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.830
 good man you know that these plants 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.240
 they always recommend these plants 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.710
 who live in little potted soil 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.920
 small always recommend us 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.590
 that are wet clear is that as the 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.140
 let it dry to the best in two 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.360
 four hours ends the plant is worth 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.510
 clear the mystery of irrigation there 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.850
 many times that he placed stones 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.980
 in the upper part of the substrate of such 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.320
 way that when I lift the stone I see 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.920
 what is in the substrate I see the humidity 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.350
 of the substrate is a way of 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.970
 It is a way of knowing if your plant is 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.410
 irrigated or not lift the stone and see what 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.010
 substrate is moist than the substrate 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.060
 is dry another trick is knowing that the 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.060
 plant is completely dry 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.159
 knowing that the plant is dry 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:01.039
 completely we are going to weigh our 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.300
 We will take the plant to the weight 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.400
 to catch the weight 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.009
 being dry we are going to fix it well 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.499
 water we are going to water well water 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.480
 you know that there are not leftovers but that 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:14.030
 there are faults 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.400
 and now we are going to weigh it again with 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.720
 all the water once drained with everything 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.790
 the water in the root ball with all the 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.490
 wet root ball we are going to weigh again 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.740
 the plant you will see that when it was dry 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.800
 when it is irrigated and a difference of 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.080
 weight that weight difference is water 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.300
 well then another trick to know if the 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.430
 plant is wet or not good I will 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.410
 continue making the pincelito 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.780
 and now when we go through the part 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.410
 come down from the plant or teach it come 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.410
 until next time 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.480
 well then we continue with our thoughts 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.910
 He said that we are removing the 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.790
 the little tips 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.460
 the outbreak down a little more 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.170
 restrained and what I am removing are 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.090
 the buds that come up when 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:04.090
 enter to cut in it 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.850
 in the tree in the green mass you enter with 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.380
 the scissors closed and once inside 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:12.000
 we open and we catch vale 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.940
 for not lead to marc 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.120
 nothing by the good way let's continue 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:23.240
 with our Think and I will remove from 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.240
 the back parts and I'll remove less 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.880
 in the front part so that the branch 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.810
 rusted promoting yourself here 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.810
 Think ito 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.740
 Well, it is already doing what I say 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.780
 warmth careful with the waters and what 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.470
 of insects to apply your 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.470
 insecticides 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.670
 It tells conical glauca is so not 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.680
 interesting to dry problem with 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.930
 the conifers is that almost all ask you 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.220
 the same they ask you to be wet but not 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.220
 do not go with the water 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.060
 in all the ways it's interesting to 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:08.520
 occasionally to dry the plant it 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.770
 Well, I think the brush has 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.210
 concluded now I already slowly as 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.430
 I will always see the little things 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.710
 I will see where it has not arrived and where 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.590
 I was passing 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.670
 well, this is all until next time 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.670
 be good
