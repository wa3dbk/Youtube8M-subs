00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.960 

this<00:00:01.319> video<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.860> going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.159> demonstrate<00:00:02.370> how

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
this video is going to demonstrate how

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.760 
this video is going to demonstrate how
to<00:00:03.000> measure<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.629> camshaft<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.620> two

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
to measure a camshaft the two

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.190 
to measure a camshaft the two
measurements<00:00:05.339> that<00:00:05.660> you<00:00:06.660> want<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.930> take<00:00:07.049> on<00:00:07.170> a

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
measurements that you want to take on a

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.900 
measurements that you want to take on a
camshaft<00:00:07.500> or<00:00:08.099> run<00:00:08.670> out<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.559> lobe<00:00:10.559> lift<00:00:10.910> will

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
camshaft or run out and lobe lift will

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.600 
camshaft or run out and lobe lift will
do<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.240> using<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:13.019> dial<00:00:13.469> indicator<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.250> then

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
do this using a dial indicator and then

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.460 
do this using a dial indicator and then
we'll<00:00:14.790> show<00:00:15.000> how<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:15.960> be<00:00:16.049> done<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.440> a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
we'll show how it can be done with a

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.870 
we'll show how it can be done with a
micrometer<00:00:17.279> also<00:00:18.350> so<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:20.010> begin<00:00:20.160> with<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.670> set

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
micrometer also so to begin with we set

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.029 
micrometer also so to begin with we set
up<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.180> dial<00:00:21.630> indicator<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.650> resting

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
up a dial indicator so that it's resting

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.340 
up a dial indicator so that it's resting
on<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.699> journal<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:25.109> part<00:00:25.230> of

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
on the the journal this is just part of

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
on the the journal this is just part of
a<00:00:25.439> camshaft<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.369> would<00:00:26.609> always<00:00:26.789> put<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
a camshaft but you would always put it

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.390 
a camshaft but you would always put it
on<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> center<00:00:28.080> journal<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> camshaft

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
on the center journal of the camshaft

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.250 
on the center journal of the camshaft
and<00:00:30.439> then<00:00:31.439> zero<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> dial<00:00:32.099> indicator<00:00:34.370> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
and then zero the dial indicator and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
and then zero the dial indicator and
then<00:00:37.260> carefully<00:00:38.190> rotate<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> camshaft<00:00:39.120> but

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
then carefully rotate the camshaft but

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.670 
then carefully rotate the camshaft but
be<00:00:39.420> careful<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.410> bump<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
be careful to do this not to bump the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.889 
be careful to do this not to bump the
table<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.910> bump<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> table<00:00:42.629> can

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
table you see the bump in the table can

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
table you see the bump in the table can
change<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.559> reading<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.059> make<00:00:45.210> sure

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
change your reading so we make sure

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.200 
change your reading so we make sure
we're<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.660> 0<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.350> rotate<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.920> camshaft

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.850 

the<00:00:54.210> Washington<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:55.140> far<00:00:55.469> our<00:00:55.620> moves

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the Washington see how far our moves

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.970 
the Washington see how far our moves
from<00:00:56.160> zero<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.800> bounce

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
from zero and all the little bounce

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.369 
from zero and all the little bounce
around<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.399> little<00:00:59.520> bit

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
around a little bit

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.350 
around a little bit
want<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> see<00:01:01.590> overall<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> does<00:01:05.360> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
want to see overall what what it does it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.690 
want to see overall what what it does it
looks<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> point<00:01:07.340> we're<00:01:08.340> two

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
looks like at that point we're two

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
looks like at that point we're two
thousandth<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.299> an<00:01:09.420> inch<00:01:09.540> away<00:01:09.750> from<00:01:09.930> our<00:01:10.560> zero

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
thousandth of an inch away from our zero

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.820 
thousandth of an inch away from our zero
so<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.600> roughly<00:01:13.020> two<00:01:13.229> thousandth<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> an

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
so we have roughly two thousandth of an

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.999 
so we have roughly two thousandth of an
inch<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.330> run-out<00:01:15.439> in<00:01:16.439> other<00:01:16.619> words<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
inch of run-out in other words the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.840 
inch of run-out in other words the
camshaft<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.640> bowed<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.390> little<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:19.850> now

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
camshaft is bowed just a little bit now

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.219 
camshaft is bowed just a little bit now
the<00:01:20.939> second<00:01:21.240> measurement<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.140> be

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the second measurement is going to be

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.539 
the second measurement is going to be
lobe<00:01:22.470> lift<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.280> done<00:01:23.430> really

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
lobe lift and this can be done really

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.490 
lobe lift and this can be done really
easily<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:27.409> if<00:01:28.409> you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
easily here at the same time if you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
easily here at the same time if you
swipe<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> dial<00:01:29.250> indicator<00:01:29.369> down<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:30.000> slide

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
swipe the dial indicator down or slide

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.999 
swipe the dial indicator down or slide
the<00:01:30.240> camshaft<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:30.930> until<00:01:31.350> we've<00:01:31.619> got<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the camshaft down until we've got the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:40.270 
the camshaft down until we've got the
dial<00:01:32.220> indicator<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.619> camshaft<00:01:34.619> lobe

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.859 

we<00:01:41.280> want<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> start<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> low<00:01:42.479> side<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
we want to start out on the low side of

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:52.490 
we want to start out on the low side of
the<00:01:42.930> lobe<00:01:49.939> zero<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> dial<00:01:51.299> indicator<00:01:51.500> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the lobe zero the dial indicator and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.330 
the lobe zero the dial indicator and
again<00:01:53.189> rotate<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> camshaft<00:01:55.009> we<00:01:56.009> find<00:01:56.250> out

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
again rotate the camshaft we find out

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550 
again rotate the camshaft we find out
how<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.820> lobe<00:01:57.030> lifts<00:01:57.630> off<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
how much the lobe lifts off that that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
how much the lobe lifts off that that
base<00:01:58.770> circle<00:02:00.259> one<00:02:01.259> full<00:02:01.500> revolution<00:02:02.330> two<00:02:03.330> full

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
base circle one full revolution two full

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.259 
base circle one full revolution two full
revolutions<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:09.649> forty<00:02:10.649> seven<00:02:11.239> so<00:02:12.239> that

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
revolutions and forty seven so that

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.699 
revolutions and forty seven so that
means<00:02:12.630> it's<00:02:12.930> point<00:02:13.319> two<00:02:13.830> four<00:02:14.340> seven<00:02:14.700> inches

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
means it's point two four seven inches

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.620 
means it's point two four seven inches
continue<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.799> turn<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.130> there<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.450> you'll<00:02:18.600> see

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
continue to turn it there and you'll see

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.820 
continue to turn it there and you'll see
that<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> rotates<00:02:19.380> back<00:02:19.650> zero<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.260> lobe

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
that it rotates back zero that the lobe

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.190 
that it rotates back zero that the lobe
lift<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.519> point<00:02:23.850> two<00:02:24.120> four<00:02:24.420> seven<00:02:24.630> inches<00:02:24.989> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
lift is point two four seven inches you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.850 
lift is point two four seven inches you
compare<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.799> specification<00:02:27.860> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
compare that to specification and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.860 
compare that to specification and
finally<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.819> do<00:02:29.940> lobe<00:02:30.120> lift<00:02:30.420> also<00:02:30.569> with<00:02:30.840> a

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
finally you can do lobe lift also with a

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.009 
finally you can do lobe lift also with a
with<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> micrometer<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.870> by

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
with a micrometer you do that by

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:44.350 
with a micrometer you do that by
measuring<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.500> base<00:02:34.650> circle<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.030> lobe

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.210 

take<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.540> measurement<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.409> compare<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.189> to

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
take that measurement and compare it to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.059 
take that measurement and compare it to
the<00:02:47.610> measurement<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.360> top<00:02:48.689> turn<00:02:49.530> turn<00:02:49.950> the

the measurement of the top turn turn the
lobe<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:51.860> measure<00:02:52.860> from<00:02:53.220> top<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.430> bottom<00:02:53.579> now

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.290 

and<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.520> difference<00:03:05.820> between<00:03:05.880> those<00:03:06.240> two

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
and the difference between those two

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.510 
and the difference between those two
measurements<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.380> took<00:03:07.590> will<00:03:08.340> end

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
measurements that you just took will end

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.370 
measurements that you just took will end
