00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.790 
they're just going for it yeah a little
harder<00:00:15.809> than<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.990> thought<00:00:16.020> they<00:00:16.410> would<00:00:16.440> have

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
harder than I thought they would have

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.920 
harder than I thought they would have
went<00:00:17.039> especially<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> lockdown<00:00:18.270> that's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
went especially with the lockdown that's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
went especially with the lockdown that's
not<00:00:19.170> gonna<00:00:19.320> work<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.740> much<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> caster<00:00:20.580> I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
not gonna work so much for a caster I

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
not gonna work so much for a caster I
get<00:00:20.939> some<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.180> safely<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.199> looks<00:00:22.380> like

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
get some out safely but it looks like

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.660 
get some out safely but it looks like
they<00:00:22.590> get<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:22.890> want<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.430> this

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
they get what they want out of this

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
twisted advance might have been able to

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.729 
twisted advance might have been able to
use<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> once<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.570> took<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> turret<00:00:37.350> aggro

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
use that once they took the turret aggro

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.590 
use that once they took the turret aggro
would<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.280> been<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> bit<00:00:38.579> more<00:00:38.730> efficient<00:00:39.149> hey

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
would have been a bit more efficient hey

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.200 
would have been a bit more efficient hey
that<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.530> pretty<00:00:41.010> clean<00:00:41.340> turret<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.879> what

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that was a pretty clean turret at what

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.569 
that was a pretty clean turret at what
he<00:00:42.300> made<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> map<00:00:43.110> control<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:44.430> they

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
he made with the map control that they

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
he made with the map control that they
kind<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.910> grabbed<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.300> these<00:00:45.420> forward<00:00:45.809> wards

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
kind of grabbed with these forward wards

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.150 
kind of grabbed with these forward wards
and<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.399> grab<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> first<00:00:47.879> dragon<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
and if we grab a first dragon to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
and if we grab a first dragon to
possibly<00:00:50.160> getting<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.850> six<00:00:51.180> getting<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
possibly getting that six getting the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
engage a lot quicker oh nice solar flare

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.970 
engage a lot quicker oh nice solar flare
he<00:00:54.719> didn't<00:00:54.960> even<00:00:55.020> think<00:00:55.170> he<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.590> gonna<00:00:55.680> hit<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
he didn't even think he was gonna hit it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.430 
he didn't even think he was gonna hit it
that<00:00:56.190> well<00:00:56.430> he<00:00:56.969> throws<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> Zenith<00:00:58.320> blade

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that well he throws out the Zenith blade

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
that well he throws out the Zenith blade
a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.890> too<00:00:59.010> far<00:00:59.309> ahead<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> allows

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
a little too far ahead and it allows

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
a little too far ahead and it allows
cloud<00:01:00.449> nine<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> retaliate<00:01:01.260> completing<00:01:01.980> the

rod of Ages speaks welp their ability to
push<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.920> far<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:06.320> that's<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.380> good

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
push that far and that's that's not good

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.500 
push that far and that's that's not good
for<00:01:08.130> dodo<00:01:08.570> boom<00:01:09.830> got<00:01:10.830> him<00:01:11.210> sneaky<00:01:12.210> there<00:01:12.390> with

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
for dodo boom got him sneaky there with

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.510 
for dodo boom got him sneaky there with
the<00:01:12.600> collateral<00:01:13.020> damage<00:01:13.439> wait<00:01:14.040> teammate<00:01:14.369> can

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the collateral damage wait teammate can

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.340 
the collateral damage wait teammate can
win

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.380 

teams<00:01:18.350> were<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:19.070> ever<00:01:19.250> calculate<00:01:19.850> this<00:01:20.060> after

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
teams were to ever calculate this after

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.300 
teams were to ever calculate this after
like<00:01:20.540> cloud<00:01:20.780> nine<00:01:21.020> would<00:01:21.260> know<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.800> decision

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
like cloud nine would know the decision

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.040 
like cloud nine would know the decision
looks<00:01:23.090> like<00:01:23.210> they<00:01:23.330> may<00:01:23.510> actually<00:01:23.660> want<00:01:23.930> it

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
looks like they may actually want it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.750 
looks like they may actually want it
after<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.620> fact<00:01:24.800> though<00:01:25.100> dodo<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.550> going<00:01:25.700> to

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
after the fact though dodo is going to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.340 
after the fact though dodo is going to
be<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.910> one<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.090> get<00:01:26.180> hit<00:01:26.360> there's<00:01:26.930> balls

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
be the one to get hit there's balls

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.710 
be the one to get hit there's balls
coming<00:01:27.770> in<00:01:27.890> at<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.190> teleport<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:28.970> he<00:01:29.480> makes

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
coming in at the teleport and he makes

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.540 
coming in at the teleport and he makes

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
well and cloud nine is looking pretty

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.810 
well and cloud nine is looking pretty
healthy<00:01:33.620> across<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.100> board<00:01:34.310> sneaky<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.760> the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
healthy across the board sneaky is the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.250 
healthy across the board sneaky is the
