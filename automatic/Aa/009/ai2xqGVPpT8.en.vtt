00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.819
 channel my name is margarita and in this 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.240
 wonderful day i wanted to congratulate 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.250
 all from the first of September 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.900
 ahahahaha when i learn what and topic 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
 This video as you already understood 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.580
 the name will be where to go to learn 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.680
 let's first understand the definition 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.380
 because oddly enough their many 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.240
 confused we start with school I think not 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.490
 worth telling you what school is 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.330
 what kind of education do you get for 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.030
 leaving it 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.860
 after the end of grade 9 you will get 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 basic general education after 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.550
 Grade 11 you will get the average 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 general education 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.190
 however, after grade 9, sometimes even after 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.469
 8 you can leave to get secondary special 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.320
 or secondary vocational education 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.390
 What is the difference I think that many 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.430
 schoolchildren frightened cock just 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.469
 after the end you would get 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.690
 secondary vocational education 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.280
 but oddly enough it is not the most 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.840
 bad option because there is and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.970
 see the average salary how much 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.439
 how many would know went to the electrician 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.619
 petrovich on also putty judging 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.430
 the wiring was forgotten by their student and vodka 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.049
 settings 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.270
 never forget well or would not go 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.250
 also after grade 9 you can go to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.070
 technical school or how fashionable it has become now 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.259
 I speak in my college no difference 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.060
 after the end of both of you 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.369
 get secondary special education 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.229
 I myself am in college and in what 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.970
 big enough plus of this academic 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.210
 places after that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.860
 you can go to the second or even to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.200
 third year university 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 so we got to what it is 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.360
 higher education institution is a higher education institution to it 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.840
 include academy universities and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.909
 Institutions like this and I think it will be clearer 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.090
 university education is different in profile 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.579
 studying at the academy is in one area 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.740
 The institute trains specialists only 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.840
 in one direction of course 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.460
 each person must decide 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.009
 but I would like to give you a couple 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.240
 tips based on my experience on my 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.040
 look the last thing for it 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.650
 stay in school especially if school 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.720
 Well, let 's say the most average because 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.190
 school makes people dumber 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.330
 here so tones often happens mary Ivanovna 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.730
 and your subject is also shit petenka I'm here 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.220
 of course you put the top three in two 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.400
 mind keep you promise that you will learn everything 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:43.780
 Hello Andrew Petrovich 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.310
 Automata will of course that until experience have the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.140
 there you can get enough 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.090
 popular profession as already 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.700
 it has been said before that is good enough 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.490
 wage you if you feel that 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.920
 higher education you do not particularly need 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.500
 love and work with your hands then you probably 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.600
 there however if you want something you 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.720
 absolutely nothing will interfere after vocational education 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.030
 do muse I even understand you 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.820
 that plumber is not yours 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.130
 you want to become well, let's say a lawyer about 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.960
 highly recommend going to the technical school 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.140
 and levkovich because studying there is very 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.480
 close to studying at a university very often 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.720
 the same teachers teach there 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.940
 and you will not be so say green 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.950
 freshmen who came and nothing 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.890
 don't know and maybe you can 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.330
 enter immediately for 2 3 course that will help 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.430
 save you 1 year 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:40.320
 would you rather hear my neighbors friend 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.790
 a friend is killed even then it will be quiet 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.680
 however if you decide to stay in school 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.290
 then I beg you not to be limited 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.990
 find only school 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.030
 have additional courses well, let's say 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.120
 at that university you want 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.580
 do very often tell you by 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.300
 secret when entering with the same 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.000
 points 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.130
 and g preference is given to that person 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.640
 who attended their extra course 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.290
 it's such a legal bribe I said well 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.990
 well i hope you like it 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.060
 video write me in the comments who you are 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.250
 want to be when you grow up or whom 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.250
 learn everything bye and see you soon
