comes<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.439> gig<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:32.309> gig<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.520> ram

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
comes with one gig of one gig of ram

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.299 
comes with one gig of one gig of ram
with<00:00:32.969> two<00:00:33.120> gigabyte<00:00:33.390> option<00:00:33.750> 8<00:00:33.989> 16<00:00:34.530> 32<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
with two gigabyte option 8 16 32 and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.840 
with two gigabyte option 8 16 32 and
it's<00:00:35.760> running<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.120> rockchip<00:00:36.440> rk3188<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
it's running a rockchip rk3188 so this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.770 
it's running a rockchip rk3188 so this
is<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.149> quad-core<00:00:40.140> cortex<00:00:40.890> a9<00:00:41.610> processor<00:00:41.850> so

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is a quad-core cortex a9 processor so

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.350 
is a quad-core cortex a9 processor so
it's<00:00:42.899> hurting<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.290> mali-400<00:00:44.280> GPU<00:00:44.360> which

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it's hurting the mali-400 GPU which

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.389 
it's hurting the mali-400 GPU which
isn't<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> newest<00:00:46.200> GPU<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> block<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
isn't the newest GPU on the block but I

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.569 
isn't the newest GPU on the block but I
mean<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.730> definitely<00:00:47.910> capable<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:49.579> playing

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
mean it's definitely capable of playing

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.549 
mean it's definitely capable of playing
all<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> latest<00:00:51.149> games<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.350> winning

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
all the latest games it's not winning

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.130 
all the latest games it's not winning
any<00:00:53.090> contests<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> frame<00:00:54.660> rates<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.020> these

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
any contests on the frame rates of these

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
any contests on the frame rates of these
games<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:56.190> you're<00:00:56.430> definitely<00:00:56.640> able<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> play

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
games but you're definitely able to play

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
4.2 point2 with a rockchip processor so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.020 
4.2 point2 with a rockchip processor so
one<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> things<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.920> i'll<00:01:20.640> take<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> walk

single speaker to be found here now if
we<00:01:40.229> put<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.560> down<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.630> actually<00:01:42.630> let's<00:01:43.110> look

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
we put this down and actually let's look

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
we put this down and actually let's look
over<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.700> they<00:01:44.700> put<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:44.970> down<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.299> then

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
over here they put this down and then

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870 
over here they put this down and then
just<00:01:45.509> peel<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.290> plastic<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.640> see

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
just peel back is plastic you can see

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.639 
just peel back is plastic you can see
that<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.899> great<00:01:49.049> quality

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
that this is a really great quality

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.889 
that this is a really great quality
Speaker<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> mean<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.820> had<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.299> ask<00:01:51.420> whether<00:01:51.689> or

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
not it was metal or plastic it's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.820 
not it was metal or plastic it's
actually<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.759> a
