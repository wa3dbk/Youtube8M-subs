00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.190
 I have been accompanying trainer for 15 years 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.820

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 Everything in Munich 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.330
 I was allowed a home two years ago 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.500
 years a coach of the first football 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.630
 accompanying the Bundesliga 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 neudeutsch coaching it is me one 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.940
 Accompaniment we have with each other 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.280
 can determine that the success is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.420
 By the way, I was hired 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.579
 for years but coach in football but 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.809
 the focus of my activity 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.289
 is in the amateur area 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.270
 because especially there, the coach has one 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.289
 even more diverse responsibility therefore 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.420
 contact person for many things in the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.829
 Of course there are several professionals 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.050
 contact person for the different ones 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.969
 urgent fields in the amateur area it is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.159
 mostly the trainer of many of these 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.850
 united tasks and while the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 Focus on sport first understandable 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.430
 The active sportsman sets up 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.210
 my focus is on the trainer in the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.840
 Amateur and professional busy 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.580
 me for several years with the topic 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.920
 Trainer as a leader in one 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.150
 Club from this whole combination 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.600
 I found out that coach 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.100
 Leaders are not just that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.560
 Leaders are from the people with 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.299
 all their strengths and weaknesses and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.970
 was exciting for me to do the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.110
 symbiosis that is a similarity 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.880
 There are between normal companies and 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.979
 sports clubs namely what happens when 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.310
 a good expert in sports becomes me 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.290
 say a great athlete someday 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.180
 Leadership becomes in a company 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.420
 Will you be director or 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.280
 Managing director in the sport that I have the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.979
 Coach and I think it does 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.020
 absolutely meaning focus in quotation marks 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.119
 not only on the active athletes too 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.090
 put 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.120
 but also quite consciously the carrier too 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.549
 accompany because they are at the top 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.870
 You have choices to make you 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.000
 have the decisions too 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.230
 bear 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 they take influence with theirs 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.970
 Decisions on victory or defeat 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.540
 and you have a high responsibility in the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.489
 Unite as the first and most important 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.489
 Contact persons are for the athletes
