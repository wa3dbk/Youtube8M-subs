00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
bubbles is actually pretty amazing the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.569 
bubbles is actually pretty amazing the
reason<00:01:43.290> why<00:01:43.409> i<00:01:43.439> got<00:01:43.649> these<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.100> i<00:01:44.280> did

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
reason why i got these is because i did

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.850 
reason why i got these is because i did
get<00:01:44.729> gelish<00:01:45.149> nails<00:01:45.450> maybe<00:01:45.960> about<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.649> last

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
get gelish nails maybe about like last

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.130 
get gelish nails maybe about like last
month<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.729> I've<00:01:48.509> had<00:01:48.659> him<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
month or so and I've had him on for a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.420 
month or so and I've had him on for a
couple<00:01:49.170> weeks<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.009> took<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.340> off

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
couple weeks and I think I took it off

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.310 
couple weeks and I think I took it off
wrong<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.200> my<00:01:52.290> first

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
wrong I think because it was my first

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
wrong I think because it was my first
time<00:01:52.619> ever<00:01:52.740> getting<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.430> gelish<00:01:53.909> nails<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
time ever getting like gelish nails so I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.359 
time ever getting like gelish nails so I
didn't<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.560> exactly<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> take

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
didn't really know exactly how to take

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
didn't really know exactly how to take
it<00:01:56.490> off<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.479> peeled<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> off

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
it off and I just you know peeled it off

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.020 
it off and I just you know peeled it off
and<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.130> ruined<00:01:59.670> my<00:01:59.790> nails

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and I think that really ruined my nails

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.310 
and I think that really ruined my nails
so<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> definitely<00:02:01.020> learned<00:02:01.200> my

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
so you know I definitely learned my

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.709 
so you know I definitely learned my
lesson<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.130> because<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.420> nails<00:02:03.630> were

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
lesson but because of that my nails were

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.020 
lesson but because of that my nails were
so<00:02:04.049> damaged<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.399> had<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.610> cut<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:05.909> nose

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
so damaged and so I had to cut my nose

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.850 
so damaged and so I had to cut my nose
really<00:02:06.360> short<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.990> irked<00:02:07.229> me<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:07.829> I

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
really short and just irked me because I

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.619 
really short and just irked me because I
never<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.459> had<00:02:08.580> my<00:02:08.729> nails<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.060> short<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
never really had my nails that short and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.660 
never really had my nails that short and
just<00:02:10.170> looked<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.800> funky<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.580> not

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
just looked really funky and not

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.830 
just looked really funky and not
feminine

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
feminine

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.390 
feminine
so<00:02:13.110> what<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.319> did<00:02:13.410> was<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.769> got<00:02:13.800> these<00:02:14.099> nails

and<00:02:54.480> I've<00:02:54.599> had<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:55.380> long<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:55.799> I

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
and I've had this for so long but I

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.229 
and I've had this for so long but I
never<00:02:56.040> actually<00:02:56.280> came<00:02:56.610> around<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.940> actually

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239

using<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.799> was<00:02:58.890> actually<00:02:59.040> quite

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
using it and I was actually quite

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.520 
using it and I was actually quite
hesitant<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.819> i<00:02:59.940> wasn't<00:03:00.209> really<00:03:00.470> kind<00:03:01.470> of

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
hesitant because i wasn't really kind of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.440 
hesitant because i wasn't really kind of
comfortable<00:03:02.010> or<00:03:02.340> familiar<00:03:02.370> with<00:03:03.180> wearing

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
comfortable or familiar with wearing

comfortable or familiar with wearing
white<00:03:03.629> eyeliner<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:04.319> not<00:03:04.440> something<00:03:04.829> that<00:03:04.860> i

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489
