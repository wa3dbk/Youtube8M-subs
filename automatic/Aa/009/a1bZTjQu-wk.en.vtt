on the skin I think it's actually quite

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.420 
on the skin I think it's actually quite
similar<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.650> Rimmel<00:02:43.950> stay<00:02:44.069> matte<00:02:44.189> powder

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:58.059 
saying it's a bad concealer um
but<00:03:51.479> something<00:03:51.989> like<00:03:52.229> the<00:03:53.159> mac<00:03:53.459> studio<00:03:53.849> finish

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.699 

that<00:03:59.069> comes<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.970> pot<00:04:00.180> like<00:04:00.359> this<00:04:00.709> they're

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
that comes in the pot like this they're

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.729 
that comes in the pot like this they're
similar<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.370> coverage<00:04:02.939> but<00:04:03.329> this<00:04:03.569> is<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.049> little

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
similar in coverage but this is a little

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.280 
similar in coverage but this is a little
bit<00:04:04.949> more<00:04:05.220> sticky<00:04:05.609> which<00:04:06.000> i<00:04:06.180> find<00:04:06.449> easier<00:04:07.019> to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
bit more sticky which i find easier to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.830 
bit more sticky which i find easier to
blend<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.799> work<00:04:07.979> with<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.970> one<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.569> a<00:04:09.599> little

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
blend and work with this one is a little

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.849 
blend and work with this one is a little
bit<00:04:10.139> drier<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:12.120> still<00:04:12.689> covers<00:04:13.169> just<00:04:13.439> as<00:04:13.680> well

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
bit drier it still covers just as well

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.559 
bit drier it still covers just as well
as<00:04:14.009> something<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.639> Mac<00:04:14.909> it<00:04:15.269> covers

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
as something like the Mac it covers

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.120 
as something like the Mac it covers
blemishes<00:04:15.689> really<00:04:16.229> well<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.590> doesn't<00:04:16.769> have<00:04:17.009> to

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
blemishes really well it doesn't have to

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.580 
blemishes really well it doesn't have to
cake<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.449> doesn't<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.109> mean

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
cake up on you and it doesn't I mean

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.199 
cake up on you and it doesn't I mean
it's<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.829> thick<00:04:20.039> concealer<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:20.729> it's<00:04:20.880> easily

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
it's a thick concealer but it's easily

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.140 
it's a thick concealer but it's easily
blended<00:04:21.599> into<00:04:21.719> your<00:04:21.930> foundation<00:04:22.789> so<00:04:23.789> all<00:04:24.000> in

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
blended into your foundation so all in

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.240 
blended into your foundation so all in
all<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.570> really<00:04:25.169> like<00:04:25.289> this

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
all I really like this

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.360 
all I really like this
I<00:04:26.870> think<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.990> products<00:04:28.410> contained<00:04:28.920> within<00:04:29.130> it

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
I think the products contained within it

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.090 
I think the products contained within it
are<00:04:29.490> great<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.180> particularly<00:04:31.080> like<00:04:31.710> the

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
are great I particularly like the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.400 
are great I particularly like the
corrector<00:04:32.820> I<00:04:32.970> think<00:04:33.240> that's<00:04:33.390> brilliant<00:04:33.660> the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
corrector I think that's brilliant the

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.680 
corrector I think that's brilliant the
concealer<00:04:34.890> is<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.130> very<00:04:35.400> good<00:04:35.640> sealer<00:04:36.030> if<00:04:36.270> a

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
concealer is a very good sealer if a

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.680 
concealer is a very good sealer if a
little<00:04:37.200> dry<00:04:37.470> for<00:04:37.500> my<00:04:37.980> taste<00:04:38.390> something<00:04:39.390> like

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
little dry for my taste something like

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.320 
little dry for my taste something like
the<00:04:39.840> mac<00:04:40.020> studio<00:04:40.320> finish<00:04:40.740> i<00:04:41.160> prefer<00:04:41.820> but<00:04:42.120> not

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
the mac studio finish i prefer but not

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.440 
the mac studio finish i prefer but not
by<00:04:42.510> much<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.370> powder<00:04:44.610> i<00:04:44.790> think<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.180> really

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
by much and the powder i think is really

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.000 
by much and the powder i think is really
great<00:04:45.570> just<00:04:45.840> for<00:04:46.020> something<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.500> has<00:04:46.710> you

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
great just for something that has you

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.370 
great just for something that has you
know<00:04:47.100> three<00:04:47.730> items<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.510> one<00:04:48.720> i<00:04:48.900> think<00:04:49.140> this<00:04:49.230> is

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
know three items in one i think this is

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.960 
know three items in one i think this is
brilliant<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.890> only<00:04:50.100> thing<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.400> will<00:04:50.670> say

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.910 
brilliant the only thing that I will say

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
expensive I'll list the price below

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.900 
expensive I'll list the price below

my head but this little pot although

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.000 
my head but this little pot although
it's<00:05:00.300> handy<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.960> have<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.200> powder<00:05:01.440> in<00:05:01.860> the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
it's handy to have the powder in the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.980 
it's handy to have the powder in the
bottom<00:05:03.020> it<00:05:04.020> makes<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.470> mess<00:05:04.680> which<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:06.060> my<00:05:06.750> only

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
kind of if it was the pressed powder

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.410 
kind of if it was the pressed powder
maybe<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.800> would<00:05:13.920> be<00:05:14.040> better<00:05:14.270> but<00:05:15.270> other

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
maybe that would be better but other
