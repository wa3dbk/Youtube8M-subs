coming off of that seven one went over
Slovakia<00:01:01.359> they<00:01:01.899> really<00:01:02.170> need<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.440> try<00:01:02.710> and

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
Slovakia they really need to try and

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.369 
Slovakia they really need to try and
build<00:01:03.039> off<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.309> that<00:01:03.550> momentum<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.300> and<00:01:05.080> there

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
build off of that momentum and and there

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.810 
build off of that momentum and and there
wasn't<00:01:05.620> a<00:01:05.770> lot<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.220> they're<00:01:06.340> going<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.640> need

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
wasn't a lot that they're going to need

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.610 
wasn't a lot that they're going to need
to<00:01:07.000> correct<00:01:07.360> just<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.870> know<00:01:07.960> continuing<00:01:08.530> to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
to correct just you know continuing to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.470 
to correct just you know continuing to
get<00:01:08.740> used<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.430> big<00:01:09.580> guys<00:01:09.760> using<00:01:10.120> it<00:01:10.360> to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
get used to the big guys using it to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.060 
get used to the big guys using it to
your<00:01:10.570> advantage<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:11.230> think<00:01:11.740> one<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
your advantage I think one of the

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.160 
your advantage I think one of the
similarities<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:12.729> they<00:01:13.030> may<00:01:13.180> find<00:01:13.509> against

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
similarities that they may find against

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.230 
similarities that they may find against
Russia<00:01:14.470> which<00:01:14.770> will<00:01:14.950> be<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.100> much<00:01:15.369> deeper<00:01:15.640> a

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
Russia which will be a much deeper a

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.510 
Russia which will be a much deeper a
more<00:01:16.869> dangerous<00:01:17.100> offensive<00:01:18.100> team<00:01:18.340> than

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
more dangerous offensive team than

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.819 
more dangerous offensive team than
Slovakia<00:01:19.090> was<00:01:19.270> what<00:01:19.899> they<00:01:20.020> may<00:01:20.170> find<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:20.649> that

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
Slovakia was what they may find is that

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.410 
Slovakia was what they may find is that
they'll<00:01:21.189> have<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.460> little<00:01:21.610> bit<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.210> same

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
they'll have a little bit of the same

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.469 
they'll have a little bit of the same
kind<00:01:22.720> of<00:01:22.810> space<00:01:23.079> defensively<00:01:23.770> or<00:01:24.700> when<00:01:25.240> Russia

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
kind of space defensively or when Russia

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.850 
kind of space defensively or when Russia
is<00:01:25.659> defending<00:01:26.110> them<00:01:26.290> they're<00:01:26.500> gonna<00:01:26.590> have<00:01:26.799> to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
is defending them they're gonna have to

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.200 
is defending them they're gonna have to
use<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.130> big<00:01:27.490> ice<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.820> their<00:01:27.939> advantage

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
use that big ice to their advantage

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.030 
use that big ice to their advantage
they're<00:01:28.840> gonna<00:01:28.960> have<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.290> also<00:01:29.439> really<00:01:29.829> be

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
they're gonna have to also really be

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.380 
they're gonna have to also really be
careful<00:01:30.219> with<00:01:30.430> their<00:01:30.610> puck<00:01:30.820> management

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
careful with their puck management

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.080 
careful with their puck management
Russia<00:01:31.750> is<00:01:31.960> very<00:01:32.170> opportunistic<00:01:32.890> they<00:01:33.759> pounce

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
Russia is very opportunistic they pounce

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.999 
Russia is very opportunistic they pounce
on<00:01:34.270> every<00:01:34.479> turnover<00:01:35.259> they<00:01:35.439> make<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.829> count

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
on every turnover they make it count
