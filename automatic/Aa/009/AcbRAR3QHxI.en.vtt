00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.719 

depending<00:04:59.680> on<00:04:59.770> how<00:04:59.919> much<00:05:00.039> foam<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.520> like

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
depending on how much foam you like

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.719 
depending on how much foam you like
again<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.750> can<00:05:01.900> bury<00:05:02.139> this<00:05:02.409> I<00:05:02.650> find<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.669> I

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
again you can bury this I find that I

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.550 
again you can bury this I find that I
like<00:05:03.759> a<00:05:03.940> good<00:05:04.150> amount<00:05:04.389> of<00:05:04.509> foam<00:05:04.690> now<00:05:05.259> we're

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
like a good amount of foam now we're

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.110 
like a good amount of foam now we're
just<00:05:05.650> going<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:05.979> add<00:05:06.129> this<00:05:06.639> and<00:05:06.849> we're<00:05:07.000> going

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
just going to add this and we're going

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.209 
just going to add this and we're going
to<00:05:07.240> actually<00:05:07.750> mark<00:05:08.080> our<00:05:08.259> milk<00:05:08.530> using<00:05:09.099> our

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
to actually mark our milk using our

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.850 
to actually mark our milk using our
espresso<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:09.849> again<00:05:10.120> I'm<00:05:10.539> going<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.139> use<00:05:11.440> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
espresso so again I'm going to use the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.649 
espresso so again I'm going to use the
single<00:05:12.400> shot<00:05:12.610> of<00:05:12.639> espresso<00:05:12.819> now<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.360> Revo

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
single shot of espresso now the Revo

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.629 
single shot of espresso now the Revo
likes<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:14.020> turn<00:05:14.139> itself<00:05:14.440> off<00:05:14.710> all<00:05:15.009> the<00:05:15.190> time

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
likes to turn itself off all the time

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.580 
likes to turn itself off all the time
so<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.300> need<00:05:16.449> to<00:05:16.539> turn<00:05:16.659> it<00:05:16.810> back<00:05:16.930> on<00:05:17.229> when<00:05:17.440> you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
so you need to turn it back on when you

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.749 
so you need to turn it back on when you
hear<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.800> double<00:05:18.099> beep<00:05:18.219> it's<00:05:18.490> ready<00:05:18.729> to

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
hear that double beep it's ready to

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.640 
hear that double beep it's ready to
start<00:05:18.879> brewing<00:05:19.210> I'm<00:05:19.629> gonna<00:05:19.960> do<00:05:20.080> again<00:05:20.319> a<00:05:20.349> short

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
start brewing I'm gonna do again a short

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.769 
start brewing I'm gonna do again a short
shot<00:05:20.949> of<00:05:21.129> espresso

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.570 

now<00:05:25.779> usually<00:05:26.560> if<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.800> were<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:27.039> do<00:05:27.189> this<00:05:27.370> or

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
now usually if you were to do this or

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.219 
now usually if you were to do this or
get<00:05:27.729> this<00:05:27.879> in<00:05:28.029> a<00:05:28.090> coffee<00:05:28.330> shop<00:05:28.479> and<00:05:28.689> have<00:05:29.080> it

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
get this in a coffee shop and have it

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.740 
get this in a coffee shop and have it
done<00:05:29.379> in<00:05:29.409> this<00:05:29.680> fashion<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:31.180> espresso<00:05:31.599> would

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
done in this fashion the espresso would

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.269 
done in this fashion the espresso would
be<00:05:31.840> brewed<00:05:32.050> separately<00:05:32.590> into<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.860> small

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
be brewed separately into a small

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.129 
be brewed separately into a small
espresso<00:05:33.849> pitcher<00:05:34.210> of<00:05:34.330> some<00:05:34.539> kind<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:35.020> then

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
espresso pitcher of some kind and then

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.860 
espresso pitcher of some kind and then
it<00:05:35.259> would<00:05:35.379> be<00:05:35.500> poured<00:05:35.889> into<00:05:36.370> your<00:05:36.969> milk<00:05:37.599> in

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
it would be poured into your milk in

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.740 
it would be poured into your milk in
your<00:05:38.139> cup<00:05:38.440> literally<00:05:39.250> marking<00:05:39.729> the<00:05:39.879> milk<00:05:40.150> with

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
your cup literally marking the milk with

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.300 
your cup literally marking the milk with
the<00:05:40.930> espresso<00:05:41.199> shot<00:05:41.620> now<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.860> reason<00:05:42.219> you

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
the espresso shot now the reason you

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.100 
the espresso shot now the reason you
would<00:05:42.430> use<00:05:42.759> that<00:05:42.969> espresso<00:05:43.240> pitcher<00:05:43.870> is<00:05:43.930> it

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
would use that espresso pitcher is it

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.079 
would use that espresso pitcher is it
would<00:05:44.199> let<00:05:44.379> you<00:05:44.529> essentially<00:05:45.370> get<00:05:45.610> better<00:05:45.819> aim

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
would let you essentially get better aim

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:48.600 
would let you essentially get better aim
you<00:05:46.479> get<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.870> much<00:05:47.169> more<00:05:47.199> distinct<00:05:47.949> mark<00:05:48.339> in<00:05:48.520> the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
you get a much more distinct mark in the

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.519 
you get a much more distinct mark in the
top<00:05:48.639> of<00:05:48.969> the<00:05:49.060> milk<00:05:49.270> but<00:05:49.569> because<00:05:50.229> we<00:05:50.349> like

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
top of the milk but because we like

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:52.529 
top of the milk but because we like
doing<00:05:50.710> things<00:05:51.069> in<00:05:51.279> one<00:05:51.669> fell<00:05:51.879> swoop<00:05:51.940> here<00:05:52.449> on

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
use the machine to mark the milk so

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.779 
use the machine to mark the milk so
right<00:05:56.589> there<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:56.979> can<00:05:57.129> see<00:05:57.310> now<00:05:57.490> I<00:05:57.520> have<00:05:57.669> a
