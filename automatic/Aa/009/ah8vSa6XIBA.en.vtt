00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello friends the math course between 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.589
 your the subject cycle training 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.440
 cuca 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.259
 this matter is very important for 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.080
 finish this year on a piece of land 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.210
 used in a very intense way 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.420
 in all exercises by 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.779
 independence had an agreement 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.599
 so let's work, we can always 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.960
 with important people, but not you 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.960
 me 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:45.400
 the boot that we draw a symbol of the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:47.650
 moment we have the xo axis 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.750
 axis of the Egyptian there is a little work 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.620
 the coordinates a caffeine hit well 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.640
 the board is on the x-axis by the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:06.070
 servicio two twitts that was then we 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:13.259
 we have the values here as in the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:20.369
 coffee smaller one here to my kitchen 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:20.369
 up here one more down in the south 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.360
 this done the moment he leaves 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.720
 from here and goes here in our grades 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.800
 walking but here are more 90 that makes 180 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.759
 playing more 90 270 degrees even more 93 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.100
 without pay 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:44.100
 perfect then we'll disturb the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 signals 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.470
 the signs 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.950
 Okay, let's put that 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.180
 yea 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.019
 he down here we put the 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.019
 convincing 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.350
 to pass perfectly 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.990
 Now we will put here 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.990
 right quadrants 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.470
 the first 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:56.640
 the second third and fourth then 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:01.740
 first quadrant is this one not here 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.290
 the second third and fourth 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.680
 Let's go here in London at the first 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.840
 south quadrant with which it has here 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.450
 He leaves here and goes on foot. 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.160
 this year we download here you have to 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.160
 Jump on the amateur 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.500
 degrees he will find the advice 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.470
 I got positive from now on. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.240
 the goal then advice on the first 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.340
 when m is positive quadrant is that with 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.890
 104 good points 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:40.750
 thales mc us senac 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:43.600
 positive so positive let's trace 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.490
 now in a year that second standard comes out 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:56.740
 from here I went here associating right there 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:59.280
 we moth attacks on al luzi here yo 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.460
 that is from here to earth try advice is 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.220
 negative and 1 being even film in 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.590
 relation to this benefit in prisons 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.550
 So be positive is that coffee is 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.290
 positive 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.200
 so we're setting up here our 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.260
 table protect we now go back to 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.900
 an angle from the 1st to the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.400
 third year then if this happens 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.520
 year the singer 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.060
 look we are attentive to the inflation 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.160
 x books first from here 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.440
 hell title also board 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.810
 that Jorge is negative in captivity 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.870
 hiring the flamengo athlete 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.660
 are the 12 and 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.320
 I just got there, like here. 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.410
 negative then being also on the net and 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.930
 now last we'll spend a year 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.190
 even those partners was a Christian book 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.020
 dark here to board here 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.260
 So, look, we bring the play. 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.090
 titled relative to the witches then 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.990
 were more positive than singing 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.160
 very positive partnership with the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.160
 recording studio 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.490
 as here for every active childhood as 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.410
 negative then here is our table 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.330
 What are you doing in this table? 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.460
 they will never forget and never 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.050
 they got an exercise and in the same way 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.720
 for example that the tangent is not always 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.420
 it may be possible to know in which 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.940
 stage is positive and advice is 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.340
 merchant toll is always a 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.440
 positive or negative strength of negative 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.840
 There are people who fit the scenes. 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.030
 negative from the perspective of 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.120
 vision and even people of the port 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:48.020
 negative because it is in the goal and the quota people 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.090
 just make a gesture from the tangent focus 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.850
 They were not released in that positive 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.610
 positive or negative behavior. 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.500
 positive or negative negative 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.120
 more political view that positive and 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.280
 negative is negative 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.580
 grateful for the attention continues to be worth 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.180
 our channel send comments 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.180
