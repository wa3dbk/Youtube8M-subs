00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to make them go back at space again i'm

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.460 
to make them go back at space again i'm
starting<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> background<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.750> remind

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
starting in the background to remind

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.470 
starting in the background to remind
myself<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.070> these<00:00:29.490> shapes<00:00:29.910> should<00:00:30.330> be

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
myself that these shapes should be

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.170 
myself that these shapes should be
smaller<00:00:30.869> than<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.349> ones<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.920> are<00:00:32.180> towards

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
smaller than the ones that are towards

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.220 
smaller than the ones that are towards
the<00:00:33.390> foreground<00:00:35.329> after<00:00:36.329> i<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.079> these

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
i'm using a standard surface so the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.649 
and as i do it I'm squinting to see both
the<00:01:16.290> value<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.189> I'm<00:01:17.549> opening<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:18.450> eyes

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the value and I'm opening up my eyes

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.609 
the value and I'm opening up my eyes
wide<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.280> color<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:23.479> because<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.780> want

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
to see the shapes it's big bigger shapes

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.870 
to see the shapes it's big bigger shapes
and<00:01:30.360> smaller<00:01:30.720> shapes<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and smaller shapes that I will go in and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.830 
and smaller shapes that I will go in and
correct<00:01:33.210> them<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.810> terms<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.759> defining<00:01:35.840> will

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
correct them in terms of defining will

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.469 
correct them in terms of defining will
shape<00:01:37.110> more<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.090> look<00:01:39.450> like

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
shape more right now we just look like

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.840 
shape more right now we just look like
blobs<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.829> block<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.670> color<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:43.590> sub<00:01:44.460> point

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
blobs and block of color but a sub point

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.770 
blobs and block of color but a sub point
of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> painting<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.909> actually<00:01:48.240> start

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
of the painting it will actually start

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.190 
of the painting it will actually start
to<00:01:48.840> look<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.500> field<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.189> poppies<00:01:51.200> you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
to look like a field of poppies you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800 
to look like a field of poppies you
don't<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:54.030> you're<00:01:54.210> working<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:54.659> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
don't want to when you're working out of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.590 
don't want to when you're working out of
paintings<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:56.159> want<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.969> blocked<00:01:57.270> in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
paintings you want it to be blocked in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.700 
paintings you want it to be blocked in
pretty<00:01:57.930> loosely<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.680> for

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
pretty loosely it for

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.260 
pretty loosely it for
I<00:01:59.770> bet<00:02:00.520> get<00:02:01.150> more<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:02.200> depth<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:03.070> detail<00:02:03.610> if

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
I bet get more in depth and detail if

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.930 
I bet get more in depth and detail if
you<00:02:04.450> start<00:02:04.810> working<00:02:05.320> too<00:02:06.280> soon<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:08.039> detail<00:02:09.039> you

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
you start working too soon on detail you

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.910 
you start working too soon on detail you
usually<00:02:10.179> will<00:02:10.750> come<00:02:11.050> up<00:02:11.170> with<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> painting

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
usually will come up with a painting

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.460 
usually will come up with a painting
that<00:02:11.950> works<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:12.880> 30<00:02:13.209> places<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:14.110> doesn't

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
that works in 30 places that doesn't

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.150 
that works in 30 places that doesn't
quite<00:02:14.709> hang<00:02:15.130> together<00:02:15.400> as<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> whole<00:02:16.270> painting

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
quite hang together as a whole painting

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.059 
quite hang together as a whole painting
so<00:02:18.160> next<00:02:18.400> time<00:02:18.780> I'll<00:02:19.780> work<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.470> some<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.950> those

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
so next time I'll work in some of those

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.940 
so next time I'll work in some of those
blue<00:02:21.430> greens<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:22.120> make<00:02:22.330> those<00:02:22.569> poppies<00:02:23.530> really

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
blue greens to make those poppies really

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.180 
blue greens to make those poppies really
pop<00:02:24.250> say
