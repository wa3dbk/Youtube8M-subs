there's<00:02:12.690> tech<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.380> trauma<00:02:13.650> know<00:02:13.800> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
there's tech that to trauma know that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.190 
there's tech that to trauma know that
looks<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.310> an<00:02:14.430> L<00:02:14.900> looks<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.050> that
