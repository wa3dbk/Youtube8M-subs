quite<00:00:08.639> common<00:00:08.940> issue<00:00:09.240> after<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.929> did<00:00:10.110> some

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
quite common issue after I did some

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.850 
quite common issue after I did some
online<00:00:10.440> research<00:00:11.750> basically<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:13.410> dad<00:00:13.559> was<00:00:13.740> in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
online research basically my dad was in

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.629 
online research basically my dad was in
it<00:00:13.980> yesterday

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
it yesterday

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.330 
it yesterday
and<00:00:14.730> he<00:00:15.179> went<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.450> charge<00:00:15.690> his<00:00:15.839> Blackberry<00:00:16.710> he

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and he went to charge his Blackberry he

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.900 
and he went to charge his Blackberry he
tried<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.880> um<00:00:18.859> power<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.520> didn't<00:00:20.760> work

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
tried this um power and it didn't work

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.630 
tried this um power and it didn't work
so<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> hell<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:23.369> he<00:00:23.400> use

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
so I was like what the hell can he use

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.049 
so I was like what the hell can he use
this<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.119> did<00:00:25.019> not<00:00:25.050> work<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.849> just<00:00:26.849> test

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.660 

he<00:00:33.059> used<00:00:34.910> listen<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.480> did<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.780> work<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> he

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
he used listen and it did not work so he

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.190 
he used listen and it did not work so he
thought<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> car<00:00:39.239> had<00:00:39.420> some<00:00:39.629> kind<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.899> major

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
thought the car had some kind of major

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.040 
thought the car had some kind of major
letter<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.829> first<00:00:41.040> thing<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.280> thought<00:00:41.489> was

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
letter the first thing you thought was

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.229 
letter the first thing you thought was
fuses<00:00:43.489> now<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> didn't<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
fuses now if you didn't know this the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.850 
fuses now if you didn't know this the
way<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.539> fuses<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.829> take

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
way you get fuses one here is you take

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.869 
way you get fuses one here is you take
your<00:00:47.160> switchblade<00:00:47.520> key<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.899> eject<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.730> if<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
your switchblade key you eject it if you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.420 
your switchblade key you eject it if you
see<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.239> there's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.629> knot

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
see right there there's a little knot

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.990 
see right there there's a little knot
pop<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> key<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.020> run<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:56.000> pop

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
pop the key in and then just run it pop

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.049 
pop the key in and then just run it pop
the<00:00:57.149> key<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.510> pop<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.550> run<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.609> up<00:00:59.850> along

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the key in pop it out run it up along

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.680 
the key in pop it out run it up along
the<00:01:00.270> edge<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.260> pops<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:03.449> just

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the edge and it pops that out you just

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.190 
the edge and it pops that out you just
pull<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:05.060> and<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.210> check<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> fuses<00:01:07.020> now

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
pull it out and you check the fuses now

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.750 
pull it out and you check the fuses now
in<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> owners<00:01:07.890> manual<00:01:08.010> I'm<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
in the owners manual I'm not going to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.440 
in the owners manual I'm not going to
pull<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.689> says<00:01:10.200> its<00:01:10.380> uses<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.450> they're

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
pull it out it says its uses a they're

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.630 
pull it out it says its uses a they're
labeled<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.130> think<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.250> 23<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
labeled I think it's 23 which is that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.179 
labeled I think it's 23 which is that
126<00:01:17.640> which<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.009> they're<00:01:20.009> both

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
126 which is that one and they're both

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.920 
126 which is that one and they're both
perfectly<00:01:20.610> I'm<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.000> gonna<00:01:21.180> pull<00:01:21.390> any<00:01:21.420> fuses

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
perfectly I'm not gonna pull any fuses

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
perfectly I'm not gonna pull any fuses

some<00:01:33.930> major<00:01:34.170> electrical<00:01:34.560> issue<00:01:34.909> well<00:01:35.909> after<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
some major electrical issue well after a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.630 
some major electrical issue well after a
little<00:01:36.420> research<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.290> did<00:01:37.380> online<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.400> turned

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640

little research I did online it turned
out<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.500> 23<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.740> 26<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.490> whatever

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
out that it's not 23 and 26 or whatever

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
out that it's not 23 and 26 or whatever
it<00:01:41.909> was<00:01:42.090> whatever<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.259> manual<00:01:43.590> says<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.250> go

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it was whatever the manual says you go

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.760 
it was whatever the manual says you go
all<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> way<00:01:44.759> down<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> second-to-last

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
all the way down to the second-to-last

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.990 
all the way down to the second-to-last
row<00:01:47.220> or<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.079> sixth<00:01:49.079> row<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.820> third

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
row or the sixth row and it's the third

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.380 
row or the sixth row and it's the third
fuse<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.950> popped<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
fuse right here and I popped it out and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.030 
fuse right here and I popped it out and
like<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> said<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.890> just

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
like I said I'm not going to do it just

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.200 
like I said I'm not going to do it just
because<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> fuck<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
because I don't want to fuck with it we

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.719 
because I don't want to fuck with it we
finally<00:01:57.450> got<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.810> work<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.460> fuse

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
finally got to work and it's that fuse

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.160 
finally got to work and it's that fuse
right<00:01:59.909> there<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.299> controls<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:00.990> your

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
right there which controls all your

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.179 
right there which controls all your
power<00:02:01.320> outlets<00:02:02.210> now<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:04.649> basically<00:02:04.799> what

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
power outlets now so basically what

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.760 
power outlets now so basically what
happened<00:02:05.579> was<00:02:05.640> once<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.119> figure<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.509> out

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
happened was once we figure that out

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.290 
happened was once we figure that out
genius<00:02:07.770> gets<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.759> starts<00:02:09.000> fucking

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
genius gets in here and starts fucking

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.220 
genius gets in here and starts fucking
with<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> fuses

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
with the fuses

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.160 
with the fuses
moves<00:02:11.590> them<00:02:11.830> around<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.430> he<00:02:13.150> causes<00:02:16.170> we

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
moves them around and he causes we

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.449 
moves them around and he causes we
started<00:02:17.500> up<00:02:17.650> me<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:20.080> those<00:02:21.010> lights<00:02:21.220> aren't

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
started up me and those lights aren't

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.630 
started up me and those lights aren't
gonna<00:02:21.549> go<00:02:21.670> into<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.000> started<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.680> anyway<00:02:27.159> so<00:02:27.220> he

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
gonna go into I started but anyway so he

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.479 
gonna go into I started but anyway so he
gets<00:02:27.819> in<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:28.299> he<00:02:28.810> triggers<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.920> stability<00:02:30.400> I

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
gets in here he triggers the stability I

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.360 
gets in here he triggers the stability I
guess<00:02:30.760> some<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:32.049> fuse<00:02:32.349> right<00:02:32.530> here<00:02:32.769> is<00:02:33.129> for

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
guess some this fuse right here is for

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.920 
guess some this fuse right here is for
your<00:02:33.459> stability<00:02:33.910> control<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.420> know<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.690> chime

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
your stability control I know the chime

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.589 
your stability control I know the chime
is<00:02:35.080> loud<00:02:35.319> because<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.890> panel<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.549> off<00:02:36.700> he

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
is loud because the panel is off he

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.960 
is loud because the panel is off he
triggers<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.410> stability<00:02:38.860> control<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.430> which

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
triggers the stability control one which

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.759 
triggers the stability control one which
triggers<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.510> check<00:02:40.750> engine<00:02:40.930> light<00:02:41.200> so

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
triggers the check engine light so

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.559 
triggers the check engine light so
basically<00:02:42.129> all<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.489> these<00:02:43.030> light<00:02:43.329> the

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
basically all of these light the

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.140 
basically all of these light the
dashboard<00:02:44.170> lights<00:02:44.410> up<00:02:44.739> because<00:02:45.700> he<00:02:45.849> got<00:02:45.970> in

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
dashboard lights up because he got in

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.050 
dashboard lights up because he got in
here<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.390> started<00:02:46.599> moving<00:02:46.750> switches<00:02:47.319> around

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
here and started moving switches around

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.339 
here and started moving switches around
cut<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.150> stupid<00:02:49.569> chime<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.730> anyway<00:02:55.260> there<00:02:56.260> we

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
cut that stupid chime so anyway there we

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.789 
cut that stupid chime so anyway there we
go<00:02:57.030> panel<00:02:58.030> one<00:02:58.180> before<00:02:58.569> this<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.470> what<00:02:59.709> your

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
go panel one before this is what your

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.680 
go panel one before this is what your
panel<00:03:00.099> looks<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.400> it's<00:03:00.579> still<00:03:00.819> you<00:03:01.359> must<00:03:01.569> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
panel looks like it's still you must the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.330 
panel looks like it's still you must the
inside<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.109> door<00:03:02.319> panel<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:02.829> still<00:03:03.129> covered

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
inside the door panel it's still covered

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.380 
inside the door panel it's still covered
in<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.700> same<00:03:04.000> soft<00:03:04.329> material<00:03:04.840> as<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.799> -<00:03:06.390> but

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
in the same soft material as the - but

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.000 
in the same soft material as the - but
anyway<00:03:07.750> what<00:03:07.989> he<00:03:08.200> ended<00:03:08.410> up<00:03:08.470> doing<00:03:08.799> was

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
anyway what he ended up doing was

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.610 
anyway what he ended up doing was
triggering<00:03:09.579> all<00:03:09.730> kinds<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.150> lights<00:03:10.620> somehow

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
triggering all kinds of lights somehow

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.309 
triggering all kinds of lights somehow
we<00:03:11.680> were<00:03:11.920> driving<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.400> car<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.140> all<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
we were driving the car and all the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.849 
we were driving the car and all the
lights

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
lights

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.940 
lights
somehow<00:03:17.160> recirculate<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.489> went<00:03:18.849> off<00:03:18.970> luckily

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
somehow recirculate and went off luckily

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.409 
somehow recirculate and went off luckily
but<00:03:20.950> basically<00:03:21.340> that's<00:03:21.519> what<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:21.849> Volkswagen

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
but basically that's what is Volkswagen

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.569 
but basically that's what is Volkswagen
for<00:03:22.540> some<00:03:22.720> reason<00:03:22.959> has<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:23.260> lit<00:03:23.410> oh<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.859> of

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
for some reason has it lit oh and of

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.409 
for some reason has it lit oh and of
course<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:25.150> fixed<00:03:25.660> all<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.169> power<00:03:26.380> outlets

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
course it fixed all of the power outlets

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.729 
course it fixed all of the power outlets
so<00:03:28.419> you<00:03:28.480> can<00:03:28.599> see<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.780> little<00:03:28.989> light<00:03:29.380> comes<00:03:29.650> on

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
so you can see the little light comes on

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:37.970 
so you can see the little light comes on
that<00:03:30.280> works<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.709> this<00:03:33.069> one<00:03:36.569> no<00:03:37.569> leave<00:03:37.750> it

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
that works and this one no leave it

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.000 
that works and this one no leave it
stupid<00:03:38.980> skull<00:03:39.370> thing<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:43.209> can<00:03:43.329> see<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.630> works

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
stupid skull thing you can see it works

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.920 
stupid skull thing you can see it works
the<00:03:45.010> skull<00:03:45.340> kind<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.209> spring<00:03:46.599> thing<00:03:46.810> that

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
the skull kind of spring thing that

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.750 
the skull kind of spring thing that
makes<00:03:47.109> it<00:03:47.230> pop<00:03:47.410> out<00:03:49.799> but<00:03:50.799> basically<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.400> is

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
makes it pop out but basically that is

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.150 
makes it pop out but basically that is
it<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.269> if<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.599> ever<00:03:52.810> anyone<00:03:53.590> who<00:03:53.739> owns<00:03:53.950> a

it so if you ever anyone who owns a

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.819 
it so if you ever anyone who owns a
Jetta<00:03:54.400> if<00:03:54.639> you<00:03:54.760> ever<00:03:55.000> have<00:03:55.299> this<00:03:55.540> problem<00:03:55.900> do

Jetta if you ever have this problem do

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.440 
Jetta if you ever have this problem do
not<00:03:56.859> panic<00:03:57.340> do<00:03:57.700> not<00:03:57.879> take<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.269> the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
not panic do not take it to the

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.869 
not panic do not take it to the
dealership<00:03:58.919> just<00:03:59.919> because<00:04:00.129> it<00:04:00.250> said<00:04:00.459> it's<00:04:00.700> one

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
fuse so I know there's been kind of a

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.559 
fuse so I know there's been kind of a
rambling<00:04:55.529> video<00:04:55.770> but<00:04:56.039> also<00:04:57.000> that's<00:04:57.389> where

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569

rambling video but also that's where
your<00:04:57.689> fuse<00:04:57.900> boxes<00:04:58.349> is<00:04:58.560> back<00:04:58.770> there<00:05:02.000> and

also I believe this is how you begin
removing<00:05:07.500> interior<00:05:08.159> panels<00:05:08.930> sighs<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:10.050> can

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
removing interior panels sighs you can

see there's clips and you can start
pulling<00:05:12.810> down<00:05:12.960> here<00:05:13.319> and<00:05:13.439> unclipping<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.099> I

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
pulling down here and unclipping it I

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.179
