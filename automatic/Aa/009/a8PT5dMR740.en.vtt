00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
split this up into two different overall

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.020 
split this up into two different overall
segments<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.680> first<00:00:44.920> will<00:00:45.430> be<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.579> little<00:00:45.880> bit

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
segments the first will be a little bit

segments the first will be a little bit
more<00:00:46.150> brief<00:00:46.450> it's<00:00:46.960> going<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.170> be<00:00:47.290> about<00:00:47.470> how<00:00:47.680> we

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
more brief it's going to be about how we

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.380 
more brief it's going to be about how we
can<00:00:47.950> organize<00:00:48.370> our<00:00:48.520> practice<00:00:48.970> session

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
can organize our practice session

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.720 
can organize our practice session
overall<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.920> second<00:00:51.280> part<00:00:51.520> will<00:00:51.670> be

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
overall and the second part will be

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.850 
overall and the second part will be
about<00:00:52.060> how<00:00:52.300> we<00:00:52.329> can<00:00:52.570> organize<00:00:52.810> certain<00:00:53.620> pieces

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
about how we can organize certain pieces

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.069 
about how we can organize certain pieces
in<00:00:54.790> order<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.149> practice<00:00:55.329> them<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.899> most

in order to practice them the most
effectively<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.850> first<00:00:58.060> concept<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:58.600> want<00:00:58.750> to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
effectively the first concept I want to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.380 
effectively the first concept I want to
present<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.640> that<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:00.850> heard<00:01:01.090> from<00:01:01.270> a

teacher and this will put a lot of

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.450 
teacher and this will put a lot of
younger<00:01:05.229> kids<00:01:05.259> minds<00:01:05.680> at<00:01:05.860> ease<00:01:05.950> when<00:01:06.280> their

to me
actually<00:01:14.170> learned<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:14.710> concept<00:01:15.280> probably

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
actually learned this concept probably

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.090 
actually learned this concept probably
three<00:01:15.880> months<00:01:16.150> ago<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.600> teacher<00:01:17.140> told<00:01:17.500> me<00:01:17.620> that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
three months ago a teacher told me that

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.670 
three months ago a teacher told me that
you<00:01:18.220> should<00:01:18.430> never<00:01:18.690> play<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.840> piano<00:01:19.870> for<00:01:20.229> more

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
you should never play the piano for more

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.340 
you should never play the piano for more
than<00:01:20.860> twenty<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.340> thirty<00:01:21.580> minutes<00:01:21.760> at<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.060> time

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
than twenty to thirty minutes at a time

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.100 
than twenty to thirty minutes at a time
and<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.440> thought<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.830> myself<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.780> really

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
and I thought to myself that is a really

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.649 
and I thought to myself that is a really
good<00:01:26.260> point<00:01:26.440> because<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.100> lot<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.280> times<00:01:27.580> I<00:01:27.880> know

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
good point because a lot of times I know

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.130 
good point because a lot of times I know
for<00:01:29.110> me<00:01:29.229> I<00:01:29.409> find<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.100> lot<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.990> zoning<00:01:31.990> app

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
for me I find a lot of zoning app

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.960 
for me I find a lot of zoning app
happens<00:01:32.619> when<00:01:32.830> I'm<00:01:32.950> at<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.340> piano<00:01:33.520> for<00:01:33.790> long

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
happens when I'm at the piano for long

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.580 
happens when I'm at the piano for long
periods<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.479> time<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:34.930> that's<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.380> first

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
periods of time so that's the first

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.990 
periods of time so that's the first
concept<00:01:36.190> I<00:01:36.250> want<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.460> present<00:01:36.820> with

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
concept I want to present with

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.060 
concept I want to present with
organizing<00:01:37.570> your<00:01:37.689> practice<00:01:38.020> time<00:01:38.200> organize

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
30 minute sessions we don't need hours

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.289 
30 minute sessions we don't need hours
on<00:01:45.610> end<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.479> different<00:01:46.840> breaks<00:01:47.110> we<00:01:47.710> just<00:01:47.920> want

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
on end of different breaks we just want

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.320 
on end of different breaks we just want
maybe<00:01:49.299> two<00:01:49.930> or<00:01:50.080> three<00:01:50.110> minutes

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
maybe two or three minutes

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.300

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
lets your mind kind of reset itself it

just as if you were running if you take

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.700 
just as if you were running if you take

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
I think each of those are so important

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.300 
I think each of those are so important
because<00:02:24.230> when<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.260> learn<00:02:25.590> new<00:02:25.770> material<00:02:25.890> each

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
because when we learn new material each

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.310 
because when we learn new material each
day<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.820> stimulates<00:02:27.600> our<00:02:27.750> mind<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.170> when

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
day it stimulates our mind and when

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.410 
day it stimulates our mind and when
we're<00:02:28.440> perfecting<00:02:28.830> old<00:02:29.520> material<00:02:30.060> each<00:02:30.209> day

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it keeps it really sharp because we're

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.180 
it keeps it really sharp because we're
learning<00:02:34.050> both<00:02:34.440> sides<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.360> our<00:02:36.620> brain<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:38.040> my

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
learning both sides of our brain in my

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.520 
learning both sides of our brain in my
opinion<00:02:38.640> really<00:02:38.820> because<00:02:39.660> you're<00:02:39.870> having<00:02:40.410> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
opinion really because you're having to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.720 
opinion really because you're having to
analyze<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.980> lot<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.310> things<00:02:41.520> when<00:02:41.700> you're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
analyze a lot of things when you're

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.560 
analyze a lot of things when you're
learning<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.330> you're<00:02:42.680> also<00:02:43.680> having<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.570> be

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
learning and you're also having to be

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.320 
learning and you're also having to be
very<00:02:45.810> creative<00:02:46.320> when<00:02:46.500> you're<00:02:47.090> perfecting<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
very creative when you're perfecting and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.240 
very creative when you're perfecting and
also<00:02:48.780> when<00:02:48.930> you're<00:02:49.050> learning<00:02:49.200> anything<00:02:49.590> it's

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
also when you're learning anything it's

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.949 
also when you're learning anything it's
stimulating<00:02:50.490> both<00:02:50.940> sides<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.480> brain<00:02:51.600> so

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
stimulating both sides of your brain so

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.180 
stimulating both sides of your brain so
much<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:52.500> important<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.070> good

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
much so it's important to have a good

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.949 
much so it's important to have a good
balance<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.850> we<00:02:54.030> don't<00:02:54.150> want<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.720> to

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
balance of that we don't want it just to

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.890 
balance of that we don't want it just to
be<00:02:54.990> learning<00:02:55.440> new<00:02:55.560> stuff<00:02:55.830> all<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.730> time<00:02:56.970> but

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
be learning new stuff all the time but

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.040 
be learning new stuff all the time but
we<00:02:58.019> don't<00:02:58.050> want<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:58.650> be<00:02:58.860> perfecting<00:03:00.050> only

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
we don't want to just be perfecting only

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.160 
we don't want to just be perfecting only
either<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.310> think<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.510> that's<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:04.019> good

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
either so I think that that's a good

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.560 
either so I think that that's a good
intro<00:03:04.709> concept<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.489> we<00:03:05.640> need<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.940> really

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
intro concept that we need to really

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.270 
intro concept that we need to really
grasp<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.230> order<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.590> make<00:03:07.739> our<00:03:07.890> practice

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
grasp in order to make our practice

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.540 
grasp in order to make our practice
sessions<00:03:08.640> more<00:03:08.820> effective<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:10.019> first

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
sessions more effective the first

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.650 
sessions more effective the first
concept<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.700> presented<00:03:12.180> right<00:03:12.269> there<00:03:12.480> was

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
concept that I presented right there was

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.810 
concept that I presented right there was
warming<00:03:13.019> up<00:03:13.370> there's<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.430> million<00:03:14.640> different

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
warming up there's a million different

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.640 
warming up there's a million different
ways<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.330> warm<00:03:15.510> up<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.230> I'm<00:03:16.320> just<00:03:16.350> going<00:03:16.560> to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
ways to warm up and I'm just going to

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.009 
ways to warm up and I'm just going to
name<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.800> few<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.160> those<00:03:17.400> today<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:18.090> lot<00:03:18.930> of

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
name a few of those today a lot of

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.020 
name a few of those today a lot of
people<00:03:19.260> have<00:03:19.350> asked<00:03:19.739> do<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.370> use<00:03:20.550> warm<00:03:20.850> up

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
people have asked do you use warm up

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.540 
people have asked do you use warm up
books<00:03:21.330> or<00:03:21.630> do<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.290> use<00:03:22.500> your<00:03:22.739> pieces<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.370> warm

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
books or do you use your pieces to warm

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.990 
books or do you use your pieces to warm
up<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.269> think<00:03:24.650> there<00:03:25.650> comes<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:26.070> point<00:03:26.280> where

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
up and I think there comes a point where

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.610 
up and I think there comes a point where
it's<00:03:27.180> more<00:03:27.390> effective<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:28.080> use<00:03:28.140> your<00:03:28.380> pieces

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
it's more effective to use your pieces

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.140 
it's more effective to use your pieces
to<00:03:28.950> warm<00:03:29.100> up<00:03:29.250> if<00:03:29.430> you're<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.580> beginning<00:03:29.910> piano

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
to warm up if you're a beginning piano

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.500 
to warm up if you're a beginning piano
student<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.780> would<00:03:31.320> say<00:03:31.440> just<00:03:31.739> using<00:03:32.250> books

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
student I would say just using books

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
student I would say just using books
Hanan<00:03:35.610> which<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:36.790> great<00:03:37.090> just<00:03:37.689> has<00:03:37.930> basic

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
Hanan which is great just has basic

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.550 
Hanan which is great just has basic
exercises<00:03:42.629> that's<00:03:43.629> number<00:03:43.840> one<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.379> also

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
exercises that's number one it also

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.690 
exercises that's number one it also
includes<00:03:45.040> all<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.459> scales<00:03:45.760> in<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.659> entire<00:03:47.700> in

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
the back of the book so I'll go back

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.110 
the back of the book so I'll go back
down<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.650> then<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.980> do<00:03:54.610> your<00:03:54.640> cadential

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
down and then you do your cadential

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.610 
down and then you do your cadential

down while others move so some of the

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.440 
down while others move so some of the
exercises<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.920> might<00:05:04.070> be<00:05:04.190> holding<00:05:04.340> down<00:05:04.700> your

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
exercises you might be holding down your

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.080 
exercises you might be holding down your
third<00:05:05.750> finger<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.350> then<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:07.070> good<00:05:07.850> way<00:05:08.030> to

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
third finger and then a good way to

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.110 
third finger and then a good way to
practice<00:05:08.390> these<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:09.080> doing<00:05:10.000> legato<00:05:11.000> and

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
practice these is doing legato and

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.180 
practice these is doing legato and
staccato<00:05:11.350> different<00:05:12.350> rhythms<00:05:12.650> things<00:05:13.040> like

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
staccato different rhythms things like

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:20.980 
staccato different rhythms things like
that<00:05:13.400> so<00:05:13.670> for<00:05:13.910> example<00:05:18.550> all<00:05:19.660> about<00:05:20.660> holding

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
that so for example all about holding

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.980 
that so for example all about holding
that<00:05:21.110> third<00:05:21.380> finger<00:05:21.710> down<00:05:22.540> the<00:05:23.540> next<00:05:23.810> book

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
that third finger down the next book

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.750 
that third finger down the next book
that's<00:05:24.200> very<00:05:24.380> similar<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.860> Schmidt<00:05:25.280> except

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
that's very similar to Schmidt except

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.270 
that's very similar to Schmidt except
it's<00:05:25.940> just<00:05:26.000> in<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.390> more<00:05:27.260> difficult<00:05:27.620> way<00:05:28.010> is

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
it's just in a more difficult way is

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.880 
it's just in a more difficult way is
called<00:05:28.670> Philippe<00:05:29.620> exercises<00:05:30.620> for<00:05:30.830> the

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
called Philippe exercises for the

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.560 
called Philippe exercises for the
independence<00:05:31.430> of<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.610> fingers<00:05:32.000> and<00:05:32.180> I

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
independence of the fingers and I

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.480 
independence of the fingers and I
believe<00:05:32.900> that<00:05:32.930> spelled<00:05:33.470> ph<00:05:34.040> IL<00:05:34.760> IP<00:05:36.220> this<00:05:37.220> deals

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
believe that spelled ph IL IP this deals

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.640 
believe that spelled ph IL IP this deals
all<00:05:37.790> with<00:05:37.970> diminished<00:05:38.420> seventh<00:05:38.810> chords<00:05:39.200> so

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
all with diminished seventh chords so

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:47.590 
all with diminished seventh chords so
you're<00:05:40.400> taking<00:05:40.550> these<00:05:40.850> chords<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:46.600> then

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
you're taking these chords and then

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.180 
you're taking these chords and then
you're<00:05:47.780> doing<00:05:47.930> similar<00:05:48.260> things<00:05:48.410> so<00:05:48.920> you'll<00:05:49.070> be

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
you're doing similar things so you'll be

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.370 
you're doing similar things so you'll be
holding<00:05:49.400> one<00:05:49.610> note<00:05:49.970> down<00:05:50.210> at<00:05:50.420> a<00:05:50.510> time<00:05:50.720> while

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
holding one note down at a time while

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.700 
holding one note down at a time while
the<00:05:51.620> others<00:05:51.950> are<00:05:52.600> playing<00:05:53.600> around<00:05:54.020> it<00:05:54.169> so<00:05:54.440> for

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
the others are playing around it so for

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.060 
the others are playing around it so for
example<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.990> could<00:06:00.140> be<00:06:00.260> an<00:06:00.380> example<00:06:00.650> of<00:06:00.919> one

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
example that could be an example of one

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.070 
example that could be an example of one
and<00:06:01.250> then<00:06:01.340> you<00:06:01.460> go<00:06:01.550> up<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.940> entire<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:03.050> entire

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
and then you go up the entire the entire

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.409 
and then you go up the entire the entire
octave<00:06:03.830> and<00:06:04.310> then<00:06:04.490> come<00:06:04.700> back<00:06:04.730> down<00:06:04.880> so<00:06:05.270> you're

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
octave and then come back down so you're

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.670 
octave and then come back down so you're
learning<00:06:05.630> your<00:06:05.750> diminished<00:06:06.080> 7th<00:06:06.380> chords

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
learning your diminished 7th chords

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.250 
learning your diminished 7th chords
other<00:06:07.220> ones<00:06:07.580> I<00:06:07.850> won't<00:06:08.060> go<00:06:08.180> into<00:06:08.360> too<00:06:08.510> much<00:06:08.750> but

or<00:06:32.250> that<00:06:32.430> from<00:06:32.610> a<00:06:32.700> professional<00:06:33.240> pianist<00:06:33.630> that

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
or that from a professional pianist that

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.650 
or that from a professional pianist that
he<00:06:34.380> used<00:06:34.590> those<00:06:35.040> so<00:06:35.370> I<00:06:35.610> would<00:06:35.970> also<00:06:36.090> check<00:06:36.420> into

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
he used those so I would also check into

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.520 
he used those so I would also check into
those<00:06:36.840> a<00:06:37.310> lot<00:06:38.310> so<00:06:38.820> that<00:06:39.270> gives<00:06:39.450> us<00:06:39.570> a<00:06:39.720> basis<00:06:40.380> of

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
those a lot so that gives us a basis of

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.160 
those a lot so that gives us a basis of
warming<00:06:40.860> up<00:06:41.030> through<00:06:42.030> exercise<00:06:42.510> books<00:06:42.840> the

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
warming up through exercise books the

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.650 
warming up through exercise books the
other<00:06:43.350> great<00:06:43.950> tool<00:06:44.730> that<00:06:44.760> we<00:06:45.030> could<00:06:45.180> use<00:06:45.390> is

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
other great tool that we could use is

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.900 
other great tool that we could use is
warming<00:06:46.470> up<00:06:46.620> through<00:06:46.830> pieces<00:06:47.310> we're<00:06:47.640> killing

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
warming up through pieces we're killing

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.080 
warming up through pieces we're killing
two<00:06:48.060> birds<00:06:48.090> with<00:06:48.330> one<00:06:48.450> stone<00:06:48.630> here<00:06:49.140> and<00:06:50.090> really

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
two birds with one stone here and really

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.090 
two birds with one stone here and really
it's<00:06:51.390> it's<00:06:51.780> very<00:06:52.140> beneficial<00:06:52.350> because<00:06:52.860> we're

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
it's it's very beneficial because we're

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.620 
it's it's very beneficial because we're
developing<00:06:53.460> technique<00:06:53.910> by<00:06:54.060> focusing<00:06:54.510> on

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
developing technique by focusing on

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.230 
developing technique by focusing on
different<00:06:54.960> aspects<00:06:55.350> of<00:06:55.440> our<00:06:56.010> hands<00:06:56.400> and<00:06:56.580> we're

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
different aspects of our hands and we're

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.610 
different aspects of our hands and we're
also<00:06:58.760> like<00:06:59.760> I<00:06:59.880> said<00:07:00.090> before<00:07:00.270> learning<00:07:00.620> the

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
also like I said before learning the

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.770 
also like I said before learning the
learning<00:07:02.040> piano<00:07:02.430> or<00:07:02.700> piano<00:07:03.000> technique<00:07:03.510> or
