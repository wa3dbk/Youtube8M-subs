00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
three of these gems to line up to do it

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.550 
three of these gems to line up to do it
like<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:41.789> and<00:04:42.449> we're<00:04:42.569> moving<00:04:42.689> the<00:04:42.930> gems<00:04:43.169> around

like so and we're moving the gems around

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.730 
like so and we're moving the gems around
if<00:04:43.830> we<00:04:43.979> get<00:04:44.099> five<00:04:44.340> in<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.610> row<00:04:44.639> we<00:04:44.999> get<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> special

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
if we get five in a row we get a special

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.679 
if we get five in a row we get a special
thing<00:04:46.740> here<00:04:47.069> that<00:04:47.669> if<00:04:47.939> we<00:04:48.060> can<00:04:48.210> get<00:04:48.300> this<00:04:48.479> to

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:48.689 
thing here that if we can get this to

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.510 
thing here that if we can get this to
line<00:04:48.810> up<00:04:49.020> with<00:04:49.050> something<00:04:49.439> like<00:04:49.740> we<00:04:50.039> will<00:04:50.219> go

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
line up with something like we will go

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.749 
line up with something like we will go
like<00:04:50.819> like<00:04:51.539> so<00:04:51.930> then<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.889> actually<00:04:53.129> gets<00:04:53.520> rid

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
like like so then it actually gets rid

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.640 
like like so then it actually gets rid
of<00:04:53.789> all<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.330> colors<00:04:54.689> that<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.169> tap<00:04:55.469> on

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
of all of the colors that you tap on

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.589 
of all of the colors that you tap on
you're<00:04:56.310> up<00:04:56.490> against<00:04:56.759> the<00:04:56.879> timer<00:04:57.180> down<00:04:57.479> the

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
you're up against the timer down the

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:58.730 
you're up against the timer down the
bottom<00:04:57.810> here<00:04:57.840> so<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.229> don't<00:04:58.379> want<00:04:58.499> to<00:04:58.560> take

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
bottom here so you don't want to take

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.189 
bottom here so you don't want to take
too<00:04:58.770> long<00:04:59.250> finding<00:04:59.789> matching<00:05:00.210> gems<00:05:00.509> it's

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
too long finding matching gems it's

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.510 
too long finding matching gems it's
really<00:05:01.500> hard<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.919> do<00:05:02.039> while<00:05:02.219> you're<00:05:02.370> talking

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
really hard to do while you're talking

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.850 
really hard to do while you're talking
you<00:05:03.210> have<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.449> keep<00:05:03.599> your<00:05:03.750> wits<00:05:03.930> about<00:05:04.110> you<00:05:04.319> and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
you have to keep your wits about you and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.219 
you have to keep your wits about you and
keep<00:05:05.250> keep<00:05:05.669> those<00:05:05.849> gems<00:05:06.300> matching<00:05:06.779> up<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.169> the

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
keep keep those gems matching up and the

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.409 
keep keep those gems matching up and the
idea<00:05:07.529> is<00:05:07.590> just<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.979> rack<00:05:08.340> up<00:05:08.370> as<00:05:08.699> higher<00:05:08.969> score

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
idea is just to rack up as higher score

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.399 
idea is just to rack up as higher score
as<00:05:09.539> you<00:05:09.629> can<00:05:09.930> before<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:11.039> timer<00:05:11.340> runs<00:05:11.490> out

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
as you can before the timer runs out

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.200 
as you can before the timer runs out
let's<00:05:13.409> go<00:05:13.529> back<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.039> home<00:05:14.159> screen<00:05:14.210> we've
