00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
 but Miguel Mateu Lahoz is one of them 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.270
 by the public 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.920
 and the soccer players who love him 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.170
 at least out of the field because inside 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.760
 from him his particular manual is still 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.370
 a mystery 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.490
 in málaga starts calm leaving 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.490
 to play 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.529
 until some players like ses 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.529
 they start to protest angrily 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.490
 the next one is Jordi Alba who after this 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.630
 entrance complains to the linier and is 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.630
 recriminated for it 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.280
 although with actions like Jesus' 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.130
 gámez template right against the heel 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.350

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.350
 a classic of mateu look me in the eyes 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.480
 everyone is wrong and that ends 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.079
 with the back to the crossbar outside makes a 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.079
 signal to corner 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.340
 and despite the repeated protests of 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.340
 willy gentleman is adamant 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.870
 yes, when the play ends without 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.220
 consequences does not hesitate to admit its 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.220
 error before sergio sanchez 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.890
 good vibes until sergio the one 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 charges is and if it is going to give the same as 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.180
 put it'll see the yellow 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.020
 and the best the defense's comment does not 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.450
 almost as much as the response of fabregas 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.450
 that follows his 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.600
 turn to alves oslo as being rolled 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.600
 by eliseu 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.910
 and that the thing is nothing 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.370
 and a couple of moves later to roll 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.370
 Eliseu and see card 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.340
 and if they stay 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.410
 but the thing does not end here gámez returns 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.140
 to scene with this hooked with neymar 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.950
 and again look me in the eyes but you 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 I forgive the card 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.739
 This is mateu lahoz adored by some 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.640

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.640
 mysterious
