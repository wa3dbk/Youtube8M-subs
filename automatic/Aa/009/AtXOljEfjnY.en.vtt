00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
reasoning and then you find out that

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.039

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
so anti innovation i guess that's the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.330 
so anti innovation i guess that's the
best<00:02:35.810> way<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.140> would<00:02:36.410> describe<00:02:36.440> Apple<00:02:37.190> right

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
best way I would describe Apple right

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
now if you tell me this is their fifth

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.170 
now if you tell me this is their fifth
anniversary<00:02:39.380> for<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.980> iphone<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.580> they<00:02:40.730> just

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
anniversary for the iphone and they just

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.550 
anniversary for the iphone and they just
stopped<00:02:41.570> another<00:02:41.870> phone<00:02:42.170> from<00:02:42.320> being

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
stopped another phone from being

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.820 
stopped another phone from being
produced<00:02:42.920> which<00:02:43.400> has<00:02:43.640> very<00:02:43.780> little

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
produced which has very little

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.320 
produced which has very little
similarities<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.340> iphone<00:02:46.820> if<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.180> really

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
similarities to the iphone if you really

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.640 
similarities to the iphone if you really
get<00:02:47.570> down<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.780> what<00:02:48.050> they're<00:02:48.200> arguing<00:02:48.320> about

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
get down to what they're arguing about

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.010 
get down to what they're arguing about
very<00:02:49.400> little<00:02:49.700> we're<00:02:50.330> talking<00:02:50.450> about<00:02:50.630> search

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
very little we're talking about search

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.510 
very little we're talking about search
and<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:51.500> know<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.650> google<00:02:52.100> is<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.220> king<00:02:52.490> of

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
and we know that google is the king of

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.130 
and we know that google is the king of
search<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.240> they<00:02:53.360> should<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.570> no<00:02:53.720> problem

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
search so they should have no problem

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.530 
search so they should have no problem
