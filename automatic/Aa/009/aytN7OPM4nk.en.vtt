real generic way but it puts it in your
responsibility<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.070> in<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.880> camp<00:04:53.150> of

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
responsibility and in the camp of

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.779

responsibility for any actions in your

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.189 
responsibility for any actions in your
camp<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:10.099> question<00:05:10.639> is<00:05:10.940> focused<00:05:11.330> on<00:05:11.539> you<00:05:11.840> and

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
camp the question is focused on you and

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.100 
camp the question is focused on you and
the<00:05:13.130> situation<00:05:13.340> not<00:05:14.210> necessarily<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.900> people

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
the situation not necessarily the people

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.810 
the situation not necessarily the people
involved<00:05:15.740> in<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.159> situation

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
involved in the situation

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.029

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
so if the motivation has caring some

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.189 
so if the motivation has caring some
maybe<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.150> will<00:05:23.330> get<00:05:23.570> involved<00:05:23.840> with<00:05:24.020> this
