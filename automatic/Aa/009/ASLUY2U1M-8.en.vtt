00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:16.560
 How some insects can walk 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.135
 On a pond surface, 

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:19.815
 But you sink quickly at the bottom 

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:21.417
 When you try to walk on the water? 

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:24.811
 Lakes did not freeze from top to bottom in the winter? 

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:28.823
 In one word, the answer to all these questions is "polar" 

00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:30.490
 Water is a simple molecule 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.946
 Consisting of one atom of oxygen, two atoms of hydrogen, 

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:35.862
 But it is necessary for life. 

00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:39.324
 In fact, water accounts for about 60% 

00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:41.954
 Of the body weight of an adult. 

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:44.372
 Polarity within those water molecules 

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:46.624
 This common substance gives properties 

00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:49.413
 Make it unique and life-sustaining. 

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:51.545
 Polarization refers to unequal sharing 

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:53.604
 Of electrons within a molecule. 

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.551
 For water, the bond between the oxygen atom 

00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.635
 And two hydrogen atoms in one molecule of water 

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:03.020
 It's like a rope-tightening game between a huge and strong football player 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.188
 A cute little kid. 

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:07.063
 Oxygen larger atom, 

00:01:07.063 --> 00:01:09.772
 With more protons in their nuclei than hydrogen. 

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:13.170
 These positive charges are like a person's physical strength. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.485
 She is able to attract 

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:16.855
 Negatively charged electrons in the bond, 

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:19.450
 Just like a strong person's ability to overcome 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.021
 On a weaker individual in the tug-of-war game. 

00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:24.204
 So, oxygen is able to attract 

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:27.123
 More than its fair share of electrons. 

00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:30.273
 Because hydrogen is smaller and less powerful, 

00:01:30.273 --> 00:01:31.550
 Or has fewer protons, 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.547
 It loses the tug of war 

00:01:33.547 --> 00:01:36.733
 And attracts fewer of its fair share of electrons. 

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:39.720
 So, oxygen in the water acts as if it is negative, 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.139
 Hydrogen acts as if it is positive. 

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.846
 The bonds inside one molecule of water 

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:48.163
 They are called polar covalent bonds. 

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:50.859
 Covalent in the sense that electrons are common. 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.945
 But, as we have just learned, 

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.277
 Polar means that these electrons are not evenly distributed. 

00:01:56.277 --> 00:01:58.938
 In water, oxygen acts negatively 

00:01:58.938 --> 00:02:01.655
 And hydrogen positively. 

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.701
 Since the positive and the negative, 

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:06.495
 Oxygen is attracted to hydrogen atoms 

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:08.149
 In nearby water molecules. 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.932
 A special type of bond is formed between water molecules, 

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.962
 Known as the Hydrogen Association. 

00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:16.770
 Hydrogen bonds do not just occur in the water as well. 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.961
 It can be formed between water molecules 

00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.470
 The polar or ionic materials are different. 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.602
 The water's ability to hold on to itself is called cohesion 

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:28.323
 While the water's ability to stick to other materials 

00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:30.560
 Called adhesion. 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.987
 Now, think again about the first questions. 

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:36.903
 First, why can some insects walk on water? 

00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:39.571
 Surface tension due to hydrogen bonding 

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.698
 Creates a thin layer on the water surface 

00:02:41.698 --> 00:02:43.159
 Give enough resistance 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.586
 To allow ultra-light insects to walk on it. 

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:46.769
 You can not walk on it 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.805
 Because hydrogen bonds are not strong enough 

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:50.545
 To keep you on the surface. 

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.918
 Why does ice float over liquid water? 

00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:54.685
 For most other materials, 

00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:57.888
 Solid state is more dense than liquid, 

00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:00.390
 But this is not the case for water! 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.599
 Hydrogen bonds keep water molecules 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.554
 Spaced further in the frozen water in the liquid. 

00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:07.518
 As far as the molecules apart, 

00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:09.773
 Reduced body density. 

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.227
 So snow is less dense than water, about 9% 

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.441
 Which means it floats at the top. 

00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:17.943
 This is why lakes freeze from top to bottom 

00:03:17.943 --> 00:03:19.861
 Aquatic life can survive 

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:21.947
 Throughout the cold winter every year. 

00:03:21.947 --> 00:03:24.656
 The polarity of the water molecule 

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:26.907
 And the resulting hydrogen bond 

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.996
 Is what gives the water its unique properties. 

00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:33.127
 So, why water is so unique, 

00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:34.440
 From inside your cells 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.877
 To the world's oceans, 

00:03:35.877 --> 00:03:40.826
 Is simply because it is a polarity molecule.
