00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.200 

the<00:00:22.510> most<00:00:22.750> interesting<00:00:23.620> thing<00:00:23.920> I<00:00:24.130> think<00:00:24.340> about

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
the most interesting thing I think about

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.320 
the most interesting thing I think about
driving<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:26.050> car<00:00:26.290> itself<00:00:26.740> obviously<00:00:27.490> it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
driving the car itself obviously it

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.630 
driving the car itself obviously it
looks<00:00:28.600> like<00:00:28.869> an<00:00:29.050> airplane<00:00:29.260> cockpit<00:00:29.860> inside

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
looks like an airplane cockpit inside

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.180 
looks like an airplane cockpit inside
there<00:00:31.030> we<00:00:31.510> had<00:00:31.720> water<00:00:31.960> gauges<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.830> know<00:00:32.980> where

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
there we had water gauges to know where

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.450 
there we had water gauges to know where
the<00:00:33.370> engines<00:00:33.790> were<00:00:33.970> which<00:00:34.690> was<00:00:35.050> a<00:00:35.430> factor<00:00:36.430> that

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
the engines were which was a factor that

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.340 
the engines were which was a factor that
we<00:00:36.730> looked<00:00:37.030> at<00:00:37.239> in<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.540> pits<00:00:37.840> whether<00:00:38.200> it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
we looked at in the pits whether it

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.470 
we looked at in the pits whether it
needed<00:00:38.680> more<00:00:38.860> water<00:00:39.100> or<00:00:39.400> not<00:00:39.550> but<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.239> oil

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
needed more water or not but the oil

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.390 
needed more water or not but the oil
pressure<00:00:40.750> gauge<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:41.410> course<00:00:41.680> tells<00:00:42.040> you<00:00:42.220> the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
pressure gauge of course tells you the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.490 
pressure gauge of course tells you the
lifeline<00:00:42.879> of<00:00:42.910> what's<00:00:43.360> going<00:00:43.720> on<00:00:43.870> with<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.200> group

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
lifeline of what's going on with a group

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.130 
lifeline of what's going on with a group
so<00:00:45.250> as<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:45.879> pulled<00:00:46.150> it<00:00:46.270> up<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.690> starting

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
so as you pulled it up to the starting

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.799 
so as you pulled it up to the starting
line<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:49.180> these<00:00:49.960> headers<00:00:50.470> coming<00:00:50.980> back<00:00:51.250> here

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
line this these headers coming back here

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.600 
line this these headers coming back here
when<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:52.960> first<00:00:53.230> let<00:00:53.530> out<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.920> clutch<00:00:54.129> and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
when you first let out the clutch and

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.030 
when you first let out the clutch and
the<00:00:54.670> smoke<00:00:55.030> come<00:00:55.360> rolling<00:00:55.750> back<00:00:56.019> it<00:00:56.440> helped

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
the smoke come rolling back it helped

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.630 
the smoke come rolling back it helped
control<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.269> slope<00:00:58.600> going<00:00:59.379> back<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.339> give<00:01:00.610> a

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
control the slope going back to give a

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.729 
control the slope going back to give a
tunnel<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:01.480> that<00:01:01.510> you<00:01:01.780> could<00:01:01.930> see<00:01:02.170> down<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.650> the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
tunnel so that you could see down in the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.460 
tunnel so that you could see down in the
middle<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.280> where<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.580> were<00:01:03.730> going<00:01:04.120> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
middle of it where you were going and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.340 
middle of it where you were going and
with<00:01:05.470> all<00:01:05.680> race<00:01:05.979> cars<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.640> fun<00:01:07.270> is<00:01:07.570> racing<00:01:08.229> to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
with all race cars the fun is racing to

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.030 
with all race cars the fun is racing to
the<00:01:08.470> finish<00:01:08.500> line<00:01:09.070> all<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.360> fun<00:01:10.630> stops<00:01:11.170> at<00:01:11.530> the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
the finish line all the fun stops at the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.610 
the finish line all the fun stops at the
finish<00:01:12.400> line<00:01:12.700> then<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.630> got<00:01:13.900> to<00:01:14.050> put<00:01:14.260> out<00:01:14.409> the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
finish line then you got to put out the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.340 
finish line then you got to put out the
parachute<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.220> get<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.820> stopped<00:01:16.240> then<00:01:17.020> we

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
parachute and get it stopped then we

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.530 
parachute and get it stopped then we
didn't<00:01:17.650> use<00:01:17.860> no<00:01:18.159> miniature<00:01:18.729> parachute<00:01:19.360> on

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
didn't use no miniature parachute on

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.490 
didn't use no miniature parachute on
this<00:01:19.840> either

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
this either

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.850 
this either
we<00:01:20.860> had<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.159> 24<00:01:22.060> foot<00:01:22.090> cargo<00:01:23.049> chute<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.620> that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
we had a 24 foot cargo chute and that

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.280 
we had a 24 foot cargo chute and that
thing<00:01:24.160> would<00:01:24.400> hit<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:24.880> hard<00:01:25.240> when<00:01:25.660> it<00:01:25.810> came<00:01:25.990> out

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
thing would hit so hard when it came out

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.160 
thing would hit so hard when it came out
it<00:01:26.890> would<00:01:27.130> pull<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.940> front<00:01:28.210> rear<00:01:28.510> wheels<00:01:28.780> off

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
it would pull the front rear wheels off

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.110 
it would pull the front rear wheels off
the<00:01:29.410> ground<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:29.950> give<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> little<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
the ground and give you a little of the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.240 
the ground and give you a little of the
wheel<00:01:31.360> barrel<00:01:31.840> effect<00:01:32.230> when<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.740> first<00:01:32.980> came

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
wheel barrel effect when it first came

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.450 
wheel barrel effect when it first came
out<00:01:33.540> okay<00:01:34.570> now<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.590> might<00:01:35.890> find<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:36.400> a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
out okay now you might find this a

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.590 
out okay now you might find this a
little<00:01:36.760> hard<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.270> believe

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
little hard to believe

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.990 
little hard to believe
but<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.170> can<00:01:38.440> actually<00:01:38.620> get<00:01:39.070> in<00:01:39.220> this<00:01:39.400> thing<00:01:39.460> I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
but I can actually get in this thing I

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.810 
but I can actually get in this thing I
tell<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.660> when<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.960> built<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.740> was<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:42.400> skinny

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
tell you when I built it I was so skinny

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.270 
tell you when I built it I was so skinny
that<00:01:43.120> they<00:01:43.630> used<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:44.110> tease<00:01:44.440> me<00:01:44.470> about<00:01:44.740> running

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
that they used to tease me about running

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.090 
that they used to tease me about running
around<00:01:45.580> in<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.030> shower<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.630> get<00:01:46.780> wet<00:01:47.110> well<00:01:47.710> I

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
around in the shower to get wet well I

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.520 
around in the shower to get wet well I
took<00:01:48.670> care<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.000> that<00:01:49.300> but<00:01:49.900> let's<00:01:50.110> give<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.380> a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
took care of that but let's give it a

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.220 
took care of that but let's give it a
try<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:51.130> see<00:01:51.190> what<00:01:51.310> happens<00:01:51.880> okay<00:01:52.330> I<00:01:52.600> always

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
try and see what happens okay I always

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.110 
try and see what happens okay I always
get<00:01:53.560> in<00:01:53.680> from<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:53.980> left<00:01:54.310> side<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.850> car

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
get in from the left side of the car

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.530 
get in from the left side of the car
because<00:01:55.900> I<00:01:55.930> crashed<00:01:56.470> real<00:01:57.040> bad<00:01:57.550> one<00:01:57.940> time<00:01:58.270> and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
because I crashed real bad one time and

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.060 
because I crashed real bad one time and
I<00:01:58.630> won't<00:01:58.900> get<00:01:59.230> in<00:01:59.380> from<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.830> right<00:02:00.040> side

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
I won't get in from the right side

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.580 
I won't get in from the right side
anymore<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.420> here<00:02:01.600> we<00:02:01.720> go<00:02:01.870> let's<00:02:02.050> give<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.410> a

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
anymore so here we go let's give it a

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.219 
anymore so here we go let's give it a
try

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.089 

now<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.119> have<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.360> do<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.920> have<00:02:12.040> to

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
now what you have to do is you have to

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.000 
now what you have to do is you have to
lay<00:02:12.400> your<00:02:12.610> foot<00:02:12.879> sideways<00:02:13.239> like<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.800> it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
lay your foot sideways like this so it

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.820 
lay your foot sideways like this so it
could<00:02:15.220> get<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.550> between<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.599> rear<00:02:16.810> end<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
could get in between the rear end and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.170 
could get in between the rear end and
out<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:19.030> slide<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.140> down<00:02:20.730> voila

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
out and slide that one down voila
