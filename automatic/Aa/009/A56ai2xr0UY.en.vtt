00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:16.410
 then a battery of 9.9 total charge 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 she is now 4.6 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 are three cells of 3 volts on average 1.5 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.990
 volts for sky but can solve if the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.990
 people observe time tester none 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.989
 load is too low then the personnel 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:47.040
 I made the mistake of leaving the battery 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:49.649
 life overload and now when I 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.059
 I try to load 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.059
 she gives me this error here 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:07.640
 she could accept some charge now 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.889
 People need to force a load 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.030
 until it reaches at least two other two 

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:16.649
 volts and a half per cell that we can 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.740
 do here since the charger does not 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.770
 accept connected in this way that people 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:31.020
 in life mode we put it in the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:34.670
 mode and let it load until it 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.670
 approximately 7 volts 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.609
 seven flights already have a little bit until eight 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.609
 others 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.580
 Okay, let's go back to the i live module. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.460
 is to change the mode mode years loading 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.810
 to marcelo 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.790
 I'm using the 12 volt source I 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.010
 I tried to charge because the battery 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.920
 that is inside the field box does not 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.310
 I was having enough strength and I 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.270
 that input voltage error like me 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.540
 I discovered this good my charger would adapt 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:27.320
 the club it comes with that cost of the alligator 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.480
 beat the banana club so he could call the 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.540
 source and I enjoyed that I have this 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.900
 alligator club and turned on my voltmeter was 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.420
 so I discovered that there is the box not 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.940
 I was having enough potential to 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.420
 charge the battery because every time you 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.550
 I called to hit him and told him to carry 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.980
 here at the last minute connected in the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.360
 low of 11 volts, consequently the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.670
 charger it 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.310
 he cut to protect the battery of the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.560
 Cashier 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.900
 so now connected at the source 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.980
 I'm able to carry my 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.980
 battery life 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.459
 there are more than ten rockets of 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.459
 charge
