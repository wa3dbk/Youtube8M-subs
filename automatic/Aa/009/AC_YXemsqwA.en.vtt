00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 all again beaver dear friends with you in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.940
 India today we talk about 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.400
 an audio recording that was recently allegedly 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 found about a purple guy like 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.969
 just lay out a video about what purple 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.590
 the guy died and these were the sounds 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.779
 and so on, I think no one is high 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.789
 listen to it again right after that me 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.750
 in the message vkontakte flew message 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.119
 about the fact that it is fake 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.640
 and Timur thanks him for it even threw off 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.070
 where did they get the sounds for this fake 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.869
 sounds were taken from the movie saw to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.880
 sorry i'll show them here not 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.800
 I can because otherwise my youtube 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 quickly report for this reason 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.079
 just believe the sounds of breaking bones and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.239
 screams are generally taken from there and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.050
 also thanks to diana for finding 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.960
 this file 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.840
 which was uploaded to file sharing 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 izalit mind was about March 5th and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.489
 is the very first place to go 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.160
 this audio file is very easy 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.899
 determine by date this is the earliest date 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.910
 so let's take a quick look at 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.399
 this file and i will prove to you that this file 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.960
 is fake immediately open right 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.000
 button on this file and see that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.070
 encrypted using the applet 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 mixcraft and now let's look at 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.049
 files that are usually in the game 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.630
 scott i took the lead phone call 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.090
 guy and so here under the inscription source 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 no inscription that is encrypted 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.500
 cattle makes these records 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.479
 in a different way than the creator of it 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.580
 fake without using the program 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.770
 mixcraft and so let's reverse 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 attention to the file format of this file 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.030
 which i took from scott this is 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.400
 file lgg format the thing is that the file 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.259
 g meadows are much more convenient to play on 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.450
 for some reason because I often him 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.579
 I see in games and now take a look at the file 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 a book that is allegedly also taken from the game 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.950
 as you can see mp3 file 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.810
 which also show a mismatch in 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 In general, for this one fact 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 say that this is fake but we will go further 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.829
 back in mixcraft and enter 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 or google and see what I expected 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.520
 mixcraft this program which 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.259
 allows you to change in some way 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.200
 audio records that is a person who 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.079
 did this fake just took a few 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.090
 put together moments from the movie saw with 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.640
 sound box from five nights at 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.670
 freddy's from somewhere took a laugh laugh and not 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.590
 found in 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.150
 but somehow he just is all 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.280
 arranged in this program 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.140
 and did not notice that this program 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.750
 leaves traces on which then 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.340
 it turned out to be elementary to determine what it is 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.770
 is nothing but 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.810
 cheating yt both seamstress well and on this 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.940
 all dear friends all thanks for 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.330
 I hope you enjoyed watching 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.330
 good luck
