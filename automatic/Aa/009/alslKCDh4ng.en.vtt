once<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:49.530> halfway<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:50.129> if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
once you have it about halfway there if

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.639 
once you have it about halfway there if

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
you could just put your hands and pry it
up<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.890> now<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> rim<00:00:53.699> underneath<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
up so now we have the rim underneath the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.479 
up so now we have the rim underneath the
tire<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> old<00:00:55.890> tube<00:00:56.100> out

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
tire we have to get the old tube out

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.150 
tire we have to get the old tube out
so<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.629> side<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> could<00:00:58.170> push<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.890> out

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
so from this side you could push it out

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.360 
so from this side you could push it out
over<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> rim<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.920> when<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
over the rim and when you have it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.910 
over the rim and when you have it
sticking<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.290> take<00:01:04.470> it

two you take your new one you take the
valve<00:01:15.720> cap<00:01:15.960> off<00:01:17.450> safety<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.869> put

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
valve cap off safety now we have to put

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.670 
valve cap off safety now we have to put
it<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.490> tire<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> making<00:01:22.530> sure

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it down into the tire so making sure

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.249 
it down into the tire so making sure
that<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.250> valve<00:01:23.640> stem<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.689> correct<00:01:25.049> way

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
that the valve stem is the correct way

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.359 
that the valve stem is the correct way
as<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.009> hole<00:01:26.810> we<00:01:27.810> start<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> work<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> tire

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
as the hole we start to work the tire

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:40.020 
as the hole we start to work the tire
into<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.240> work<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> tube<00:01:30.990> into<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> tire

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.760 

once<00:01:41.030> it's<00:01:41.240> inside<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.960> tire<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.530> have<00:01:42.590> to

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
once it's inside the tire you have to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.610 
once it's inside the tire you have to
get<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.010> around<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.910> rim<00:01:44.120> so<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.200> just<00:01:45.350> take

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
get it around the rim so you just take

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.640 
get it around the rim so you just take
it<00:01:45.830> use<00:01:46.010> your<00:01:46.130> fingers<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.260> just<00:01:48.410> push

it use your fingers and you just push

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.520 
it use your fingers and you just push
the<00:01:48.800> tube<00:01:49.040> all<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.550> way<00:01:49.850> around<00:01:52.120> now<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:54.290> take

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
the tube all the way around now you take

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.130 
the tube all the way around now you take
that<00:01:54.830> hole<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.210> like<00:01:56.420> line<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.780> up<00:01:56.990> with

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
that hole and you like line it up with

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.050 
that hole and you like line it up with
your<00:01:57.200> valve<00:01:57.530> stem<00:01:57.650> so<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.610> line<00:01:58.790> up<00:01:58.820> your

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
your valve stem so you line up your

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.120 
your valve stem so you line up your
valve<00:01:59.270> stem<00:01:59.360> like<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.900> you<00:02:00.560> push<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.950> through

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
valve stem like that you push it through

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.270 
valve stem like that you push it through
and<00:02:01.430> now<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:02.150> have<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.510> get<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:03.620> tire<00:02:03.860> back

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
and now we have to get the tire back

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.280 
and now we have to get the tire back
onto<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.670> rim<00:02:04.760> so<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.630> take<00:02:05.900> your<00:02:05.930> blunt

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
onto the rim so you take your blunt

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.669 
onto the rim so you take your blunt
object<00:02:06.740> again<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.400> use<00:02:07.580> it<00:02:07.760> as<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.880> lever<00:02:08.240> to

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
object again you use it as a lever to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.150 
object again you use it as a lever to
move<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.860> around<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.900> then<00:02:11.900> take<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.380> to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
move it around and then take that to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.100 
move it around and then take that to
this<00:02:13.280> position<00:02:13.490> once<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:13.970> have<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.240> here<00:02:14.510> best

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
this position once you have it here best

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.110 
this position once you have it here best
thing<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.740> do<00:02:15.950> use<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> little<00:02:16.700> bit<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.820> force

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
thing is to do use a little bit of force

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.030 
thing is to do use a little bit of force
and<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.990> push<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.380> both<00:02:18.560> sides<00:02:18.890> evenly<00:02:21.040> and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
and you push it on both sides evenly and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.920 
and you push it on both sides evenly and
that<00:02:22.280> time<00:02:22.910> we'll<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.330> goes<00:02:25.450> right<00:02:26.450> there<00:02:26.720> on

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
that time we'll just goes right there on

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.260 
that time we'll just goes right there on
the<00:02:27.050> rim<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:28.040> now<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.489> the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
the rim like that so now you have the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.590 
the rim like that so now you have the
tube<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> rim<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.560> tire<00:02:30.770> on<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.100> rim<00:02:31.250> if

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
tube on the rim the tire on the rim if

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.060 
tube on the rim the tire on the rim if
they<00:02:32.600> squeeze<00:02:32.930> here<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.500> push<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.920> little

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
they squeeze here to push that little

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.880 
they squeeze here to push that little
nozzle<00:02:34.280> up<00:02:34.930> maybe<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.110> could<00:02:36.230> easily<00:02:36.320> use<00:02:36.530> a

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
nozzle up maybe you could easily use a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.699 
nozzle up maybe you could easily use a
foot<00:02:37.489> pump<00:02:37.670> or<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:38.000> hand<00:02:38.480> pump<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:39.320> inflate<00:02:39.440> it

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
foot pump or a hand pump to inflate it

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.850 
foot pump or a hand pump to inflate it
to<00:02:39.830> 30<00:02:40.160> psi<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.350> side<00:02:42.530> of<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.709> tire

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
to 30 psi so on the side of the tire

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.900 
to 30 psi so on the side of the tire
here<00:02:43.100> you'll<00:02:43.250> see<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.489> manufacturers

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
here you'll see the manufacturers

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.250 
here you'll see the manufacturers
recommended<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.690> 30<00:02:45.260> psi<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.780> we'll<00:02:47.959> attach

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
recommended is to 30 psi so we'll attach

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.509 
recommended is to 30 psi so we'll attach
the<00:02:48.530> nozzle<00:02:48.680> here<00:02:49.120> clamp<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.269> down<00:02:50.300> into<00:02:50.630> place

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
the nozzle here clamp it down into place

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:04.180 
the nozzle here clamp it down into place
and<00:02:52.519> we<00:02:52.640> start<00:02:52.880> pulsing<00:03:02.709> all<00:03:03.709> right<00:03:03.830> so<00:03:04.070> you

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
and we start pulsing all right so you

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.830 
and we start pulsing all right so you
see<00:03:04.370> here<00:03:04.640> we<00:03:04.910> have<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.060> around<00:03:05.299> 30<00:03:05.930> psi<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:07.840> just

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
see here we have it around 30 psi I just

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.940 
see here we have it around 30 psi I just
detach<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.440> nozzle<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.890> get<00:03:13.070> our<00:03:13.220> cap<00:03:14.950> screw

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
detach the nozzle you get our cap screw

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.340 
detach the nozzle you get our cap screw
that<00:03:16.070> on<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.670> now<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.030> have<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.330> ready<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.049> go
