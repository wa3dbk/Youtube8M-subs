will<00:00:33.510> give<00:00:33.809> store<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.260> still<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.800> you're

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
will give store but still if you're

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
line with this pistol I think the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.150 
line with this pistol I think the
reference<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> Wikipedia<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.920> fun

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
reference in the Wikipedia is really fun

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.660 
reference in the Wikipedia is really fun
yeah<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.360> pistol<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.320> strong<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:52.980> there

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
yeah the pistol is very strong but there

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
yeah the pistol is very strong but there
is<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> lack<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> elephants<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.289> kill<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.770> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
is a lack of elephants to kill with this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
is a lack of elephants to kill with this
pistol<00:00:56.390> anyway<00:00:57.390> let's<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> look<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.109> this

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
pistol anyway let's take a look at this

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:28.580 
pistol anyway let's take a look at this
pistol<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.680> action<00:00:59.070> against<00:00:59.460> zombies

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.930 

one<00:01:29.590> really<00:01:29.920> strange<00:01:30.250> thing<00:01:30.520> about<00:01:30.640> this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
one really strange thing about this

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.350 
one really strange thing about this
pistol<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.980> despite<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.820> really<00:01:34.180> high

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
pistol is that despite the really high

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.920 
pistol is that despite the really high
damage<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:36.190> recoil<00:01:36.820> is<00:01:36.970> very<00:01:37.390> easy<00:01:37.690> to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
damage the recoil is very easy to

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.219 
damage the recoil is very easy to
control<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.610> sometimes<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.210> may<00:01:40.450> not<00:01:40.990> even

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
control so sometimes you may not even

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.219 
control so sometimes you may not even
notice<00:01:41.590> how<00:01:42.130> powerful<00:01:42.790> this<00:01:43.060> or<00:01:43.270> remember<00:01:44.020> our

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
notice how powerful this or remember our

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.880 
notice how powerful this or remember our
powerful<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:45.040> revolver<00:01:45.970> ease<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:47.020> one

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
powerful this revolver ease and one

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.370 
powerful this revolver ease and one
problem<00:01:48.190> maybe<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.910> fact<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:50.110> have<00:01:50.350> a

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
problem maybe the fact that you have a

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.820 
problem maybe the fact that you have a
limited<00:01:51.040> magazine<00:01:51.700> five<00:01:52.360> round<00:01:52.690> magazine<00:01:53.290> but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
limited magazine five round magazine but

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.100 
limited magazine five round magazine but
taking<00:01:54.100> mind<00:01:54.310> from<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.820> spy<00:01:55.210> shots<00:01:55.570> on<00:01:55.869> one

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
taking mind from the spy shots on one

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.219 
taking mind from the spy shots on one
shot<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:57.100> not<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.729> kill<00:01:58.000> somebody<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:58.960> if<00:01:59.080> you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
shot is not to kill somebody so if you

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.020 
shot is not to kill somebody so if you
are<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.320> good<00:01:59.560> shot<00:01:59.830> if<00:02:00.040> you<00:02:00.070> take<00:02:00.490> your<00:02:00.700> time

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
are a good shot if you take your time

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.750 
are a good shot if you take your time
before<00:02:01.300> shooting<00:02:02.200> if<00:02:03.010> you're<00:02:03.280> fast<00:02:03.580> enough

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
before shooting if you're fast enough

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.090 
before shooting if you're fast enough
you<00:02:03.940> can<00:02:04.330> be<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.540> cowboy<00:02:05.140> on<00:02:05.410> breaking<00:02:05.830> point
