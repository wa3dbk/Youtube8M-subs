00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.880
 hello hello I would like to talk to you about the system of opening the system 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.400
 opening for me also very important on knives especially on 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.649
 the static rapeseed 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:15.710
 you have to be comfortable 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.080
 you must know that the majority of knives for you have them in hand 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.200
 when you're using a knife in action when you're military the 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.560
 law enforcement we often have a cluttered disclaimer tristan something 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:29.039
 we are just waiting to open the knife of only one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.669
 so it's true you have to think that there are big 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.670
 according to the units so my request 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.010
 for me the fastest and most efficient Belgian system and the 6 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.620
 February that these people 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.620
 we are on a very fast brenneman system 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.370
 right out of poverty extracting the knife from the pocket 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.140
 we had a little shot with macky locked open and that operational 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.350
 we know very well 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.480
 for example automatic systems but we are sure of fishing and 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.750
 social protection the auto system certainly the opening system 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.310
 fast the most extensive and the most famous washington cost the life 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.440
 you have a ride 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.000
 what do you say you take out a cover 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.930
 as if out of the pocket 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.190
 which is closed and by simple pressure fear 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.640
 Discovery 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.600
 and we paid 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.570
 waxman 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.430
 it's past this fastest time today 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.210
 it's a safe system but it does not matter 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.820
 now between a car system 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 Amazing the two systems of law 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.850
 at the opening assist 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.049
 quick opening we can see in this summer I really do not see any 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.640
 difference in terms of comfort it's the same 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.810
 instead of just a push of a button 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.680
 you have 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.800
 a pressure to do on ppr 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 here you have a personal account 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.140
 good step forward for me 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.040
 these two flagship products 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040
 I know too much that I think in any case not really different 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.480
 we 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.740
 from earlier in quick opening 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.010
 so really effective always asthmatics 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.030
 but the same 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.400
 we are approaching 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.550
 and it's part of it is the same quick access system but it's not 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.109
 the fastest 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.059
 for me the fastest 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.389
 it is there because you know who it is a system is like a big 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.230
 majority of potters the room 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.139
 we can also find if it's true 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.560
 at aeg figaro on the delicate model honduras is a management mode 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.080
 so we had the relief you grabbed the handle is right there 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.080
 you enter frankly and sincerely it's gone you have a personal account 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.949
 at the level of guinea 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.899
 you can do any case what you want the system will remain 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.099
 necessarily the fastest 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.099
 knife has published his plans 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.169
 when I told you, 'I have the only one who can 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.109
 good on 6 then 6 10 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.370
 the opening system was extremely fast 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.249
 polanski on these qc ca 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.249
 the cqcd people got the baby 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.849
 the system is still as important to develop 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.399
 but in comparison 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.399
 for example on their way 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.160
 you'll see 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.399
 on their way the systems to establish a little bit more shortcuts 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.049
 but what makes one 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.789
 the system 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:18.969
 which is a little less effective, that is to say on hot about ten 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.009
 of 2de extractions from the pocket knife 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.009
 you may be beating 3 or 4 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:27.579
 due to the fact that the system had been shortened 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.949
 and speak in comparison 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.949
 if you take 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.529
 6 ft. 4 in. honduras has been witnessed much more 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.139
 so the review success to 100% of his lawyer out pocket 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.959
 and even I would say a little too easy that is to say that you have the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.959
 possibility by advancing 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.429
 today 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:04:00.849
 you have a possibility with the cqc 10 for example system 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.579
 other concern for justice 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.759
 two get out the pole as well running 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.349
 see my father operational 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 with a pocket extraction 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.069
 in recent years in orford 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.010
 slightly 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.569
 where he is at his approach 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.169
 quite simply 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.659
 to the amount you must not 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.929
 it's true if it was just right it's a bit early for the internee so 

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:28.580
 it is perfect it is also reassuring the departmental 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.080
 without having to open 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.669
 and now if you have a doubled with you are you are a little 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 conclusive spaces you can also take it out of the world 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.039
 and so there a turn at the point of lyon 2 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.210
 the system 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.560
 where can we see on their way will be addressed to them a little bit 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.389
 more difficult 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.349
 in the sense of towers 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.059
 the system is a little slower 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.939
 we do not have this version 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.800
 we have a small margin each time 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.819
 there it works 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.639
 on the ejection system back 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.639
 on a system 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.400
 it's dangerous 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.639
 It's used for 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.480
 so for me on their way the system where she left little too 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.120
 short 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.839
 a little bit too short 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.839
 so that without problem 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.080
 on the budget without trace either on the drug on the job one has a 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.400
 dream system that's pretty important enough pronounced 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 so we'll see 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.800
 he did the cycle 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.379
 whether it is 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:38.379
 nothing will happen 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.490
 vertical space 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.929
 you can even have fun gold on the baguette it jumps anyway 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.119
 these five easy years paradox there is a small danger the fact that it is 

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.990
 as pronounced 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.619
 if you have if for example you are sitting 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:56.749
 in a sitting position 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.639
 noting that the opposition 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.180
 these would be assembled in manama center it was extremely 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.129
 difficult 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.439
 basque the project precisely the system tends to believe in its quality a 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.589
 megaphone and so there 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:12.129
 they will pay for equipped in 2009 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.960
 a series of films that we conclude a little bit the board 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.349
 you can indeed around 40 years old ok 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:20.389
 so the Algerian system on 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.800
 it is for me the fastest system the most efficient 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.139
 something to fault you get you to fool that it's very 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.710
 very quickly 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.830
 but Germany would not agree or later 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.419
 for me this sector 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.030
 the top of the top opening very very fast
