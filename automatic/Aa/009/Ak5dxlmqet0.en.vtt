00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.679
 according to data from mp rails around 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.080
 of 7.7 million passengers are 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.389
 transported daily on rails 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 in brazil without considering those who 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.480
 touring the tourist trains and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.880
 cultural 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.250
 the expectation is that the initiatives in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.619
 phase of study or already under way in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.080
 around this type of transport in the country and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.910
 already has about 85 billion 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.669
 investments in brazil in the coming 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.309
 comprising five years since lines 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.070
 subway regional and metropolitan trains 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.340
 even monorails and so-called vehicles 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.649
 light on tracks the vlts 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.690
 focusing on this growth potential 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.570
 alstom recently presented to the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.200
 global market a new solution in subway 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.230
 Light 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.280
 axn sony axn sony your system 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.550
 Turnkey Transports 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.800
 based on the light subway built into 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.250
 latest technologies available for 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.350
 each subsystem and able to carry 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.900
 up to 45 thousand people per hour per direction 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 axn sony allows the use of structures 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 prefabricated by lowering the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.869
 construction of the project for only three 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.360
 or four years 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.299
 the cost of operation and maintenance is 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.210
 estimated at around 20% below cost 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.950
 of the monorail system in addition the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.070
 system allows change of supplier 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.409
 trains in future upgrades will not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.750
 leaving arrested the company of which it bought 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.060
 the system at the beginning to the large 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.590
 Brazilian cities a product that is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.640
 very well adapted 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.020
 I am the axon sony with viaducts because the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.710
 viaduct that was developed maybe 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.930
 I used to go light anyway so I 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.490
 easy to build faster and this 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.810
 explains why we are not talking about 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.009
 three to four years 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.009
 buildings
