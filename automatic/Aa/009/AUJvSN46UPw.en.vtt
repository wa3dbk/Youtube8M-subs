00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.870 
want to close out of that and it should
pop<00:03:19.860> up<00:03:20.340> right<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.610> when

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
pop up right here just like that when

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.820 
pop up right here just like that when
you<00:03:24.090> open<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.540> up<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:28.310> there<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.940> go<00:03:30.830> 124

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
you open this up and there we go 124

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.260 
you open this up and there we go 124
million<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.340> didn't<00:03:32.550> get<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> slash<00:03:32.970> right

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
million it didn't get the slash right

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.180 
million it didn't get the slash right
but<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> guess<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:33.900> makes<00:03:34.050> sense<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.070> guys

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.350 
but I guess that makes sense so you guys
can<00:03:35.310> play<00:03:35.430> around<00:03:35.610> with<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.330> a

can play around with this this is a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.729 
can play around with this this is a
pretty<00:03:36.630> cool<00:03:36.810> mod<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.140> don't<00:03:37.410> know<00:03:37.530> why<00:03:37.680> you
