00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.100
 What is the flame of the candle really? 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.080
 I am at the Discovery Palace in Paris to do an experiment 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.080
 The answers are beautifully illustrated. 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.500
 Well, so we're running an electric field here, 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.580
 To see how the flames spread. 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.380
 So very nice. 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.500
 It's like a butterfly. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.060
 You can see that the flame is there 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.180
 Two separate parts now. 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 Someone is moving towards the negative plate. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.720
 These will be positive ions, 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.580
 Negative ions will move towards the positively charged plate. 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.740
 Therefore, we see that the flame is flat or flat. 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.080
 But if that does not convince you, 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.700
 That the flame contains ions, 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.480
 Examine the second part of our experience, 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.080
 Where we compare the conductivity of rays 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.940
 To air conductivity, 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.860
 Which are usually very good isolation. 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.740
 Which requires approximately 10,000 volts 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740
 To break one centimeter of air. 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.120
 So far this plate requires approximately 20,000 volts. 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.640
 You may see that spark a few, 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.660
 But if you put it around the flames, 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.820
 We'll see if we can get a bigger spark. 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.780
 See for that, Yah! 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.120
 Because the flame contains ions inside it, 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.520
 That means we can dismantle 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.280
 The largest distance from the air. 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.640
 This conductivity is large. 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.520
 It's a great! I loved this experience, right? 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.260
 The electric field can be strong enough 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.280
 To actually extinguish the flame 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120
 But watch carefully what happens when the flame comes out. 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.540
 Just as in flame, 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.580
 Reverse charges in smoke are withdrawn in opposite directions. 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.280
 Some may argue that the torch 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.500
 It's not really plasma because it's not hot enough, 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.660
 And does not have enough high density of ions, 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.640
 But one thing is certain, that it contains ions 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.700
 Which has important electrical properties, 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.560
 Which can be installed, if your electric field is strong enough. 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.560
