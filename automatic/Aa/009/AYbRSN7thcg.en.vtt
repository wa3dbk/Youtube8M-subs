in our mirror as well and that is of

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.099 
in our mirror as well and that is of
course<00:00:14.460> where<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.639> started<00:00:15.179> playing<00:00:15.450> planets

course where I started playing planets

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.620 
course where I started playing planets
at<00:00:16.289> Q<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.220> I've<00:00:17.609> been<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> bit<00:00:18.060> curious<00:00:18.359> about

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
at Q and I've been a bit curious about

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.830 
at Q and I've been a bit curious about
the<00:00:18.810> river<00:00:19.020> lately<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.210> that's<00:00:21.210> one<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> the

the river lately so that's one of the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.929 
the river lately so that's one of the
main<00:00:22.109> reasons<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> why<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.130> are<00:00:23.340> playing<00:00:23.640> here

may not know the heart of the river or

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.209 
may not know the heart of the river or
actually<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> wall<00:00:36.570> nce<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.380> vehicles<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.950> seems

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
actually a wall nce of vehicles it seems

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.910 
actually a wall nce of vehicles it seems
has<00:00:38.730> been<00:00:39.149> changed<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> much<00:00:40.710> more

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
past I have been ranting quite a lot on

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.310 
past I have been ranting quite a lot on
the<00:00:51.600> river<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.530> has<00:00:52.860> been<00:00:54.020> changed<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.140> lot

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the river it has been changed a lot

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.260 
the river it has been changed a lot
throughout<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> patches<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.940> river<00:00:57.149> I'm

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
throughout the patches and the river I'm

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
throughout the patches and the river I'm
flying<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:58.980> any<00:00:59.100> way

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
flying right now is not in any way

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.270 
flying right now is not in any way
similar<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.329> how<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> river<00:01:00.930> was<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.530> let's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
similar to how the river was like let's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.399 
similar to how the river was like let's
say<00:01:02.430> six<00:01:02.699> months<00:01:02.969> ago<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.300> somesuch<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:04.229> one

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
say six months ago or somesuch now one

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.070 
say six months ago or somesuch now one
of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> major<00:01:05.180> advantages<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> river<00:01:06.810> has

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
of the major advantages of the river has

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.160 
of the major advantages of the river has
always<00:01:07.290> been<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.369> damage<00:01:08.729> output<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.869> goes

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
always been the damage output this goes

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.010 
always been the damage output this goes
for<00:01:10.500> both<00:01:10.670> rotary<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.479> rocket<00:01:12.810> pods

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
for both rotary and the rocket pods

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
for both rotary and the rocket pods
which<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:13.860> using<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.850> right<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.210> I'm

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360

which is what I'm using or right now I'm
flying<00:01:15.630> without<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.530> rocket<00:01:16.770> pods<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.070> using

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
flying without the rocket pods on using

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:28.349 
flying without the rocket pods on using
the<00:01:17.460> fuel<00:01:17.670> parts<00:01:17.939> instead

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.569

die
is<00:01:35.000> supposed<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.109> be<00:01:36.259> changed<00:01:36.770> as<00:01:37.429> far<00:01:37.640> as<00:01:37.759> I

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
is supposed to be changed as far as I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.410 
is supposed to be changed as far as I
know<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.409> it's<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.700> tactics<00:01:40.700> that<00:01:40.939> has<00:01:41.209> been

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
know and it's a tactics that has been

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.359 
know and it's a tactics that has been
used<00:01:41.569> by<00:01:41.750> some<00:01:41.810> players<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.679> just<00:01:43.069> make<00:01:43.219> sure

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
used by some players to just make sure

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.309 
used by some players to just make sure
that<00:01:43.399> they<00:01:43.670> keep<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.299> higher<00:01:44.569> KD<00:01:44.929> than<00:01:45.200> they

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
that they keep a higher KD than they

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.590 
that they keep a higher KD than they
actually<00:01:45.530> should<00:01:46.100> have<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:47.149> think<00:01:47.390> it's

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
actually should have and I think it's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.599 
actually should have and I think it's
actually<00:01:47.750> only<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.229> very<00:01:48.619> few<00:01:48.709> amount<00:01:49.429> of

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
actually only a very few amount of

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.819 
actually only a very few amount of
players<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.170> systematically<00:01:51.170> are<00:01:51.439> using

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
players that systematically are using

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.639 
players that systematically are using
these<00:01:51.950> tactics<00:01:52.509> cause<00:01:53.509> obviously<00:01:53.959> to<00:01:54.439> some

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
these tactics cause obviously to some

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.979 
these tactics cause obviously to some
players<00:01:54.829> publish<00:01:55.610> statistics<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:56.299> really

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:56.989 
players publish statistics is really

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:03.959 
players publish statistics is really
important

was<00:02:59.609> actually<00:02:59.879> a<00:02:59.909> bit<00:03:00.030> lucky<00:03:00.359> this<00:03:00.719> guy<00:03:00.840> Dennis

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
was actually a bit lucky this guy Dennis

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.379 
was actually a bit lucky this guy Dennis
Bjorn<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.129> think<00:03:02.340> his<00:03:02.430> name<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.579> was<00:03:03.060> actually

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
Bjorn I think his name is was actually

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.679 
Bjorn I think his name is was actually
typing<00:03:03.930> when<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.349> engaged<00:03:04.799> him<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:06.150> got<00:03:06.659> a

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
typing when I engaged him and I got a

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.809 
typing when I engaged him and I got a
good<00:03:06.930> jump<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.409> him<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.680> it's<00:03:08.430> kind<00:03:08.609> of<00:03:08.669> cool

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
good jump on him up it's kind of cool

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.030 
good jump on him up it's kind of cool
that<00:03:08.849> he<00:03:09.239> still<00:03:09.780> tried<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.169> take<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.829> fight

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
that he still tried to take the fight

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.520 
that he still tried to take the fight
even<00:03:11.069> though<00:03:11.459> he<00:03:11.760> had<00:03:12.359> a<00:03:12.389> very<00:03:12.659> bad<00:03:12.870> engagement

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
even though he had a very bad engagement

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.770 
even though he had a very bad engagement
unlike<00:03:14.069> other<00:03:14.280> pilots<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:15.000> would<00:03:15.389> only

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
unlike other pilots that would only

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.929 
unlike other pilots that would only
engage<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:17.040> they<00:03:17.459> have<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.639> clear

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
engage you if they have a clear

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.959 
engage you if they have a clear
advantage<00:03:18.109> otherwise<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.889> mail<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.609> log

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:20.969 
advantage otherwise it is mail and log

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:34.530 
advantage otherwise it is mail and log
off

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.940 

yeah<00:03:35.540> I'm<00:03:35.750> trying<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.140> take<00:03:36.319> calm<00:03:36.560> down<00:03:36.739> that's

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
yeah I'm trying to take calm down that's

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:46.839 
yeah I'm trying to take calm down that's
behind<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:43.420> yeah<00:03:44.420> your<00:03:44.780> darlin<00:03:45.110> being<00:03:45.849> the

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
behind you yeah your darlin being the

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.430 
behind you yeah your darlin being the
thing<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.209> have<00:03:47.390> always<00:03:47.540> considered<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
thing that I have always considered the

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.320 
thing that I have always considered the
strength<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.129> the<00:03:49.430> most<00:03:49.640> compared<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.209> the

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
strength of the most compared to the

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.050 
strength of the most compared to the
river<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:50.780> its<00:03:51.110> speed<00:03:51.860> maneuverability<00:03:52.790> and

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
river is its speed maneuverability and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
river is its speed maneuverability and
it<00:03:53.930> gives<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.650> mosquito<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.750> greater<00:03:56.750> chance

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
it gives the mosquito a greater chance

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.330 
it gives the mosquito a greater chance
to<00:03:57.349> escape<00:03:57.739> in<00:03:58.629> critical<00:03:59.629> situations<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.440> it

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
to escape in critical situations and it

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.990 
to escape in critical situations and it
also<00:04:01.810> means<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:03.019> it<00:04:03.349> is<00:04:03.980> less<00:04:04.519> likely<00:04:04.549> that

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
also means that it is less likely that

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.229 
also means that it is less likely that
you<00:04:05.239> take<00:04:05.450> damage<00:04:05.690> from<00:04:06.519> flak<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:07.879> some<00:04:08.060> such

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
you take damage from flak and some such

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.319 
you take damage from flak and some such
the<00:04:09.079> smaller<00:04:09.489> hitbox<00:04:10.489> of<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.790> mosquito

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
the smaller hitbox of the mosquito

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.690 
the smaller hitbox of the mosquito
compared<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.840> river<00:04:12.079> is<00:04:12.709> of<00:04:13.069> course<00:04:13.310> one

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
compared to the river is of course one

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.719 
compared to the river is of course one
of<00:04:13.730> its<00:04:14.000> advantages<00:04:14.359> and<00:04:15.019> that<00:04:15.620> goes<00:04:15.799> for<00:04:16.100> one

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
of its advantages and that goes for one

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.240 
of its advantages and that goes for one
versus<00:04:17.060> one<00:04:17.090> air<00:04:17.660> combat<00:04:18.049> as<00:04:18.199> well<00:04:18.229> but<00:04:18.949> the

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
versus one air combat as well but the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.879 
versus one air combat as well but the
damage<00:04:19.549> output<00:04:19.760> of<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.180> river<00:04:20.570> is<00:04:20.840> clearly<00:04:21.769> a

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
damage output of the river is clearly a

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.860 
damage output of the river is clearly a
lot<00:04:22.160> stronger<00:04:22.550> than<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:23.270> bond<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.780> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
lot stronger than the bond of the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.710 
lot stronger than the bond of the
mosquito<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:25.550> probably<00:04:26.150> evens<00:04:26.479> it<00:04:26.600> out

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
mosquito and this probably evens it out

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.800 
mosquito and this probably evens it out
or<00:04:27.080> in<00:04:27.530> many<00:04:27.949> situations<00:04:28.520> this<00:04:29.180> actually

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
or in many situations this actually

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.869 
or in many situations this actually
favors<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.350> river

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.609 

I'm<00:04:34.839> being<00:04:35.169> gangbanged<00:04:35.649> here<00:04:36.689> right<00:04:37.689> Camila

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:38.619 
I'm being gangbanged here right Camila

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:40.469 
I'm being gangbanged here right Camila
I'm<00:04:38.830> going<00:04:39.159> to<00:04:39.279> have<00:04:39.399> some<00:04:39.639> 135th<00:04:40.240> once

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
I'm going to have some 135th once

00:04:40.479 --> 00:05:14.189 
I'm going to have some 135th once
against<00:04:40.839> a<00:04:40.959> goose<00:04:41.319> oh<00:04:41.999> yeah

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.779 

so<00:05:15.199> during<00:05:15.379> this<00:05:15.590> gameplay<00:05:15.860> we<00:05:16.159> decided<00:05:16.699> to

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
so during this gameplay we decided to

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.610 
so during this gameplay we decided to
try<00:05:16.909> to<00:05:16.940> stick<00:05:17.180> together<00:05:17.300> because<00:05:18.199> we<00:05:18.470> know

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
try to stick together because we know

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.740 
try to stick together because we know
that<00:05:18.650> going<00:05:19.340> against<00:05:19.669> PR<00:05:19.940> we<00:05:20.150> are<00:05:20.270> most<00:05:20.539> likely

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
that going against PR we are most likely

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.600 
that going against PR we are most likely
going<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.080> be<00:05:21.169> outnumbered<00:05:21.349> no<00:05:22.190> matter<00:05:22.370> what

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
going to be outnumbered no matter what

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.330 
going to be outnumbered no matter what
and<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.930> worked<00:05:24.139> out<00:05:24.259> pretty<00:05:24.319> fine<00:05:24.680> we<00:05:25.129> had<00:05:25.310> a

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
and it worked out pretty fine we had a

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.939 
and it worked out pretty fine we had a
pretty<00:05:25.819> decent<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.479> teamwork<00:05:26.870> going<00:05:27.050> we

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
pretty decent the teamwork going we

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.399 
pretty decent the teamwork going we
didn't<00:05:28.729> crash<00:05:28.940> into<00:05:29.210> one<00:05:29.300> another<00:05:29.539> too<00:05:29.930> much<00:05:30.139> I

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
didn't crash into one another too much I

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.260 
didn't crash into one another too much I
