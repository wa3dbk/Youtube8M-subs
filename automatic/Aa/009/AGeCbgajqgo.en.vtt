 Latent cycle work 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.180
 Everyone has a pattern programmed into the latent cycle 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.909
 But I do not notice the pattern 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.310
 However, it only changed 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.650
 Only the other party has changed 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.370
 In fact, I always go around the same place 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.750
