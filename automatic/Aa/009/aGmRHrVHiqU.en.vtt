00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.999 
the day what did you and the goal line
set<00:01:44.150> would<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.360> see<00:01:44.540> how<00:01:44.750> dolphins<00:01:44.990> like<00:01:45.409> Lane

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
set would you see how dolphins like Lane

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.139 
set would you see how dolphins like Lane
said<00:01:46.250> offensive<00:01:46.610> line<00:01:46.759> did<00:01:46.909> really<00:01:47.060> well

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
said offensive line did really well

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.810 
said offensive line did really well
today<00:01:47.270> they<00:01:48.049> did<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.680> think<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.490> know<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
today they did and I think you know the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.789 
today they did and I think you know the
defense<00:01:50.570> had<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> little<00:01:51.079> bit<00:01:51.290> of<00:01:51.320> an<00:01:51.470> edge<00:01:51.590> at

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
defense had a little bit of an edge at

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.139 
defense had a little bit of an edge at
the<00:01:51.860> beginning<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.610> then<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.820> think<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
the beginning and then I think the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.359 
the beginning and then I think the
offensive<00:01:53.630> line<00:01:53.659> came<00:01:54.439> back<00:01:54.649> got<00:01:54.860> some<00:01:55.100> you

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
offensive line came back got some you

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.910 
offensive line came back got some you
know<00:01:55.399> good<00:01:55.670> seems<00:01:56.000> for<00:01:56.329> for<00:01:57.110> Justin<00:01:57.439> Davison

Williams<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.209> they're<00:02:14.360> going<00:02:14.480> with<00:02:14.629> five

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930

defensive tackles across and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.550 
defensive tackles across and
so<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.970> gives<00:02:17.180> him<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.170> think<00:02:18.410> they

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
that was a little difficult you know at

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.240 
that was a little difficult you know at

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
the beginning for the offensive line to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.759 
the beginning for the offensive line to
handle<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:23.629> you<00:02:24.230> know<00:02:24.260> they<00:02:24.379> kind<00:02:24.650> of

people<00:02:58.400> i<00:02:58.459> think<00:02:58.489> are<00:02:58.849> thinking<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.470> by<00:03:00.470> you

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
people i think are thinking it by you

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.800

know<00:03:01.310> rehabbing<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.209> taking<00:03:02.540> really<00:03:02.690> good

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
know rehabbing it and taking really good

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.190 
know rehabbing it and taking really good
care<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.790> he<00:03:05.209> might<00:03:05.390> be<00:03:05.510> better<00:03:05.660> off<00:03:05.780> I

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
care of it that he might be better off I

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.650 
care of it that he might be better off I
think<00:03:06.400> Demetrius<00:03:07.400> felt<00:03:07.640> like<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.390> would<00:03:08.510> be

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
think Demetrius felt like it would be

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.720 
think Demetrius felt like it would be
such<00:03:08.989> a<00:03:09.019> setback<00:03:09.380> if<00:03:09.739> he<00:03:09.860> had<00:03:09.980> surgery<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.610> he

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
such a setback if he had surgery and he

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.300 
such a setback if he had surgery and he
was<00:03:10.849> out<00:03:11.030> for<00:03:11.060> all<00:03:11.390> those<00:03:11.599> months<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.560> next

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
was out for all those months that next

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.580 
was out for all those months that next
year<00:03:13.459> would<00:03:13.579> really<00:03:13.910> be<00:03:14.030> in<00:03:14.150> doubt<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:15.410> he

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
year would really be in doubt and so he

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.920 
year would really be in doubt and so he
did<00:03:15.620> take<00:03:16.010> off<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.670> know<00:03:16.819> he<00:03:17.180> basically<00:03:17.480> took

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
did take off you know he basically took

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.660 
did take off you know he basically took
a<00:03:17.989> week<00:03:18.230> off<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.680> came<00:03:18.829> back<00:03:18.890> today<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.579> he

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
a week off and came back today and he

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.270 
a week off and came back today and he
felt<00:03:19.940> just<00:03:20.569> great<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:21.019> mean<00:03:21.200> he<00:03:21.290> looked<00:03:21.590> good<00:03:21.799> it

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
felt just great I mean he looked good it

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.710 
felt just great I mean he looked good it
was<00:03:22.430> out<00:03:22.549> there<00:03:22.730> with<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.940> first<00:03:23.150> team<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:23.630> he

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
was out there with the first team and he

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.569 
was out there with the first team and he
I<00:03:23.930> think<00:03:24.290> he<00:03:24.350> feels<00:03:24.620> like<00:03:24.920> he<00:03:25.130> made<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.430> right

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
I think he feels like he made the right

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.699 
I think he feels like he made the right
