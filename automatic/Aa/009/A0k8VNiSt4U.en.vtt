00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
they do have they did a little bit of

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.840 
they do have they did a little bit of
enhancement<00:03:15.050> tweaks<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.550> exhaust

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
enhancement tweaks to like the exhaust

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.710 
enhancement tweaks to like the exhaust
system<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.980> few<00:03:19.640> little<00:03:19.910> performance<00:03:20.390> bugs

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
system and a few little performance bugs

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.230

you<00:03:21.050> know<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.320> kind<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.500> stuff<00:03:21.710> and<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.670> mean<00:03:23.210> I

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
you know that kind of stuff and I mean I

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.070 
you know that kind of stuff and I mean I
guess<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.960> basa<00:03:24.710> are<00:03:25.100> from<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.550> 2009<00:03:26.180> year

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
guess that basa are from the 2009 year

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.130 
guess that basa are from the 2009 year
they<00:03:27.940> bumped<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.210> MSRP<00:03:29.990> price<00:03:30.730> up<00:03:31.730> like

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
they bumped the MSRP price up like

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
twelve or fourteen hundred dollars which

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.140 
twelve or fourteen hundred dollars which
I<00:03:35.810> mean<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.470> course<00:03:36.590> there's<00:03:37.430> been<00:03:37.490> inflation

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
I mean of course there's been inflation

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.870 
I mean of course there's been inflation
since<00:03:38.360> 2009<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:39.020> little<00:03:39.320> bit<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:39.770> I<00:03:39.980> mean

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
since 2009 a little bit but I mean

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.210 
since 2009 a little bit but I mean
there's<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.840> few<00:03:42.140> enhancements<00:03:42.260> there<00:03:43.130> are

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
there's a few enhancements there are

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.130 
there's a few enhancements there are
performance<00:03:43.670> enhancements<00:03:44.180> but<00:03:44.360> Jesus

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
performance enhancements but Jesus

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.920 
performance enhancements but Jesus
working<00:03:45.770> under<00:03:45.950> bucks<00:03:46.190> that's<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:46.670> big<00:03:47.000> jump<00:03:47.540> so

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
working under bucks that's a big jump so

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.199 
working under bucks that's a big jump so
I<00:03:48.200> don't<00:03:48.770> know<00:03:48.830> about<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.220> but<00:03:49.880> uh

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
I don't know about that but uh

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.780 
I don't know about that but uh
as<00:03:51.659> I<00:03:51.840> was<00:03:51.959> looking<00:03:52.079> at<00:03:52.319> them<00:03:52.439> and<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:53.700> know

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
as I was looking at them and you know

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.179 
as I was looking at them and you know
the<00:03:54.030> biggest<00:03:54.299> problem<00:03:55.219> about<00:03:56.219> the<00:03:56.549> 2013<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:58.319> or

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
the biggest problem about the 2013 is or

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.000 
the biggest problem about the 2013 is or
at<00:03:59.430> least<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.760> 2013<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.989> that's<00:04:01.739> sold<00:04:01.950> in

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
at least the 2013 that that's sold in

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.869 
at least the 2013 that that's sold in
the<00:04:02.159> u.s.<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:03.349> that<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.500> color<00:04:04.890> scheme<00:04:05.370> looks

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
the u.s. is that the color scheme looks

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.580 
the u.s. is that the color scheme looks
so<00:04:06.329> bad<00:04:07.609> it's<00:04:08.609> like<00:04:08.879> a<00:04:08.909> it's<00:04:09.629> like<00:04:09.810> black<00:04:10.260> and

upon<00:04:47.600> doing<00:04:47.840> more<00:04:48.230> research<00:04:49.330> there<00:04:50.330> is<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.660> like

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
upon doing more research there is a like

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.000 
upon doing more research there is a like
a<00:04:51.440> special<00:04:52.100> edition<00:04:52.580> version<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:54.440> course<00:04:54.800> is

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
a special edition version of course is

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.610 
a special edition version of course is
only<00:04:55.190> being<00:04:55.490> sold<00:04:55.820> in<00:04:56.000> freakin<00:04:56.630> Europe<00:04:56.960> make

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
only being sold in freakin Europe make

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.780 
only being sold in freakin Europe make
it<00:04:57.740> in<00:04:57.920> the<00:04:57.980> UK<00:04:58.340> or<00:04:58.550> UK<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.600> US<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.830> uh<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.340> think

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
it in the UK or UK the US but uh I think

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.920 
it in the UK or UK the US but uh I think
like<00:05:03.400> it's<00:05:04.400> kind<00:05:04.610> of<00:05:04.670> got<00:05:04.850> like<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.030> retro<00:05:05.420> paint

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
like it's kind of got like a retro paint

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.710 
like it's kind of got like a retro paint
scheme<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.290> I<00:05:06.700> after<00:05:07.700> looking<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:08.390> up

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
scheme and I after looking it up

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.030 
scheme and I after looking it up
I<00:05:08.750> guess<00:05:09.020> it's<00:05:09.230> based<00:05:09.530> off<00:05:09.770> of<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.190> an<00:05:10.310> old

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
I guess it's based off of like an old

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.310 
I guess it's based off of like an old
like<00:05:13.040> race<00:05:13.550> bike<00:05:13.970> that's<00:05:14.300> uzuki<00:05:14.810> had<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.230> the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
like race bike that's uzuki had and the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.210 
like race bike that's uzuki had and the
70s<00:05:16.100> or<00:05:16.250> something<00:05:16.580> like<00:05:16.700> that<00:05:17.890> but<00:05:18.890> it's<00:05:19.040> got

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
70s or something like that but it's got

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.670 
70s or something like that but it's got
this<00:05:19.370> like<00:05:19.580> really<00:05:19.970> retro<00:05:20.570> paint<00:05:21.080> scheme<00:05:21.440> and

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
this like really retro paint scheme and

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.390 
this like really retro paint scheme and
I<00:05:22.640> I<00:05:23.060> don't<00:05:23.510> know<00:05:23.630> about<00:05:23.750> you<00:05:24.050> guys<00:05:24.230> but<00:05:24.770> I
