00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.340 
chairs if I got new high chairs they
only<00:03:49.610> had<00:03:49.790> booster

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
only had booster

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.040 
only had booster
and<00:03:50.950> that<00:03:51.100> too<00:03:51.220> without<00:03:51.340> double<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.330> melt<00:03:52.840> on

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050

but<00:03:53.410> we<00:03:53.710> did<00:03:53.890> carry<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.340> little<00:03:54.580> ones<00:03:54.730> that

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
but we did carry the little ones that

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.930 
but we did carry the little ones that
was<00:03:55.120> fine<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:56.380> wish<00:03:57.040> had<00:03:57.220> good<00:03:57.460> things<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.790> say

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.290 
was fine I wish had good things to say
but<00:03:58.680> i<00:03:59.680> would<00:04:00.310> say<00:04:00.430> except<00:04:00.760> for<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:00.940> dessert

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
but i would say except for the dessert

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.870 
but i would say except for the dessert
the<00:04:02.050> rest<00:04:02.320> of<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.650> was<00:04:02.890> not<00:04:03.070> very<00:04:03.190> remarkable

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
the rest of that was not very remarkable

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.520 
the rest of that was not very remarkable

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
overall it just seemed like a very good

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.690 
overall it just seemed like a very good
package<00:05:20.470> to<00:05:20.680> me<00:05:20.770> I<00:05:20.800> really<00:05:21.250> enjoyed<00:05:21.580> the

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
package to me I really enjoyed the

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.790 
package to me I really enjoyed the
dinner<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:22.000> enjoyed<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.660> environment<00:05:23.620> and

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
dinner I enjoyed the environment and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.340 
dinner I enjoyed the environment and
just<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.220> whole<00:05:24.850> experience<00:05:24.910> that<00:05:25.690> we<00:05:26.140> head

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
just the whole experience that we head

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.930 
just the whole experience that we head
over<00:05:26.380> there<00:05:26.560> I<00:05:26.980> think<00:05:27.400> it's<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.550> small<00:05:27.760> enough

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
over there I think it's a small enough

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.380 
over there I think it's a small enough
place<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.540> the<00:05:28.810> food<00:05:28.960> comes<00:05:29.200> very<00:05:29.440> quickly

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
place that the food comes very quickly

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.790 
place that the food comes very quickly
but<00:05:31.390> but<00:05:31.660> I've<00:05:31.840> never<00:05:32.020> been<00:05:32.260> there<00:05:32.410> for<00:05:32.620> brunch

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
but but I've never been there for brunch

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.730 
but but I've never been there for brunch
actually<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:34.300> sounds<00:05:34.870> like<00:05:34.900> that<00:05:35.620> was

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
actually so it sounds like that was

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.050 
actually so it sounds like that was
either<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:36.010> completely<00:05:36.550> different<00:05:36.850> brunch

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
either a completely different brunch

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.970 
either a completely different brunch
