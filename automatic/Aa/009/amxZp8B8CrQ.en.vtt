00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
can see you can't print the image that

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.580 
can see you can't print the image that
you<00:02:24.319> know<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.620> thumbnail<00:02:25.150> videos<00:02:26.200> but<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.380> mean

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
you know the thumbnail videos but I mean

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.870 
you know the thumbnail videos but I mean
that's<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.730> fine<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.030> guess<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:32.440> now<00:02:33.880> you

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
that's that's fine I guess so now you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.740 
that's that's fine I guess so now you
can<00:02:35.090> highlight<00:02:35.799> parts<00:02:36.799> as<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:37.640> saw<00:02:37.850> you

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
can highlight parts as you just saw you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.759 
can highlight parts as you just saw you
can<00:02:38.989> even<00:02:41.799> write<00:02:42.799> on<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:44.060> make<00:02:44.989> lines<00:02:45.290> I

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
can even write on it and make lines I

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.320 
can even write on it and make lines I
know<00:02:46.130> for<00:02:46.519> for<00:02:47.390> example<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:49.060> couple<00:02:50.060> of

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
tutorials one of them is how to make a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.140 
tutorials one of them is how to make a
page<00:02:53.989> on<00:02:54.170> tumblr<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.160> used<00:02:55.400> pictures<00:02:55.880> to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
page on tumblr and I used pictures to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.650 
page on tumblr and I used pictures to
show<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.190> except<00:02:58.190> for<00:02:58.220> example<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.239> use<00:02:59.269> I

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
show this except for example I can use I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.759 
show this except for example I can use I
use<00:03:00.019> arrows<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.180> case<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.600> can<00:03:02.810> use<00:03:02.989> an

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
use arrows so in this case I can use an

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.069 
use arrows so in this case I can use an
arrow<00:03:04.070> like<00:03:04.489> right<00:03:04.880> here<00:03:05.150> you're<00:03:05.630> prettier
