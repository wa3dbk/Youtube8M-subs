00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.580
 very practical arrangement for May 10 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.170
 what we are going to need 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.560
 It can be a little box 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.610
 I have this little box here the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.940
 my son's toys this box 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.780
 we are going to need this 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.220
 you need good me here I have 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.220
 which stones 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.870

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.210
 beads sequins whatever they have to the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.180
 hand is about not spending a lot and of 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.500
 recycle I also have here this 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.370
 I do not have diamond in several emails 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.420
 Here, in my son, mark me the letters 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.970
 you're on the buoys 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.830
 [Music] 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.160
 I'm going to give you a little color with the 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.100
 diamond if you make a mistake it does not matter 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.050
 because already with the diamond every and 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.430
 right now I'm going to do what mom says 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.550
 nothing more and that I 'm guiding here for 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.880
 take out the typeface and as we have 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.760
 our letters are going to paint 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.650
 our little box 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.020
 [Music] 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.220
 now it does not matter if they are wrong 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.160
 identify here says mom but to me the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.100
 last one did not work out then what I'm going to 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.860
 to do is I'm going to put one here and not 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.680
 exports but from our family member I already 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.080
 has written things what's important 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.900
 recycle here in this little bit I'm going to 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.630
 do it and what we need to do 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.830
 paste it to start doing our 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.580
 box 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.130
 good 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.020
 here I already have the letters finished 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.070
 how are I going to leave them and I'm going to start 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.490
 paint the box 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.830
 I chose a pink Mexican color from 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.820
 the color that you want or of which 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.030
 have come out let's start painting it 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.090
 very careful not to stain the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.230
 plastic 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.300
 well here I already have the little box is the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.140
 first layer just that today 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.560
 and as you can see then you have to have 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.560
 patience until you 're in layers 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.020
 also the tricolor and so you have to give it 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.710
 the layers of paint 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.660
 until the color we want is 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.700
 important to have a tablecloth or something to 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.210
 Do not stain our table our area 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.040
 work 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.280
 come out then let's continue painting 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.170
 here so that it dries faster I 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.170
 I'm helping from a fan 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.420
 and what is drying 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.910
 I'm going to start 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.840
 to put diamond on my letters for 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.620
 seize the time 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.390
 and then we go back 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.390
 this diamond our letters 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.940
 and you can 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.260
 our diamond 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.030
 or the one they have there 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.490
 Saved 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.209
 this is how our 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.209
 letters now I will move on to do this 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.810
 [Music] 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.950
 to me for the crown of me 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.760
 it happened that you can take me this tone 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.390
 golden and to make it look a little bit more 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.880
 original 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.880
 and put these pebbles up here 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.930
 it depends on the taste of everyone 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:17.500
 now let's put our diamond 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:23.900
 and so that it sticks we're going to help 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:26.930
 of our liquid resistor comes out we put 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.479
 our sun and we help each other with a 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.060
 pincelito in this case I here no longer 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.800
 occupied this is for the eyes but if 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.440
 you have any other that can 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.440
 serve them forward we are going to 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.310
 pass our glue well so that 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.310
 it's the crown 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.630
 since we have our crown against 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.910
 sector 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.810
 the only thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.810
 sprinkle 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.060
 canteen 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.800
 [Applause] 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.640
 once we have ready 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.640
 let's remove the excess 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.759
 and we will have something like that 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.369
 here where they were a few parts 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:43.280
 fill it up again 

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:44.800
 resistol and we do the same 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.560
 all right 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.050
 our box since we gave the past 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.699
 what you need is left like this now what 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.569
 next is going to be clean here the 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:57.229
 acetate 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:59.920
 so that we look nice and here we have 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.880
 and to our lyrics 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.170
 what are we doing with 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.880
 diamond takes here I'm still going to 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.580
 put some details with paint 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.169
 plastic and here I will cover with a 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.840
 colored sheet so it does not look like this 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:25.220
 here I already have my cup 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:28.150
 it is so I bought it at the store 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.150
 of savings was 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.500
 the box I already stuck the ornaments 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:40.270
 this is I did a braid but I'm going 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:43.820
 to close and paste everything 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.110
 and had I was saved 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.730
 so 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.030
 I remembered that my mom likes them a lot 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.070
 the bands and what I'm going to do is what 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.060
 I'm going to cut the legs and I'm going to 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.160
 hit here below 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.160
 and this one I'm going to put something like 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:17.040
 [Music] 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.449
 here is our finished work 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.289
 and I hope you liked it 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.809
 and so 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:35.470
 If you liked the craft, you know 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:39.990
 I recommend on my channel 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.990
 and so it was for the bottom part
