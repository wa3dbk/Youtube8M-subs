I<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:04.650> know<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.799> know<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.120> Shanahan<00:04:06.120> his

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
I you know I know that Shanahan his

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.470 
I you know I know that Shanahan his
excuse<00:04:06.720> was<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.370> he<00:04:08.370> he<00:04:09.030> wants<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.299> see<00:04:09.390> what

excuse was that he he wants to see what

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.640 
excuse was that he he wants to see what
the<00:04:09.570> other<00:04:09.660> guys<00:04:09.870> have<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.320> quarterbacks

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
the other guys have the quarterbacks

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.110 
the other guys have the quarterbacks
have<00:04:10.799> since<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.549> season<00:04:11.730> they're<00:04:11.880> not<00:04:11.970> going

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
have since the season they're not going

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.410 
have since the season they're not going
to<00:04:12.180> playoffs<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.780> that's<00:04:13.350> fine<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:14.420> disagreed

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
to playoffs and that's fine I disagreed

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.670 
to playoffs and that's fine I disagreed
that's<00:04:15.630> through<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.019> real<00:04:16.200> reason<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.530> think

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
that's through the real reason I think

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.229 
that's through the real reason I think
everyone<00:04:16.979> knows<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.220> there's<00:04:17.940> been<00:04:18.060> some

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
everyone knows that there's been some

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.229 
everyone knows that there's been some
issues<00:04:18.359> between<00:04:18.630> main<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.049> Shanahan<00:04:20.239> but

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
issues between main and Shanahan but

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.000 
issues between main and Shanahan but
other<00:04:21.660> than<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.020> think<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
other than that I think that the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.440 
other than that I think that the
Redskins<00:04:23.400> came<00:04:23.580> out<00:04:23.729> one<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.000> win<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.300> saw

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
Redskins came out one to win you saw

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.640 
Redskins came out one to win you saw
them<00:04:24.660> in<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.110> way<00:04:25.200> they<00:04:25.320> came<00:04:25.470> back

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
them in the way they came back

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.740 
them in the way they came back
you<00:04:27.340> know<00:04:27.430> sellers<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.210> coolly<00:04:28.509> you<00:04:28.660> know

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
you know sellers and coolly you know

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.120 
you know sellers and coolly you know
coolies<00:04:29.020> never<00:04:29.199> catch<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.530> second<00:04:29.800> half<00:04:29.830> and

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
coolies never catch the second half and

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.620 
coolies never catch the second half and
then<00:04:30.190> he<00:04:30.340> became<00:04:30.430> an<00:04:30.729> impact<00:04:31.000> player<00:04:31.090> for<00:04:31.540> him

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
then he became an impact player for him

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.659 
then he became an impact player for him
sellers<00:04:32.620> catching<00:04:32.979> out<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.130> back<00:04:33.280> field<00:04:33.520> of

course Santana Moss who dropped one that

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.870 
course Santana Moss who dropped one that
probably<00:04:35.740> would<00:04:35.949> extended<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.430> game<00:04:36.610> for<00:04:36.820> the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
probably would extended the game for the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.450 
probably would extended the game for the
Redskins<00:04:37.500> meal<00:04:38.500> he's<00:04:38.770> accused<00:04:39.070> of<00:04:39.130> cowboys

Redskins meal he's accused of cowboys

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.370 
Redskins meal he's accused of cowboys
kill<00:04:39.639> he<00:04:39.699> had<00:04:39.789> a<00:04:39.820> couple<00:04:40.000> touchdowns<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:41.080> I

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
kill he had a couple touchdowns so I

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.980 
kill he had a couple touchdowns so I
just<00:04:41.949> see<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.820> like<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.419> both<00:04:43.600> teams<00:04:43.810> were

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
just see I like that both teams were

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.930 
just see I like that both teams were
fighting<00:04:44.380> because<00:04:45.009> even<00:04:45.400> though<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.820> know

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
fighting because even though you know

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.820 
fighting because even though you know
across<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.570> country<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.169> other<00:04:47.500> two<00:04:47.650> teams

what<00:05:29.110> I've<00:05:29.229> seen<00:05:29.380> so<00:05:29.440> far<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:30.009> do<00:05:30.340> think<00:05:30.789> that

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
what I've seen so far I do think that

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.820 
what I've seen so far I do think that
you<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.240> Eagles<00:05:31.599> or<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.870> Giants<00:05:32.229> will<00:05:32.740> be

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
you to the Eagles or the Giants will be

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.020 
you to the Eagles or the Giants will be
in<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:32.979> Super<00:05:33.190> Bowl<00:05:33.250> where<00:05:33.460> they<00:05:33.550> win<00:05:33.729> it<00:05:33.880> I

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
in the Super Bowl where they win it I

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.189 
in the Super Bowl where they win it I
don't<00:05:34.270> know<00:05:34.330> but<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.570> think<00:05:34.599> either<00:05:34.960> one<00:05:35.139> of

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
don't know but I think either one of

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.050 
don't know but I think either one of
those<00:05:35.289> two<00:05:35.349> will<00:05:36.039> go<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.430> NFC<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:36.970> then

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
those two will go to the NFC and then

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.129 
those two will go to the NFC and then

they weren't already on Sunday to run
the<00:06:27.430> football<00:06:27.610> now<00:06:28.419> that<00:06:28.599> they<00:06:28.690> have<00:06:28.720> I<00:06:29.289> think

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
the football now that they have I think

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.140 
the football now that they have I think
it<00:06:29.740> that<00:06:29.919> physiol<00:06:30.729> they<00:06:30.789> could<00:06:30.909> hit<00:06:31.060> each

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
it that physiol they could hit each

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.550 
it that physiol they could hit each
other<00:06:31.270> during<00:06:31.510> the<00:06:31.630> week<00:06:31.810> they<00:06:32.260> can<00:06:32.380> hit<00:06:32.440> each

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
other during the week they can hit each

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.060 
other during the week they can hit each
other<00:06:32.620> on<00:06:32.830> Sundays<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:34.080> so<00:06:35.080> I<00:06:35.110> think<00:06:35.229> that's<00:06:35.770> a

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
other on Sundays and so I think that's a

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.950 
other on Sundays and so I think that's a
pretty<00:06:36.520> good<00:06:36.700> answer<00:06:36.940> so<00:06:37.060> I<00:06:37.090> think<00:06:37.270> that's<00:06:37.870> a

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
pretty good answer so I think that's a

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.269 
pretty good answer so I think that's a
pretty<00:06:38.080> good<00:06:38.229> answer<00:06:38.440> Jason<00:06:38.620> gear<00:06:38.919> whether

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:39.279 
pretty good answer Jason gear whether

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:40.530 
pretty good answer Jason gear whether
it's<00:06:39.460> true<00:06:39.610> or<00:06:39.639> not<00:06:39.760> I<00:06:40.090> don't

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
it's true or not I don't

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.960 
it's true or not I don't
but<00:06:40.840> I<00:06:40.870> think<00:06:41.200> it's<00:06:41.290> pretty<00:06:41.380> cancer<00:06:41.770> so

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
but I think it's pretty cancer so

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.720 
but I think it's pretty cancer so
