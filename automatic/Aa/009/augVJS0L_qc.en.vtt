00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.590
 hi Guys 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.660
 today there are brathering and four 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.570
 I'll take her and in 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:31.580
 fry the butter and then come 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.840
 you in a marinade out to the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:39.820
 same part consists of vinegar and water 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:46.040
 where various spices are then 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 laurel mustard salt sugar and 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:01:01.760
 pepper allspice and juniper berry juice 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.159
 one lemon and two onions in 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.549
 then they will be two 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.590
 or maybe even three days 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.930
 and then I will get it 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.600
 let's taste it so first I have 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.149
 a pan is placed there 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.609
 a tablespoon of butter lard in it 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:24.409
 and is just breaking up and I will 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:26.240
 now prepare the herring and that 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.219
 with lemon 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:35.979
 so replace these three of it 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:40.490
 they are no longer valid today 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.369
 because that was mainly done earlier 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.549
 not so fresh anymore 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.990
 There was no smell and smell 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.719
 You do not need that anymore these days 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.579
 but i do it anyway i believe 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:02:00.439
 that has something to do with the taste 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:07.479
 the second thing that comes in here is salt and 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:10.810
 pepper over it so now they are in 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.810
 turned flour 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.230
 and now they come here in the pan 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.329
 become really nice from both sides 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.220
 roast an estimated 23 minutes 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.379
 per page 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.379
 meanwhile prepare and marinade 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:42.190
 I add 500 milliliters of vinegar to it 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:42.190
 Add a small amount of water to a pot 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.109
 and the spices I mentioned above 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.420
 I believe the dried chemistry was mine 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:04:00.650
 forgot to mention 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:06.849
 everything comes in here and will be on now 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.849
 Simmer the stove for about 5 minutes 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:33.820
 unfortunately not fitting fluctuates 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:41.620
 little filed but think that will 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:43.510
 be a bit tragic like that 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:56.290
 marinade has about five minutes 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:58.230
 I 'm going to simmer now and now 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.550
 come here from me 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.540
 cut in the meantime 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.540
 onion rows 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.580
 important is that the onions now 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.580
 not boil or cook for 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.820
 But stop your taste 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.820
 submit 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.750
 now the marinade has to cool down 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:36.450
 then she comes over the fish over it 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.080
 then the bowl is covered and for 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.120
 two or three days on the balcony at 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.320
 every park because my fridge absolutely 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:50.150
 is full and on the balcony that cools 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.150
 whole of course much faster 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.760
 By the way, I have another vessel 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.510
 Although found is not so big 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.450
 but the herring are really nice 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.870
 place and see 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:12.230
 the rings and the marie a that i have now 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.230
 cooled down now I give here 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:46.580
 now the lid on it comes like that 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:50.330
 lid on it and off again on the 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.730
 balcony for the next two or three 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.920
 I'll check it out after two days 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:07:00.380
 and will contact me again 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:07.210
 three days are completely unspectacular 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:10.250
 passed so i have two here 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.990
 got out and tried so far 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.040
 to decorate 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:19.370
 I will be able to do that now and yes 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.080
 Have fun when copying is so bad 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.880
 it not 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.070
 and also the smell keeps in the kitchen 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.960
 in limits 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.960
 and yes we have a good appetite
