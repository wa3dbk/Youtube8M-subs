paper<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.710> can<00:00:07.919> work<00:00:08.099> well<00:00:08.400> if<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.880> have<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
paper that can work well if you have a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.570 
paper that can work well if you have a
patterned<00:00:10.349> paper<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.099> one<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.550> I

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
patterned paper like this one that I

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.240 
patterned paper like this one that I
have<00:00:11.880> up<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:13.049> want<00:00:13.320> something<00:00:14.070> that

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
have up here and you want something that

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.709 
have up here and you want something that
complements<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.299> don't<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.660> a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
complements it and you don't have a

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.130 
complements it and you don't have a
solid<00:00:16.440> color<00:00:16.830> paper<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:18.090> matches<00:00:18.510> so

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
solid color paper and that matches so

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.250 
solid color paper and that matches so
with<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.520> paper<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.210> want<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.990> match

the dimensions of twelve by twelve at
300<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.420> pretty<00:00:57.600> standard<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.199> paper

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
300 which is pretty standard for paper

300 which is pretty standard for paper
and<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:01.530> probably<00:01:02.100> choose<00:01:02.340> white<00:01:02.640> or

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
have gone through flip that to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.420 
have gone through flip that to
background<00:01:06.930> color<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.320> used<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:07.830> let's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
background color and used it but let's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.789 
background color and used it but let's
for<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> sake<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.900> let's<00:01:10.170> pretend<00:01:10.590> you

for the sake of this let's pretend you
weren't<00:01:11.430> paying<00:01:11.640> attention<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> his'n

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
weren't paying attention to the his'n

weren't paying attention to the his'n
you<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.049> chose<00:01:13.260> white<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:14.130> I'll<00:01:14.310> show

Elements 6 for Windows for this tutorial
but<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.200> work<00:01:22.409> similarly<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.610> Mac

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
but this will work similarly on Mac

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.149 
but this will work similarly on Mac
versions<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.630> well<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.320> Photoshop<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> other

versions<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.670> Photoshop<00:01:27.090> Elements<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.869> just

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
versions of Photoshop Elements so just

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170 
versions of Photoshop Elements so just
letting<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
letting you know that so now we have a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.999 
letting you know that so now we have a
white<00:01:30.450> 2<00:01:30.689> file<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.560> size<00:01:31.770> but

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
white 2 file that's the right size but

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.069 
white 2 file that's the right size but
doesn't<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> color<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.630> shortcut

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
doesn't have the color and the shortcut

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.499 
doesn't have the color and the shortcut
for<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.640> wanted<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> use<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
for that if we wanted to use the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.840 
for that if we wanted to use the
shortcuts<00:01:36.930> which<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> almost<00:01:38.520> always

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
shortcuts which is what I almost always

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.660 
shortcuts which is what I almost always
use<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.420> things<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.900> Alt<00:01:40.530> +<00:01:40.799> backspace

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
use on things is Alt + backspace

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.149 
use on things is Alt + backspace
if<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.479> using<00:01:42.659> Windows<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.619> Mac<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
if you're using Windows on a Mac it's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.380 
if you're using Windows on a Mac it's
option<00:01:44.700> +<00:01:44.939> delete

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
option + delete

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.899 
option + delete
I<00:01:45.600> believe<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> color<00:01:47.700> on

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
I believe so now we have the color on

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.100 
I believe so now we have the color on
there<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> doesn't<00:01:48.720> look<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.049> like

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
there but it doesn't look at all like

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.780 
there but it doesn't look at all like
paper<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.890> looks<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.189> nice<00:01:50.369> big

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
paper it just looks like a nice big

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.120 
paper it just looks like a nice big
block<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.270> color<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.840> I'm<00:01:52.619> gonna<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.979> out<00:01:53.100> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
block of color and I'm gonna get out of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.380 
block of color and I'm gonna get out of
that<00:01:53.220> eyedropper<00:01:53.790> tool<00:01:54.000> because<00:01:54.240> it's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that eyedropper tool because it's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.420 
that eyedropper tool because it's
driving<00:01:54.600> me<00:01:54.750> crazy

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
driving me crazy

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.039 
driving me crazy
so<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.549> need<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> put<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.149> pattern<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
so we need to put some pattern on this

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.620 
so we need to put some pattern on this
paper<00:01:58.320> give<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.219> bit<00:01:59.399> more<00:01:59.640> interest

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
paper give it a little bit more interest

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.959 
paper give it a little bit more interest
to<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.290> I'm<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> use<00:02:02.369> two<00:02:02.640> different

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to it I'm going to use two different

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.370 
to it I'm going to use two different
patterns<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.479> I'm<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> use<00:02:04.049> them<00:02:04.200> both

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
patterns and I'm going to use them both

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560 
patterns and I'm going to use them both
through<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.100> adjustment<00:02:05.880> layers<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
through the adjustment layers the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.389 
through the adjustment layers the
pattern<00:02:06.930> that's<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.320> adjustment<00:02:07.890> layers<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
pattern that's in adjustment layers I

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.020 
pattern that's in adjustment layers I
can

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
can

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.059 
can
the<00:02:09.330> scale<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:10.020> them<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:10.800> bit<00:02:10.920> more

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the scale of them a little bit more

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.980 
the scale of them a little bit more
easily<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.730> even<00:02:11.970> go<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.510> make<00:02:12.600> changes

the first pattern I want to use on this
is<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.440> one<00:02:37.739> right<00:02:37.920> here<00:02:37.980> call<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.209> you'll

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
is this one right here call it's you'll

pronouncing<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.430> quickly<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.910> think<00:02:42.150> it's<00:02:42.239> go

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
pronouncing this quickly I think it's go

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.830 
pronouncing this quickly I think it's go
as<00:02:42.630> light<00:02:43.350> on<00:02:43.620> watercolor<00:02:44.060> click<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.420> and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
as light on watercolor click on it and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.690 
as light on watercolor click on it and
click<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.709> get<00:02:46.860> rid<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.250> pattern

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
click this to get rid of the pattern

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.030 
click this to get rid of the pattern
choices<00:02:48.209> now<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.110> doesn't<00:02:49.440> look<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.680> very

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
choices now it doesn't look like very

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.360 
choices now it doesn't look like very
much<00:02:50.280> when<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.450> smallest<00:02:52.260> scale<00:02:52.680> so

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
much when it's this smallest scale so

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.400 
much when it's this smallest scale so
I'm<00:02:53.489> going<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.819> turn<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.450> scale<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.989> all<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
I'm going to turn the scale up all the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.259 
I'm going to turn the scale up all the
way<00:02:55.560> actually<00:02:56.069> I'll<00:02:56.340> use<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.670> slider<00:02:56.970> here

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
way actually I'll use the slider here

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.600 
way actually I'll use the slider here
all<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.840> way<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.080> thousand<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.920> click<00:02:59.430> on

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
all the way to a thousand and click on

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.000 
all the way to a thousand and click on
that<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.090> now<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.870> looks<00:03:01.019> nice<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.470> looks<00:03:01.620> sort

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
that and now it looks nice it looks sort

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.580 
that and now it looks nice it looks sort
of<00:03:02.040> modeled<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.330> parchment<00:03:03.660> perhaps<00:03:04.350> or

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
of modeled and like parchment perhaps or

of modeled and like parchment perhaps or
rag<00:03:04.890> rolled<00:03:05.220> I'll<00:03:05.790> hit<00:03:06.000> OK<00:03:06.500> obviously<00:03:07.500> it's

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
rag rolled I'll hit OK obviously it's

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.160 
rag rolled I'll hit OK obviously it's
gray<00:03:07.920> that's<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:08.610> gonna<00:03:08.760> work<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.959> next

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
gray that's not gonna work so the next

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.050 
gray that's not gonna work so the next
thing<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.470> do<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.250> go<00:03:11.430> into<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.790> blend

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
thing to do is to go into the blend

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.750 
thing to do is to go into the blend
modes<00:03:12.360> use<00:03:13.110> this<00:03:13.440> set<00:03:13.829> of<00:03:13.980> blend<00:03:14.250> modes<00:03:14.519> in

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
modes use this set of blend modes in

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.550 
modes use this set of blend modes in

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.479 
shades of grey they work well in
particular<00:03:21.329> I'll<00:03:22.200> use<00:03:22.470> overlay<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.280> case

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
particular I'll use overlay in this case

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.090 
particular I'll use overlay in this case
that<00:03:24.269> looks<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.570> lot<00:03:24.750> better<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.739> still<00:03:25.890> a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
that looks a lot better but it's still a

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.259 
that looks a lot better but it's still a
little<00:03:26.340> bit<00:03:26.489> more<00:03:27.620> more<00:03:28.880> strong<00:03:29.880> it's

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
little bit more more strong it's

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.420 
little bit more more strong it's
stronger<00:03:30.780> than<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.019> would<00:03:31.079> like<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:32.130> let's<00:03:32.280> turn

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
stronger than I would like so let's turn

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.479 
stronger than I would like so let's turn
the<00:03:32.610> opacity<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.360> down<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.870> found<00:03:34.470> as<00:03:35.310> I've

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
the opacity of this down I found as I've

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.800 
the opacity of this down I found as I've
been<00:03:35.670> experimenting<00:03:36.120> for<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.540> particular

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
been experimenting for this particular

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.710 
been experimenting for this particular
one<00:03:37.140> 40<00:03:37.769> 45<00:03:38.459> somewhere<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.000> there<00:03:39.150> works<00:03:39.390> good

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
one 40 45 somewhere in there works good

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.870 
one 40 45 somewhere in there works good
and<00:03:39.900> I'll<00:03:40.799> just<00:03:41.010> click<00:03:41.250> out<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.519> there<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.730> get

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
and I'll just click out of there to get

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.270 
and I'll just click out of there to get
out<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.209> opacity<00:03:42.510> slider<00:03:42.900> now<00:03:43.680> I'll<00:03:44.040> say

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
out of the opacity slider now I'll say

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.550 
out of the opacity slider now I'll say
that<00:03:44.519> I've<00:03:44.730> been<00:03:45.420> recording<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.350> several

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
that I've been recording this several

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.680 
that I've been recording this several
times<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:47.100> look<00:03:47.820> back<00:03:48.090> at<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.359> video<00:03:48.630> and

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
times and look back at the video and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.410 
times and look back at the video and
this<00:03:49.079> looks<00:03:49.500> much<00:03:49.890> better<00:03:50.250> believe<00:03:51.090> me<00:03:51.299> in

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
this looks much better believe me in

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.000 
this looks much better believe me in
person<00:03:51.840> than<00:03:51.959> what<00:03:52.079> you're<00:03:52.290> probably<00:03:52.500> seeing

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
person than what you're probably seeing

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.979 
person than what you're probably seeing
in<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.370> video<00:03:53.549> right<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.239> capture<00:03:54.840> is

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
in this video right now the capture is

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.440 
in this video right now the capture is
not<00:03:55.049> capturing<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:55.980> as<00:03:56.130> nice<00:03:56.880> as<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.269> really

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
not capturing it as nice as it really

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.120 
not capturing it as nice as it really
does<00:03:57.570> look<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:58.260> may<00:03:58.590> look<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.859> little<00:03:59.040> bit

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
does look it may look a little bit

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.319 
does look it may look a little bit
Pixley<00:03:59.609> or<00:03:59.730> blocky

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
Pixley or blocky

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.420 
Pixley or blocky
but<00:04:01.109> so<00:04:01.440> we've<00:04:01.590> got<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.799> color<00:04:02.010> looking<00:04:02.310> a

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
but so we've got the color looking a

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.520 
but so we've got the color looking a
little<00:04:02.940> bit<00:04:03.060> more<00:04:03.299> interesting<00:04:03.780> but<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.320> still

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
little bit more interesting but it still

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.380 
little bit more interesting but it still
needs<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.859> pattern<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.790> considered<00:04:06.209> paper

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
needs a pattern to be considered paper

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.229 
needs a pattern to be considered paper
so<00:04:06.720> back<00:04:06.930> in<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.200> pattern<00:04:07.560> here<00:04:08.010> back<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.970> sin

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
so back in the pattern here back in sin

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.729 
so back in the pattern here back in sin
the<00:04:09.390> same<00:04:09.660> set<00:04:09.959> I'm<00:04:10.140> going<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.350> use<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.560> very

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
the same set I'm going to use the very

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.550 
the same set I'm going to use the very
first<00:04:11.010> one<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.459> says<00:04:11.519> dark<00:04:11.940> coarse<00:04:12.239> weave

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
first one that says dark coarse weave

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.770 
first one that says dark coarse weave
on<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.860> again<00:04:14.550> I'm<00:04:14.670> gonna<00:04:14.819> increase<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.330> scale

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
on it again I'm gonna increase the scale

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.870 
on it again I'm gonna increase the scale
but<00:04:16.019> not<00:04:16.169> too<00:04:16.560> much<00:04:16.799> because<00:04:17.400> remember<00:04:17.609> we're

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
but not too much because remember we're

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.199 
but not too much because remember we're
looking<00:04:18.180> at<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.709> 12<00:04:19.709> by<00:04:19.889> 12<00:04:20.190> inch<00:04:20.519> piece<00:04:21.030> of

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
looking at a 12 by 12 inch piece of

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.210 
looking at a 12 by 12 inch piece of
paper<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.750> even<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.590> your<00:04:22.740> screen<00:04:23.040> you're<00:04:23.190> not

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
paper and even on your screen you're not

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.920 
paper and even on your screen you're not
looking<00:04:23.610> at<00:04:23.730> something<00:04:23.910> that's<00:04:24.060> 12<00:04:24.510> by<00:04:24.660> 12

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
looking at something that's 12 by 12

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.920 
looking at something that's 12 by 12
inch<00:04:25.230> so<00:04:25.860> I'm<00:04:25.980> gonna<00:04:26.100> hit<00:04:26.280> okay<00:04:26.639> at<00:04:26.820> 125<00:04:27.540> here<00:04:27.870> I

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
inch so I'm gonna hit okay at 125 here I

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.040 
inch so I'm gonna hit okay at 125 here I
like<00:04:28.169> 125<00:04:28.800> I'm<00:04:29.130> gonna<00:04:29.490> zoom<00:04:29.730> in<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.180> 100%<00:04:30.300> so

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
like 125 I'm gonna zoom in to 100% so

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.750 
like 125 I'm gonna zoom in to 100% so
you<00:04:31.110> can<00:04:31.320> see<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:31.860> you're<00:04:31.980> definitely<00:04:32.220> not

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
you can see that you're definitely not

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.550 
you can see that you're definitely not
looking<00:04:33.330> at<00:04:33.630> something<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:33.990> was<00:04:34.200> quite<00:04:34.380> as

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
looking at something that was quite as

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.879 
looking at something that was quite as
tiny<00:04:34.889> as<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.250> saw<00:04:35.690> it's<00:04:36.690> what<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:36.930> like<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.740> do

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
tiny as you saw it's what I like to do

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.710 
tiny as you saw it's what I like to do
is<00:04:38.040> going<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.639> hundred<00:04:38.970> percent<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.419> do<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
is going to a hundred percent and do the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.870 
is going to a hundred percent and do the
rest<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.169> work<00:04:40.350> from<00:04:40.620> there<00:04:40.830> next<00:04:41.669> I'm

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
rest of the work from there next I'm

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.550 
rest of the work from there next I'm
gonna<00:04:41.970> change<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.360> blend<00:04:42.600> mode<00:04:42.660> again<00:04:43.050> when

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
gonna change the blend mode again when

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.310 
gonna change the blend mode again when
you<00:04:43.650> soft<00:04:44.040> light<00:04:44.310> in<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.639> case<00:04:44.910> if<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.870> had<00:04:46.290> a

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
you soft light in this case if you had a

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.440 
you soft light in this case if you had a
color<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:47.490> sampled<00:04:48.000> that's<00:04:48.180> much

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
color that you sampled that's much

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.350 
color that you sampled that's much
lighter<00:04:48.990> like<00:04:49.470> white<00:04:49.830> closer<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.910> white<00:04:51.090> or

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
lighter like white closer to white or

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.230 
lighter like white closer to white or
closer<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.229> black<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:53.070> may<00:04:53.220> need<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.580> use<00:04:53.820> one

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
closer to black you may need to use one

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.120 
closer to black you may need to use one
of<00:04:54.270> these<00:04:54.450> other<00:04:54.510> blend<00:04:55.380> modes<00:04:55.590> here<00:04:55.770> such<00:04:55.979> as

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
of these other blend modes here such as

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.650 
of these other blend modes here such as
hard<00:04:56.370> light<00:04:56.550> vivid<00:04:56.940> light<00:04:57.090> linear<00:04:57.450> light

you find what you like because the

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.610 
you find what you like because the
lighter<00:05:03.030> colors<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.810> patterns<00:05:04.169> won't<00:05:04.410> show

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
lighter colors the patterns won't show

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.320 
lighter colors the patterns won't show
up<00:05:04.770> as<00:05:04.950> well<00:05:05.130> but<00:05:05.160> soft<00:05:05.610> light<00:05:05.790> will<00:05:05.940> work<00:05:05.970> in

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
up as well but soft light will work in

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.230 
up as well but soft light will work in
this<00:05:06.419> case<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:07.200> it's<00:05:07.620> even<00:05:07.979> still<00:05:08.580> too<00:05:08.970> harsh

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
this case and it's even still too harsh

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.540 
this case and it's even still too harsh
for<00:05:09.540> my<00:05:09.630> liking<00:05:09.900> my<00:05:10.710> mistake<00:05:11.160> when<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.370> was

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
for my liking my mistake when I was

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.280 
for my liking my mistake when I was
first<00:05:11.669> making<00:05:11.910> paper<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:12.479> as<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.660> kept<00:05:12.930> my

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
first making paper so as I kept my

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.080 
first making paper so as I kept my
opacity<00:05:13.650> on<00:05:14.010> this<00:05:14.280> layer<00:05:14.460> turned<00:05:14.760> up<00:05:14.880> way<00:05:15.030> too

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
opacity on this layer turned up way too

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.570 
opacity on this layer turned up way too
much<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:15.750> was<00:05:15.870> just<00:05:16.050> too<00:05:16.580> harsh

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
much and it was just too harsh

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.219 
much and it was just too harsh
especially<00:05:18.150> when<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.390> get<00:05:18.510> it<00:05:18.660> printed<00:05:19.050> out

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
especially when you get it printed out

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.870 
especially when you get it printed out
and<00:05:19.470> have<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.650> on<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.860> layout<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.460> doesn't<00:05:20.760> look

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
and have it on a layout it doesn't look

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.640 
and have it on a layout it doesn't look
as<00:05:21.030> nice<00:05:21.180> so<00:05:21.539> I'm<00:05:21.660> gonna<00:05:21.780> turn<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.140> opacity<00:05:22.410> of

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
as nice so I'm gonna turn the opacity of

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.920 
as nice so I'm gonna turn the opacity of
this<00:05:22.800> layer<00:05:22.860> down<00:05:23.250> quite<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.610> bit<00:05:23.700> to<00:05:24.300> about<00:05:24.419> 30

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
this layer down quite a bit to about 30

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.460 
this layer down quite a bit to about 30
I<00:05:25.050> think<00:05:25.490> in<00:05:26.490> this<00:05:26.550> case<00:05:26.820> until<00:05:27.150> it's<00:05:27.330> very

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
I think in this case until it's very

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.460 
I think in this case until it's very
very<00:05:28.470> subtle<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.750> click<00:05:30.750> out<00:05:30.900> of<00:05:31.050> there<00:05:31.260> and

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
very subtle and click out of there and

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.290 
very subtle and click out of there and
now<00:05:31.890> when<00:05:32.100> you<00:05:32.190> start<00:05:32.430> zooming<00:05:32.580> out<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.150> can

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
now when you start zooming out you can

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.580 
now when you start zooming out you can
see<00:05:33.419> that<00:05:33.450> you<00:05:33.630> can<00:05:33.780> still<00:05:33.900> see<00:05:34.050> it<00:05:34.380> it's<00:05:34.530> not

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
see that you can still see it it's not

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.950 
see that you can still see it it's not
so<00:05:34.919> subtle<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:35.400> it's<00:05:35.550> gone<00:05:35.789> but<00:05:36.479> it's<00:05:36.539> much

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
so subtle that it's gone but it's much

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.350 
so subtle that it's gone but it's much
more<00:05:36.990> like<00:05:37.530> paper<00:05:37.830> and<00:05:38.220> of<00:05:38.760> course<00:05:38.970> once<00:05:39.210> you

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
more like paper and of course once you

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.630 
more like paper and of course once you
get<00:05:39.539> zoomed<00:05:39.840> out<00:05:39.990> enough<00:05:40.919> to<00:05:41.100> that<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.490> can

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
get zoomed out enough to that you can

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.940 
get zoomed out enough to that you can
see<00:05:41.850> the<00:05:42.000> entire<00:05:42.300> thing<00:05:42.630> on<00:05:43.380> both<00:05:43.560> of<00:05:43.830> these

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
see the entire thing on both of these

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.529 
see the entire thing on both of these
you<00:05:44.220> can't<00:05:44.460> really<00:05:44.729> see<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:45.000> pattern<00:05:45.330> in<00:05:45.389> at

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
you can't really see the pattern in at

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.540 
you can't really see the pattern in at
all<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:46.260> may<00:05:46.440> not<00:05:46.590> look<00:05:46.740> so<00:05:46.919> great<00:05:47.130> again<00:05:47.400> on

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
all it may not look so great again on

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.520 
all it may not look so great again on
your<00:05:47.669> video<00:05:47.940> screen<00:05:48.030> but<00:05:48.510> it<00:05:48.720> is<00:05:49.050> very<00:05:49.260> nice

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
your video screen but it is very nice

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.350 
your video screen but it is very nice
and<00:05:49.830> we<00:05:50.220> have<00:05:50.340> a<00:05:50.370> nice<00:05:50.550> solid<00:05:50.760> paper<00:05:51.120> that

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
and we have a nice solid paper that

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.480 
and we have a nice solid paper that
complements<00:05:51.900> this<00:05:51.990> pattern<00:05:52.350> paper<00:05:52.620> if<00:05:53.310> you're

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
complements this pattern paper if you're

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.040 
complements this pattern paper if you're
an<00:05:53.580> element's<00:05:53.970> here<00:05:54.150> you<00:05:54.270> can<00:05:54.450> use<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:54.780> cookie

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
an element's here you can use the cookie

an element's here you can use the cookie
cutter<00:05:55.320> to<00:05:55.530> cut<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.770> big<00:05:55.979> chunk<00:05:56.250> of<00:05:56.400> it<00:05:56.550> off<00:05:56.700> in<00:05:56.880> a

layout<00:05:59.100> in<00:05:59.539> Photoshop<00:06:00.539> you<00:06:00.720> can<00:06:00.900> crop<00:06:01.139> it<00:06:01.380> with

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
layout in Photoshop you can crop it with

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.640 
layout in Photoshop you can crop it with
some<00:06:02.340> tools<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.240> put<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.050> on<00:06:04.169> your<00:06:04.320> layout

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
some tools and and put it on your layout

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.980 
some tools and and put it on your layout
that<00:06:04.830> way<00:06:05.010> use<00:06:05.280> it<00:06:05.460> as<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.610> photo<00:06:05.910> mat<00:06:06.210> or<00:06:06.630> for

that way use it as a photo mat or for

that way use it as a photo mat or for
journaling<00:06:07.470> but<00:06:08.100> now<00:06:08.220> you've<00:06:08.370> got<00:06:08.580> a<00:06:08.789> little

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
so that you have these layers available

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.050 
so that you have these layers available
to<00:06:27.750> work<00:06:27.960> with<00:06:28.200> and<00:06:28.410> as<00:06:28.500> I<00:06:28.590> say<00:06:28.800> having<00:06:29.190> these
