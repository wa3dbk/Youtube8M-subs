 the graph is the same and the best is not 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.170
 color difference is that neither we 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.160
 we found the computer regulators 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.030
 and we do not have treatments or anything 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.540
 more 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.040

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.910

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.160
 next galera he does not wheel because he 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.020
 does not have a higher social type 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.840
 of this cartridge exceeded 8 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.060
 He has an entrance to enter others. 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.700
 cartridges, that is, if you put a 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.350
 cartridge on top with a special chip 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.869

 I paid two hundred and forty reais but it is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.930

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.209
 Special 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.200
