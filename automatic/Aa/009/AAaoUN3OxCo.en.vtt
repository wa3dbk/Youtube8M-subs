00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:45.580 
it any minute now
I<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:38.190> sit<00:02:38.459> no<00:02:42.350> that's<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.590> picture<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.220> cat

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
I think sit no that's a picture of cat

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.470 
I think sit no that's a picture of cat
my<00:02:46.590> cat<00:02:49.459> all<00:02:50.459> right<00:02:50.670> well<00:02:50.819> we<00:02:50.970> can't<00:02:51.180> find<00:02:51.360> that

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
my cat all right well we can't find that

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.340 
my cat all right well we can't find that
picture<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:53.250> we're<00:02:53.459> gonna<00:02:53.550> use<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.880> one

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
picture so we're gonna use this one

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.610 
picture so we're gonna use this one
screenshot<00:02:56.269> okay<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.510> think<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.080> helps<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.410> have

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
screenshot okay I think it helps to have

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.970 
screenshot okay I think it helps to have
the<00:02:58.890> pixels<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.640> 320<00:03:00.480> by<00:03:00.600> 480<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.800> last

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
the pixels on 320 by 480 but the last

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.250 
the pixels on 320 by 480 but the last
one<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.340> did<00:03:02.580> didn't<00:03:03.569> have<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.959> think<00:03:04.200> it

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
one I did didn't have that I think it

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.509 
one I did didn't have that I think it
was<00:03:04.380> 640<00:03:05.069> by<00:03:05.420> 960<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.110> I'm<00:03:07.980> pretty<00:03:08.280> sure<00:03:08.400> it's

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
was 640 by 960 so I'm pretty sure it's

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.640 
was 640 by 960 so I'm pretty sure it's
all<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> same<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.510> think<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.049> just<00:03:10.230> how

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
all the same but I think it just how

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.350 
all the same but I think it just how
much<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.980> image<00:03:11.160> you're<00:03:11.280> gonna<00:03:11.400> fit<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.640> so

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
much of the image you're gonna fit in so

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
much of the image you're gonna fit in so
320<00:03:12.810> by<00:03:12.900> 480<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.680> best<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.310> have<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.549> think

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
320 by 480 is the best to have I think

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.050 
320 by 480 is the best to have I think
