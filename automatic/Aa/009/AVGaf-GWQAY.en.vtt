00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.589
 I realize now that the car is already much more detailed in us and was 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.789
 working on reinforcing lines 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.510
 playing a little wonder do not worry about consumption and the company that 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.739
 manufactures discarded the intention is that it is not to teach whether to make a shadowing 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.200
 only now focus on the oxas areas of the 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.320
 the object 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.220
 do not do more or less a drawing of the shape of a lightweight 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.560
 and here comes a mix of the 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.080
 to him is 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.980
 working teeth by this hue 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.170
 and there try to get a little closer to the actual small holds 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.620
 details that end up making a difference on the brightness afternoons 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.800
 go publicly working all the resources you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.570
 available 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 gradin at first 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.520
 for unless you know how to work in a camp 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.040
 something we always end up risking to leave 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.649
 a little better is not so heavy 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.060
 Basso is a more or less format 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.160
 brightness area and and playing 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.250
 a little detail each 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.810
 you can get more or less 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.600
 a visual effect 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.110
 of the thing as nothing said 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.200
 I ask that down here where I was straight I have already rounded round sheen already 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.510
 I even made a little more rounding to see a cap 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.770
 close the door you have to do it because if the caetano explained gil 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.380
 is therefore of double-hand object 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.700
 tell 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.280
 at the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.130
 or compare in person 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 the crib in size and more or less similar to each one of them 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.860
 of the news here we were intentional of the act the person who ended up 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.580
 opting for this figure more 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.130
 we go to people has as object average parameter of 20 measures of each 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.669
 one that fits a house in search of three every four times or so here in the 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.649
 so the paper has the first leadership isolated 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.829
 more or less this size has to fit more three other mentor is 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.839
 more or less this proportion that I will use for each of the curves there 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.429
 and then I'm measuring 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.299
 by object format 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.299
 working these sentences curvatures 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.969
 do not come back to the bravas producer and do it 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.689
 work correctly neither in any one magic formula 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.579
 is this system can be decisive 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.079
 but I believe you doing this way as I indicated starting with the 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.369
 licensing 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:55.629
 and leaving for the object alone you can do 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.209
 a CA 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.189
 the substitute 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.239
 the comment of a little more that they is not something decent to follow 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.189
 essential for us to achieve 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.729
 better pick up these pieces form passwords here 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.899
 she from 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.209
 we played bush the hand finals 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.069
 object and achieve up to 1 appearance 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.069
 more faithful to the model we were working on 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.939
 You do not have to stop there. Many people here I work. 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.150
 Contour and then I'm going to look for Brazil's highs 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.919
 legs 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.519
 It's more or less how I would work with 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.979
 the pupil game 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.689
 the hair we work the same way it does 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.579
 The class 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.789
 the general format of the thing and pulling me the wires problem occurred 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.529
 the feeling 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.239
 from so far and so sincere walking 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.079
 the children 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.079
 I realized that with few traces it is already very close 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.069
 on the side of the real madrid is not more or less what people 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.999
 I had to do it, it's just you. 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.029
 Working 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:06.809
 the actor will it blend the finish 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.809
 rio grande do sul where necessary 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.029
 that we can 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.919
 leaves this drawing very close to the real there 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.680
 I'll show you later 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.499
 this object 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.900
 along with two others 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.900
 ansa 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.870
 the teddy bear and a 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.490
 the baby slipper 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.610
 so that we can 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.849
 make a composition also with with objects I will make available 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.580
 Blog Archive 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.789
 isolated from the most interesting objects you have to do this exercise 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.050
 with ready objects 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.900
 for now only
