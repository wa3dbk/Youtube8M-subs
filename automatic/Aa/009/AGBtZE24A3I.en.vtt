00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
options against you and it does work out
really<00:01:23.549> well<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.570> run<00:01:24.689> like

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
really well also you can run like

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.899 
really well also you can run like
pixelate<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.409> hyper<00:01:25.560> voice<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.189> still<00:01:26.790> get

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
pixelate with hyper voice and still get

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.640 
pixelate with hyper voice and still get
a<00:01:26.939> lot<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> damage<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.659> well<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.500> look

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
a lot of damage as well but if we look

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.280 
a lot of damage as well but if we look
at<00:01:28.770> regular<00:01:29.130> Altaria<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> same

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
at regular Altaria it can do the same

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.350 
at regular Altaria it can do the same
thing<00:01:31.530> because<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.460> defenses<00:01:32.970> don't<00:01:33.180> really

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
thing because the defenses don't really

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.819 
thing because the defenses don't really
change<00:01:33.540> too<00:01:33.750> much<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:33.990> 105<00:01:34.439> special

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
change too much you have 105 special

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.859 
change too much you have 105 special
defense<00:01:35.070> which<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.939> same<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:36.570> 90

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
defense which is the same and then 90

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.960 
defense which is the same and then 90
defense<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.439> only<00:01:37.590> 10<00:01:37.740> 20<00:01:38.549> points<00:01:38.790> lower

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
defense which is only 10 20 points lower

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
defense which is only 10 20 points lower
and<00:01:39.270> cotton<00:01:39.930> guard<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> make<00:01:40.770> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and cotton guard is going to make that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
and cotton guard is going to make that
not<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.369> matter<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.000> come<00:01:42.540> Gardens

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
not really matter because come Gardens

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.060 
not really matter because come Gardens
won't<00:01:43.020> strongest<00:01:43.409> moves<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> game<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:43.979> my

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
won't strongest moves in the game in my

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.819 
won't strongest moves in the game in my
opinion<00:01:44.100> boost<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> defense<00:01:45.390> by<00:01:45.630> 3<00:01:46.229> that

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
opinion boost the defense by 3 that

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.889 
opinion boost the defense by 3 that
means<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.130> first<00:01:47.549> usage<00:01:48.000> two<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> half

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
means on that first usage two and a half

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.929 
means on that first usage two and a half
times<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.409> defense<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
times your defense just like that and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.520 
times your defense just like that and
that's<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> help<00:01:51.780> pace<00:01:52.020> anything<00:01:52.409> that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that's going to help pace anything that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.230 
that's going to help pace anything that
outpaces<00:01:52.829> Swords<00:01:53.280> Dance<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.970> outpaces

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
outpaces Swords Dance that outpaces

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.209 
outpaces Swords Dance that outpaces
dragon<00:01:54.780> dance<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> be

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
dragon dance so it's just going to be

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.740 
dragon dance so it's just going to be
like<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.759> good<00:01:56.880> wave<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.420> opponent

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
like a really good wave if your opponent

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.450 
like a really good wave if your opponent
setting<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.110> or<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.649> don't<00:01:59.250> want<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
setting up or if you just don't want to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.789 
setting up or if you just don't want to
dive<00:01:59.670> that's<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.689> now<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.409> main

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
dive that's what you do now the main

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.469 
dive that's what you do now the main
thing<00:02:01.829> problem<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.520> though<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.060> we're

we're not going to be getting that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.819 
we're not going to be getting that

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
had to make up something on the fly but

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.390 
had to make up something on the fly but
natural<00:03:08.170> cure<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.620> something<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.040> does<00:03:09.190> that

out<00:03:50.350> from<00:03:50.500> there<00:03:50.620> but<00:03:50.830> that's<00:03:51.040> pretty<00:03:51.250> much

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
out from there but that's pretty much

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.820 
out from there but that's pretty much
what<00:03:51.610> all<00:03:51.700> Tory<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.060> going<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.300> be<00:03:52.390> up<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.830> now

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
was thinking is we do have Hays as an

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.740 
was thinking is we do have Hays as an
option<00:04:48.460> they're<00:04:48.880> trying<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.120> set<00:04:49.330> up<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.600> can

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
option they're trying to set up you can

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.390 
option they're trying to set up you can
take<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:50.020> away<00:04:50.140> from<00:04:50.290> them<00:04:50.530> instead<00:04:50.770> of<00:04:51.190> heal

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
take that away from them instead of heal

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.770 
take that away from them instead of heal
Bell<00:04:51.550> we<00:04:51.700> can<00:04:51.820> also<00:04:51.940> go<00:04:52.120> with<00:04:52.150> safeguard

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
Bell we can also go with safeguard

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.480 
Bell we can also go with safeguard
you're<00:04:53.260> gonna<00:04:53.410> be<00:04:53.530> susceptible<00:04:53.980> on<00:04:54.340> that

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
you're gonna be susceptible on that

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.740 
you're gonna be susceptible on that
first<00:04:54.700> turn<00:04:54.880> like<00:04:55.180> when<00:04:55.360> you're<00:04:55.480> setting<00:04:55.690> up

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
first turn like when you're setting up

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.180 
first turn like when you're setting up
tailwind<00:04:56.140> after<00:04:56.650> that<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:56.920> can<00:04:57.040> get

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
tailwind after that you can get

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.220 
tailwind after that you can get
safeguard<00:04:57.610> across<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.270> can<00:04:58.480> make<00:04:58.960> for

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
safeguard across and that can make for

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.750 
safeguard across and that can make for
some<00:04:59.260> good<00:04:59.440> outplay<00:04:59.740> potential<00:05:00.040> probably<00:05:00.700> the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
so he'll bail is just kind of the backup

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.570 
so he'll bail is just kind of the backup
option<00:05:05.080> safeguard<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:05.920> just<00:05:06.070> another<00:05:06.220> option
