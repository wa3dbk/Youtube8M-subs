develop those talents in the ways that
they<00:04:20.669> could<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.600> we<00:04:21.750> need<00:04:21.900> an<00:04:22.019> auditorium<00:04:22.620> we

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
they could so we need an auditorium we

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.510 
they could so we need an auditorium we
believe<00:04:23.760> strongly<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.479> getting<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:25.380> pool<00:04:25.590> we

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
believe strongly in getting a pool we

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
the lake in this area and we don't have

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.540 
the lake in this area and we don't have
the<00:04:31.110> facilities<00:04:31.650> or<00:04:31.889> capability<00:04:32.460> of

instructing<00:04:33.090> them<00:04:33.270> students<00:04:34.200> also<00:04:34.620> feel<00:04:34.830> that

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
instructing them students also feel that

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.650 
instructing them students also feel that
the<00:04:35.130> passage<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.700> bond<00:04:35.910> proposals<00:04:36.479> is

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
the passage of the bond proposals is

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.390 
the passage of the bond proposals is
necessary<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.440> improve<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.889> quality<00:04:38.100> of

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
necessary to improve the quality of

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.270 
necessary to improve the quality of
learning<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.000> school<00:04:39.240> district

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
learning in the school district

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.980 
learning in the school district
definitely<00:04:41.280> because<00:04:41.610> we<00:04:42.060> need<00:04:42.210> high<00:04:42.750> school

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
definitely because we need high school

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.240 
definitely because we need high school
with<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.169> pool<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.410> we<00:04:43.710> need<00:04:43.860> high<00:04:43.950> schools

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
with the pool and we need high schools

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.570 
with the pool and we need high schools
with<00:04:44.490> bigger<00:04:44.760> facilities<00:04:45.389> because<00:04:45.750> the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
with bigger facilities because the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.730 
with bigger facilities because the
classrooms<00:04:47.580> are<00:04:47.729> really<00:04:47.910> overcrowded<00:04:48.360> I

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
classrooms are really overcrowded I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.840 
classrooms are really overcrowded I
think<00:04:49.740> it's<00:04:49.860> kind<00:04:50.039> of<00:04:50.100> important<00:04:50.550> we<00:04:50.610> have<00:04:50.760> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
think it's kind of important we have the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.730 
think it's kind of important we have the
bond<00:04:51.090> door<00:04:51.539> thrill<00:04:51.840> this<00:04:52.289> year<00:04:52.560> especially

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
bond door thrill this year especially

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.770 
bond door thrill this year especially
we're<00:04:53.250> growing<00:04:53.699> so<00:04:53.729> much<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.419> we<00:04:54.479> don't<00:04:54.660> have

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
we're growing so much and we don't have

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.390 
we're growing so much and we don't have
any<00:04:55.020> room<00:04:55.289> they<00:04:55.680> sold<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.039> hundred<00:04:56.310> more

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
any room they sold a hundred more

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.149 
any room they sold a hundred more
parking<00:04:56.820> passes<00:04:57.000> than<00:04:57.419> they<00:04:57.539> had

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159 
parking passes than they had

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.429 
parking passes than they had
so<00:04:58.879> I<00:04:58.909> think<00:04:59.149> we're<00:04:59.509> kind<00:04:59.719> of<00:04:59.779> at<00:04:59.929> the<00:05:00.020> limit<00:05:00.349> of

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:00.439 
so I think we're kind of at the limit of

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.129 
so I think we're kind of at the limit of
