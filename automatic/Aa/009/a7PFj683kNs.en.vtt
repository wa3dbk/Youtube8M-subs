00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.490
 against attacks it was necessary to do the yoyo 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.440
 elastic 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.550

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.810
 assaults of Russian and Italian carried 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.850
 by the enthusiasm of his motivated audience 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.490
 more than ever to not disappoint him 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.420
 at the last turn coup is 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.459
 huge disappointment 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.470

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.390
 tears eyed yeah unhappy a game 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.959

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.970
 race and has several times where it rubs 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.640
 it's really strong 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.910
 I almost fell in their journey 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.920
 final the airlock sent forge hardly end I 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.149
 panic not a little but it's a little 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.759
 anything I mingle with cannes between 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.840
 legs I'm spreading to the press and 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.050
 finish with the whole group that pass me 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.060
 above we see the dance is hard 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.990
 begin for me it's not the day there 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.720
 I farted a stick very early 300 meters 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.830
 after the line is a stick all the way down 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.620
 early I thought it was my points 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.480
 not touched that after I throw it 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.140
 I take it bounces on my hand I 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.489
 loupe and I do not know the legs 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.230
 crazy but it can fix things 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.819
 sadness so after a battle at 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.890
 which two other French took 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.760
 share the representatives of the team grenoble 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.830
 northern isÃ¨re 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.870
 cyril gaillard and guillaume perrot did not 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.800
 not played the extras 3 yeah bah that's 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.590
 true with guillaume we tried everything 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.970
 because me behind the others they 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.530
 know that in the end if the strongest 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.080
 not that they are not riding a new moment 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.730
 we tried we tried if ever came out 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.130
 wheels and then my mast at the end like 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.380
 planned they go ahead and it's them 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.080
 who win 1 we try to leave and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.280
 the more we had to try not to take 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.020
 the wheel makes them leave those who were 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.610
 in front of and then we tried to do that 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.930
 but to roman claudon that you are very 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.480
 fort who came back twice to us 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.670
 and suddenly after me it was very hard 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.500
 in the last lap I dropped cirilli 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.390
 this is a sprint spell a little bit 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.710
 on interesting in like that it's 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.710
 normal we are less used to doing 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.850
 well it's gone pretty strong well placed 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.540
 and then just after departure what are you 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.100
 cane of the coup I took again rather quickly 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.640
 but I left a lot of juice for 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.550
 replace 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.880
 then after in front when it attacks the 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.480
 russian very much sensational the hi 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.640
 I think that roller skiing on its own 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.010
 in skiing in general what we have 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.990
 proved we just showed it and 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.540
 sensational new gyan we Lorraine 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.890
 were great we expected we were hoping 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.530
 a success we were not expecting 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.800
 popular success really today I 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.990
 think 2000-2005 160 500 people sus 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.500
 around the park where it was really facing 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.500
 at fantastic
