00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.590
 the construction of the aerial tramway on the piz val 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.650
 Gronda is for everyone involved 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.850
 company a challenging project 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.530
 In addition to the protect also provides 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.430
 especially the construction of the mountain station 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.110
 a challenge there over 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.090
 2800 meters above sea level in the summer 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.010
 snowfalls and gale-force storms 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.820
 possible are the difficulty in the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.200
 plant are the given conditions before 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.620
 betrayed specifications of nature conservation, etc 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.650
 to that comes of course that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.970
 geographic location of the hill station 2800 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.369
 meter difficult geological situation 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.300
 the technology of the technology a 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:17.020
 all calls come in ishgl that 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.750
 best thing is there is not enough in it 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.259
 so immensely pretty much everything there is 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.960
 gives 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:27.009
 if you a bit what the zuleger 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.490
 Knife and I think that will not happen 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.740
 be in the limelight here 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.610
 the construction period is very short or the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.150
 implementation time and is available immediately 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.250
 state security has to start 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.479
 So it's more or just running at the moment 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.119
 less according to plan 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.700
 Of course, the uncertainty is certain 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.540
 the weather and the construction social in the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.540
 Workshop 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.490
 but we are actually confident 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.490
 that one as planned 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.950
 the temperature makes a problem hum 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.540
 the most important thing is that the weather 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.760
 fit 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.680
 winter and no fog so you just 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.849
 the flight transports and assembly 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 transport by helicopter 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.890
 can perform 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.970
 we have a top team in the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.680
 train station as well as the supports 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.680
 busy they are very motivated clear 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.540
 such new snowfalls dampen those 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.939
 then again once you have the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.010
 diet has misplaced everything and there is 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.170
 then 20-30 cm of fresh snow 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.090
 but on the whole it works 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.870
 very well we are in the schedule 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.000
 we expect that we will be up to 20 august 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.099
 the concrete work in the workshop area 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.170
 can conclude and then with the 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.170
 cable car technical assembly start
