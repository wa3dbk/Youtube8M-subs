now

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
now

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.770 
now
starting<00:00:12.380> now<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.210> what<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> want<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.630> do

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
starting now and what I want you to do

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 
starting now and what I want you to do
is<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.199> time<00:00:16.410> how<00:00:16.740> long<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.130> takes<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> boot<00:00:17.609> up

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
is to time how long it takes to boot up

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.029 
is to time how long it takes to boot up
as<00:00:19.039> you<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.260> relatively<00:00:22.260> older

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
as you know this is a relatively older

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.060 
as you know this is a relatively older
laptop<00:00:23.789> although<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.720> great<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.260> that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
laptop although it is a great one that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.429 
laptop although it is a great one that
they'll<00:00:26.310> produced<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:28.279> twelve<00:00:29.279> hundred

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
they'll produced it's twelve hundred

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:39.319 
they'll produced it's twelve hundred
megahertz<00:00:31.550> with<00:00:33.739> anywhere<00:00:34.739> from<00:00:35.780> 256<00:00:36.860> to<00:00:38.329> 512

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
megahertz with anywhere from 256 to 512

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.459 
megahertz with anywhere from 256 to 512
of<00:00:39.710> megabytes<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.950> memory<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:44.840> very<00:00:45.840> light

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of megabytes of memory and very light

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.700 
of megabytes of memory and very light
weight<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> portable<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.289> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
weight and portable and you can see the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.639 
weight and portable and you can see the
music's<00:00:50.010> already<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.930> if<00:00:51.930> you've<00:00:52.320> timed

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
music's already on so if you've timed

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
music's already on so if you've timed
this<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.100> should<00:00:53.399> take<00:00:53.550> anywhere<00:00:53.760> from<00:00:53.910> 30<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this it should take anywhere from 30 to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.950 
this it should take anywhere from 30 to
35<00:00:55.050> seconds<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.250> boot<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.480> very

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
35 seconds to boot up and that's very

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.860 
35 seconds to boot up and that's very
quick<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.829> any<00:00:59.070> computer<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.300> but

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
quick for any computer really but

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.520 
quick for any computer really but
especially<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:03.090> bit

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
especially for one that is a little bit

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.219 
especially for one that is a little bit
older<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:07.460> next<00:01:08.460> demonstration<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
older now the next demonstration is

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
older now the next demonstration is
actually<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.610> opening<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.700> an<00:01:11.850> application

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
actually in opening up an application

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.390 
actually in opening up an application
and<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.850> Microsoft<00:01:15.650> Word<00:01:16.650> which<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and I have here Microsoft Word which is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
and I have here Microsoft Word which is
relatively<00:01:18.090> large<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.770> we'll<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.920> how

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
relatively large and we'll see how

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
relatively large and we'll see how
quickly<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> boots<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.409> click<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.450> one<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
quickly it boots up click and one and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.640 
quickly it boots up click and one and
two<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.890> two<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.880> three<00:01:27.030> seconds<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:28.350> it's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
two and two or three seconds it's it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.429 
two and two or three seconds it's it's
up<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.950> running<00:01:31.640> repeating<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.439> produces

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
up and running repeating this produces

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.999 
up and running repeating this produces
an<00:01:34.590> instantaneous<00:01:36.650> opening<00:01:38.509> now<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:40.049> you're

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
an instantaneous opening now if you're

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.219 
an instantaneous opening now if you're
going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> buy<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.340> computer<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.229> probably

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
going to buy this computer it's probably

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
going to buy this computer it's probably
going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:44.930> surf<00:01:45.930> wirelessly<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.479> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
going to be to surf wirelessly and I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
going to be to surf wirelessly and I
have<00:01:48.720> an<00:01:48.869> internal<00:01:49.229> card<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.920> an<00:01:50.040> internal

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
shows you the C and the D Drive this is

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.840 
shows you the C and the D Drive this is
actually<00:02:56.170> one<00:02:56.470> hard<00:02:56.710> drive<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.280> partition

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
actually one hard drive that I partition

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.450 
actually one hard drive that I partition
into<00:02:58.150> into<00:02:58.780> two<00:02:58.960> partitions<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.310> place<00:03:00.910> the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
into into two partitions and I place the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.380 
into into two partitions and I place the
the<00:03:03.460> files<00:03:04.200> page<00:03:05.200> file<00:03:05.470> on<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:06.670> D<00:03:06.850> Drive<00:03:07.090> and

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the files page file on the D Drive and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.110 
the files page file on the D Drive and
this<00:03:08.230> also<00:03:08.440> helps<00:03:08.770> access<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:12.120> applications

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
this also helps access the applications

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.949 
this also helps access the applications
much<00:03:13.300> more<00:03:13.480> quickly<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:15.040> seems<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.400> work<00:03:15.959> now

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
much more quickly it seems to work now

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.040 
much more quickly it seems to work now
finally<00:03:17.470> I'm<00:03:17.739> going<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.190> shut<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.459> down<00:03:18.610> and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.070 
finally I'm going to shut it down and
this<00:03:20.050> is<00:03:20.110> my<00:03:20.590> other<00:03:20.770> selling<00:03:21.190> point<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.700> that

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
this is my other selling point is that

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.370 
this is my other selling point is that
with<00:03:23.080> most<00:03:23.320> computers<00:03:23.470> it's<00:03:24.130> going<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.520> take

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380
