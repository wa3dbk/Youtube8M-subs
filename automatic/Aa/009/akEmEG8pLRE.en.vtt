00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello friends here we are with a new 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.730
 video and today tutorial of 2014 today 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.889
 We will learn to defend or how to handle 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.230
 our defense and avoid being sent 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.200
 those empty balls that hurt so much 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.270
 they make us and well the problem more than 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.220
 everything is that when our 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.930
 rival has a ball our defense is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.699
 for almost in the middle of the court 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.100
 when it's a backlash as well as what 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.689
 can see here is there 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.670
 all are almost standing in the middle of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.349
 the court allowing our 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.280
 opposing player can send a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.930
 I hit the back of the defense and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.640
 usually if the front of the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.129
 opposing team is much faster 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.110
 we are always going to win the race and so 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.070
 She will be alone against the goalkeeper as 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.890
 today we will learn 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.170
 how to prevent our defense from saying 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.930
 that stops there how to control our 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 defense preventing them from receiving 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.400
 front that ball that hurt so much 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.560
 makes us 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.140
 but the truth is very simple to use 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.770
 I think that pp 2013 did not exist 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.440
 option and now defend our defense 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.120
 is for almost half of the court 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.590
 pressing the arrows in both 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.380
 playstation as in xbox towards the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.580
 left keeping the pressure going to 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.530
 appear a radar line 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.750
 telling us that the defense is 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.550
 retreating in this case 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.750
 here we have another example in our 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.550
 defense is for in the middle of the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.500
 court as you can see there then 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.210
 than moving the arrow on the left 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.729
 keeping the pressure on our defense 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.619
 will go back with that we avoid 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.000
 send the ball or if they send 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.740
 the ball our defense is going to 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.780
 be far enough behind 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.180
 intercept the ball is the example 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.650
 we twist the defense already as our 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.260
 defense is well behind there is no where 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.390
 send the ball there is another small example 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.200
 let's see where we are at 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.090
 back the defense going good here them 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.130
 I'm going to show another small example 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.420
 our defense stands in the middle 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.880
 of the court as you can see in the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.850
 radar we push them back 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.170
 when the forward receives the pass 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.509
 our defense is already prepared in 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 is so ahead so we're going to 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.890
 to be able to stand will not have space 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.599
 to run or win at speed 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.789
 It is a very good strategy for 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.840
 defend all this type of pelotazos 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.150
 you go through vacuum or you can prevent the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.800
 defense up so much because usually 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.269
 always our defense is going to stop 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.700
 in the middle of the court that I think 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.819
 a very serious mistake any pitch 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.249
 it can be fatal 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.379
 and there is the good repetition also them 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.819
 I want to comment that if you do not want to 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.620
 that if they want to advance the defense 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.450
 we can press towards the sense 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.980
 opposite is done to the right what 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.989
 we keep pressed and our defense 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.650
 will go up many times we can 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.319
 used to force the misplaced 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.329
 or so that our pressure is 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.329
 make more up but you have to have a lot 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.370
 careful because also when going down a lot in 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.709
 many times the defense are going to 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.290
 create spaces here in the room 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.200
 field and therefore our rival always to 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.519
 master the ball is only to use it when 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.480
 We are hiring when we are going to 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.459
 run to the counterattack 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.200
 Do not use it always because it's going to 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.269
 generate spaces in the court room 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.670
 that can be taken advantage of by our 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.620
 rival to touch the ball and can us 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.690
 cause problems good friends here 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.670
 we come to the end of the video do not forget
