b/e ah you don't remember so do you
gradually<00:02:03.170> lose<00:02:03.979> your<00:02:04.250> memory<00:02:04.460> when<00:02:05.329> you<00:02:05.450> die

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
so what happens you know why are you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.940 
so what happens you know why are you
losing<00:02:15.769> your<00:02:15.950> memory<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:17.170> know<00:02:18.170> you've<00:02:18.560> already

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
losing your memory I know you've already

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.830 
losing your memory I know you've already
said<00:02:19.220> it's<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.459> transaction<00:02:20.120> by<00:02:20.269> transaction

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
said it's a transaction by transaction

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:42.990 
said it's a transaction by transaction
to<00:02:20.959> what<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:33.250> v<00:02:34.250> e<00:02:39.040> universe<00:02:40.040> a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.180 

translational<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.360> universe<00:02:45.160> like<00:02:46.160> a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
translational to universe like a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.300 
translational to universe like a
universal<00:02:46.549> consciousness<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:51.130> then<00:02:52.130> what

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
universal consciousness and then what

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:09.699 
universal consciousness and then what
happens<00:02:53.440> ar<00:02:54.440> e<00:02:56.319> I<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.709> incarnation

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.759 

so<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.280> pass<00:03:11.519> over<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.840> still<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.290> memories

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
so you pass over you still have memories

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.929 
so you pass over you still have memories
you<00:03:14.430> gradually<00:03:14.760> forget<00:03:15.209> those<00:03:15.420> memories<00:03:16.939> you

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
you gradually forget those memories you

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.399 
you gradually forget those memories you
become<00:03:18.239> part<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.689> the<00:03:18.750> universal

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
become part of the universal

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.949 
become part of the universal
consciousness<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.760> then<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.810> get

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
consciousness and then you get

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.390 
consciousness and then you get
reincarnated<00:03:27.260> so<00:03:28.260> what<00:03:28.409> happens<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:29.310> your

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
reincarnated so what happens to your

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.539 
reincarnated so what happens to your
memories<00:03:29.959> do<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.110> take<00:03:31.260> them<00:03:31.470> with<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.860> when

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
memories do you take them with you when

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:43.819 
memories do you take them with you when
you<00:03:32.640> get<00:03:32.730> be<00:03:32.879> incarnated<00:03:36.290> No<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:42.440> God<00:03:43.440> forgive

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.270 
you get be incarnated No so God forgive
me<00:03:43.859> while<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.099> can<00:03:44.250> finger<00:03:44.579> quite<00:03:44.790> difficult<00:03:46.280> to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
me while I can finger quite difficult to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.420 
me while I can finger quite difficult to
keep<00:03:47.400> up<00:03:47.549> with<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.950> is<00:03:56.159> that<00:03:56.190> how

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
keep up with you so is that how

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.030 
keep up with you so is that how
evolution<00:03:57.150> works<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.930> love<00:04:00.930> life<00:04:01.409> to<00:04:01.829> gain

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
evolution works you love life to gain

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.259 
evolution works you love life to gain
experiences<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:04.790> then<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:05.940> take<00:04:06.150> those

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
experiences and then you take those

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.149 
experiences and then you take those
experiences<00:04:06.930> with<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.819> when<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:08.909> cross<00:04:09.150> over

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
experiences with you when you cross over

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.900 
experiences with you when you cross over
you<00:04:11.159> get<00:04:11.370> reincarnated<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:13.549> then<00:04:14.549> that's<00:04:14.790> how

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
you get reincarnated and then that's how

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.170 
you get reincarnated and then that's how
evolution<00:04:15.209> was<00:04:16.310> because<00:04:17.539> you<00:04:18.539> are<00:04:19.970> even<00:04:20.970> find

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
evolution was because you are even find

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.719 
evolution was because you are even find
the<00:04:21.269> words<00:04:24.199> yeah<00:04:25.199> you<00:04:25.260> know<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:26.490> know<00:04:26.610> what

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
the words yeah you know you know what

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.310 
the words yeah you know you know what
I'm<00:04:26.789> trying<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.090> say<00:04:27.210> Mike<00:04:27.539> but<00:04:27.810> I'm<00:04:27.840> trying<00:04:28.260> to

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
I'm trying to say Mike but I'm trying to

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
I'm trying to say Mike but I'm trying to
put<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.560> across<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:29.039> you<00:04:29.220> triples<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:32.280> you

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
put it across to you triples so you

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.670 
put it across to you triples so you
remember<00:04:33.090> what<00:04:33.539> you've<00:04:33.720> done<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.199> a<00:04:34.289> past<00:04:34.560> life

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
remember what you've done in a past life

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.080 
remember what you've done in a past life
you<00:04:35.070> take<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.430> with<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.729> will<00:04:35.880> need<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.000> be

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
you take it with you will need to be

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.200 
you take it with you will need to be
incarnated<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.139> that's<00:04:37.349> why<00:04:37.760> people<00:04:38.760> evolve

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
incarnated and that's why people evolve

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.800 
incarnated and that's why people evolve
that's<00:04:39.690> why<00:04:40.220> we<00:04:41.220> lost<00:04:41.490> or<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:42.030> use<00:04:42.120> that's<00:04:42.539> why

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
that's why we lost or to use that's why

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.659 
that's why we lost or to use that's why
