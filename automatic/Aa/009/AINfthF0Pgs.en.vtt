00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.319
 I think we didn't do what we said before 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.990
 games 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.260
 what did the coach ask us to do and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.929
 there was a terrible defense they send 90 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.440
 points and we are too small to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.590
 to win 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.020
 you can't beat so little scoring from them 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.970
 great fans they drove ahead we 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 knew that the opponent would fight from 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.920
 of all strength and with all our energy we are not 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.199
 able to resist them and curtain the game 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:35.940
 we need to fight their energy and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:37.290
 I hope then we win if calls to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.660
 the bright side then because it 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.270
 defeat happened now something later 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.710
 I think we carried our lesson and unique 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 more mistakes like today i don't know what 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 exactly happened we will see tomorrow 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.670
 record of matches is visible but exactly for them 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.379
 became the key to victory that they 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 left our big spoiled to us 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.739
 paint game 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.739
 on 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.090
 forced to throw from afar cannot be won 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:11.790
 throwing away 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 throws from afar in the past but yes there is such 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.600
 the situation turned out like a map now you 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.180
 then peeking out to the third match and and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.690
 everything was good as I think they are 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.610
 they feel now now they are the same as 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.420
 last year we were supposedly fine 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.000
 play at home 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.650
 sure they still do a lot of things to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.570
 whip yourself even more 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.509
 all talk about what we can 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.580
 Russian play on equal terms and on Friday 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.740
 but I can not and try to play hard from 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.020
 all the way we tried when i'm cooper 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.020
 bolts 2012 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:55.390
 looking you forward 4 matches you need 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:57.579
 change we need to each appear more often 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.590
 from the sword for too long we hold it 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.630
 your hands while partners or 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.549
 free but not only that you 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.189
 missed a lot of shots that 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.019
 we usually usually score the very beginning 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.290
 you can see it because skip video seven 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.879
 points we need protection for them today 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.379
 there was strong support they it 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.989
 felt were beginning to argue the department 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.780
 it did not want to spend much more than we 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.000
 they beat us themselves all the time years and 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.680
 earning points for her was powerful 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.220
 support and they completely by this 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.220
 took advantage
