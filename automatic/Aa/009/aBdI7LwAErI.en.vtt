00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.620
 hello girls pudding recipe 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.200
 Neapolitan in today express and then we are going to 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.930
 see how it is done and good as the recipe 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.940
 it says it's going to be a Neapolitan flan in 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.070
 today expresses so we need the mold 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.990
 and we are going to put 4 tablespoons of 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.510
 sugar that are what we are going to do 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.720
 The candy 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.150
 and the ingredients to liquefy are 3 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.239
 teaspoons vanilla a can of milk 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.500
 evaporated a can of condensed milk 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.860
 100 milliliters of milk from which 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.320
 you want and 5 whole eggs now 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.100
 so let's make the candy then 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.540
 we 're going to put it on medium heat and what 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.400
 we have to be checking so that 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.620
 burn us because if we burn the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.239
 caramel is the mass of the bitter 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.980
 then you have to be moving 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.980
 constantly so that it does not burn 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.770
 candy is already going to wait for 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.280
 cool down a bit and then we go with 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.280
 the liquid ingredients to grind the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.740
 and well here they do not reach to listen 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.030
 but because the candy is already thundering 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.590
 because it is already cooling then 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.750
 right now we have our mix 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.500
 list we can really do 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.500
 they have the mold 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.050
 cover it to be able to put it in the old one and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.600
 here I already have my flan and cover it and then 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.580
 it's ready to be cooked, we're going to 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.880
 be firing at medium-high fire is 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.570
 important that your daughter has the capital 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.650
 from the start of cooking and good 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.530
 now he is already taking 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.940
 let's leave 20 minutes with the flame 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.280
 equal high 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.440
 since they spent 20 minutes what 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 let's do is let it cool down to 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.800
 I can put it in the refrigerator so 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.990
 less about 2 hours so you can 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.670
 unmold and know richer and the only thing 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.310
 what we are going to do is pass a knife 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.590
 all over the shore so that if something 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.599
 it was stuck you can unmold 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.370
 and well that's how our flower looks 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:31.420
 Neapolitan I hope you liked the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.420
