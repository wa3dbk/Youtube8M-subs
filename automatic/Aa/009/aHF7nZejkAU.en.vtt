70-inch tripod when it's fully extended

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.509 
70-inch tripod when it's fully extended
so<00:02:35.019> that's<00:02:35.230> about<00:02:35.470> 10<00:02:35.709> inches<00:02:35.890> more<00:02:36.220> than<00:02:36.400> that

so that's about 10 inches more than that

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.220

inches it's a four point one pounds so a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.420 
inches it's a four point one pounds so a
little<00:02:48.430> bit<00:02:48.579> heavier<00:02:48.970> than<00:02:49.030> usual<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:51.220> got

ended up returning because I was not

fond<00:03:27.519> of<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:32.680> how<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.430> worked<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:34.000> mean<00:03:34.239> it's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
fond of the of how it worked I mean it's

a<00:03:34.540> very<00:03:34.780> nice<00:03:34.930> tripod<00:03:35.560> just<00:03:35.590> really<00:03:36.040> wasn't<00:03:36.220> my

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
a very nice tripod just really wasn't my

a very nice tripod just really wasn't my
speed<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.970> was<00:03:37.090> awkward<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.600> use<00:03:38.049> just<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:39.070> my

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220

opinion<00:03:39.670> don't<00:03:39.850> let<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.209> stop<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.810> from<00:03:40.840> not

opinion don't let that stop you from not
getting<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.079> but<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.620> more<00:03:45.190> my

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
in my opinion so the back to this right

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.830 
in my opinion so the back to this right
here<00:03:51.060> seems<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.239> be<00:03:52.389> very<00:03:52.600> well<00:03:53.519> seems<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.639> be

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
it seems very well constructed it's got

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:23.930 
it seems very well constructed it's got
a<00:04:14.250> double<00:04:17.030> it's<00:04:18.030> got<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.209> double<00:04:22.490> level<00:04:23.490> there<00:04:23.729> a

a double it's got a double level there a
balance<00:04:24.600> level<00:04:25.110> I'm<00:04:25.380> trying<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.860> say<00:04:27.139> so

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
balance level I'm trying to say so

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.070 
balance level I'm trying to say so
that's<00:04:28.260> pretty<00:04:28.650> cool<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:30.300> seems<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.900> be<00:04:31.050> a

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
that's pretty cool that seems to be a

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.520 
that's pretty cool that seems to be a

yeah<00:05:58.560> it's<00:05:59.330> appears<00:06:00.330> to<00:06:00.509> be<00:06:00.630> very<00:06:00.960> very<00:06:01.229> well

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
yeah it's appears to be very very well

think this would really complement the
camcorder<00:06:11.310> itself<00:06:13.430> and<00:06:14.430> give<00:06:14.759> it<00:06:14.880> a<00:06:14.969> real

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
camcorder itself and give it a real

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.620 
camcorder itself and give it a real
touch<00:06:15.419> of<00:06:15.599> some<00:06:15.780> class<00:06:16.050> so<00:06:16.880> anyway<00:06:17.880> that's<00:06:18.449> my

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
touch of some class so anyway that's my

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.980 
touch of some class so anyway that's my
unboxing<00:06:19.440> for<00:06:19.650> the<00:06:19.770> Sun<00:06:20.039> PEC<00:06:20.630> I'm<00:06:21.630> gonna<00:06:21.810> go

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
unboxing for the Sun PEC I'm gonna go

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.899 
unboxing for the Sun PEC I'm gonna go
ahead<00:06:22.139> and<00:06:22.409> shoot<00:06:22.590> another<00:06:22.770> video<00:06:23.370> with<00:06:23.699> my

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
ahead and shoot another video with my

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.700 
ahead and shoot another video with my
cell<00:06:24.240> phone<00:06:24.599> on<00:06:24.840> here<00:06:25.490> showing<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:27.710> camcorder

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
cell phone on here showing the camcorder

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.969 
cell phone on here showing the camcorder
on<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.219> tripod<00:06:29.729> so<00:06:30.199> I'll<00:06:31.199> be<00:06:31.289> back<00:06:31.500> in<00:06:31.530> just<00:06:31.830> a

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
on the tripod so I'll be back in just a

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.320 
on the tripod so I'll be back in just a
minute

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.350 

all<00:06:34.810> right<00:06:34.930> so<00:06:35.169> here's<00:06:35.530> my<00:06:35.620> camcorder<00:06:36.610> sitting

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
all right so here's my camcorder sitting

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.809 
all right so here's my camcorder sitting
on<00:06:37.509> the<00:06:37.720> new<00:06:37.870> Sun<00:06:38.199> Peck<00:06:40.139> 7000<00:06:41.250> ultra<00:06:42.250> tripod

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
on the new Sun Peck 7000 ultra tripod

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.680 
on the new Sun Peck 7000 ultra tripod
here<00:06:43.139> as<00:06:44.139> you<00:06:44.349> can<00:06:44.500> see<00:06:44.770> the<00:06:45.639> black<00:06:45.879> complement

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
here as you can see the black complement

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.430 
here as you can see the black complement
the<00:06:46.870> black<00:06:47.050> tripod<00:06:47.590> complements<00:06:48.250> the<00:06:48.400> black

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
the black tripod complements the black

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.040 
the black tripod complements the black
shape<00:06:50.440> or<00:06:50.889> the<00:06:51.129> black<00:06:51.310> color<00:06:51.610> on<00:06:51.849> my<00:06:55.050> my

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
shape or the black color on my my

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.790 
shape or the black color on my my
camcorder<00:06:56.319> there<00:06:56.830> I<00:06:58.259> think<00:06:59.259> it<00:06:59.349> adds<00:06:59.530> a<00:06:59.650> real

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
camcorder there I think it adds a real

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.330 
camcorder there I think it adds a real
touch<00:07:00.009> of<00:07:00.190> some<00:07:00.370> class<00:07:00.639> and<00:07:04.979> let's<00:07:05.979> see<00:07:06.220> how

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
touch of some class and let's see how

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.020 
touch of some class and let's see how
this<00:07:06.490> looks

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
this looks

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.740 
this looks
oh<00:07:07.139> yeah<00:07:09.060> very<00:07:10.060> nice

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
oh yeah very nice

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.909 
oh yeah very nice
so<00:07:12.300> hopefully<00:07:14.340> this<00:07:15.340> will<00:07:15.400> last<00:07:16.270> a<00:07:16.509> lot<00:07:16.719> longer

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
so hopefully this will last a lot longer

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.809 
so hopefully this will last a lot longer
then<00:07:17.919> some<00:07:18.370> of<00:07:18.490> the<00:07:18.580> other<00:07:19.050> tripods<00:07:20.050> I<00:07:20.259> had

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 
then some of the other tripods I had

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.189 
then some of the other tripods I had
I've<00:07:21.819> been<00:07:22.180> in<00:07:22.300> the<00:07:22.389> bad<00:07:22.539> habit<00:07:22.930> of<00:07:22.960> buying

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
I've been in the bad habit of buying

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.459 
I've been in the bad habit of buying
some<00:07:23.500> cheaper<00:07:23.979> tripods<00:07:24.550> and<00:07:25.110> this<00:07:26.110> one<00:07:26.259> wasn't

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:26.469 
some cheaper tripods and this one wasn't

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:28.469 
some cheaper tripods and this one wasn't
ultra<00:07:27.370> expensive<00:07:27.729> like<00:07:28.090> some<00:07:28.300> of<00:07:28.389> the

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 
ultra expensive like some of the

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.290 
ultra expensive like some of the
higher-end<00:07:28.690> men's<00:07:29.139> photos<00:07:29.650> or<00:07:30.550> mod<00:07:30.879> photos

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
higher-end men's photos or mod photos

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.240 
higher-end men's photos or mod photos
rather<00:07:31.479> they<00:07:32.440> weren't<00:07:32.620> as<00:07:32.710> expensive<00:07:33.159> with

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250 
rather they weren't as expensive with

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.469 
rather they weren't as expensive with
some<00:07:33.400> of<00:07:33.490> the<00:07:33.550> higher<00:07:33.699> and<00:07:33.940> month<00:07:34.120> for<00:07:34.360> this

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 
some of the higher and month for this

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:39.450 
some of the higher and month for this
but<00:07:35.789> and<00:07:36.789> there's<00:07:37.030> still<00:07:37.330> a<00:07:38.130> pretty<00:07:39.130> high-end

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.460 
but and there's still a pretty high-end

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.899 
but and there's still a pretty high-end
device<00:07:40.029> compared<00:07:40.870> to<00:07:41.490> say<00:07:42.490> craftsman<00:07:43.389> or

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:44.909 
device compared to say craftsman or

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:49.230 
device compared to say craftsman or
amazonbasics<00:07:45.909> or<00:07:47.580> something<00:07:48.580> like<00:07:48.699> that<00:07:48.759> or

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 
amazonbasics or something like that or

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.230 
amazonbasics or something like that or
Maxell<00:07:50.169> but<00:07:51.330> overall<00:07:52.330> I<00:07:53.759> think<00:07:54.759> it<00:07:55.090> looks

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 
Maxell but overall I think it looks

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.760 
Maxell but overall I think it looks
really<00:07:55.479> good<00:07:55.750> and<00:07:55.810> it<00:07:55.990> complements<00:07:56.500> my

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:56.770 
really good and it complements my

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:02.189 
really good and it complements my
camcorder<00:07:57.729> very<00:07:58.599> very<00:07:58.930> well<00:07:59.229> so<00:08:01.199> hopefully

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.199 
camcorder very very well so hopefully

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.999 
camcorder very very well so hopefully
this<00:08:02.380> will<00:08:02.560> last<00:08:02.889> me<00:08:03.099> for<00:08:03.400> many<00:08:03.550> years<00:08:03.639> to<00:08:04.000> come

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:05.009 
this will last me for many years to come

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.619 
this will last me for many years to come
