00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
do it so I'm just gonna cover back this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.609 
do it so I'm just gonna cover back this
is<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> looks<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:23.540> that's<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.780> I'm<00:01:25.409> just

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
is what it looks like that's it I'm just

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.960 
is what it looks like that's it I'm just
pumping<00:01:26.009> these<00:01:26.759> cups<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.049> creating<00:01:28.970> some

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
pumping these cups and creating some

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.640 
pumping these cups and creating some
suction<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:30.750> what<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.020> doing<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.470> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
suction and then what it's doing is it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.300 
suction and then what it's doing is it
allowing<00:01:32.420> just<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.740> blood<00:01:35.070> flow

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
allowing just you know more blood flow

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.999 
allowing just you know more blood flow
to<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.030> areas<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.680> upper

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to get into these areas and this upper

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.760 
to get into these areas and this upper
back<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.700> helps<00:01:39.119> controls<00:01:40.110> really

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
back here really helps controls really

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.179 
back here really helps controls really
helps<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> lung<00:01:41.460> functions<00:01:43.009> it's<00:01:44.009> also

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
helps with the lung functions it's also

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.590 
helps with the lung functions it's also
good<00:01:45.110> for<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.670> bring<00:01:47.850> more<00:01:48.000> blood<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
good for all the to bring more blood to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:10.499 
good for all the to bring more blood to
the<00:01:48.780> face

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.740 

it<00:02:11.080> looks<00:02:11.260> like<00:02:11.409> it<00:02:11.560> hurts<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:12.129> it<00:02:12.280> doesn't

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it looks like it hurts but it doesn't

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.780 
it looks like it hurts but it doesn't
looks<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.810> lot<00:02:13.930> like<00:02:14.110> an<00:02:14.290> alien<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:18.340> usually<00:02:18.670> if

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
looks a lot like an alien but usually if

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.580 
looks a lot like an alien but usually if
I<00:02:18.909> have<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> cold<00:02:19.329> this<00:02:20.019> makes<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.379> go<00:02:20.500> away

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
I have a cold this makes it go away

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.080 
I have a cold this makes it go away
really<00:02:20.860> fast<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.129> is<00:02:27.250> maybe<00:02:27.579> how<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.849> would

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
really fast so this is maybe how I would

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.649 
really fast so this is maybe how I would
start<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:29.409> I<00:02:29.650> would<00:02:29.799> just<00:02:29.950> place<00:02:30.269> these<00:02:31.269> six

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
start and I would just place these six

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.649 
start and I would just place these six
cups<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.500> her<00:02:32.769> back<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.370> her<00:02:33.489> up<00:02:33.640> her<00:02:33.760> back<00:02:33.940> and

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
cups on her back and her up her back and

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.819 
cups on her back and her up her back and
then<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.900> would<00:02:35.049> leave<00:02:35.170> them<00:02:35.379> there<00:02:35.500> for<00:02:35.769> about

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
then I would leave them there for about

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.030 
then I would leave them there for about
ten<00:02:36.129> minutes<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:37.140> she<00:02:38.140> was<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:38.349> relaxed<00:02:38.890> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
ten minutes and she was just relaxed and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.309 
ten minutes and she was just relaxed and
I<00:02:39.190> would<00:02:39.370> put<00:02:39.579> a<00:02:39.609> heat<00:02:39.819> lamp<00:02:39.849> make<00:02:40.750> sure<00:02:40.900> she's

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
I would put a heat lamp make sure she's

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.500 
I would put a heat lamp make sure she's
well<00:02:41.500> covered<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.129> she<00:02:42.760> feels<00:02:42.940> him<00:02:43.060> warm<00:02:43.299> and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
well covered and she feels him warm and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.899 
well covered and she feels him warm and
comfortable<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.769> most<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.280> time<00:02:45.430> she

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909
