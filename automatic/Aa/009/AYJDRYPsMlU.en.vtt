that<00:00:25.859> they've<00:00:26.449> tried<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.660> innovate<00:00:27.990> into<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that they've tried to innovate into a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.209 
that they've tried to innovate into a
few<00:00:28.890> bucks<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:30.170> I'm<00:00:31.170> saying<00:00:31.890> I'm<00:00:32.040> sorry

but<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.820> horrible<00:00:33.270> idea<00:00:33.450> it'd<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.469> good<00:00:34.890> if

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
but it's a horrible idea it'd be good if

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.650 
but it's a horrible idea it'd be good if
they<00:00:35.250> actually<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.880> put<00:00:36.239> some<00:00:36.390> thought<00:00:36.600> into

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
they actually like put some thought into

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.290 
they actually like put some thought into
it<00:00:36.930> because<00:00:37.710> all<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> spin<00:00:38.550> boxes<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.030> break

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

your<00:00:56.110> spin<00:00:56.800> wave<00:00:57.129> annoyed<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.500> little<00:00:59.860> I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
your spin wave annoyed it's a little I

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.770 
your spin wave annoyed it's a little I
think<00:01:00.489> it's<00:01:00.610> in<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.820> balcony<00:01:01.030> on<00:01:01.540> Ceres<00:01:03.780> very

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
think it's in the balcony on Ceres very

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.600 
think it's in the balcony on Ceres very
nice<00:01:05.050> walk<00:01:05.409> young<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:07.180> spinning<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:08.860> fixed<00:01:09.400> I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
nice walk young the spinning is fixed I

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.399 
nice walk young the spinning is fixed I
would<00:01:09.729> really<00:01:10.210> try<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.659> get<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> few<00:01:11.110> more<00:01:11.290> of

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
would really try to get a few more of

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.540 
would really try to get a few more of
these<00:01:11.530> I'd<00:01:11.770> probably<00:01:11.950> get<00:01:12.130> one<00:01:12.280> in<00:01:12.430> every

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
these I'd probably get one in every

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.380 
these I'd probably get one in every
element<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:14.170> if<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.340> look<00:01:15.729> at<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:15.909> spin

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
element but if you look at the spin

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.940 
element but if you look at the spin
Raven<00:01:16.750> art<00:01:16.899> I<00:01:17.020> think<00:01:17.050> they<00:01:17.320> did<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.500> very<00:01:17.800> good

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
Raven art I think they did a very good

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.210 
Raven art I think they did a very good
job<00:01:18.130> renovating<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.270> rave<00:01:19.420> annoyed<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:21.040> can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
job renovating the rave annoyed you can

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.469 
job renovating the rave annoyed you can
notice<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:21.700> has<00:01:21.790> hands<00:01:23.850> actual<00:01:24.850> hands<00:01:25.300> right

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
notice it has hands actual hands right

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.700 
notice it has hands actual hands right
there<00:01:26.759> here's<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.869> innovates<00:01:29.410> with<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
there here's what innovates with the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.270 
there here's what innovates with the
spinning<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:31.050> prong<00:01:32.050> right<00:01:32.259> there<00:01:32.470> right

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
spinning this prong right there right

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.090 
spinning this prong right there right
behind<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.670> hands<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:35.440> they<00:01:35.590> also<00:01:35.740> become<00:01:36.039> a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
behind the hands and they also become a

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.660 
behind the hands and they also become a
pump<00:01:36.369> use<00:01:36.550> gloves<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.090> or<00:01:37.330> type<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.750> gauntlet

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
pump use gloves on or type of gauntlet

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.030 
pump use gloves on or type of gauntlet
so<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:41.020> website<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.190> I<00:01:42.250> said<00:01:42.429> you<00:01:42.520> can

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.899 

there<00:01:47.730> we<00:01:47.970> go<00:01:48.150> spin<00:01:49.080> room<00:01:49.290> would<00:01:50.390> close

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.819 

is<00:01:53.999> a<00:01:54.979> pretty<00:01:55.979> cool<00:01:56.159> background<00:01:56.840> I'm<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.530> bored

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
is a pretty cool background I'm so bored

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.660 
is a pretty cool background I'm so bored
office

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.749 

it's<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:03.460> pattern

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.899 

it<00:02:09.269> looks<00:02:09.509> nice<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.830> problem<00:02:11.489> though

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
it looks nice of this one problem though

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.380 
it looks nice of this one problem though
he<00:02:12.659> has<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.610> head<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:17.370> comes<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
he has this head that it comes up and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.369 
he has this head that it comes up and
goes<00:02:19.019> down<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.680> pretty<00:02:19.890> annoying<00:02:20.239> um<00:02:23.060> yeah

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
goes down it's pretty annoying um yeah

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.770 
goes down it's pretty annoying um yeah
so<00:02:25.379> that's<00:02:26.190> probably<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.180> only<00:02:27.360> flower

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
so that's probably the only flower

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.259 
so that's probably the only flower
besides<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.319> spinning<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.790> notice<00:02:29.970> that

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
besides the spinning you can notice that

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.440 
besides the spinning you can notice that
now<00:02:31.010> almost<00:02:32.010> all<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.430> back<00:02:32.579> one<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.329> new

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
now almost all the back one in the new

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.710 
now almost all the back one in the new
series<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:34.650> been<00:02:34.680> having<00:02:35.340> diagonals<00:02:36.120> that

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
series have been having diagonals that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.649 
series have been having diagonals that
don't<00:02:37.019> come<00:02:37.200> out<00:02:37.290> straight<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> side<00:02:39.329> and

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
don't come out straight to the side and

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.710 
don't come out straight to the side and
I<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:40.579> let's<00:02:41.579> bring<00:02:41.879> in<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.150> really<00:02:42.540> good

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
I go let's bring in a really good

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.000 
I go let's bring in a really good
example<00:02:46.340> bring<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.459> naga<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.260> compare<00:02:49.859> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
example bring in naga and compare the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.610 
example bring in naga and compare the
wings<00:02:50.420> it's<00:02:51.420> best<00:02:51.690> if<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.900> compare<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.319> from

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
wings it's best if you compare it from

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.500 
wings it's best if you compare it from
the<00:02:52.799> back

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.580 

okay<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.489> notice<00:02:57.849> on<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.360> left<00:02:58.720> wing

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
okay so if you notice on the left wing

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.000 
okay so if you notice on the left wing
