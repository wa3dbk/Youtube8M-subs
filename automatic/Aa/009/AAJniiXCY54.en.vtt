00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.290
 Before you is the immense blue sky, 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.830
 dreams of touching him and beckoning. 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.840
 Your wings are like wings: 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.840
 you know no obstacles. 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.380
 But sweat runs down the frenzied face: 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.940
 all contrary to your expectations goes 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.930
 complacency its former 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.630
 cursing with all my heart. 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.090
 But why 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 I cant 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.140
 see what seems to lie in front of me? 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.340
 All my words go straight to heaven: 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.390
 so weak, so fragile that they disappear without a trace, 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.340
 finally leaving me regret 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 that there is no power to change this world now. 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.420
 Burning passion reckless people of the heart, 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.930
 and the time of a torrent of dust carries them away, 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.810
 and your voice finally reached me 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.990
 breaking into the defense of a strong breach. 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.490
 A short glory crown shines only a moment, 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.010
 but if faith in the song sounds in a chord, 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.890
 then the petals of an unknown flower 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.750
 will color bright blue. 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.230
 But why 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.820
 I cant 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.250
 achieve what seems to lie in front of me? 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.450
 All my words go straight to heaven: 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.500
 so weak, so fragile that they disappear without a trace, 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.530
 finally leaving me impatient ... 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.400
 But there is no power to change this world now. 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.190
 Well, why 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.720
 you see everything 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.160
 What only happens every day in my soul? 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.340
 All my words go straight to heaven: 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.370
 so weak, so fragile that they disappear without a trace in him. 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.470
 Regret away! No need to worry anymore! 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.420
 My voice will sound like thunder! 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.640
 I let all my love go straight to the sky: 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.570
 in the clouds and rays of the sun, feelings dissolve. 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.720
 And for us the time has come for you: 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.580
 at that moment we were able to change the blue world! 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.020
 This world!
