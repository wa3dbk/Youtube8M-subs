 little video what I wanted to show you 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 not which not in the where can 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.480
 I because of lte allrounder has me 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.160
 written 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.050
 maybe because of the 3ds amulette on 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.000
 Japanese is yes I have it again 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.130
 a bit wanted and have the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.649
 really found emulator 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 There are also some which I have 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.579
 video found 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.350
 there is a one emulator loaded the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.460
 stood 3ds and whole settings though 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.440
 he stopped instead of mario kart 7 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.750
 on it the file was a point 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.129
 file and he has not controlled anything 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.980
 that was a video also on the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.559
 quality seen and that it too 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.530
 has fast loaded for a 3ds in 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.579
 goleta and that would be impossible and there 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 I have a little bit around 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.460
 wanted and have exactly this excel 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.170
 found just about this to you later in 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.850
 the video description and i show you 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.950
 Also something you can do here in media 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.350
 very easy to load down is no 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.229
 virus or something 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.470
 and yes I always here purely from the Sun 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.630
 here is a 3 d the rom 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.390
 this is this is the 3ds simulator and 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.100
 this is a gameboy game so i start 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.100
 now time to execute yes 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.940
 such a moment, I'll do it 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.760
 First of all, the three would have to be bigger 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.380
 a minimum size of so has is 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.979
 not what is written here like soul boy 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.150
 advance this is not a 3ds simulator 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.090
 but a gameboy emulator stands here 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.729
 Although on the 3ds and above I can tell you 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.190
 let's show what exactly is the option in 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.340
 frame skip and all the crap on one 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.679
 game creator is gameboy yes 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.459
 and if one stands out here stands 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.769
 the 3ds version 1 0 2 1 and 2 is the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.930
 last version of visual boy advance 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.940
 by gameboy curator and then if you can 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.650
 that one enters a google one finds one here 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.430
 Not at all when you look at this page 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.019
 you go on the side for the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.019
 gameboy emulator yes 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:35.569
 I'm trying 3ds up now 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.860
 yes you see no space is a gameplay 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.470
 sound but he finds nothing then do 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.010
 I now open times may he finds 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.870
 only that max and I can not do anything else 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:53.470
 make the motors gm is the only way open 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.470
 it is now 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.150
 it is still alive 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.770
 apparently he does not work yet 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.670
 times I've still I've got times 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.330
 tried out 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.150
 skipper select file probably needs 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.430
 you can copy something into it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.910
 I dont know 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.990
 Let's see what this is 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.990
 which is okay 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:35.049
 rom information pokÃ©mon 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.540
 always means on the ear but yes intenso rum 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.519
 is a gameboy amoled so let yourself 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.019
 do not fool though we are in 3ds logo 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:46.540
 is and the whole mist yes there are many 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.780
 fakes and I will continue to search 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.700
 until this one emulator found 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.680
 but he probably is not too 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.030
 find that so normal normal people yes that 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.159
 I wanted you times now show that 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.139
 not even that's the way it is 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.140
 the sneaky are those fixed 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:11.450
 yes yes 3ds 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.840
 and yes , everything is gone until yes 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.840
