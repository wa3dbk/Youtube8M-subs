00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.380 
look in the year let's look at the
antifreeze<00:00:26.279> make<00:00:26.700> sure<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.970> doesn't<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.329> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
antifreeze make sure it doesn't have a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.830 
antifreeze make sure it doesn't have a
black<00:00:27.599> anything<00:00:28.590> yeah<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.490> looks<00:00:29.669> good<00:00:29.849> then

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
we're going to check the blow-by after

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200 
we're going to check the blow-by after
we<00:00:33.750> run<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.320> bit<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:35.640> after
