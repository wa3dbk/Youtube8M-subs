can<00:00:02.490> see<00:00:02.520> that<00:00:02.879> we<00:00:03.000> get<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.270> lot<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.899> color<00:00:04.220> all

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
can see that we get a lot of color all

favorite techniques to use on clients

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.410 
favorite techniques to use on clients
that<00:00:13.860> are<00:00:13.950> looking<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.880> most<00:00:15.059> amount<00:00:15.299> of

that are looking for the most amount of
color<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.529> least<00:00:16.710> amount<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.070> effort

color with the least amount of effort

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.269 
color with the least amount of effort
for<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> most<00:00:17.880> part<00:00:18.260> and<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.740> great<00:00:20.039> because

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
for the most part and it's great because

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
up and pull it back into a ponytail you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.170 
up and pull it back into a ponytail you
notice<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.149> don't<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.570> heavy<00:00:37.110> line

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
notice that we don't get that heavy line

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.720 
notice that we don't get that heavy line
our<00:00:39.180> streaks<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.050> hair<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:41.070> kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.489> run

our streaks in the hair that kind of run

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360 
our streaks in the hair that kind of run
back<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.329> actually<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> nice<00:00:43.200> color<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
back we actually get a nice color that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.639 
back we actually get a nice color that
flows<00:00:44.820> throughout<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.690> throws<00:00:46.379> through

flows<00:00:47.190> throughout<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.879> hair<00:00:48.149> while<00:00:49.110> still

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
flows throughout the hair while still

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.990 
flows throughout the hair while still
keeping<00:00:49.590> some<00:00:50.010> contrast<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.850> some

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
keeping some contrast and some

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
keeping some contrast and some

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
highlights going on there as well but we

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.549 
highlights going on there as well but we
just<00:00:53.460> don't<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.879> those<00:00:54.090> lines<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.960> we

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
just don't see those lines that we

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.010 
just don't see those lines that we
typically<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.460> we're<00:00:56.610> using<00:00:56.910> more<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
typically see when we're using more of a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.260 
typically see when we're using more of a
horizontal<00:00:58.350> foil<00:00:58.859> pattern<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> sides<00:01:00.030> of

horizontal foil pattern on the sides of
the<00:01:00.359> head<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:01.320> also<00:01:01.500> don't<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> problem

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the head we also don't get the problem

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.380 
the head we also don't get the problem
of<00:01:04.170> having<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.339> where<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> foils<00:01:06.119> are

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of having to see where the foils are

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.960 
of having to see where the foils are
when<00:01:06.810> they're<00:01:07.260> placed<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> head<00:01:08.130> because

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
when they're placed in the head because

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.510 
when they're placed in the head because
as<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> hair<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> pulled<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.950> can't<00:01:11.250> see

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
as the hair is pulled back you can't see

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.740 
as the hair is pulled back you can't see
a<00:01:11.790> definite<00:01:12.360> area<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.200> where<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.430> hair<00:01:14.790> was

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
a definite area of where that hair was

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.710 
a definite area of where that hair was
foiled<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.189> therefore<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.210> clients<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
foiled and so therefore the clients that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.560 
foiled and so therefore the clients that
that<00:01:19.439> don't<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.790> wouldn't<00:01:21.450> say

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that don't like to see I wouldn't say

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
that don't like to see I wouldn't say
the<00:01:21.720> rootage<00:01:22.080> area<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.710> definitely<00:01:23.280> don't

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the rootage area but definitely don't

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
the rootage area but definitely don't
want<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.990> their<00:01:25.140> foils<00:01:25.530> were

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
want to see where their foils were

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.580 
want to see where their foils were
placed<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.630> typically<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.320> with

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
placed in which you typically do with

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
placed in which you typically do with
the<00:01:28.770> horizontal<00:01:29.070> foil<00:01:29.610> placement<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.180> top<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the horizontal foil placement on top and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.600 
the horizontal foil placement on top and
the<00:01:31.170> horizontal<00:01:31.439> foil<00:01:31.890> placement<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the horizontal foil placement on the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.330 
the horizontal foil placement on the
sides<00:01:32.960> with<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> breaks<00:01:34.560> all<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.130> up

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
sides with this it breaks all of that up

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.609 
sides with this it breaks all of that up
so<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:36.210> kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> criss<00:01:36.720> cross<00:01:36.990> over<00:01:37.590> each

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
so they kind of criss cross over each

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.340 
so they kind of criss cross over each
other<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.850> foils<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
other the foils do and we don't get that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530 
other the foils do and we don't get that
type<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.950> line<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.610> type<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.030> effect<00:01:42.390> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the hair by using the branch technique

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.210 
the hair by using the branch technique
this<00:01:45.540> will<00:01:45.720> take<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.649> most<00:01:46.829> amount<00:01:47.100> of

this will take the the most amount of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.420 
this will take the the most amount of
foils<00:01:47.579> usually<00:01:48.350> probably<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.560> 20<00:01:49.979> it

foils usually probably around 20 it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.969 
foils usually probably around 20 it
could<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> 25<00:01:51.810> depending<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.619> the

of sections that you take but this is a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600 
of sections that you take but this is a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
great technique to use for those clients

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
great technique to use for those clients
that<00:01:59.820> are<00:02:00.060> looking<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.960> most<00:02:01.140> amount<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that are looking for the most amount of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.550 
that are looking for the most amount of
color<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> least<00:02:02.729> amount<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.090> effort

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
color with the least amount of effort

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.100 
color with the least amount of effort
and<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.829> basically<00:02:05.729> gives<00:02:06.299> us<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.689> good<00:02:06.960> amount

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and it basically gives us a good amount

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.380 
and it basically gives us a good amount
of<00:02:07.350> color<00:02:07.560> over<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.340> top<00:02:08.369> through<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> sides

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
of color over the top through the sides

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.250 
of color over the top through the sides
at<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> back<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> front<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.039> well
