these<00:00:49.829> fit<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.430> you've<00:00:50.730> never<00:00:50.910> tried<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
these fit if you've never tried on the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.920 
these fit if you've never tried on the
vapor<00:00:51.870> 7<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.000> narrow<00:00:54.300> feet<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
vapor 7 and you have narrow feet you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.979 
vapor 7 and you have narrow feet you
might<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:55.890> half<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> size

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
might want to go down half a size

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.479 
might want to go down half a size
because<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> vapor<00:00:58.260> 7<00:00:58.800> runs<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.340> bit

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
because the vapor 7 runs a little bit

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.689 
because the vapor 7 runs a little bit
like<00:01:00.390> half<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> size<00:01:00.870> long<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.379> guess<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
like half a size long I guess but if you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
like half a size long I guess but if you
have<00:01:02.850> white<00:01:03.090> feet<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.539> suggest<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.199> stay<00:01:04.409> in

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
have white feet I suggest you stay in

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.310 
have white feet I suggest you stay in
your<00:01:04.739> regular<00:01:04.890> size<00:01:05.780> because<00:01:06.780> um<00:01:06.960> these<00:01:07.140> are

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
your regular size because um these are

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.260 
your regular size because um these are
size<00:01:07.560> 9<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.920> 1/2<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.430> tried<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.909> i<00:01:08.970> have

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
size 9 and 1/2 I tried them on i have

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.600 
size 9 and 1/2 I tried them on i have
white<00:01:09.510> feet<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.380> too<00:01:10.740> tight<00:01:11.040> around<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
white feet and it's too tight around the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.570 
white feet and it's too tight around the
forefoot<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> make<00:01:13.890> sure<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.400> your

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
forefoot here so make sure you get your

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
forefoot here so make sure you get your
regular<00:01:14.729> size<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.600> white<00:01:15.869> feet<00:01:16.140> but

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
regular size if you have white feet but

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.230 
regular size if you have white feet but
if<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.920> narrow<00:01:17.369> feet<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> you've<00:01:18.030> never

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
if you have narrow feet and you've never

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.960 
if you have narrow feet and you've never
tried<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> vapor<00:01:19.189> then<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.580> guess<00:01:20.759> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
tried on the vapor then I guess you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
tried on the vapor then I guess you
should<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.180> go<00:01:21.600> down<00:01:21.780> half<00:01:22.049> size<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
should just go down half size as that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.030 
should just go down half size as that
would<00:01:23.220> fit<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> lot<00:01:23.820> better<00:01:27.890> here's<00:01:28.890> the
