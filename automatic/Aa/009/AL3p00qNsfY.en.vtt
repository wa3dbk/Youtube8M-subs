00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.850
 and 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.850
 yeah 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.660
 hi everyone is falling apart i hope 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.640
 that you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.280
 we meet for our fourth 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.230
 tomahawk video on black ops 2 so 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.980
 as expected we end up on standoff 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.570
 so it's played in defense so for the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.190
 ranking is not complicated you 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.170
 advance to the van what is 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.380
 the right rear headlight in the middle of 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.730
 your screen here I show you in sight 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.059
 in the third person how how 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.280
 then to put oneself in terms of 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.480
 aimed with the volume ouch 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.640
 it's not complicated so you get up 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.989
 your viewfinder a little bit you take 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.670
 as a landmark the chimney that is in 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.730
 underneath so wap the red line that are 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.280
 very red it is necessary that your father is 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.420
 above the red line admit that the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.010
 but slightly right do not 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.030
 like me I was lucky you 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.170
 go see my methods really 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.070
 above oysters and red for the thur 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.570
 to return to Morocco 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.940
 it must be so horizontally must 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.770
 your father with the blue line arrives 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.770
 roughly at roof height 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.670
 after that it's up to you to play on it 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.350
 have the eye the hand then y'a 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.969
 more than throw and you'll see that 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.969
 it's magic as usual 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.530
 yet it's a little that there is 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.619
 I really really cracked me 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.170
 left that gives an advantage and that and not 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.110
 too much so the players so we will follow the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.670
 way from the tomahawk so the ride you 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.530
 doubt a hymn tchin tchin monte 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.789
 it crosses the map it returns by the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.289
 window normally they go back into the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.270
 window it does not bounce but hey there 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.399
 I was lucky there was there the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.450
 sniper who was the window 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.060
 otherwise you do not even if help 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.979
 at the window just to aim a little bit 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.899
 you do it without any 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.579
 problem so I hope the video you 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.359
 will have pleased and I tell you very soon 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.960
