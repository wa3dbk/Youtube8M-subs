special if you're coming in mind with

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.449 
special if you're coming in mind with
the<00:02:12.080> fact<00:02:12.290> they<00:02:12.380> might<00:02:12.590> be<00:02:12.770> close<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.130> Formula

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the fact they might be close to Formula

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.370 
the fact they might be close to Formula
One<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.670> think<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.330> haven't<00:02:14.810> quite<00:02:15.140> understood

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
One I think you haven't quite understood

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.130 
One I think you haven't quite understood
for<00:02:16.160> Maneri<00:02:16.430> formula<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.209> its<00:02:17.420> own<00:02:17.570> separate

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
for Maneri formula is its own separate

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.110 
for Maneri formula is its own separate
kind<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.500> identity<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:22.130> will<00:02:22.370> enjoy<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
kind of identity and you will enjoy the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.830 
kind of identity and you will enjoy the
experience<00:02:24.610> as<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.970> completely<00:02:26.540> different

sort<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.140> experience<00:02:27.560> we<00:02:27.920> have<00:02:28.070> two<00:02:28.250> cars

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
sort of experience we have two cars

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.300 
sort of experience we have two cars
instead<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.910> one<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.330> race<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:30.130> I'm<00:02:31.130> not

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
instead of one in the race and I'm not

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.550 
instead of one in the race and I'm not

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
watch if only is the first all-electric

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.590 
watch if only is the first all-electric
racing<00:02:40.220> series<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:40.850> know<00:02:41.209> these<00:02:41.360> cars

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
racing series so you know these cars

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.170 
racing series so you know these cars
we've<00:02:42.050> got<00:02:42.170> no<00:02:42.350> engines<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:43.640> some<00:02:43.970> ways<00:02:44.150> I

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
we've got no engines in some ways I

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.310 
we've got no engines in some ways I
suppose<00:02:44.450> they<00:02:44.570> look<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:44.930> fairly

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
suppose they look like fairly

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.840 
suppose they look like fairly
conventional<00:02:45.560> single-seaters<00:02:46.550> but<00:02:46.700> they're

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
conventional single-seaters but they're

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.660 
conventional single-seaters but they're
not<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.269> know<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.570> sir<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.310> completely

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
not you know that sir it's a completely

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.590 
not you know that sir it's a completely
new<00:02:49.970> way<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.239> going<00:02:50.540> racing<00:02:50.810> new<00:02:51.590> technology

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
new way of going racing new technology

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.470 
new way of going racing new technology
you<00:02:53.600> know<00:02:53.720> we've<00:02:53.870> got<00:02:53.989> 10<00:02:54.500> teams<00:02:54.800> 20<00:02:55.370> cars<00:02:55.610> lots

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
you know we've got 10 teams 20 cars lots

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.540 
you know we've got 10 teams 20 cars lots
of<00:02:56.690> drivers<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:57.709> myself<00:02:57.890> would<00:02:58.190> come<00:02:58.340> out<00:02:58.459> of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
of drivers like myself would come out of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.350 
of drivers like myself would come out of
f1<00:02:59.140> so<00:03:00.140> yeah<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.160> think<00:03:01.280> we<00:03:01.550> should<00:03:01.580> be<00:03:01.880> should

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
f1 so yeah I think we should be should

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.699 
f1 so yeah I think we should be should
be<00:03:02.480> quite<00:03:02.630> good<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.019> we're<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.440> middle<00:03:03.620> of

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
be quite good and we're in the middle of

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.500 
be quite good and we're in the middle of
cities<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:04.519> like<00:03:04.760> we<00:03:04.880> are<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.030> London<00:03:05.390> today

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
cities like like we are in London today

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.880 
cities like like we are in London today
but<00:03:05.810> we're<00:03:05.930> going<00:03:06.019> to<00:03:06.170> nine<00:03:06.350> other<00:03:06.530> cities

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
but we're going to nine other cities

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.979 
but we're going to nine other cities
around<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.160> world<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:08.390> i<00:03:08.660> think<00:03:08.870> that's

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
around the world and i think that's

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.800 
around the world and i think that's
