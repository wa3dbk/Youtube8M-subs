substance to the bottom of the nest and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.940 
substance to the bottom of the nest and
they'll<00:02:03.810> break<00:02:04.020> through<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.439> crust<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:04.890> we

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
they'll break through the crust when we

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
they'll break through the crust when we
fall<00:02:05.159> into<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> water<00:02:05.670> where<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.719> will

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
fall into the water where they will

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.419 
fall into the water where they will
continue<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.590> next<00:02:07.860> stage<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.280> their

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
continue the next stage of their

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.990 
continue the next stage of their
development

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
development

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.540 
development
and<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:10.869> amazing<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.530> see<00:02:11.770> how<00:02:12.520> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
and it's amazing to see how the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.360 
and it's amazing to see how the
intelligence<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.690> nature<00:02:14.070> ensures<00:02:15.070> the
