just<00:01:03.859> because<00:01:04.449> using<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.630> pistol<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.050> already

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
just because using a pistol you already

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.530 
just because using a pistol you already
at<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.440> disadvantage<00:01:06.500> doing<00:01:07.250> well<00:01:07.540> your

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
at a disadvantage doing well your

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.410 
at a disadvantage doing well your
weapons<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.740> try<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.130> change<00:01:10.850> that<00:01:11.090> with<00:01:11.240> the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
weapons so I try to change that with the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.770 
weapons so I try to change that with the
advantage<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.850> not<00:01:13.850> being<00:01:14.060> able<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.300> seen<00:01:14.690> on

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
advantage of not being able to seen on

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.730 
advantage of not being able to seen on
the<00:01:14.840> radar<00:01:14.960> or<00:01:15.320> heard<00:01:15.620> in<00:01:16.010> my<00:01:16.220> footsteps<00:01:17.740> which

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
the radar or heard in my footsteps which

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.720 
the radar or heard in my footsteps which
I<00:01:18.830> think<00:01:19.040> actually<00:01:19.220> on<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:19.520> one<00:01:19.640> I'm

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
I think actually on this one I'm

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.340 
I think actually on this one I'm
treating<00:01:20.240> myself<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.600> any<00:01:20.750> more<00:01:20.870> steady<00:01:21.170> aim

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
treating myself in any more steady aim

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.060 
treating myself in any more steady aim
because<00:01:21.650> originally<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.100> was<00:01:22.220> trying<00:01:22.430> also<00:01:22.990> 90

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
because originally I was trying also 90

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.300 
because originally I was trying also 90
which<00:01:26.080> in<00:01:27.080> later<00:01:27.320> games<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.710> was<00:01:27.800> successful

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
which in later games I was successful
