00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.110
 i have all the ass players pp 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.640
 in this video we believe teach you how to create an image for the property 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.089
 car player who represents a couple yes 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.319
 begin 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.419
 to make these images new levels are needed we bring the lowest 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.320
 first page 19 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.220
 to select the bevel square 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.050
 we color it black 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.050
 pc errors i love you round in this mar 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.409
 contact 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.110
 now 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.290
 we duplicate level 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.690
 and let's place the vv level slightly lower 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.140
 looking for the right proportions for a playing card 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.760
 so I'll be able to holland 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.040
 now we duplicate from the bottom level and we go to color it white 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.160
 we carry it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.350
 lenovo pc errors slightly 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.930
 so that the black border 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.930
 we are going to be almost imperceptible 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.510
 duplicate the other black beveled square we also try this one too 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.830
 vault of white enya moric there is to say emodata of the same dimensions of the po 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 too much study 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.690
 the black fox will help us to separate the two cards because now we go palm 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.610
 topic are one of the two squares 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.110
 and we carry it 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.840
 in this way 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.140
 we bring in low level 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.380
 and as you see the black stamp we have just created 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.609
 gives the impression that your cards are actually separate 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.310
 so let's look for the right position 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.010
 we position live 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.400
 we decided to create the details 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.220
 at the top level 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.910
 al pacino 1 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.470
 let's select it 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.690
 we color it black 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.620
 you could even color it red to make other servants try that to me 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 like spades this time I have colored dinner 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.690
 therefore lari pi cydia mo 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.150
 we carry it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.939
 in the upper right corner 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.489
 we publish the letter o 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.489
 and we bring it this time of the flights in the lower left 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.229
 we duplicate how an abortion goes 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.099
 but this time we color it red 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.079
 and we carry it in the upper right corner but of the card below 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.689
 that's it done now we have to go and position this level so that 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.719
 you are really below the level of the first part so we go down to 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.719
 find the right position 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.419
 now we just have to enter an email address 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.329
 the spades on page 4 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.789
 we color black 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.219
 because I love the diamond bulge 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.589
 put them in the middle of the card 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.459
 here is the pair of aces finished thanks for having undergone this video there 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.859
 let's see the next one
