00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
acquired the site which was originally

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.880 
acquired the site which was originally
five<00:00:51.690> acres<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:53.120> 1946<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.480> did<00:00:55.289> many

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
five acres in 1946 and did many

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.689 
five acres in 1946 and did many
different<00:00:56.370> studies<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.629> design<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.699> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
different studies for the design of the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.139 
different studies for the design of the
glass<00:00:59.910> house<00:01:00.210> before<00:01:00.750> arriving<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.850> at<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
glass house before arriving at at this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.050 
glass house before arriving at at this
arrangement<00:01:03.870> where<00:01:04.739> essentially<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.610> have

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
arrangement where essentially you have

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
arrangement where essentially you have
two<00:01:06.539> pavilions<00:01:07.050> facing<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.190> another<00:01:08.220> across

two pavilions facing one another across
a<00:01:08.940> courtyard<00:01:09.560> one<00:01:10.560> almost<00:01:11.310> entirely

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
a courtyard one almost entirely

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.330 
a courtyard one almost entirely
transparent<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.649> other<00:01:13.800> almost

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
transparent and the other almost

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.309 
transparent and the other almost
entirely<00:01:15.030> opaque<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.429> this<00:01:17.429> opposition<00:01:18.319> was

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319 
entirely opaque and this opposition was

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.710 
entirely opaque and this opposition was
very<00:01:19.530> important<00:01:20.039> I<00:01:20.280> think<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.910> for<00:01:21.330> Phillip

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
very important I think for for Phillip

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.830 
very important I think for for Phillip
who<00:01:22.560> maintained<00:01:23.280> through<00:01:23.700> his<00:01:24.179> life<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
who maintained through his life and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.969 
who maintained through his life and
career<00:01:25.050> an<00:01:25.640> interest<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:28.440> way<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.770> which

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
career an interest in the way in which

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.699 
career an interest in the way in which
things<00:01:29.310> were<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.240> fixed<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.319> in<00:01:31.530> which

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
things were not fixed the way in which

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.969 
things were not fixed the way in which
things<00:01:32.069> could<00:01:32.580> change<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.990> transform<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
things could change and transform and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.389 
things could change and transform and
morph<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:36.599> see<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.050> very<00:01:37.319> much<00:01:37.410> in<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
morph and we see that very much in the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.669 
morph and we see that very much in the
way<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.450> other<00:01:39.660> buildings<00:01:40.440> and

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
way that the other buildings and

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.430 
way that the other buildings and
structures<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> site<00:01:41.759> developed<00:01:42.440> each

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
structures on the site developed each

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.999 
structures on the site developed each
one<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:44.069> a<00:01:44.190> completely<00:01:44.849> different

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
one in a completely different

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.699 
one in a completely different
architectural<00:01:47.009> language<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.729> Sensibility

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
architectural language or Sensibility

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.199 
architectural language or Sensibility
but<00:01:49.709> it<00:01:49.830> was<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.190> kind<00:01:50.489> of<00:01:50.640> Restless

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
but it was this kind of Restless

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.949 
but it was this kind of Restless
curiosity<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.500> interest<00:01:52.830> in<00:01:53.130> change<00:01:53.489> I<00:01:53.959> think

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
curiosity and interest in change I think

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.949 
curiosity and interest in change I think
that<00:01:55.349> really<00:01:55.940> motivated<00:01:56.940> much<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.479> much<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
that really motivated much of much of

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.790 
that really motivated much of much of
his<00:01:58.110> work<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.720> initially<00:02:00.720> along<00:02:01.470> with<00:02:01.709> the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
his work and initially along with the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.229 
his work and initially along with the
glass<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.280> brick<00:02:02.429> house<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.179> a

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
glass and brick house there was a

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.410 
glass and brick house there was a
sculpture<00:02:03.840> by<00:02:04.170> Jacques<00:02:04.560> Lipchitz<00:02:05.209> and<00:02:06.209> that

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
sculpture by Jacques Lipchitz and that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
sculpture by Jacques Lipchitz and that
was<00:02:06.599> the<00:02:06.780> composition<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.739> a<00:02:07.770> three-part

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
was the composition it was a three-part

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.510 
was the composition it was a three-part
composition<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.629> then<00:02:10.619> over<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> course<00:02:11.340> of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
composition and then over the course of

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.570 
composition and then over the course of
several<00:02:11.910> decades<00:02:12.800> Phillip<00:02:13.800> began<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.310> acquire

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
several decades Phillip began to acquire

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.240 
several decades Phillip began to acquire
adjacent<00:02:15.540> parcels<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.110> land<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.980> grew

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
adjacent parcels of land and it grew

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.090 
adjacent parcels of land and it grew
from<00:02:17.640> five<00:02:18.420> acres<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.170> 49<00:02:20.100> acres<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:22.100> over

from five acres to 49 acres and over

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.500 
from five acres to 49 acres and over
time<00:02:23.340> he<00:02:23.370> began<00:02:23.970> adding<00:02:24.540> new<00:02:25.410> structures

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510

were a bit less strict and so there was
the<00:04:04.620> possibility<00:04:04.970> for<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.510> young<00:04:07.079> architect<00:04:07.790> to
