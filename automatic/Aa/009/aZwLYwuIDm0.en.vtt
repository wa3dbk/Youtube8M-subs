00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello and in one of the reviews on 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.010
 marker montana black 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.059
 Iron said that there will be a sightseeing 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.580
 montana black plastic marker 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.089
 actually start so here's iron 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.520
 marker 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.590
 here's a plastic goes plastic marker 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.890
 i.e. 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.910
 so they look external differences by 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.899
 In principle, the case does not exist; 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.440
 only plastic flask there is no depression 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.780
 here it is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 on the bottom of both the iron and the head 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.760
 monk you her beria is also the same and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.760
 the lid here goes around by the cooking 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:58.379
 here is darkened ie in ink color 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:01.350
 which will be in it and so in general 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.000
 iron marker basically normal i 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.820
 already filmed about him saw that is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 connection is bad he is flowing in me 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.680
 ok that's another plastic thing 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:19.259
 the marker that is the thickness of the plastic goes here 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.299
 this protrusion from the bottom goes favors 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.040
 millimeter 3 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.189
 it all goes thickness marker i mean it 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.400
 very thick and not simply forced 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:34.619
 in general the same head 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.049
 I have already said and here is the most important 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.880
 problem of this marker 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.810
 now I have a full stock option 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.250
 that is, I did not rework anything 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.750
 pump and she just does not hold at all then 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.950
 there is here you take turn over and he 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 fall out absolutely just not holding on and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.729
 due to this what is happening that is 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.119
 you have such a small gap 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.660
 refueled the marker collected soaked 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.540
 write and in time 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:18.440
 when the ink beats on here here sponges 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.800
 no they go without a sponge 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.050
 montana black markers when ink is there 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.840
 uphill before the griffin they start 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.300
 flow through the thread and everything flows just 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:35.260
 on your hands in your pocket anywhere at all 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.440
 I tried to seal the pump that is 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.190
 completely glue the moment 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.000
 some second that Lenin is normal 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.690
 put in need to wait until dry 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.870
 then smeared glue on the head 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.510
 screwed up 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.960
 and in this form I passed the marker 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.070
 literally 2 days on ink again 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.210
 came on slate and section 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.820
 glue that was in the pump and glue section 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.290
 who was here heads that is again 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:16.180
 everything flowed out that is without options so 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.250
 let's say but now I have an idea 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.650
 maybe a few 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.800
 this is not very practical but I have 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:31.670
 I will share in general again , I want to smear 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:37.040
 bomb glue glue and and and and and and here 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.959
 here is not a long distance in front 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.830
 before the thread there is a small 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.209
 gap and i want 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.270
 something that is well hot kenwood 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.270
 with iron just a pump and a marker here on 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.270
 this edge to fuse together that is to 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:57.440
 this whole construction was non-separable 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.200
 so that it does not flow, do you think 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.180
 one of the many better housing options 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.129
 I like 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.409
 the cover also like that easily 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:11.260
 opens you can walk and with 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.989
 metallic but someone might want to 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.549
 plastic walk who can pacifier 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:21.639
 bought or will buy here for this i suggest 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.830
 This option is to remove the pump 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.789
 which, again, here it falls out very 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:32.889
 just glue the glue 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.840
 and all this soldering raises the question of 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.780
 refueling 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.669
 that is, it can be refilled through 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.419
 bombs that is how the ink came out and 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.330
 settlement that is here pour almost and 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.889
 on the very edges of the ink and what will be 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.400
 pushing the pump and not going to flow 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.830
 back so I already did a bit of course 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.690
 of porn out there ten minutes have 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.970
 sit for a dressing husband less if 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.009
 get a handle 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:05.470
 but will need to refuel better 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:08.770
 the only negative of this marker is this 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.840
 pomp that falls out otherwise 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.340
 Excellent same cover which is easy 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.039
 a reliable case opens therefore if 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.190
 you are going to buy will think 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.409
 whether you will not need to solder it or 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.020
 No, because all dummies are absolutely 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.659
 they all go you with such a defect that is 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.539
 I don't know why they did it 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:35.530
 but so it is no matter what absolute 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:41.320
 beer 810 millimeters 15 will still 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:45.610
 there is such a hat in general when I do 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.479
 I think I'll shoot a video in principle how 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.840
 it all looks 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:53.620
 I'll show the zapayku how he will be there 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.889
 I will remind you in a circle and who are interested 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.840
 do if not then if you don't 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.900
 going to do that marker here not 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.610
 take that is, its principle is not why 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.639
 take it will constantly flow 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.150
 and not even what glue saves here 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.150
 here is the video 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:19.950
 Thought opened you eyes from a marker for those 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:21.910
 who would like to take or will be all 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.010
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.480
 like wait new videos 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.480
 they will be bye
