00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.090
 Today I am going to tell you a story 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.800
 history of johnny paper was an expert 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.870
 fighter pilot of battlefield 3 in 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.720
 playstation3 where a beating goes to all the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 world and distributed advanced campings to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.450
 any threat that was put to him by 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.360
 in front of very dangerous that outside 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.280
 the new generation has already gone and I no longer 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.380
 he wanted to stay behind so he dared to 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.620
 make the jump but this time in a new 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.760
 platform the pc so I bought a pc 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.760
 and the battlefield 4 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.460
 I neither dared and also spliced 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.560
 site that his first departure rammed phil 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.990
 four were the mode of superiority 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.600
 air for a good start its journey through 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.520
 pc even though he did not like the mouse 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.590
 I thought it would only be a matter of 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.470
 adapt until you understood that what 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.280
 they were raping they were doing 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.280
 bullying 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.280
 dv 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.429
 and he had a little anger I was not even 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.500
 confused he did not understand anything that happened as 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.049
 is that people were so good at hunting 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.140
 with a damn mouse I did not even stay 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.409
 desolate and defeated until he discovered 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.409
 the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.970
 but what the hell is the ds3 tool and what 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.580
 demons has to do with what you 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.440
 happens to port vell johnny good stress 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.390
 it's just a program since we 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.869
 allows you to use the great controls 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.910
 from console to pc if the mouse is a lot 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.070
 more precise than the control joystick 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.350
 that's no doubt but the joystick of 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.390
 command is much more flexible and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.520
 manageable and in aerial vehicles we 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.070
 will provide great mobility and much 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.140
 piloting facility 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.630
 but without more nonsense let's see from 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.600
 a brief way how to install this 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.480
 program on the pc and how to configure it in 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.360
 first place we downloaded the program in 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.100
 the second description what 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.100
 We install following the steps of 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.440
 any other fucking program in third 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.470
 instead we open the program and insert 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.980
 the command on the computer 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.480
 johnny what are you doing like this I do not 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.209
 I mean, you connect it 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.030
 in fourth place when we have connected 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.590
 the command to the pc we leave a few moments to 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.390
 to load the drivers in the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.610
 computer and then we go to the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.769
 ds3 tool drivers section 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.739
 we select the command driver and what 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.959
 we load well you already have the command ready 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.420
 normally to use it in others 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.680
 games we will select the option of xbox 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.079
 360 controller but in battlefield let's go 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.079
 have to select this let's give it 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.849
 to create a new profile and on the r3 button 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.310
 let's configure it to be the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.319
 keyboard key with this we're going to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.959
 save a little kalimba conflict of 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.390
 fill 4 good and you're done 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.459
 this is all you already know comrades and already 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.739
 you know I do not even the best to control the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.019
 Aerial vehicles in battlefield 4 pc is 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.269
 a good console command good clear 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.400
 then there are the pros with their team 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.160
 600 euros of simulators that are going to 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.950
 fuck but that's another story and good 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.120
 I hope you have served the video 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.829
 except the console comrades who 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.780
 they will have imported a shit from the video 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.519
 but nothing happens in the next video 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.410
 of patrice let's talk about the fighters 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.450
 from a cost 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.050
 all cross-platform until then 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.050
 comrades
