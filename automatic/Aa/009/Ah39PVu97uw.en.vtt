now<00:02:34.849> I'm<00:02:34.969> just<00:02:35.090> waiting<00:02:35.299> for<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.659> to<00:02:36.189> harden<00:02:37.189> I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
now I'm just waiting for it to harden I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.149 
now I'm just waiting for it to harden I
guess<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.879> it's<00:02:37.969> still<00:02:38.329> really<00:02:38.750> wet<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.650> don't

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
guess and it's still really wet I don't

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.209 
guess and it's still really wet I don't
know<00:02:40.219> if<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.400> gets<00:02:40.549> hard<00:02:40.790> or<00:02:40.939> not<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.889> will

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
know if it gets hard or not so I will

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.369 
know if it gets hard or not so I will
just<00:02:43.430> wait<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.030> see<00:02:44.329> I<00:02:44.540> will<00:02:44.629> see<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.169> in
