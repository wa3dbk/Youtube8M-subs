00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
we get that's I think after that room to

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.050 
we get that's I think after that room to
work<00:00:29.439> on<00:00:29.590> our<00:00:29.650> walls<00:00:30.009> i'm<00:00:30.310> going<00:00:30.609> to<00:00:30.849> try<00:00:31.000> to

work on our walls i'm going to try to

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.140 
work on our walls i'm going to try to
get<00:00:31.269> to<00:00:31.359> all<00:00:31.480> our<00:00:31.630> lost<00:00:31.810> level<00:00:32.230> 7<00:00:32.830> and<00:00:33.150> then

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
get to all our lost level 7 and then

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.189 
get to all our lost level 7 and then
this<00:00:34.269> base<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.449> going<00:00:34.629> to<00:00:34.690> look<00:00:34.809> really<00:00:34.960> nice

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
this base is going to look really nice

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.070 
this base is going to look really nice
almost<00:00:35.800> maxed<00:00:36.100> out<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:37.660> all<00:00:37.839> we<00:00:37.930> have<00:00:38.019> left

time because of all the walls which are
extremely<00:00:49.720> expensive<00:00:49.900> but<00:00:50.650> lately<00:00:51.489> I've<00:00:51.699> been

and out of town hall 7 so it was pretty

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.560 
and out of town hall 7 so it was pretty
easy<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.770> take<00:01:15.130> this<00:01:15.250> one<00:01:15.399> outs<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:15.880> turn<00:01:16.479> my

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
easy to take this one outs and turn my

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.330 
easy to take this one outs and turn my
volume<00:01:16.719> down<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:17.289> little<00:01:17.679> bit<00:01:17.890> too<00:01:18.070> might<00:01:18.189> be<00:01:18.310> a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
volume down a little bit too might be a

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.690 
volume down a little bit too might be a
little<00:01:18.460> too<00:01:18.579> loud<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:20.469> go<00:01:20.590> okay<00:01:21.340> so<00:01:21.399> this

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
little too loud there we go okay so this

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.209 
little too loud there we go okay so this
one<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:22.210> basically<00:01:22.539> just<00:01:22.719> have<00:01:23.350> incorporated<00:01:23.829> a

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
one I basically just have incorporated a

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.429 
one I basically just have incorporated a
healer<00:01:24.549> into<00:01:24.789> my<00:01:24.909> army<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:25.329> I<00:01:26.079> just<00:01:26.259> use<00:01:26.380> a

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
healer into my army and I just use a

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.669 
healer into my army and I just use a
little<00:01:26.499> bit<00:01:26.679> less<00:01:27.090> archers<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.469> as<00:01:29.469> you<00:01:29.590> can

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
little bit less archers and as you can

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.859 
little bit less archers and as you can
see<00:01:29.710> i<00:01:29.890> previously<00:01:30.640> just<00:01:30.909> did<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.179> giant

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
see i previously just did the giant

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.270 
see i previously just did the giant
healer<00:01:32.049> strategy<00:01:32.409> along<00:01:32.829> with<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.130> lot<00:01:33.249> of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
healer strategy along with a lot of

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.700 
healer strategy along with a lot of
infantry<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.140> squabbles<00:01:35.140> going<00:01:35.530> around

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
infantry and squabbles going around

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.590 
infantry and squabbles going around
getting<00:01:35.979> all<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.369> punchers<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:37.329> stuff

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
getting all of the punchers and stuff

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.330 
getting all of the punchers and stuff
distracting<00:01:38.259> stuff<00:01:38.469> as<00:01:38.590> well<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.039> it<00:01:39.189> worked

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
distracting stuff as well and it worked

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.130 
distracting stuff as well and it worked
pretty<00:01:39.490> well<00:01:39.729> we<00:01:40.420> think<00:01:40.479> it'll<00:01:40.689> three<00:01:40.869> start

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
pretty well we think it'll three start

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.880 
pretty well we think it'll three start
and<00:01:41.789> it<00:01:42.789> was<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:42.939> pretty<00:01:43.090> solid<00:01:43.539> rate<00:01:43.840> so<00:01:44.140> what

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
and it was a pretty solid rate so what

right<00:01:48.249> ever<00:01:48.399> but<00:01:48.639> it's<00:01:48.759> one<00:01:48.909> of<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.060> biggest

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
right ever but it's one of the biggest

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.249 
right ever but it's one of the biggest
I've<00:01:49.450> ever<00:01:49.479> done<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:50.319> was<00:01:50.560> really<00:01:50.920> crazy<00:01:51.219> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
I've ever done it was really crazy and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.539 
I've ever done it was really crazy and
it<00:01:53.259> was<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.409> huge<00:01:53.439> amount<00:01:53.829> of<00:01:53.859> resources<00:01:54.249> so

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
it was a huge amount of resources so

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.270 
it was a huge amount of resources so
let's<00:01:54.670> go<00:01:54.759> ahead<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:56.200> was<00:01:56.889> pretty<00:01:57.159> much

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
telesco times for and they just break

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.859 
telesco times for and they just break
through<00:01:59.350> anger<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.829> last<00:02:00.039> two<00:02:00.659> defenses<00:02:01.659> not

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
archers and then broke in there once we

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.320 
archers and then broke in there once we
got<00:02:47.620> through<00:02:47.860> most<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.190> those<00:02:48.340> i<00:02:48.730> usually<00:02:49.180> put

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
got through most of those i usually put

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330 
got through most of those i usually put
any<00:02:49.510> Giants<00:02:50.170> see<00:02:50.740> if<00:02:50.860> that's<00:02:51.010> what<00:02:51.130> he<00:02:51.190> did

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
any Giants see if that's what he did

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.270 
any Giants see if that's what he did
next<00:02:51.550> about<00:02:52.360> times<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.140> little<00:02:53.980> bit<00:02:54.130> quicker

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
next about times to a little bit quicker

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.510 
next about times to a little bit quicker
and<00:02:55.320> yep<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.410> did<00:02:56.470> use<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.860> like<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.070> spell<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.400> take

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
and yep I did use a like a spell to take

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.550 
and yep I did use a like a spell to take
out<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.820> mortar<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.300> way<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.200> get<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.350> all

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
out the mortar that way I can get to all

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.890 
out the mortar that way I can get to all
those<00:02:59.709> goblins<00:03:00.070> in<00:03:00.190> there<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.610> get<00:03:00.730> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
those goblins in there to get the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.660 
those goblins in there to get the
storages<00:03:01.900> without<00:03:02.230> them<00:03:02.890> getting<00:03:02.920> exploding

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
storages without them getting exploding

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.630 
storages without them getting exploding
stuff<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.510> were<00:03:05.050> pretty<00:03:05.230> well<00:03:05.459> get<00:03:06.459> both

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
stuff so that were pretty well get both

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.000 
stuff so that were pretty well get both
of<00:03:06.820> his<00:03:06.910> air<00:03:07.480> defenses<00:03:07.840> down<00:03:07.959> here<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.440> could

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
of his air defenses down here so I could

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.500 
of his air defenses down here so I could
usually<00:03:09.160> healer<00:03:09.580> pretty<00:03:09.790> effectively<00:03:10.180> at<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
usually healer pretty effectively at the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.940 
usually healer pretty effectively at the
top<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.930> right<00:03:11.380> here<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> think<00:03:11.739> if<00:03:11.800> she<00:03:11.920> does

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
top and right here I think if she does

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.300 
top and right here I think if she does
get<00:03:12.190> shot<00:03:12.400> down<00:03:12.430> though<00:03:13.320> yep<00:03:14.320> but<00:03:14.770> after<00:03:14.980> that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
get shot down though yep but after that

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.210 
get shot down though yep but after that
most<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.000> big<00:03:16.690> defenses<00:03:17.080> are<00:03:17.200> gone<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.800> all

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
most of the big defenses are gone so all

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.350 
most of the big defenses are gone so all
the<00:03:18.550> Giants<00:03:18.910> Collins<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:20.430> our<00:03:21.430> chargers<00:03:22.090> are

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
the Giants Collins and our chargers are

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.060 
the Giants Collins and our chargers are
doing<00:03:22.630> pretty<00:03:22.780> good<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.080> they<00:03:23.769> just<00:03:23.920> went

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
doing pretty good and they just went

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.470 
doing pretty good and they just went
through<00:03:24.250> n<00:03:24.430> pretty<00:03:24.760> much<00:03:24.850> demolish<00:03:25.299> this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
through n pretty much demolish this

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.840 
through n pretty much demolish this
entire<00:03:25.780> place<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.890> Tesla's<00:03:27.250> came<00:03:27.400> up<00:03:27.549> I

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
entire place and the Tesla's came up I

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.580 
entire place and the Tesla's came up I
wasn't<00:03:28.540> really<00:03:28.630> worried<00:03:28.930> about<00:03:28.959> skinning

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
wasn't really worried about skinning

3-star butts nice Emma tree and Giants

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.289 
3-star butts nice Emma tree and Giants
take<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.070> through<00:03:33.220> those<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.670> they<00:03:34.150> did

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
take it through those and they did

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.630 
take it through those and they did
pretty<00:03:34.420> well<00:03:34.570> even<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.350> 3<00:03:35.500> stars<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:35.980> we<00:03:36.190> got<00:03:36.310> a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
pretty well even the 3 stars so we got a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.190 
pretty well even the 3 stars so we got a
crazy<00:03:37.060> amount<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.390> resources<00:03:37.720> on<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.049> one

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.350 
collectors so let's go and place these
here<00:05:23.560> we're<00:05:23.710> going<00:05:23.920> to<00:05:24.070> try<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.640> looks<00:05:25.240> like

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
here we're going to try and looks like

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.670 
here we're going to try and looks like
most<00:05:25.540> of<00:05:25.600> me<00:05:25.720> did<00:05:25.870> put<00:05:26.020> in<00:05:26.110> his<00:05:26.260> base<00:05:26.440> we're

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
most of me did put in his base we're

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.990 
most of me did put in his base we're
going<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.980> go<00:05:27.250> for<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.490> free<00:05:27.610> straw<00:05:27.760> I<00:05:27.820> guess

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
going to go for the free straw I guess

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.660 
going to go for the free straw I guess
so<00:05:28.930> let's<00:05:29.080> go<00:05:29.260> and<00:05:29.680> 12<00:05:30.400> starts<00:05:32.490> we're<00:05:33.490> going<00:05:33.580> to

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
so let's go and 12 starts we're going to

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.910 
so let's go and 12 starts we're going to
start<00:05:33.880> on<00:05:33.940> this<00:05:34.060> side<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:34.270> we're<00:05:34.540> going<00:05:34.630> to

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
start on this side so we're going to

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.530 
start on this side so we're going to
will<00:05:35.920> place<00:05:36.100> in<00:05:36.250> some<00:05:36.400> archers<00:05:36.670> here<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.390> get

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
will place in some archers here to get

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.090 
will place in some archers here to get
rid<00:05:37.660> of<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:37.840> so<00:05:38.050> we'll<00:05:38.140> place<00:05:38.320> in<00:05:38.500> one<00:05:38.680> Giants

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
rid of that so we'll place in one Giants

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.760 
rid of that so we'll place in one Giants
to<00:05:39.430> see<00:05:40.360> if<00:05:40.450> there<00:05:40.570> is<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:40.690> trap<00:05:41.020> there<00:05:41.260> and<00:05:41.470> I

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
to see if there is a trap there and I

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.700 
to see if there is a trap there and I
think<00:05:42.010> there<00:05:42.130> might<00:05:42.310> be<00:05:43.020> or<00:05:44.020> not<00:05:44.080> okay<00:05:44.650> so

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
think there might be or not okay so

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.350 
think there might be or not okay so
we're<00:05:44.890> putting<00:05:45.100> all<00:05:45.190> of<00:05:45.220> them<00:05:45.400> in<00:05:45.490> there<00:05:46.090> we<00:05:46.210> go

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
we're putting all of them in there we go

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.230 
we're putting all of them in there we go
and<00:05:46.660> we<00:05:47.560> should<00:05:47.770> be<00:05:47.860> preset<00:05:48.310> so<00:05:48.610> we're<00:05:49.150> going

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
and we should be preset so we're going

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.770 
and we should be preset so we're going
to<00:05:49.419> drop<00:05:49.780> in<00:05:50.080> as<00:05:50.380> many<00:05:50.560> of<00:05:50.919> these<00:05:51.780> Wahlburgers

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
to drop in as many of these Wahlburgers

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.150 
to drop in as many of these Wahlburgers
we<00:05:52.900> can<00:05:53.020> get<00:05:53.140> in<00:05:53.230> there<00:05:53.380> and<00:05:53.530> we<00:05:53.860> should<00:05:54.070> be

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
we can get in there and we should be

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
we can get in there and we should be
pretty<00:05:54.580> set<00:05:55.140> foot<00:05:56.140> in<00:05:56.230> the<00:05:56.320> King<00:05:56.530> as<00:05:56.650> well<00:05:56.860> and

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
pretty set foot in the King as well and

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.330 
pretty set foot in the King as well and
then<00:05:58.180> we<00:05:58.270> got<00:05:58.390> to<00:05:58.630> basically<00:05:59.620> try<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.070> get<00:06:00.190> into

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
then we got to basically try to get into

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.700 
then we got to basically try to get into
the<00:06:00.520> center<00:06:00.760> more<00:06:00.940> so<00:06:01.600> I'm<00:06:01.690> going<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:02.080> place<00:06:02.350> in

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
the center more so I'm going to place in

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.640 
the center more so I'm going to place in
some<00:06:03.010> warm<00:06:04.050> everything<00:06:05.050> we've<00:06:05.140> replaced<00:06:05.470> all

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
some warm everything we've replaced all

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.810 
some warm everything we've replaced all
our<00:06:05.830> wahlburgers<00:06:05.980> let's<00:06:06.400> we<00:06:06.490> get<00:06:06.610> into<00:06:06.730> the

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
our wahlburgers let's we get into the

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.090 
our wahlburgers let's we get into the
center<00:06:07.060> there<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:07.480> destroy<00:06:08.050> that's<00:06:08.410> your

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
center there and destroy that's your

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.409 
center there and destroy that's your
gums<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.400> healer<00:06:09.700> she<00:06:09.970> should<00:06:10.180> do<00:06:10.300> pretty

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
gums the healer she should do pretty

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.450 
gums the healer she should do pretty
well<00:06:10.660> and<00:06:10.990> will<00:06:11.440> place<00:06:11.620> the<00:06:11.770> dragon<00:06:12.160> up<00:06:12.280> here

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
well and will place the dragon up here

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.640 
well and will place the dragon up here
as<00:06:12.550> well<00:06:12.730> so<00:06:13.000> when<00:06:13.660> you<00:06:13.750> get<00:06:13.960> rid<00:06:14.350> of<00:06:14.410> some<00:06:14.620> of

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
as well so when you get rid of some of

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.970 
as well so when you get rid of some of
these<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:15.480> then<00:06:16.480> focus<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.560> rest<00:06:17.710> of<00:06:17.800> them<00:06:17.890> I

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
these and then focus the rest of them I

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.980 
these and then focus the rest of them I
guess<00:06:18.130> towards<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.520> center<00:06:18.790> and<00:06:19.000> we<00:06:19.810> should

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
guess towards the center and we should

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.640 
guess towards the center and we should
be<00:06:20.169> pretty<00:06:20.380> good<00:06:20.650> well<00:06:20.800> if<00:06:20.890> you<00:06:20.980> have<00:06:21.070> this<00:06:21.220> so

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
be pretty good well if you have this so

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.400 
be pretty good well if you have this so
123,000<00:06:23.650> left<00:06:23.890> and<00:06:24.690> it<00:06:25.690> looks<00:06:25.840> like<00:06:25.900> once<00:06:26.260> we

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
123,000 left and it looks like once we

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.650 
123,000 left and it looks like once we
get<00:06:26.530> onto<00:06:26.680> this<00:06:26.860> side<00:06:27.070> of<00:06:27.130> the<00:06:27.190> base<00:06:27.480> the<00:06:28.480> rest

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
get onto this side of the base the rest

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.620 
get onto this side of the base the rest
will<00:06:28.780> be<00:06:28.870> gone<00:06:29.280> so<00:06:30.280> you<00:06:30.550> guys<00:06:30.700> can<00:06:30.760> make<00:06:31.090> it<00:06:31.270> all

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
will be gone so you guys can make it all

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.020 
will be gone so you guys can make it all
the<00:06:31.660> way<00:06:31.750> through<00:06:32.020> it<00:06:32.140> looks<00:06:32.260> like<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:33.030> Giants

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
the way through it looks like the Giants

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.030 
the way through it looks like the Giants
did<00:06:34.180> split<00:06:34.390> up<00:06:34.570> this<00:06:34.870> should<00:06:35.169> still<00:06:35.590> be<00:06:35.710> pretty

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
did split up this should still be pretty

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.100 
did split up this should still be pretty
good<00:06:36.280> we<00:06:36.790> do<00:06:36.910> that<00:06:37.090> all<00:06:37.150> three<00:06:37.450> dragons<00:06:37.900> just

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
good we do that all three dragons just

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.710 
good we do that all three dragons just
going<00:06:38.260> around<00:06:38.320> dominating<00:06:39.360> hopefully<00:06:40.360> the

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
going around dominating hopefully the

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.840 
going around dominating hopefully the
Giants<00:06:41.169> can<00:06:41.289> get<00:06:41.440> to<00:06:41.620> that's<00:06:42.280> air<00:06:42.550> defense

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
Giants can get to that's air defense

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.490 
Giants can get to that's air defense
before<00:06:43.030> it<00:06:43.450> reaches<00:06:43.750> the<00:06:43.780> dragon<00:06:44.229> we'll<00:06:44.350> see

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
before it reaches the dragon we'll see

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.170 
before it reaches the dragon we'll see
how<00:06:44.650> that<00:06:44.710> goes

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
how that goes

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.820 
how that goes
it's<00:06:47.180> not<00:06:47.540> taking<00:06:47.900> too<00:06:47.960> much<00:06:48.080> damage<00:06:48.140> down<00:06:48.560> and

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
it's not taking too much damage down and

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.190 
it's not taking too much damage down and
it<00:06:49.130> looks<00:06:49.310> like<00:06:49.370> it<00:06:49.550> will<00:06:49.670> survive<00:06:50.060> so<00:06:51.020> it's

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
it looks like it will survive so it's

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.360 
it looks like it will survive so it's
pretty<00:06:51.290> much<00:06:51.380> a<00:06:51.530> guarantee<00:06:51.650> three-star<00:06:52.250> now

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
pretty much a guarantee three-star now

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.960 
pretty much a guarantee three-star now
because<00:06:52.780> can't<00:06:53.780> really<00:06:53.930> do<00:06:54.050> much<00:06:54.080> to<00:06:54.880> no<00:06:55.880> other

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
because can't really do much to no other

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.720 
because can't really do much to no other
defenses<00:06:56.300> can<00:06:56.450> do<00:06:56.540> much<00:06:56.720> of<00:06:56.750> that<00:06:56.900> dragon<00:06:57.320> so

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
defenses can do much of that dragon so

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.610 
defenses can do much of that dragon so
looks<00:06:58.730> like<00:06:58.790> we're<00:06:58.940> pretty<00:06:58.970> good<00:06:59.560> goblins<00:07:00.560> are

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
looks like we're pretty good goblins are

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.930 
looks like we're pretty good goblins are
going<00:07:00.770> around<00:07:00.920> getting<00:07:01.190> all<00:07:01.280> the<00:07:01.400> stuff<00:07:01.640> we

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
going around getting all the stuff we
