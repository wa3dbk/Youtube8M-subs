00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.580
 let's show them on this ipad wi-fi + 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.650
 3g what we will find with the new 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.300
 operating system ios 6 that within 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.560
 you will have little available and that 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.329
 us thanks to the beta for 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.609
 developers we can install it 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.350
 to show you the generality of what 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.089
 let's find we will not enter 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.470
 detail in all the features 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:38.210
 new since in later 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.400
 videotutoriales we are going to show you 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.430
 within the channel first steps in ios 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.220
 of Katyn Point TV in any way 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.559
 let's start to review the changes 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.719
 more palpable than this or six in 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.760
 this case on the ipad as you see the 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.460
 adjustments have been organized much more 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.940
 now we will have it better separated by 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.559
 segments for example the section on what 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.379
 what is the connectivity with airplane mode 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.200
 in the part of wifi the section for 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.820
 connect bluetooth other devices 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.679
 here we will have one of the novelties is 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.630
 the section of not bothering this will be 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.820
 much more important in the case of 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.560
 iphone especially so that we do not 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.720
 bother in case of receiving calls 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.000
 messages notifications and that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.470
 later we will explain you without 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.150
 However, if we enter the menu 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.140
 notifications we are also going to 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.970
 find and is 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.440
 as we commented on your own 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.510
 customization of this new 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.820
 characteristic of the six here what 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.100
 we can get is that during a 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.770
 time that we plan to program 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.080
 be a few days a few works in this case the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.130
 iPad this with complete silence also 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.450
 we can 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.540
 let's say that establish some 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.210
 exceptions like the favorites list 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.650
 that we will explain later something 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.840
 important that I know that it's going to change about 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.240
 everything with the arrival of montán lion is 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.710
 the documents and data shared with 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.660
 our max mostly because we can 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.270
 not only save them and synchronize 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.090
 but also edit them for example with 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.700
 pages keynote and numbers or applications 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.289
 compatible with icloud here we will see the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.649
 Sound settings for each 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.260
 moment each event of the system itself 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.630
 operative ios 6 and here we have another 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.340
 novelty the privacy what we're going to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.610
 get with this is that we can 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.100
 deactivate or let's say you limit the use 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.170
 of our information to applications of 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.300
 third parties as here indicates that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.269
 will appear the applications that have 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.650
 requested access to your contacts what 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.780
 same happens with calendars 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 and photographs this will be very important 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.829
 to maintain our security that 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.930
 no third party application is going to 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.720
 intercede in our personal data 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.489
 the messages will activate and mi6 for 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.860
 receive the messages through our 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.870
 idea of apple we remember compatible 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.150
 also now with mac and soon 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.670
 mount lion you can download the beta 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.900
 message on the apple page in the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.569
 part of facetime is also going to be 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.879
 important because now in the 6th we are going 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.799
 to allow not to do it simply with 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.019
 wi-fi networks but also if we're 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.180
 on the street with 3g data networks 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.040
 safari will also receive some 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.409
 news not only performance by 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.590
 course but we will also receive 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.450
 the lash updates more 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.549
 smart is to say they are going to 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.650
 synchronize with icloud to make it 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.750
 now for example we move to another 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.790
 ipad with our idea of ​​apple or also 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.579
 we move to a mark with this idea of 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.379
 apple we are going to have those same tabs 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.180
 open and saved to follow 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.099
 working on any device 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.500
 here as we see we have the account of 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.150
 iTunes store and the app store for 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.400
 synchronize and also of course already the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.439
 paragraph of itunes match 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.390
 here as you see in photos and cameras and that 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.129
 we have another great novelty is my photos 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.870
 in streaming what we're going to get 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.180
 now with streaming photos is that 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.500
 we can define some users with the 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.390
 we want to share this 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.370
 synchronization of such photos 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.739
 way that will be for example my wife 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.829
 have another ipad with an apple id 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.569
 different and we want you to also receive 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.819
 these photos that we made with our 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.250
 iphone with our ipad and so on in your 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.260
 device we can select it for 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.140
 that that photo album in streaming 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.420
 also be shared on your reel 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.579
 this is something that was already happening for example 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.850
 something similar in the galleries of 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.320
 mobileme 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.209
 and here as you see we will have the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.700
 twitter integration not only that already 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.590
 we looked at 25 but also from 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.810
 facebook here we will be able to introduce 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.280
 our user keys our 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.170
 password to be able to perform 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.390
 different actions for example 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.610
 share different things in our 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.900
 social network mark as I like or 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.460
 perform different things that 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.010
 we will proceed to show you in others 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.630
 videotutorials here as you see in the 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.670
 different applications that have 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.710
 included in them 6 there are some 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.320
 difference to start has been included 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.060
 the application of the watch that you see 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.160
 before we did not have and that of course 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.800
 we had on our iphone with the 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.060
 different options of the world clock 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.870
 set an alarm that as you see 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.090
 we can even visualize for weeks 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.610
 if we add one for example 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.660
 and we say that it's going to repeat all the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.660
 Monday Wednesday and Friday 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.780
 we already have it here available and 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.289
 displayed our email 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.300
 in which we are going to have some novelty 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.810
 for example the vip lists let's see 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.000
 as if we add this user to the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.060
 vip list what we are going to get is 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 that a different mailbox is created as you see 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.910
 as a mailbox for important people 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.860
 of which we do not want to miss any 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.629
 message or any information 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.689
 another interesting application 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:44.090
 are the maps the maps have been 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.889
 completely remodeled and redesigned 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.259
 in addition all of it of the hand of the own one 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.270
 apple has different options per 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.030
 example here as you see we have all the 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.800
 information we have a preview 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.930
 we can navigate for example by pressing 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.379
 how to get there we can select the 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.110
 current location as you see here we are going to 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.789
 show what navigation is all 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.669
 the navigation data is going to 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.830
 show through if we position ourselves by 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.050
 example in cupertino that is where apple 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.439
 has the headquarters as you see here yes that we 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:18.080
 will show what the maps are already in 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.719
 three dimensions so that as you see 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.180
 is going to look much better on screen and 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:25.250
 above all it will show us the 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.230
 map information in a way 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.850
 Awesome 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.770
 it also means that there are other 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.510
 novelties a lot of news one of 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.550
 which we like most is in airplane and 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.260
 rolling with the global let's get 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.480
 connect through an appetizer in the 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.490
 television not everything that happens in the 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.920
 screen of our ipad also ipod 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.270
 touch and iphone to display it in the 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.700
 television this again I'll 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.600
 we will show in a videotutorial more than 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.600
 more specific way
