slowly baby alright so we're gonna talk

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.959 
slowly baby alright so we're gonna talk
a<00:00:09.410> little<00:00:09.650> bit<00:00:09.799> about<00:00:09.830> serving<00:00:10.400> and<00:00:10.549> blocking

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
a little bit about serving and blocking

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.749 
a little bit about serving and blocking
because<00:00:11.420> I<00:00:11.540> think<00:00:11.599> they<00:00:11.900> exist<00:00:12.050> in<00:00:12.559> some<00:00:13.490> sort

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
because I think they exist in some sort

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.980 
because I think they exist in some sort
of<00:00:14.290> business<00:00:15.670> formula<00:00:16.670> but<00:00:17.540> when<00:00:17.660> it<00:00:17.750> talks

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
of business formula but when it talks

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.560 
of business formula but when it talks
about<00:00:18.140> it<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:19.250> lower<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.699> level<00:00:20.000> of<00:00:20.090> play<00:00:20.359> the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
about it the lower the level of play the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.960 
about it the lower the level of play the
more<00:00:20.720> important<00:00:21.170> serving<00:00:21.560> is<00:00:21.710> alright<00:00:22.430> so

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
more important serving is alright so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.370 
more important serving is alright so
you're<00:00:23.119> going<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.300> have<00:00:23.420> more<00:00:23.689> aces<00:00:24.140> at<00:00:24.289> the

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
you're going to have more aces at the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.130 
you're going to have more aces at the
lower<00:00:24.590> level<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:26.300> higher<00:00:26.510> levels<00:00:26.960> that's

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
lower level and the higher levels that's

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.300 
lower level and the higher levels that's
when<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:27.439> determine<00:00:27.710> that's<00:00:28.010> how<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:28.130> get

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
when you determine that's how you get

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.519 
when you determine that's how you get
better<00:00:28.550> passing<00:00:29.150> will<00:00:29.599> always<00:00:29.900> predict<00:00:30.380> your

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
better passing will always predict your

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.119 
better passing will always predict your
level<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:30.890> play<00:00:31.660> but<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.230> serve<00:00:33.470> pass<00:00:33.769> games

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
level of play but the serve pass games

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.950 
level of play but the serve pass games

lower levels you know who knows what

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.350 
lower levels you know who knows what
it's<00:00:43.250> going<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.430> be<00:00:43.549> at<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.729> higher<00:00:43.909> levels

at<00:00:49.670> whatever<00:00:49.940> numbers<00:00:50.330> are<00:00:50.479> important<00:00:50.960> for

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
at whatever numbers are important for

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.590 
at whatever numbers are important for
you<00:00:51.229> to<00:00:51.379> determine<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.070> most<00:00:52.879> college<00:00:53.330> teams

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
you to determine that most college teams

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.969 
you to determine that most college teams
are<00:00:53.809> probably<00:00:54.080> looking<00:00:54.229> at<00:00:54.350> about<00:00:54.530> one<00:00:54.739> point

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
are probably looking at about one point

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.840 
are probably looking at about one point
five<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.610> one<00:00:55.989> but<00:00:56.989> I<00:00:57.260> mean<00:00:57.650> we<00:00:58.040> and<00:00:58.400> again<00:00:58.820> I

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
five to one but I mean we and again I

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.060 
five to one but I mean we and again I
can<00:00:59.150> only<00:00:59.239> talk<00:00:59.510> about<00:00:59.540> my<00:00:59.989> team<00:01:00.290> so<00:01:00.530> it's<00:01:00.920> not

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
can only talk about my team so it's not

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.320 
can only talk about my team so it's not
like<00:01:01.250> oh<00:01:01.369> yeah<00:01:01.549> well<00:01:01.729> you've<00:01:01.879> got<00:01:02.030> so-and-so

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
like oh yeah well you've got so-and-so

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.789 
like oh yeah well you've got so-and-so
that's<00:01:02.989> not<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.350> point

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
that's not the point

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.890 
that's not the point
we've<00:01:04.100> had<00:01:04.339> some<00:01:04.670> years<00:01:04.879> where<00:01:05.479> we<00:01:05.630> were<00:01:05.780> in

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
we've had some years where we were in

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.200 
we've had some years where we were in
last<00:01:06.110> place<00:01:06.530> in<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.950> conference<00:01:07.190> in<00:01:07.760> aces<00:01:08.330> and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
last place in the conference in aces and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.270 
last place in the conference in aces and
won<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.390> national<00:01:11.840> championship<00:01:12.530> all<00:01:13.100> right

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
won the national championship all right

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.520 
won the national championship all right
so<00:01:13.730> we<00:01:13.880> were<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.150> worst<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.870> eleven<00:01:15.260> teams

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
so we were the worst of the eleven teams

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.090 
so we were the worst of the eleven teams
in<00:01:15.920> serving<00:01:16.910> aces<00:01:17.450> but<00:01:18.230> we<00:01:18.380> won<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.680> national

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
in serving aces but we won the national

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.090 
in serving aces but we won the national
championship<00:01:19.700> however<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:21.290> were<00:01:21.440> first<00:01:21.800> in

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
championship however we were first in

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.870 
championship however we were first in
digs<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.850> first<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:24.080> blocking<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.740> first<00:01:25.700> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.260 
digs and first in blocking and first in
hitting<00:01:26.290> but<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:27.920> have<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.430> find<00:01:28.670> what's

you know two two great middles that were
all<00:02:41.330> Americans<00:02:41.900> we<00:02:42.080> did<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.320> every<00:02:42.560> day<00:02:42.770> people

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
all Americans we did it every day people

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.340 
all Americans we did it every day people
would<00:02:43.550> serve<00:02:43.790> short<00:02:44.060> they'd<00:02:44.630> pass<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.230> they'd

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
would serve short they'd pass and they'd

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.550 
would serve short they'd pass and they'd
hit<00:02:45.560> we'd<00:02:46.010> put<00:02:46.280> four<00:02:46.850> blockers<00:02:47.210> and<00:02:47.810> five

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
hit we'd put four blockers and five

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.950 
hit we'd put four blockers and five
diggers<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.130> they'd<00:02:49.610> still<00:02:49.880> score<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:50.810> we'd

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
diggers and they'd still score then we'd

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.810 
diggers and they'd still score then we'd
say<00:02:51.200> maybe<00:02:51.650> we've<00:02:51.890> got<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.190> wrong<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.670> should

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
say maybe we've got it wrong it should

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.450 
say maybe we've got it wrong it should
be<00:02:52.910> five<00:02:53.210> blockers<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.080> four<00:02:54.590> diggers<00:02:55.010> so

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
be five blockers and four diggers so

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.820 
be five blockers and four diggers so
when<00:02:55.700> we<00:02:55.820> played<00:02:56.060> teams<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:57.080> was<00:02:57.200> three<00:02:57.560> on

and they served a short and we cited out

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.560 
and they served a short and we cited out
90%<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.650> rotation<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:04.460> was<00:03:04.910> glad<00:03:05.150> people

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
90% in that rotation I was glad people

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.450 
90% in that rotation I was glad people
were<00:03:05.660> reading<00:03:05.960> that<00:03:06.080> book<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.860> said<00:03:07.160> serve

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
were reading that book that said serve

were reading that book that said serve
short<00:03:07.790> all<00:03:08.660> right

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
short all right

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.880 
short all right
because<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:10.160> was<00:03:10.850> very<00:03:11.120> easy<00:03:11.420> but<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.470> was<00:03:12.590> only

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
because it was very easy but it was only

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.680 
because it was very easy but it was only
easy<00:03:13.070> because<00:03:13.340> we<00:03:13.520> practiced<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.240> those

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
easy because we practiced and those

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.080 
easy because we practiced and those
players<00:03:14.990> were<00:03:15.170> good<00:03:15.620> if<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.280> players<00:03:16.730> are<00:03:16.910> no

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
players were good if the players are no

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.970 
players were good if the players are no
good<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.990> practice<00:03:18.530> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
good and you practice it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.270 
good and you practice it
you're<00:03:19.430> still<00:03:19.850> screwed<00:03:20.270> all<00:03:20.840> right<00:03:21.280> because

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
you're still screwed all right because

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.540 
you're still screwed all right because
back<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.209> rule<00:03:23.390> one<00:03:23.660> if<00:03:23.840> they're<00:03:24.020> no<00:03:24.200> good

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
back to rule one if they're no good

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.280 
back to rule one if they're no good
practice<00:03:25.550> makes<00:03:25.820> them<00:03:26.030> better<00:03:26.300> but<00:03:27.110> the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
practice makes them better but the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.949 
practice makes them better but the
answer<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:27.770> hey<00:03:28.070> we'll<00:03:28.760> pass<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.360> ball<00:03:29.540> short

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
answer is hey we'll pass the ball short

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.080 
answer is hey we'll pass the ball short
but<00:03:30.410> don't<00:03:30.650> set<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.190> girl<00:03:31.400> who's<00:03:31.640> passed<00:03:31.880> the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
but don't set the girl who's passed the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.170 
but don't set the girl who's passed the
book<00:03:32.240> art<00:03:32.690> because<00:03:33.380> she<00:03:33.530> can't<00:03:33.800> hit<00:03:33.980> quick<00:03:34.280> all

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
book art because she can't hit quick all

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.430 
book art because she can't hit quick all
right<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:37.390> serving<00:03:38.390> at<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.840> center<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.410> think

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
right so serving at the center I think

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.560 
right so serving at the center I think
helps<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.100> lot<00:03:40.220> when<00:03:40.760> you're<00:03:40.880> playing<00:03:41.150> against

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
helps a lot when you're playing against

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.240 
helps a lot when you're playing against
team<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:41.959> has<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:42.110> back<00:03:42.440> row<00:03:42.709> setter

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
team that has a back row setter

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.550 
team that has a back row setter
wherever<00:03:44.060> she's<00:03:44.360> coming<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:44.840> from<00:03:45.140> you're

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
wherever she's coming in from you're

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.830 
wherever she's coming in from you're
just<00:03:45.830> serving<00:03:46.220> at<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.459> individual<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.570> we<00:03:47.690> do
