00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
view and uncle quad view again I'm just
going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.049> press<00:02:04.200> forward<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.979> rotate

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
going to press forward to kind of rotate

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.080 
going to press forward to kind of rotate
around<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> I've<00:02:07.710> made<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> very<00:02:08.429> simple<00:02:08.909> little

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
around so I've made a very simple little

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.699 
around so I've made a very simple little
landscape<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> could<00:02:10.049> spend<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.530> more

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
landscape and I could spend much more

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.650 
landscape and I could spend much more
time<00:02:10.769> on<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.159> and<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.519> could<00:02:11.700> go<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.300> I'll

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
time on it and I could go in and I'll

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.910 
time on it and I could go in and I'll
actually<00:02:12.840> show<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.200> what<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.530> do<00:02:13.709> here

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
actually show you what I can do here

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.910 
actually show you what I can do here
press<00:02:14.849> tab<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.150> go<00:02:15.450> into<00:02:15.599> edit<00:02:15.780> mode<00:02:15.930> press<00:02:16.349> age

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
press tab to go into edit mode press age

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.290 
press tab to go into edit mode press age
everything<00:02:17.370> impressed<00:02:17.670> w<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.240> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
everything impressed w to go to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.150 
everything impressed w to go to
subdivide<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:21.319> I'm<00:02:22.319> going<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.530> up<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.920> number

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
subdivide and I'm going to up the number

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.600 
subdivide and I'm going to up the number
of<00:02:23.250> cuts<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.610> little<00:02:23.819> bit<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.250> now<00:02:26.400> that's

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
of cuts a little bit and so now that's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.070 
of cuts a little bit and so now that's
super<00:02:26.970> smooth<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.510> has<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> ton<00:02:28.050> of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
super smooth and it has a ton of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.690 
super smooth and it has a ton of
vertices<00:02:28.530> right<00:02:28.739> now<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.069> it's<00:02:29.190> taking<00:02:29.520> up<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
vertices right now so it's taking up a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.210 
vertices right now so it's taking up a
lot<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.880> processing<00:02:30.510> power<00:02:30.739> but<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.770> could<00:02:32.069> also

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
lot of processing power but I could also

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.580 
lot of processing power but I could also
go<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.000> add<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:34.130> tab<00:02:35.130> add<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:36.330> modifier<00:02:36.959> like

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
go in and add a tab add a modifier like

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.479 
go in and add a tab add a modifier like
a<00:02:37.620> sub<00:02:38.040> surf<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:39.290> subdivision<00:02:40.290> rather<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> up

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
a sub surf or subdivision rather and up

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.449 
a sub surf or subdivision rather and up
that<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:42.150> bit<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.160> gets<00:02:44.340> a

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
that a little bit and it just gets a

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.130 
that a little bit and it just gets a
little<00:02:44.489> bit<00:02:44.790> smoother<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.360> all<00:02:45.569> this<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.840> is

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
little bit smoother so all this is is

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.839 
little bit smoother so all this is is
just<00:02:46.349> basically<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.040> go<00:02:47.160> over<00:02:47.310> proportional

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
just basically to go over proportional

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.110 
just basically to go over proportional
editing<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.750> show<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.959> how<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.319> make<00:02:49.769> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
editing and to show you how to make a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.729 
editing and to show you how to make a
unique-looking<00:02:51.120> landscape<00:02:51.900> bye<00:02:52.500> guys<00:02:52.709> thanks

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
unique-looking landscape bye guys thanks

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.220 
unique-looking landscape bye guys thanks
for<00:02:53.100> watching
