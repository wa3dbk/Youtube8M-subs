00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
particular bike says now that we have

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
particular bike says now that we have
the<00:00:52.800> motor<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.190> top<00:00:53.430> dead<00:00:53.670> center<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.539> we're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the motor on top dead center what we're

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
the motor on top dead center what we're
going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.350> take<00:00:55.649> our<00:00:55.800> feeler<00:00:56.010> gauge<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
going to do is take our feeler gauge and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
going to do is take our feeler gauge and
check<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> clearance<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> we're

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
check what the clearance is and we're

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.689 
check what the clearance is and we're
going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.289> check<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> between<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> cam<00:00:59.370> lobe

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
going to check it between the cam lobe

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
going to check it between the cam lobe
and<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> bucket<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.140> we're<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.800> if

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and the bucket so we're going to see if

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.000 
and the bucket so we're going to see if
this<00:01:02.010> 4,000<00:01:02.850> fits<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.229> does<00:01:04.439> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this 4,000 fits in there and it does so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.890 
this 4,000 fits in there and it does so
our<00:01:05.129> clearance<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> four<00:01:05.909> thousands<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.689> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
our clearance is four thousands on this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.240 
our clearance is four thousands on this
so<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.010> take<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
so what I'm going to do is take that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
so what I'm going to do is take that
clearance<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.479> write<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.780> down

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
clearance and I'm going to write it down

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.859 
clearance and I'm going to write it down
for<00:01:09.990> my<00:01:10.320> intake<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> go<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> my

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
for my intake then I'm going to go to my

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.520 
for my intake then I'm going to go to my
next<00:01:12.930> valve<00:01:14.689> it's<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.750> little<00:01:15.990> loose<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.350> there

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
next valve it's a little loose on there

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.690 
next valve it's a little loose on there
so<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> go<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> next<00:01:17.549> size<00:01:20.509> and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
so I'm going to go to the next size and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.929 
so I'm going to go to the next size and
that<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:23.880> does<00:01:24.060> fit<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> one's<00:01:24.930> at<00:01:25.080> 5,000

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
that one does fit so this one's at 5,000

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.850 
that one does fit so this one's at 5,000
repeat<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.090> operation<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.049> four<00:01:28.350> valves

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
repeat this operation on all four valves

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.679

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
first thing is they're different sizes

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.290 
first thing is they're different sizes
they're<00:02:46.260> not<00:02:46.410> interchangeable<00:02:47.180> second<00:02:48.180> thing

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
they're not interchangeable second thing

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.260 
they're not interchangeable second thing
is<00:02:48.450> don't<00:02:49.110> lose<00:02:49.590> these<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:50.070> they<00:02:50.400> drop<00:02:50.730> down<00:02:51.000> in

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
is don't lose these if they drop down in

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.940 
is don't lose these if they drop down in
or<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.570> leave<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.870> out<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.530> motor<00:02:52.770> could

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
or you leave this out the motor could

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.890 
or you leave this out the motor could
lock<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:54.120> don't<00:02:54.210> want<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.540> happening

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
lock up and we don't want that happening

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.930 
lock up and we don't want that happening
so<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:55.800> we<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:56.310> apart<00:02:56.640> we're<00:02:56.760> going<00:02:56.880> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
so now we have this apart we're going to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.860 
so now we have this apart we're going to
go<00:02:57.060> ahead<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.450> get<00:02:57.840> these<00:02:58.020> cams<00:02:58.320> out<00:02:59.690> there<00:03:00.690> we

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
go ahead and get these cams out there we

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.860 
go ahead and get these cams out there we
go<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.910> don't<00:03:03.090> want<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.330> lose<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.630> cam<00:03:03.840> chain

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
go you don't want to lose the cam chain

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.530 
go you don't want to lose the cam chain
down<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.920> what<00:03:05.070> we're<00:03:05.220> going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.370> do<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.940> good

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
down so what we're going to do a good

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.850 
down so what we're going to do a good
rule<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.750> thumb<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.050> I'll<00:03:07.290> set<00:03:07.470> these<00:03:07.620> cams

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
rule of thumb is I'll set these cams

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.320 
rule of thumb is I'll set these cams
over<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.310> side<00:03:08.490> I'm<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:09.000> going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.150> hang

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
over to the side I'm just going to hang

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.120 
over to the side I'm just going to hang
my<00:03:09.420> T<00:03:09.480> wrench<00:03:09.780> off<00:03:09.960> of<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.890> will<00:03:10.950> keep

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
my T wrench off of it and that will keep

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.800 
my T wrench off of it and that will keep
it<00:03:11.280> tight<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.670> won't<00:03:12.150> fall<00:03:12.330> off<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.570> sprocket

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
it tight it won't fall off the sprocket

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.630 
it tight it won't fall off the sprocket
on<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.200> bottom<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.070> take<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> peek<00:03:14.610> here

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
on the bottom if you take a peek here

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.580 
on the bottom if you take a peek here
though<00:03:14.940> our<00:03:15.120> cams<00:03:15.450> there's<00:03:16.170> two<00:03:16.440> different

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
though our cams there's two different

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.350 
though our cams there's two different
cams<00:03:17.040> in<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.340> obviously<00:03:17.790> we<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:17.970> an<00:03:18.090> intake

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
cams in this obviously we have an intake

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.360 
cams in this obviously we have an intake
and<00:03:18.540> exhaust<00:03:18.600> if<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.650> were<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.920> go<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:20.190> this

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
and exhaust if I were to go like this

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.830 
and exhaust if I were to go like this
they<00:03:20.580> kind<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.850> look<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> same<00:03:21.300> but<00:03:21.630> what

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
they kind of look the same but what

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.540 
they kind of look the same but what
tells<00:03:22.320> them<00:03:22.500> apart<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.280> little<00:03:23.520> piece

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
tells them apart is this little piece

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.250 
tells them apart is this little piece
right<00:03:23.910> here<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.690> what<00:03:24.930> we<00:03:25.020> call<00:03:25.230> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
right here this is what we call a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.840 
right here this is what we call a
decompression<00:03:25.800> valve<00:03:25.980> what<00:03:26.670> that

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
decompression valve what that

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.310 
decompression valve what that
decompression<00:03:27.510> valve<00:03:27.540> does<00:03:27.960> is<00:03:28.140> when<00:03:28.290> you

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
decompression valve does is when you

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.470 
decompression valve does is when you
kickstart<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.010> bike<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.430> bumps<00:03:30.120> open<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
kickstart that bike it bumps open the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.230 
kickstart that bike it bumps open the
exhaust<00:03:30.870> valve<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.040> smidge<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.090> bike

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
exhaust valve just a smidge so the bike

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.330 
exhaust valve just a smidge so the bike
can<00:03:33.390> start<00:03:33.690> easier<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.560> we'll<00:03:34.740> put<00:03:34.890> those<00:03:35.010> cam

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
can start easier so we'll put those cam

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.790 
can start easier so we'll put those cam
decide<00:03:35.760> what<00:03:36.510> we're<00:03:36.750> worried<00:03:37.170> about<00:03:37.260> now<00:03:37.620> is

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
decide what we're worried about now is

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.700 
decide what we're worried about now is
our<00:03:38.400> shims<00:03:38.790> now<00:03:39.090> what<00:03:39.330> happens<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.410> shims

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
our shims now what happens is the shims

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.830 
our shims now what happens is the shims
are<00:03:40.860> underneath<00:03:41.220> these<00:03:41.460> buckets<00:03:41.940> we're<00:03:42.690> going

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
are underneath these buckets we're going

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.510 
are underneath these buckets we're going
to<00:03:42.900> come<00:03:43.080> back<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.440> two<00:03:43.590> seconds<00:03:44.040> here<00:03:44.160> pull

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
to come back in two seconds here pull

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.150 
to come back in two seconds here pull
those<00:03:44.700> out<00:03:44.910> check<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.840> manual<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.410> then<00:03:46.920> get

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
those out check the manual and then get

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.770 
those out check the manual and then get
the<00:03:47.250> correct<00:03:47.610> shims<00:03:47.880> back<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.420> there<00:03:48.630> and

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
the correct shims back in there and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.050 
the correct shims back in there and
button<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.770> thing<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:50.130> have<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.400> cams<00:03:50.730> out

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
button this thing I have the cams out

button this thing I have the cams out
we're<00:03:51.600> going<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.780> go<00:03:51.870> ahead<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.230> remove<00:03:52.320> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
we're going to go ahead and remove the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.830 
we're going to go ahead and remove the
buckets<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.280> particular<00:03:53.970> application<00:03:54.510> is

what<00:03:55.320> we<00:03:55.380> call<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> shim<00:03:55.980> under<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.730> shim

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
what we call a shim under it's shim

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.940 
what we call a shim under it's shim
under<00:03:57.209> bucket<00:03:57.570> so<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:57.990> have<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.290> special<00:03:58.470> tool

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
under bucket so I have a special tool

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.490 
under bucket so I have a special tool
here<00:03:59.310> right<00:03:59.910> here<00:04:00.090> it's<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.110> little<00:04:01.290> suction

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
here right here it's a little suction

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.680 
here right here it's a little suction
cup<00:04:01.770> what<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.430> does<00:04:02.610> is<00:04:02.790> pulls<00:04:03.420> out<00:04:03.570> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
cup what it does is pulls out the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.420 
cup what it does is pulls out the
buckets<00:04:04.050> if<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.590> take<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.800> peek<00:04:05.040> in<00:04:05.190> here<00:04:05.310> you

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
buckets if you take a peek in here you

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.920 
buckets if you take a peek in here you
can<00:04:05.550> see<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.820> four<00:04:06.030> shims<00:04:06.330> in<00:04:06.450> there<00:04:06.630> this

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
can see the four shims in there this

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.480 
can see the four shims in there this
tool<00:04:07.170> actually<00:04:07.350> we<00:04:07.650> even<00:04:07.800> work<00:04:07.950> on<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.220> shims

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
tool actually we even work on the shims

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.640 
tool actually we even work on the shims
what<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.060> shim<00:04:09.330> is<00:04:09.510> it's<00:04:09.959> just<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.260> little<00:04:10.410> piece

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
what a shim is it's just a little piece

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.610 
what a shim is it's just a little piece
of<00:04:10.860> metal<00:04:11.510> precision<00:04:12.510> metal<00:04:12.990> I<00:04:13.230> shouldn't<00:04:13.500> say

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
of metal precision metal I shouldn't say

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.530 
of metal precision metal I shouldn't say
just<00:04:13.650> metal<00:04:14.100> because<00:04:14.640> they<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:15.270> don't<00:04:15.420> want

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
just metal because they you don't want

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.960 
just metal because they you don't want
to<00:04:15.600> grind<00:04:15.870> these<00:04:16.109> or<00:04:16.760> tamper<00:04:17.760> with<00:04:17.880> them

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
to grind these or tamper with them

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.400 
to grind these or tamper with them
anyway<00:04:18.299> there's<00:04:18.540> different<00:04:18.840> thicknesses<00:04:19.230> for

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
anyway there's different thicknesses for

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.390 
anyway there's different thicknesses for
them<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.650> that's<00:04:19.920> what's<00:04:20.160> going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.310> change

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
them and that's what's going to change

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.099 
them and that's what's going to change
your<00:04:20.730> clearance<00:04:21.030> out<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.690> we're<00:04:21.840> going<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.020> go

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
your clearance out so we're going to go

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.140 
your clearance out so we're going to go
ahead<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.350> put<00:04:22.500> them<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.340> spot<00:04:23.729> where<00:04:24.120> we

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
ahead and put them in the spot where we

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.670 
ahead and put them in the spot where we
wrote<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.630> on<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.780> paper<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.440> very

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
wrote it on the paper it's very

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.750 
wrote it on the paper it's very
important<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:26.400> keep

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
important that we keep

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.730 
important that we keep
on<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.970> paper<00:04:27.210> because<00:04:27.780> what<00:04:28.470> we're<00:04:28.590> going<00:04:28.710> to

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
on the paper because what we're going to

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
on the paper because what we're going to
do<00:04:28.980> is<00:04:29.130> consult<00:04:29.970> our<00:04:30.210> manual<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:31.220> our<00:04:32.220> manual

do is consult our manual and our manual

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.040 
do is consult our manual and our manual
will<00:04:32.970> have<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.150> little<00:04:33.330> shim<00:04:33.600> chart<00:04:33.870> in<00:04:33.960> there

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
will have a little shim chart in there

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.200 
will have a little shim chart in there
and<00:04:34.230> it<00:04:34.590> will<00:04:34.650> tell<00:04:34.890> us<00:04:34.920> exactly<00:04:35.100> what<00:04:35.820> shims

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
and it will tell us exactly what shims

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.750 
and it will tell us exactly what shims
we<00:04:36.390> need<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.660> replace<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.170> with<00:04:37.400> here's<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.490> tip

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
we need to replace it with here's a tip

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.760 
we need to replace it with here's a tip

sure so let's get these shims back in
make<00:04:48.450> sure<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.750> numbers<00:04:49.050> are<00:04:49.140> down<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.560> you

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
make sure the numbers are down so you

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.920 
make sure the numbers are down so you
don't<00:04:49.770> wear<00:04:50.070> off<00:04:50.250> now<00:04:51.210> we're<00:04:51.450> ready<00:04:51.630> for<00:04:51.720> our

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.450 
buckets let's put those buckets back in
it's<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> good<00:04:55.560> idea<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.860> put<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.040> light<00:04:56.190> coating

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
it's a good idea to put a light coating

to do is take a look at your motor and

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.180 
to do is take a look at your motor and
see<00:05:05.730> where<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.270> cam<00:05:06.540> chain<00:05:06.870> tensioner<00:05:06.930> is<00:05:07.860> on

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
see where the cam chain tensioner is on

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.860 
see where the cam chain tensioner is on
this<00:05:08.490> particular<00:05:08.970> motor<00:05:09.180> our<00:05:09.390> cam<00:05:09.660> chain

this particular motor our cam chain
tensioner<00:05:09.930> is<00:05:10.410> right<00:05:11.010> here<00:05:11.310> now<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.600> plays

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
tensioner is right here now that plays

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.930 
tensioner is right here now that plays
an<00:05:13.260> important<00:05:13.740> part<00:05:13.770> because<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.730> always

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
an important part because you always

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.930 
an important part because you always
want<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.330> set<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.340> marks<00:05:17.340> on<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.550> non

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
want to set the the marks on the non

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.300 
want to set the the marks on the non
tensioner<00:05:18.450> side<00:05:18.660> first<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:19.320> it's<00:05:19.950> always<00:05:20.190> a

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
tensioner side first so it's always a

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.160 
tensioner side first so it's always a
good<00:05:20.490> idea<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.850> put<00:05:21.090> this<00:05:21.270> cam<00:05:21.570> in<00:05:21.750> first<00:05:22.020> in

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
good idea to put this cam in first in

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.750 
good idea to put this cam in first in
this<00:05:22.260> particular<00:05:22.530> model<00:05:22.890> this<00:05:23.310> happens<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.730> be

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
this particular model this happens to be

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.640 
this particular model this happens to be
our<00:05:23.970> exhaust<00:05:24.360> cam<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:25.170> what<00:05:25.350> we're<00:05:25.470> going<00:05:25.590> to

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
our exhaust cam so what we're going to

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.610 
our exhaust cam so what we're going to
do<00:05:25.830> here<00:05:26.070> is<00:05:26.190> pull<00:05:26.760> chain<00:05:27.660> up<00:05:27.840> we're<00:05:28.230> still<00:05:28.260> on

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
do here is pull chain up we're still on

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.410 
do here is pull chain up we're still on
top<00:05:28.830> dead<00:05:29.070> center<00:05:29.400> down<00:05:29.610> here<00:05:29.850> this<00:05:30.000> hasn't

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
top dead center down here this hasn't

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.630 
top dead center down here this hasn't
moved<00:05:30.540> yet<00:05:30.720> so<00:05:31.410> we're<00:05:31.650> going<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.800> go<00:05:31.950> ahead<00:05:32.040> get

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
moved yet so we're going to go ahead get

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.390 
moved yet so we're going to go ahead get
our<00:05:32.820> exhaust<00:05:33.150> cam<00:05:33.450> in<00:05:34.040> there's<00:05:35.040> going<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.250> be<00:05:35.340> a

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
our exhaust cam in there's going to be a

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.250 
our exhaust cam in there's going to be a
little<00:05:35.610> dot<00:05:35.820> and<00:05:36.120> we're<00:05:36.750> going<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:36.900> go<00:05:37.050> ahead

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
little dot and we're going to go ahead

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.220 
little dot and we're going to go ahead
and<00:05:37.500> get<00:05:37.920> that<00:05:37.950> dot<00:05:38.400> lined<00:05:38.790> up<00:05:39.000> directly<00:05:39.230> with

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
and get that dot lined up directly with

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.740 
and get that dot lined up directly with
the<00:05:40.860> line<00:05:41.100> on<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.400> case<00:05:41.610> so<00:05:42.120> now<00:05:42.450> we're<00:05:42.630> ready

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
the line on the case so now we're ready

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.350 
the line on the case so now we're ready
for<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.170> intake<00:05:43.500> cam<00:05:43.740> our<00:05:43.980> intake<00:05:44.670> cam<00:05:44.940> we<00:05:45.240> do

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
for the intake cam our intake cam we do

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.020 
for the intake cam our intake cam we do
the<00:05:45.480> same<00:05:45.690> exact<00:05:46.110> thing<00:05:47.720> slide<00:05:48.720> that<00:05:48.930> in<00:05:50.030> now

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
the same exact thing slide that in now

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.120 
the same exact thing slide that in now
the<00:05:51.450> reason<00:05:51.780> we<00:05:51.870> do<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.170> non<00:05:52.350> tensioner<00:05:52.920> side

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
the reason we do the non tensioner side

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.100 
the reason we do the non tensioner side
first<00:05:53.490> is<00:05:53.760> because<00:05:54.300> if<00:05:54.420> there's<00:05:54.570> any<00:05:54.720> slack

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
first is because if there's any slack

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.780 
first is because if there's any slack
that<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.440> tension<00:05:55.770> brings<00:05:55.980> up<00:05:56.160> it's<00:05:56.490> going<00:05:56.700> to

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
that the tension brings up it's going to

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.150 
that the tension brings up it's going to
bring<00:05:56.970> this<00:05:57.120> stop<00:05:57.540> down<00:05:57.870> so<00:05:58.470> now<00:05:58.710> we<00:05:58.770> got<00:05:59.040> the

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
bring this stop down so now we got the

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.980 
bring this stop down so now we got the
cams<00:05:59.430> on<00:05:59.670> we're<00:06:00.150> going<00:06:00.300> to<00:06:00.360> go<00:06:00.510> ahead<00:06:00.750> and

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
cams on we're going to go ahead and

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.770 
cams on we're going to go ahead and
we're<00:06:01.170> going<00:06:01.320> to<00:06:01.560> put<00:06:01.920> our<00:06:02.190> CE<00:06:02.880> clips<00:06:03.150> in<00:06:03.360> very

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
we're going to put our CE clips in very

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.100 
we're going to put our CE clips in very
important<00:06:04.440> don't<00:06:04.620> forget<00:06:04.710> those<00:06:05.190> and

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
important don't forget those and

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.260 
important don't forget those and
remember<00:06:07.110> they're<00:06:07.260> different<00:06:07.470> sizes<00:06:08.120> once<00:06:09.120> we

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
remember they're different sizes once we

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.030 
remember they're different sizes once we
set<00:06:09.480> those<00:06:09.660> on<00:06:09.900> we're<00:06:10.530> going<00:06:10.650> to<00:06:10.710> take<00:06:10.920> our

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
set those on we're going to take our

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.610 
set those on we're going to take our
caps<00:06:11.310> our<00:06:11.610> cam<00:06:12.000> caps<00:06:12.300> remember<00:06:13.050> exhausted

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
caps our cam caps remember exhausted

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.770 
caps our cam caps remember exhausted
intake<00:06:13.950> and<00:06:14.250> this<00:06:14.610> is<00:06:14.760> very<00:06:15.060> important<00:06:15.630> on

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
intake and this is very important on

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.900 
intake and this is very important on
these<00:06:16.230> high-performance<00:06:16.440> models<00:06:17.310> you<00:06:17.400> got<00:06:17.730> to

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
these high-performance models you got to

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.180 
these high-performance models you got to
be<00:06:18.000> very<00:06:18.210> gentle<00:06:18.660> with<00:06:18.720> these<00:06:18.930> if<00:06:19.800> they<00:06:20.100> are

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
be very gentle with these if they are

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.790 
be very gentle with these if they are
over<00:06:20.430> torqued<00:06:21.030> or<00:06:21.210> if<00:06:21.870> they<00:06:22.140> are<00:06:22.320> put<00:06:22.680> in

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800
