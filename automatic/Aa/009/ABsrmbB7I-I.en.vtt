00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.580
Hi, I'm Jay from Real Street Performance.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.420
Today we're going to take a look at the relationship between the pin and the piston, and how to install

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.960
the clips that retain the pin into the piston.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.280
So out of the pieces of your human body that has the most nerve endings, fingertips are in the top 5.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.780
You're going to use them to feel around for sharp edges.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:41.180
The fact that this pin will not pass through this piston, there is a very small, unhappy little edge somewhere.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.940
This one has already been worked out.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.220
It just falls through.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.300
Your machine shop is probably going to bill you for pin fitting.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.260
The manufacturer has probably billed you for pin fitting.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.060
And everyone will claim that everything will just slide together.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.240
You're gonna find that enough that it's gonna cause this pin to stick.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.240
If you find some sharp edges or some burs, I just take some fine cloth or sandpaper.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.540
And just drag it around the area and create a radius on the piece of material that you are working on

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.200
to get any high spots off the machined edge.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.300
If the pin will fall through the piston, you know that you got it all cleaned.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.440
When you're working with these clips, a couple little tips.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.840
Inevitably, you're gonna shoot one of these things across the room. You're gonna have to go look for it.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.760
It's just part of the game if you are not careful.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.980
You want to put the circlip about halfway into the pin, and then use your thumb.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.060
I just use this little angle pic to roll the edge in slowly.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.440
And then once I have it about half way in, I'll just use the pin. I can just seat it in with that

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.120
until you hear it click.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:57.160
This is good to go. It's just about having a good clean, edge free, bur free, trash free,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.780
debris free assembly to ensure you are not putting any material in these pin bores.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.480
You want to make sure the pin turns freely after it's assembled because a very small piece

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.400
of metal or a very small scratch in this pin bore can just perpetuate into a larger problem as the engine is run.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.380
I hope you're taking away some information from these little bits.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.700
Next week we're gonna do spark plug heat range and plug gap.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.540
And how you will work that in your tuning recipe. So stay tuned.
