the 18 inch edge across the top now that

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.580 
the 18 inch edge across the top now that
is<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:21.060> often<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.900> selvage

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
is very often the one with the selvage

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.820 
is very often the one with the selvage
just<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> help<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.400> guide<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.750> I've<00:01:25.140> folded

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
just to help you guide then I've folded

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.390 
just to help you guide then I've folded

up the other the rest of the fabric so

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.710 
up the other the rest of the fabric so
that<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.670> more<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:29.970> less<00:01:30.000> folded<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.689> half

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that it's more or less folded in half

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.060 
that it's more or less folded in half
but<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.240> top<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> fabric<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.650> lined<00:01:34.890> up

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
but the top of the fabric is lined up

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.090 
but the top of the fabric is lined up
with<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.729> lines<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.829> ruler<00:01:37.829> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
with one of the lines of my ruler so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.670 
with one of the lines of my ruler so
that<00:01:38.220> i<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.210> line<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.350> now

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that i know that it's all in line so now

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
that i know that it's all in line so now
i'm<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.280> cut<00:01:41.520> off<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:44.149> edges<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.780> make

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
i'm going to cut off the edges to make

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.719 
i'm going to cut off the edges to make
sure<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.380> I've<00:01:46.470> got<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.710> completely<00:01:47.220> straight

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.030 
sure that I've got a completely straight
edge<00:01:48.530> going<00:01:49.530> down<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:51.049> which<00:01:52.049> takes<00:01:52.470> me<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
edge going down here which takes me to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.999 
edge going down here which takes me to
their<00:01:53.840> right<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.229> I'm<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> cut<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
their right so I'm going to cut that

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.740 
their right so I'm going to cut that
edge<00:01:57.979> then<00:01:58.979> I'm<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.549> cut<00:01:59.820> nine<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
edge then I'm going to cut nine and a

terribly<00:05:30.159> interesting<00:05:30.610> so<00:05:31.210> what<00:05:31.720> I'm<00:05:31.840> going

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
terribly interesting so what I'm going

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.430 
terribly interesting so what I'm going
to<00:05:32.139> do<00:05:32.349> is<00:05:32.699> take<00:05:33.699> this<00:05:34.000> one<00:05:34.479> underneath<00:05:34.960> it

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
to do is take this one underneath it

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.520 
to do is take this one underneath it
every<00:05:35.949> second<00:05:36.550> row<00:05:36.789> basically<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:37.659> flip<00:05:38.409> it

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
every second row basically and flip it

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
every second row basically and flip it
round<00:05:38.830> so<00:05:39.789> that<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.449> first<00:05:41.169> row<00:05:41.470> will<00:05:41.770> have

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
round so that the first row will have

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.659 
round so that the first row will have
the<00:05:42.699> white<00:05:42.880> always<00:05:43.419> to<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.720> right<00:05:44.520> of<00:05:45.520> each

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
the white always to the right of each

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.250 
the white always to the right of each
strip<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.449> second<00:05:46.780> row<00:05:46.870> will<00:05:47.020> have<00:05:47.169> the

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
strip and the second row will have the

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.800 
strip and the second row will have the
white<00:05:47.440> always<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.159> left<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:49.240> now<00:05:49.449> if<00:05:49.659> I

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
white always to the left so now if I

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.939 
white always to the left so now if I
just<00:05:50.050> move<00:05:50.260> that<00:05:50.530> along<00:05:50.650> there<00:05:52.590> you'll<00:05:53.590> see

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
just move that along there you'll see

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.950 
just move that along there you'll see
that<00:05:54.130> you've<00:05:54.370> got<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:55.090> first<00:05:55.330> row<00:05:55.539> doesn't

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
that you've got the first row doesn't

that you've got the first row doesn't
have<00:05:56.139> a<00:05:56.169> wide<00:05:56.380> square<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.949> second<00:05:57.340> one<00:05:57.520> does

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
have a wide square the second one does

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.089 
have a wide square the second one does
and<00:05:58.120> the<00:06:00.510> white<00:06:01.530> squares<00:06:02.530> as<00:06:02.710> you<00:06:02.830> go<00:06:02.979> across

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
and the white squares as you go across

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.490 
and the white squares as you go across
are<00:06:03.639> now<00:06:03.820> out<00:06:04.060> of<00:06:04.090> line<00:06:04.539> with<00:06:04.810> each<00:06:04.990> other<00:06:05.259> and

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
are now out of line with each other and

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.439 
are now out of line with each other and
that's<00:06:06.099> what<00:06:06.370> I<00:06:06.400> want<00:06:06.669> it<00:06:06.820> to<00:06:06.849> be<00:06:06.940> I<00:06:07.090> want<00:06:07.180> to

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
that's what I want it to be I want to

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.689 
that's what I want it to be I want to
give<00:06:07.599> it<00:06:07.720> that<00:06:08.370> random<00:06:09.370> sort<00:06:09.610> of

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
give it that random sort of

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:11.969 
give it that random sort of
higgledy-piggledy<00:06:10.270> log<00:06:10.659> and<00:06:10.870> so<00:06:11.650> now<00:06:11.860> I'm

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
higgledy-piggledy log and so now I'm

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.750 
higgledy-piggledy log and so now I'm
going<00:06:12.159> to<00:06:12.250> show<00:06:12.280> these<00:06:12.840> rows<00:06:13.840> all<00:06:14.139> together<00:06:14.760> in

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
going to show these rows all together in

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.420 
going to show these rows all together in
this<00:06:15.820> way<00:06:16.210> with<00:06:16.450> every<00:06:16.690> alternate<00:06:17.169> row

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
this way with every alternate row

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.410 
this way with every alternate row
starting<00:06:18.430> with<00:06:18.639> them<00:06:18.940> a

starting with the white square for the
border<00:06:25.610> I've<00:06:25.760> used<00:06:25.910> one<00:06:26.150> and<00:06:26.330> a<00:06:26.360> half<00:06:26.390> inch

strips of the white fabric which on the
two<00:06:29.510> sides<00:06:29.540> will<00:06:30.080> give<00:06:30.290> that<00:06:30.470> sort<00:06:30.740> of<00:06:30.830> dog

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
two sides will give that sort of dog

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.810 
two sides will give that sort of dog
turds<00:06:31.250> effect<00:06:31.840> you'll<00:06:32.840> need<00:06:33.110> two<00:06:33.890> lengths<00:06:34.610> of
