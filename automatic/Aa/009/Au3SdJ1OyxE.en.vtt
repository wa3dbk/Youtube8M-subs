00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.980 
what's going on my ninjas just a few
minutes<00:00:02.220> ago<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.760> was<00:00:02.879> sitting<00:00:02.939> down<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.419> was

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
minutes ago I was sitting down I was

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.960 
minutes ago I was sitting down I was
eating<00:00:04.230> my<00:00:04.319> pizza<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.160> was<00:00:05.310> rereading<00:00:05.640> the

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
eating my pizza and I was rereading the

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.820 
eating my pizza and I was rereading the
latest<00:00:06.270> chapter<00:00:06.480> mostly<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.140> was<00:00:07.290> looking<00:00:07.710> at

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
latest chapter mostly I was looking at

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.500 
latest chapter mostly I was looking at
the<00:00:08.010> silhouette<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.910> chakra<00:00:09.360> that

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the silhouette of the chakra that

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.560 
the silhouette of the chakra that
current<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.960> sensing<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:11.280> do<00:00:11.490> not<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.330> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
current is sensing and I do not have a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.180 
current is sensing and I do not have a
clue<00:00:12.900> who<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.500> usually<00:00:13.799> think<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.070> was

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
clue who that is I usually think it was

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.550 
clue who that is I usually think it was
covered<00:00:14.519> tow<00:00:14.670> but<00:00:15.179> heard<00:00:15.599> not<00:00:15.960> knowing<00:00:16.350> who

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
covered tow but heard not knowing who

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.580 
covered tow but heard not knowing who
capital<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.609> not<00:00:18.150> very<00:00:18.510> likely<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
capital is is not very likely because I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.769 
capital is is not very likely because I
mean<00:00:19.920> they<00:00:20.100> both<00:00:20.310> worked<00:00:20.970> really<00:00:21.330> close<00:00:21.630> with

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
mean they both worked really close with

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.960 
mean they both worked really close with
the<00:00:21.900> rich<00:00:22.020> my<00:00:22.260> room<00:00:22.470> although<00:00:23.039> her<00:00:23.279> lab<00:00:23.550> was

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
the rich my room although her lab was

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.910 
the rich my room although her lab was
way<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.660> fuck<00:00:24.840> out<00:00:24.960> there<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.350> many<00:00:25.500> maybe

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
way the fuck out there so many maybe

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
way the fuck out there so many maybe
they<00:00:26.160> never<00:00:26.340> met<00:00:26.699> what<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.449> makes<00:00:27.660> me

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
they never met what really makes me

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
they never met what really makes me
think<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.650> Kabuto<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.670> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
think that this is not Kabuto is that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
think that this is not Kabuto is that
when<00:00:30.449> she<00:00:30.630> sent<00:00:30.900> his<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.500> person's<00:00:31.920> chakra

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
when she sent his this person's chakra

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.100 
when she sent his this person's chakra
she<00:00:32.550> said<00:00:32.759> she<00:00:32.969> has<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> bad<00:00:33.450> feeling<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:33.930> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
she said she has a bad feeling about it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.870 
she said she has a bad feeling about it
so<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.829> doesn't<00:00:35.070> necessarily<00:00:35.250> mean<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
so this doesn't necessarily mean that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.850 
so this doesn't necessarily mean that
he's<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> bad<00:00:36.420> guy<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.989> there's<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:37.590> me<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
he's a bad guy but there's not me that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
he's a bad guy but there's not me that
he's<00:00:38.010> good<00:00:38.280> either<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.969> coloring<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> known

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
he's good either and coloring is known

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.350 
he's good either and coloring is known
for<00:00:40.200> detecting<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.280> kind<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.820> someone's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
for detecting what kind of or someone's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.270 
for detecting what kind of or someone's
chakra<00:00:42.780> gives<00:00:43.020> off<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> cocky

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
chakra gives off like in the cocky

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.479 
chakra gives off like in the cocky
summit<00:00:44.640> she<00:00:44.820> could<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.300> tell<00:00:45.629> when<00:00:46.489> Sasuke

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
summit she could really tell when Sasuke

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.450 
summit she could really tell when Sasuke
went<00:00:47.850> dark<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:49.350> she<00:00:49.559> says<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.250> she<00:00:50.430> has

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
went dark so when she says that she has

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
went dark so when she says that she has
a<00:00:50.550> bad<00:00:50.820> feeling<00:00:51.210> about<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.750> by<00:00:51.870> sitting

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
a bad feeling about it just by sitting

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
a bad feeling about it just by sitting
so<00:00:52.379> much<00:00:52.530> chakra<00:00:52.829> I'm<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:53.730> sure<00:00:54.000> that

they're nothing to be fucked away and I
don't<00:00:56.129> believe<00:00:56.399> competent<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
don't believe competent would have that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.080 
don't believe competent would have that
diabolical<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.800> any<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.370> because<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.910> get

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
this diabolical over from someone's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.109 
this diabolical over from someone's
chakra<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.500> probably<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.340> covered<00:01:11.670> since

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
chakra it's probably not covered since

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.630 
chakra it's probably not covered since
she<00:01:12.510> senses<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.320> diabolical<00:01:14.280> aura<00:01:14.430> from

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
this precious chakra like I said I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
this precious chakra like I said I
highly<00:01:16.890> doubt<00:01:17.040> his<00:01:17.220> cover<00:01:17.460> toe<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:17.820> he

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
highly doubt his cover toe because he

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
highly doubt his cover toe because he
would<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.270> basically<00:01:18.689> had<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.470> become<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
would have basically had to become a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
would have basically had to become a
good<00:01:20.070> guy<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> escape<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:21.390> thinking<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.960> if

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
good guy to escape I'm thinking that if

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.890 
good guy to escape I'm thinking that if
someone<00:01:22.380> entirely<00:01:23.420> different<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.509> someone

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
someone entirely different like someone

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
someone entirely different like someone
who<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.590> seen<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.189> war<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.790> all

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
who we have not seen in this war at all

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.030 
who we have not seen in this war at all
yet<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.900> again<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.380> person<00:01:28.770> may<00:01:28.860> not

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
yet but then again this person may not

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.950 
yet but then again this person may not
be<00:01:29.159> evil<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.060> may<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.689> said

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
be evil at all you may have just said

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.929 
be evil at all you may have just said
that<00:01:31.530> she<00:01:31.860> got<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> bad<00:01:32.340> feeling<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that she got a bad feeling from it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.030 
that she got a bad feeling from it
because<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.390> chakra<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.290> overwhelming

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
because a chakra was so overwhelming

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.530 
because a chakra was so overwhelming
that<00:01:35.189> she<00:01:35.520> could<00:01:35.670> tell<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.030> person<00:01:36.240> was

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
so why not go a step further just in

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.819

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
tails in my opinion it would make sense

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.559

within the next few chapters will get

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.970 
within the next few chapters will get
confirmation<00:03:35.870> whether<00:03:36.139> my<00:03:36.590> theory<00:03:36.950> is

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
confirmation whether my theory is

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.220 
confirmation whether my theory is
awesome<00:03:37.940> or<00:03:38.120> if<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:38.870> just<00:03:38.989> straight-up

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
awesome or if it's just straight-up

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.080 
awesome or if it's just straight-up
bullshit<00:03:39.650> personally<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.370> think<00:03:40.549> it<00:03:40.850> would<00:03:40.970> be

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
bullshit personally I think it would be

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.479 
bullshit personally I think it would be
a<00:03:41.120> great<00:03:41.540> way<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.930> introduce<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.590> sage<00:03:42.980> or

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
a great way to introduce the sage or

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.670 
a great way to introduce the sage or
maybe<00:03:43.700> even<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.120> sages<00:03:44.480> sons<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:45.019> us<00:03:45.200> since

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
maybe even the sages sons to us since

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.259 
maybe even the sages sons to us since
we've<00:03:45.859> never<00:03:46.069> really<00:03:46.310> seen<00:03:46.400> them<00:03:46.639> in<00:03:47.030> action

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
we've never really seen them in action

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.569 
we've never really seen them in action
so<00:03:47.569> yes<00:03:47.810> this<00:03:48.079> is<00:03:48.260> my<00:03:48.410> theory<00:03:48.680> hagoromo

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
so yes this is my theory hagoromo

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.090 
so yes this is my theory hagoromo
otsutsuki<00:03:49.690> himself<00:03:50.690> put<00:03:51.200> his<00:03:51.350> chakra<00:03:51.650> into

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
otsutsuki himself put his chakra into

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.699 
otsutsuki himself put his chakra into
the<00:03:52.880> ten<00:03:53.180> tails<00:03:53.389> or<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.989> god<00:03:54.170> tree<00:03:54.440> so

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
the ten tails or the god tree so

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.039 
the ten tails or the god tree so
whenever<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.519> ten<00:03:55.730> tails<00:03:55.910> or<00:03:56.239> God<00:03:56.569> tree<00:03:56.870> are

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
whenever the ten tails or God tree are

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.110 
whenever the ten tails or God tree are
revived<00:03:57.709> or<00:03:58.099> when<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.459> fruit<00:03:58.639> blooms<00:03:58.910> or

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
revived or when the fruit blooms or

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.420 
revived or when the fruit blooms or
whatever<00:03:59.389> he<00:03:59.900> would<00:04:00.139> reappear<00:04:00.709> or<00:04:01.040> maybe<00:04:01.220> his

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
whatever he would reappear or maybe his

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.030 
whatever he would reappear or maybe his
sons<00:04:01.670> will<00:04:01.849> reappear<00:04:02.329> to<00:04:02.840> stop<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.470> threat<00:04:03.799> or
