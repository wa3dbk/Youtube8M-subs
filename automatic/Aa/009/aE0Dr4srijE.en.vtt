00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello yours with egg radar and I do not know 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.010
 one more copyright tip for you as 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.360
 is that you write in a personal way 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.259
 silval 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.519
 The tip I'm going to give you today is about 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.550
 I have already mentioned a number of other 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.320
 metal triggers here or mental shortcuts 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
 explain first that it is the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.060
 attention to the mental wave hits 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.789
 When will you make a decision? 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.849
 you have to analyze the object of your decision 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.340
 So tell me, will you open the door or not? 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.030
 I have to leave, have to go to the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 other side 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.390
 so I have to open the door for 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.120
 Passing through the door you make a decision 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.530
 for an objective you want 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.920
 now imagine you have to think 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.270
 then both examples will think there was 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.789
 dust but do not think you have to think 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.940
 in every decision that you will take to get them 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.160
 I gave a good handle to the brush and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.260
 up and down or back to front 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.120
 and when did you drive? 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.010
 or do not have many things that you do not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 think but I'm already among the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.030
 results when being your car to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.430
 driving you simply reminder passes 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 first by the bride although it does not have to 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.260
 think more 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.240
 In other words, your brain is already 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.040
 to make a decision 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.860
 through a set of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 situations ie into the car call 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.540
 The car passes Senator first hug 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.210
 although there is a set of 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.700
 a set of situations that context you 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.860
 Speak in this situation, you 're going to do it. 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.290
 here and you stop making decisions 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.750
 fast at the door is more a decision you 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 You do not have to think I'm going to make a decision. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.200
 day 30 at the door 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.390
 I will open the door labored launch 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.369
 because there in the shelter until when after 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.079
 very little balance not you 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.790
 simply the door and passes and closes the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.110
 door but you that when you close 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.060
 doors you 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.700
 The big question is there are many things 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.890
 in the brain that takes shortcuts because it 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.909
 Can not decide I'm all this is a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.219
 metal shortcut 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.320
 only there are much more subtle shortcuts 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.860
 than I'll just open the door or 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.590
 not 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.290
 for example when you see the opinion of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.930
 thousand 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.750
 millions positive about the product you 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.729
 takes that product as being good and comes 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.920
 there is social proof because your brain 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.580
 even next there are 100 thousand people 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.780
 talk about that product is good then the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.880
 product is good 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.980
 I mean you do not know do not know the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.280
 products deeply analyzed product 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.710
 but you took a shortcut your brain 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.050
 take a shortcut if an authority and 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.300
 beat dina told an authority to speak 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.100
 product well then the product is good that 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.630
 you trust the maturity us you 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.130
 trust what he says he speaks 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.140
 Everything is good, and you? 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.870
 yet knowing well then that is a 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.360
 mental shortcut so that the shortcut and Neuton 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.380
 today we are going to talk about 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.480
 reductionism that means when 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.180
 you have a very large amount of 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.340
 variables you say you are a 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.010
 producer you want to make the copy of a 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.470
 certain product only exist 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.450
 many variables speak for example the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.160
 you be promoted a company 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.590
 let's say your total product 15 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.560
 here's your product is a product 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.700
 you will help the person to be 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.640
 promoted 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.090
 will help the person lead better 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.340
 It's okay, and it's just me that there are a lot of 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.310
 variables for this very much if you give me 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.260
 the best with the tone of voice tells the clothes 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.870
 Why are you going to check your resume? 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.810
 A lot counts then it would be very 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.030
 Difficult you've been having product doing 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.400
 an irresistible promise as you 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.320
 You have to fight like hundreds of 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.989
 variables for the face to be promoted 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.360
 so what do you do you use technique 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.510
 reductionism you speak the following looks 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.670
 there are many variables that you 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.060
 have to really count for you to win 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:51.420
 a promotion but there are two of them that 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.519
 account for 80% at the end of their 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.459
 employability in how much you can 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.530
 be promoted 80 with scenes of this 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.019
 all and all variables only by the two 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.480
 all the strongest selections ever reduced 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.630
 all that if you have some time to 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.960
 that is if you have 80% of these variables 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.790
 dominated 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.310
 if you always listen, it's very big everything 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.400
 well there is a product called influence 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.460
 external product is released and people 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.710
 already played in the cup and and with that put there 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.690
 influenced it sells that it is a product that 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:28.910
 shows how you influence paris 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.250
 led leaders to let you gauge 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.630
 the company all positions of influence 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.270
 that you influence people to your 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.780
 around it and it uses the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.220
 reductionism how good you have many 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.250
 variables a company with you in 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.600
 promoted but there are two that are 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.570
 the main 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.260
 your competence in fact if you are good 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.800
 or not and its power of influence 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.980
 then this is 80 maybe 90% of the variables 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.530
 that you are promoted and after that 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.830
 You reduced today, so if you really 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.350
 if you focus on competence influence 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.450
 you exist a very great chance you 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.150
 to be promoted then we reduced 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.550
 many variables actors and now you go 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.400
 fight with these two then first 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.070
 skill thing you learned during 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.890
 five years in college once four 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.260
 perhaps six and more than the period the 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.640
 trainee but of the grid training and go but 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.570
 the first two years of the company 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.630
 13 - years then if we have 10 12 15 years 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.330
 learning how to do now and the other 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.430
 variable the other 50% of these two 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.680
 variables the influence you did not study 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.500
 influence you do not know how it works 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.480
 then this product is to supply that 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.230
 The gap that you have you do not know 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.270
 that guy who talks about ours and me 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.040
 I know so-and-so or so-so is so good but 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.350
 did not start his career 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.910
 or that guy knows much less 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.280
 that's how I can be 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.590
 promoted and I do not the difference is in 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.420
 influence on competence then the 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.280
 product in your sphere by talking more about 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.330
 So the big question is when 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.389
 you rite 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.460
 lots of people to cut down on my 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.919
 copy of the samurai cope to sell the 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.110
 mobile phone and I also renounce used 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:19.430
 the technical reductionism to speak 70% of 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.400
 farm in the center hotel and if that the 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.020
 digital business or is not the copy 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.210
 that is if you learn how to copy 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.060
 you will succeed success torch 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.219
 increases greatly you use appliance reduces 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.020
 two three four maximum variables 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.819
 fight with those variables and 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.560
 convinces the person you solve 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.569
 those problems are all problems 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.840
 but those who are the main ones 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:44.240
 solve 70 80% of everything you need 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.080
 to achieve a goal then with this 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:51.409
 When you reduce you gain power 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.159
 people count other elements and this is the 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:53.870
 main 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:56.270
 so what are you going to do now? 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.940
 in your copy you will think which are 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.819
 all the problems that mine 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.620
 consumer will face to achieve 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.719
 his promise and resisted that I am 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.960
 making to go to these 20 problems 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:11.360
 what are the main are these three 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.430
 represents 80 in the center of the effects of 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.389
 problem I'm going to fight against these three 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.419
 variables 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.360
 I'm going to reduce my fight instead of 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.770
 to fight with a video fight with 13 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.080
 reductionism and with that you fight a lot 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.020
 well just with those three 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.659
 this is the technique of reductionism is the 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.940
 shortcut because the person forgets the others 

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:33.979
 variables and criticized that it concentrates only 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.839
 In those and those you can fight. 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:38.690
 because there are few 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:41.240
 It is logical that the art of reducing means 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.430
 variables you will choose from ringtones is a 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.990
 Very important tip I use more 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.610
 courses on my back a glass of 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.589
 clients my partners mine too 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.610
 When I'm going to write confidant and give 

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:52.610
 very sure 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.940
 A big hug and until our next 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.940
 tip
