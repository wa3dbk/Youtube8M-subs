00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100 
backfield there was times we only had
three<00:01:41.670> cornerbacks<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.329> three<00:01:42.509> safeties<00:01:42.930> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
three cornerbacks and three safeties so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
three cornerbacks and three safeties so
you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> injuries<00:01:44.340> got<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.729> us

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you know some of the injuries got to us

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.660 
you know some of the injuries got to us
a<00:01:44.970> little<00:01:45.090> bit<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.540> again<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
a little bit but again I think that you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
a little bit but again I think that you
know<00:01:47.759> our<00:01:47.790> scrimmages<00:01:48.420> were<00:01:48.630> very<00:01:48.869> very

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
know our scrimmages were very very

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
know our scrimmages were very very
productive<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.950> averaged<00:01:50.280> about<00:01:50.430> 94

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
productive I think we averaged about 94

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
productive I think we averaged about 94
plays<00:01:51.240> each<00:01:51.479> scrimmage<00:01:52.130> sometimes<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> don't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
plays each scrimmage sometimes you don't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.460 
plays each scrimmage sometimes you don't
want<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> go<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.790> many<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.470> discriminant

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
want to go that many but discriminant

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
want to go that many but discriminant
imes<00:01:55.649> dictates<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.939> different

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
imes dictates that in different

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.630 
imes dictates that in different
situations<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.280> ended<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.610> a
