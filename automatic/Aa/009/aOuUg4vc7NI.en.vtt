confident<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:46.860> very<00:01:47.490> aware<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
confident but I was just very aware of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.219 
confident but I was just very aware of
the<00:01:48.000> fact<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.299> they<00:01:48.509> might<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> 90<00:01:49.079> minute

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the fact that they might get a 90 minute

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
the fact that they might get a 90 minute
goal<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.100> luckily<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> 63rd<00:01:51.149> minute<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
goal and luckily in the 63rd minute I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.810 
goal and luckily in the 63rd minute I
scored<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.350> corner<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.220> head<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.670> with

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
scored a corner with a head out with

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.010 
scored a corner with a head out with
Porter<00:01:54.119> from<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.360> corner<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.780> that's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
Porter from a corner I think that's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
Porter from a corner I think that's
probably<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> first<00:01:56.040> corners<00:01:56.490> I've

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
you can see here we moved up until

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.740 
you can see here we moved up until
you've<00:02:56.730> managed<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.000> move<00:02:57.090> into<00:02:57.269> thirteen

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
you've managed to move into thirteen

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.410 
you've managed to move into thirteen
just<00:02:58.080> outside<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> top<00:02:58.769> twelve<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
just outside of the top twelve and I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.509 
just outside of the top twelve and I
never<00:03:00.420> go<00:03:00.540> into<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.810> game<00:03:01.200> against<00:03:01.709> Leeds<00:03:02.190> who

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
never go into a game against Leeds who

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.400 
never go into a game against Leeds who
are<00:03:02.670> one<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.850> Mills<00:03:03.030> biggest<00:03:03.510> rivals<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.380> I

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
are one of Mills biggest rivals so I

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.140 
are one of Mills biggest rivals so I
definitely<00:03:04.739> want<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.100> make<00:03:05.220> sure<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> won

this game and also want to make sure
that<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:07.980> leave<00:03:08.250> oh<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.550> got<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> point<00:03:08.970> or

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
that I just leave oh just got a point or

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.360 
that I just leave oh just got a point or
a<00:03:09.540> victory<00:03:09.959> cuz<00:03:10.500> who<00:03:10.590> threw<00:03:10.890> away<00:03:10.950> those<00:03:11.190> three

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
a victory cuz who threw away those three

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.710 
a victory cuz who threw away those three
points<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.790> game<00:03:11.850> was<00:03:12.120> free<00:03:12.239> one<00:03:12.390> up<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
points in that game was free one up and

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.690 
points in that game was free one up and
threw<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.900> away<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.980> way<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> make<00:03:14.310> sure<00:03:14.519> we

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
threw it away and I way to make sure we

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.800 
threw it away and I way to make sure we
actually<00:03:14.790> got<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.060> win<00:03:15.209> on<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.360> board<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.660> maybe

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
actually got a win on the board so maybe

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.050 
actually got a win on the board so maybe
we<00:03:15.870> could<00:03:16.019> make<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> push<00:03:16.560> into<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.220> top<00:03:17.489> twelve

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
we could make a push into the top twelve

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.720 
we could make a push into the top twelve
and<00:03:18.329> as<00:03:19.049> always<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.650> got<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.070> good<00:03:20.100> start<00:03:20.459> I

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and as always I got to a good start I

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.819 
and as always I got to a good start I
was<00:03:20.970> creating<00:03:21.180> lot<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.329> chances<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.500> leaves

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
was creating lot of chances and leaves

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:23.960 
was creating lot of chances and leaves
managed<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.370> nice<00:03:23.549> chance<00:03:23.820> they

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
managed to have a nice chance they

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.130 
managed to have a nice chance they
probably<00:03:24.150> could<00:03:24.329> have<00:03:24.390> school<00:03:24.690> done<00:03:24.989> better

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
probably could have school done better

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.330 
probably could have school done better
with<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.410> chance<00:03:25.650> they<00:03:25.799> had<00:03:25.950> there<00:03:26.160> and

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
with that chance they had there and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.120 
with that chance they had there and
again<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.329> think<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.810> make<00:03:27.989> another<00:03:28.170> chance<00:03:28.470> here

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
again I think I make another chance here

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.970 
again I think I make another chance here
yep<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.239> bit<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.750> hit<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.049> post<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.560> bit

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
yep this a bit but I hit the post a bit

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.350 
yep this a bit but I hit the post a bit
a<00:03:32.040> long<00:03:32.190> range<00:03:32.430> effort<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.910> that's<00:03:33.060> one<00:03:33.180> thing

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
a long range effort and that's one thing

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.729 
a long range effort and that's one thing
that<00:03:33.540> no<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.019> lot<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.380> said<00:03:34.560> that

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
that no it's a lot of you just said that

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.949 
that no it's a lot of you just said that
I<00:03:34.769> shoot<00:03:35.190> from<00:03:35.489> too<00:03:35.730> far<00:03:36.030> out<00:03:36.269> quite<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> lot

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
I shoot from too far out quite a lot

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.080 
I shoot from too far out quite a lot
which<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.140> probably<00:03:37.530> true<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.190> guess<00:03:38.970> it's

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
which is probably true I guess it's

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.520 
which is probably true I guess it's
fully<00:03:39.239> down<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> fact<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:39.930> like<00:03:40.260> online

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
fully down to the fact that like online

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.680 
fully down to the fact that like online
when<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.310> play<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.670> like<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:42.000> bet<00:03:42.180> T<00:03:42.360> in<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> meal

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
when I play is like a bet T in the meal

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.900 
when I play is like a bet T in the meal
wall<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.140> do<00:03:43.530> tend<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.769> go<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.040> sometimes<00:03:44.310> and

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
could go push on and push on I did split

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.159 
could go push on and push on I did split
exactly<00:05:32.940> born<00:05:33.090> edge<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.330> area<00:05:33.570> has<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.720> shot

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.640 
but that is kind of blocked and pulls
into<00:05:36.360> woloson's<00:05:36.720> path<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.169> Mollison<00:05:37.470> has<00:05:37.620> a
