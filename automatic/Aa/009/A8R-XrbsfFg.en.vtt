00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.830
 hi all already have all these fps 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.919
 young people today we find ourselves for 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.980
 a video of particular because I you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.570
 announces a big change on my 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.270
 chain at the design level 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 then for the design of laudot bread 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.609
 I'm talking about each other's intro so this 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.789
 which is at the end of the video is 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.330
 also penguins on my channel 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.149
 so to start from the logo of my 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 new end of my channel me see you 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.430
 currently on the screen is also 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.960
 of course if you if you clicked on 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 this video you see my emblem a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.110
 world where logo right next to the video 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.039
 so for that I think with that one 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.660
 as you can see her breasts 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.809
 a rather special design all that we 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.340
 wanted a design around the design 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.510
 we often have designers have in 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.579
 made for locals here I wanted 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.340
 really something a little more 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.960
 original and you can see in the middle 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.820
 a the colors of my new logo in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.420
 it's just the flag 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.909
 Belgium have a small cure that one of the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 like that anyway I hope you 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.520
 go love him so tell me in the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 comments how you find 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.920
 knowing that I specify that all the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.200
 design be it the background the logo 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 and the intro the other I did everything I did 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.020
 realize everything myself of course I have 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.240
 am tutorials or two things like 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.939
 but that it was personally is 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 me who do what I mean 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.009
 so now I 'm going to move to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.759
 bhagwan you can see it now 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.329
 on my channel so the gold pack has changed 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.149
 yes if I do you the record is now 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.340
 we will place in the main one almost 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.159
 that you will see this at each beginning and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.810
 at each end of my videos and ben I 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.850
 of course talks about the intro and the other 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.969
 I will pass you the intro all of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.969
 after 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.379
 days 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.859
 here I hope you like the intro 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.170
 in any case I find it I find 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.799
 frankly not bad even if my old 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.230
 trotting I find really well suddenly 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.849
 it's not easy to make an intro 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.750
 was as good as the one I had 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.420
 before because personally 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.819
 I would love it's a troll so that's it 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.170
 and I will now pass you my 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.170
 new other ear 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.880
 so here I hope you have 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.470
 also the dishes so tell me in 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.260
 comments as you are 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.850
 or even if you have for example 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.010
 small improvements to make why 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.140
 not like I did it myself 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.930
 can do all the changes that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.870
 I want of course and here at the level 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.330
 also music that she will 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.970
 surely gay at least one who asks me 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.920
 every time a year with my old 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.810
 among other things what is the title of the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.440
 music 20 the titles I you the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.230
 put in the description is what 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.080
 I applied on -2 of the title 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.430
 exactly short that's not too bad but 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.980
 I will put all this in the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.750
 description so you can listen to it 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.610
