the<00:02:44.180> reason<00:02:44.480> for<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.629> is<00:02:44.989> because<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.530> its

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
the reason for that is because of its

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.789 
the reason for that is because of its
its<00:02:46.190> reputation<00:02:46.879> for<00:02:47.180> being<00:02:47.329> great<00:02:47.629> value<00:02:48.349> one

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
its reputation for being great value one

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.190 
its reputation for being great value one
and<00:02:49.099> two<00:02:49.700> because<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.120> its<00:02:50.239> longevity<00:02:50.480> and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
and two because of its longevity and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.190 
and two because of its longevity and
also<00:02:51.950> because<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:53.060> terms<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.660> its<00:02:53.780> twice

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
also because it in terms of its twice

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.800 
also because it in terms of its twice
evolution<00:02:54.859> it<00:02:55.310> might<00:02:55.519> not<00:02:55.760> necessarily<00:02:55.790> be<00:02:56.629> a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
evolution it might not necessarily be a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.240 
evolution it might not necessarily be a
great<00:02:57.109> investment<00:02:57.470> wine<00:02:57.829> it's<00:02:58.099> very

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
great investment wine it's very

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.589 
great investment wine it's very
dangerous<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.730> talk<00:02:58.970> about<00:02:59.120> Wireless

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
dangerous to talk about Wireless

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.539 
dangerous to talk about Wireless
investments<00:03:00.140> but<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.739> always<00:03:00.890> seems<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.400> hold

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
investments but it always seems to hold

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.610 
investments but it always seems to hold
its<00:03:01.819> value<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.510> yes<00:03:02.780> when<00:03:03.079> people<00:03:03.319> are<00:03:03.379> buying

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
its value so yes when people are buying

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.380 
its value so yes when people are buying
it<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.129> they<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.489> they're<00:03:04.670> buying<00:03:04.849> quantity

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
it and they and they're buying quantity

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.819 
it and they and they're buying quantity
of<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.599> they<00:03:05.720> know<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.079> it<00:03:06.200> not<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:06.709> not

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
of it they know that it not it's not

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.740 
of it they know that it not it's not
gonna<00:03:07.069> lose<00:03:07.250> value<00:03:07.640> yes<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.269> think<00:03:08.510> that's

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
gonna lose value yes and I think that's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.259 
gonna lose value yes and I think that's
what<00:03:09.049> makes<00:03:09.319> this<00:03:09.560> one<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.129> unique<00:03:10.269> amongst
