00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the hamsters are one of the most 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.029
 popular with the little ones and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.919
 although maybe you have not had one in 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.840
 house when child is very likely 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.280
 Some friend of yours if he did or that in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.130
 your school had the odd 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.660
 hamster like the lounge mascot like this 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.369
 that you will not be surprised to know that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.380
 hamsters present a strange 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.410
 cannibalistic behavior with their new 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.720
 born but you ever wondered 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.000
 why do they do this this is a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.980
 frequent question so today I invite you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.890
 to know why hamsters eat 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.110
 to their young, animal cannibalism 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 infanticide because the hamsters are 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.219
 they eat their young the cannibalism inside 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 of the animal kingdom is not something new either 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.960
 for us that from the ethology we 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.149
 we have dedicated to see several examples of 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.940
 how on certain occasions 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.760
 animals eat each other 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 just some examples we have since 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 insects like the praying mantises or 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.930
 arachnids like the black widows that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.670
 after copulating they devour their partners 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.620
 reptiles like crocodiles or mammals 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.379
 all kinds that for various reasons 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.570
 they eat their young until the pets so 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 close as dogs and cats 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.030
 domestic workers who also eat their 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.649
 children under certain circumstances 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.570
 several other cases of 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.610
 cannibalism even within our 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.860
 own clear species that I do not mean 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.200
 to the zombie cannibal of miami but what 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 long history have existed 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.500
 different villages whose members were 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.569
 cannibals and they fed on others 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.659
 humans for both food purposes 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.340
 as cultural and religious so 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.159
 despite the fact that in a first instance 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.170
 we can all be noticed by the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.149
 animal cannibalism is something much more 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.399
 common and natural of what you believe and also 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.250
 of occurring between the hamsters occurs 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.520
 among many other species, let's 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.409
 know some of the possible reasons 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 why hamsters and other animals 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.849
 they eat their children because the hamsters are 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.230
 They eat their young beyond the unusual 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.390
 we may look like 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.430
 of cannibalism when it happens between 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.530
 parents and children may still be 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.810
 more striking if we consider the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.700
 effort the energy and work that you 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.650
 It takes any species to extend its 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.990
 bequeathed by this is that the scientists 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.100
 have investigated the causes of this 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.650
 behavior in the different 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.550
 species that manifest it and apparently 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.780
 all have very similar reasons 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.330
 focusing on the hamsters 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.730
 There are different possible reasons why 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.010
 those who eat their children first 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.530
 place it is pointed out that being the pups so 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.450
 weak and small are devoured by their 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.150
 parents in a kind of instinct that 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.430
 makes them consider as incapable the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.740
 parents would assume that being so weak 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.450
 they will not be able to survive in the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.150
 future in the face of the dangers that 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.040
 they surround themselves so their parents make sure that 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 only the strongest will be those who go to 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.140
 perpetuate the species on the other hand it 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.480
 esteem that before the birth of broad 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.130
 litters with a large number of offspring the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.260
 mother feels overwhelmed by the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.240
 situation by the way they should 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.000
 continue with them and keep them 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.890
 except eating one two or three 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.630
 litter of the mother 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.840
 he ensures he can take care of the rest 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.040
 more effectively because hamsters 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.370
 they eat their young 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.170
 3 kingston this little bit another theory supposes 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.790
 that after giving birth the mother 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.590
 feels weak and needs big 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.600
 amounts of nutrients to be able 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.400
 survive properly and thus be able to 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.190
 continue with life to take care of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.980
 pups for it the hamster can be 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.700
 feed some of their young 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.000
 sacrificing the in the name of his 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.370
 brothers finally it has been noticed that in 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.959
 sometimes if the baby is born far away 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.420
 of the nesting place where they have 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.910
 born the other offspring the mother can not 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.769
 recognize it as their own when not 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.050
 recognize it well you can consider it 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.670
 as a good source of food that will 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.860
 allow yourself to stay stronger and 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.800
 healthy for when you need to feed the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.930
 rest of the offspring how does the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.230
 infanticide in nature is something 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.150
 really interesting do not you think some 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.060
 have you ever seen a hamster or other animal 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.200
 eat their young because other things 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.200
 do you think it could happen
