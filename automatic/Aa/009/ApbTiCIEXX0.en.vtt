00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.790
 Hello everyone, Alex and today we are 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.070
 consider how to fix 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:18.570
 let's start by creating a model 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.400
 primitive box somewhere like this and set 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.210
 number of segment more after that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.730
 we convert it to the dian idea field 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.910
 as here a little bit strange geometry 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.540
 no difference 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.720
 and do it with difficulty draining the sheets 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.720
 some facets 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.720
 the reason 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.609
 in this way we have such 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:57.820
 the model is a little incomprehensible but at the same time 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.699
 if she zameksturirovat it will be so 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 say artifact choose any material 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:09.640
 and set the diffuse color 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.310
 it is packed to you after this on this bit to you we 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.930
 we will impose 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.930
 Here are these Turku for example, take 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.229
 and after that we will impose our model 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.690
 show it to the viewport and at the same time how we 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.380
 see here such nonsense happened to 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.330
 artifacts are not displayed correctly when 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.990
 this let's set tayvin that is 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.380
 texture multiplication 1 8 is big 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.000
 amount of texture we see it at all 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.050
 house occurred nothing is clear what 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.470
 going on here we go 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.110
 modify 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.300
 and here we are already choosing it in the watermelon w 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.030
 then click on the plus sign here 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.369
 we press polyvore after that to us 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.930
 you must select those polygons that 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:08.100
 must be edited on textures 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.050
 we outline we clamp the contour we surround with the other 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.760
 sides and the same with this he then we 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.680
 at least all displayed 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.430
 wrong bottom line we don't touch 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.940
 how much on 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 They do not require further editing 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.760
 click open you why editor and we 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.980
 there is such a window in this 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.870
 The window we have displayed is completely ours. 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.770
 model that is all of our polygons 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.420
 handed down here to scan each 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.510
 by its it was displayed separate 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.489
 right click open 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.780
 fifty dollars and there are already set parameters 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.700
 press ok 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.420
 so this is all the geometry 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.209
 we were distributed on such a format 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.200
 taking out every object let's move it 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.190
 somehow he moves on the model 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.959
 let's say you clicked this polygon 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.730
 after that let's see how he 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.830
 It looks like this and if we are right here 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.400
 move it then it will move with us 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.500
 leakage model is possible and we see more 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.560
 attach additional bottom 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.580
 polygons we move and they, too, for him 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.239
 move so that this does not happen 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.340
 can make furniture half a night pink ok 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.640
 and after that he stood out became you 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.950
 their separate large polygon 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.350
 can be reduced as we see in the picture 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.650
 here, too, is changing and moving that 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.720
 instead of the image that we need all 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.410
 This surface is obtained. 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.850
 this square that's our texture 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.519
 so that we correctly fill in 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.989
 see this object but do not know put 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.090
 where is it in texture 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.079
 it can be done ace view.ru species 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.019
 template 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.390
 and render template after that 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.570
 such a picture is filled with this texture 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.430
 you can save where we need and already in 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.610
 do it on Photoshop for everyone 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.410
 field so that it appears here so 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.389
 way we got here such at 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.350
 country of geometry while she is with us 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.600
 right 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.120
 to texture 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.540
 thank you all for watching good luck creating 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.540
 models
