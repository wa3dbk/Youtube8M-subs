00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.960
 the divine poem 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.220
 our father who art in heaven on earth in the 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.430
 fire in water and air 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.700
 Our father that you are in the flowers in the corner 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.130
 of birds in the heart to pulsate 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.670
 you compassion in the quality and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.250
 patience and gestures of pardon to the father 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.150
 ours that is in me that is in that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.520
 that I love 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.180
 in him who strikes me in him who seeks 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.760
 true father of ours who is in the one who 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.380
 walk with me and the one who has already left 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.520
 leaving my soul hurt by longing 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.280
 Blessed is your name 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.720
 for all that is fair and just good 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.790
 gracious for all the harmony of creation 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.520
 be hallowed for my life 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.240
 for so many opportunities for that 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.460
 that I have belt and belt and for leading me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.830
 the perfection 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.000
 come to us your kingdom of peace and justice 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.130
 faith and charity light and love there in what I am 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 called to build through the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.150
 meekness of spirit reflex of greatness 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 Your inner will is done 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.590
 that my objective presses on more of my 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.049
 proud of what my real 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.030
 needs 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.100
 although I often do not understand 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.880
 more than silence in response to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.110
 my prayers not listening to you to say 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.200
 son is waiting for you is all eternity 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.240
 Give us this day our daily bread. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.020
 I can share with my brother 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.030
 the material conditions that now has to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.740
 nothing is good if I do not remember who 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.100
 lives in the flow of body and soul bread 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.220
 that true life in the next bread 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.180
 bringing joy and joy is the gospel of 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.870
 jesus forgive my my offenses 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.250
 mistakes 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.070
 my faults 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.710
 Forgive me when my heart becomes cold 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.980
 when they allow evil to be exterior 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.580
 and in the form of aggression 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.849
 more than talk the know hear that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.489
 instead of judging I seek to accept that 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.819
 do not cultivate violence I will be peace 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.030
 that saying no to too many requirements 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.060
 can we all thank 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.459
 forgive me as I forgive those 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.950
 to offend me even when my 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.370
 heart is hurt by the bitterness and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.650
 of tastes of ingratitude can I 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.379
 lord of life, remember that no one 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.860
 eternal sorrow and that the only way 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:01.400
 that makes me sublime is the humble road 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.609
 do not let me fall into the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.290
 temptations of errors and selfishness that 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.099
 make me slaves of me is a 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.609
 violence before your light is on 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.010
 me 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.829
 illuminating me so that I find you 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.760
 inside my soul as part of it. 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.280
 my essence and deliver me the evil of 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.329
 all the violence of all the misfortune of 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.709
 all disease free meditate of pain 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:33.109
 of all the heartache and all the disillusionment 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.480
 but still when it brings difficulty 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.049
 and if they make it necessary for me to have 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.730
 strength and courage to say thank you father 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.730
 for more of this mission 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.410
 everything around us and debt poetry there is a 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.150
 trace of God in every sector of creation 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.000
 because we have for it in the blossoming of 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.720
 flowers running down the waters in the corner of 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.680
 wind in the singular of the stars but above 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.320
 we seek for it in our interior 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.160
 it suffices that for a moment we close the 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:18.500
 eyes and feel them there he is giving 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.500
 rhyme the verses of our lives
