00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.600 
playing it's going to be easier to get
into<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.650> game<00:00:39.800> but<00:00:39.860> it's<00:00:40.190> also<00:00:40.339> gonna<00:00:40.489> be

old<00:01:36.000> community<00:01:36.600> who<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.050> playing<00:01:37.410> troubles

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
old community who are playing troubles

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.400 
old community who are playing troubles
still<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> keep<00:01:39.450> their<00:01:39.750> old<00:01:39.960> troubles

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
still there and keep their old troubles

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.219 
still there and keep their old troubles
I<00:01:40.620> think<00:01:41.550> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.120> if<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.330> typical<00:01:42.780> tribal

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
I think I think if the typical tribal

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.440 
I think I think if the typical tribal
wars<00:01:43.410> of<00:01:43.740> player<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.220> definitely<00:01:44.790> passionate

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
wars of player is definitely passionate

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
wars of player is definitely passionate
and<00:01:45.900> I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.740> thing<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:46.979> drives

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and I think that's the thing that drives

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
and I think that's the thing that drives
this<00:01:47.700> whole<00:01:47.910> project<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:49.080> think<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.470> players

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this whole project I think the players

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
this whole project I think the players
in<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> community<00:01:50.540> they're<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.630> the
