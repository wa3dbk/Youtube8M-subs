gathered<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.220> detail<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.299> therefore<00:01:18.630> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
gathered and more detail so therefore I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.130 
gathered and more detail so therefore I

can gather more start light so before I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.359 
can gather more start light so before I
take<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.530> photo
