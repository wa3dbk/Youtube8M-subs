00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
this video I'm actually connected with a

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.450 
this video I'm actually connected with a
Mac<00:00:55.149> keyboard<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.230> Mac<00:00:56.530> Mouse<00:00:56.859> so<00:00:57.129> I<00:00:57.160> was

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
Mac keyboard and a Mac Mouse so I was

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.069 
Mac keyboard and a Mac Mouse so I was
really<00:00:57.789> really<00:00:58.030> surprised<00:00:58.510> when<00:00:58.690> they<00:00:58.840> worked

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
really really surprised when they worked

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.810 
really really surprised when they worked
with<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.320> Android<00:00:59.800> software<00:01:00.039> but<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.550> works

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
with the Android software but it works

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.910 
with the Android software but it works
and<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.449> works<00:01:01.480> flawlessly<00:01:01.929> so<00:01:02.500> I'm<00:01:02.620> assuming

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
and it works flawlessly so I'm assuming

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.340 
and it works flawlessly so I'm assuming

keyboard<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:05.979> mouse<00:01:06.070> they<00:01:06.369> should<00:01:06.729> work<00:01:07.180> fine

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
keyboard and mouse they should work fine

keyboard and mouse they should work fine

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.780 
does what because you can't actually set
anything<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.140> only<00:01:50.290> option<00:01:50.950> in<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.610> settings

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
anything the only option in the settings

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.730 
anything the only option in the settings
is<00:01:52.240> whether<00:01:52.600> or<00:01:52.780> not<00:01:52.899> you<00:01:53.049> have<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.229> QWERTY

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
is whether or not you have a QWERTY

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.590 
is whether or not you have a QWERTY
keyboard<00:01:54.219> and<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.579> of<00:01:54.640> course<00:01:54.909> everyone<00:01:55.570> has

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
keyboard and I of course everyone has

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.170 
keyboard and I of course everyone has
QWERTY<00:01:56.200> keyboard<00:01:56.619> so<00:01:56.890> that's<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.909> can't

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
QWERTY keyboard so that's that you can't

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.120 
QWERTY keyboard so that's that you can't
actually<00:01:58.360> bind<00:01:58.840> any<00:01:59.140> keys<00:01:59.439> to<00:01:59.590> anything<00:01:59.799> yet

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
actually bind any keys to anything yet

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.219 
actually bind any keys to anything yet
now<00:02:00.340> I'm<00:02:00.579> sure<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.299> support<00:02:01.719> will<00:02:01.869> come<00:02:02.079> in

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
now I'm sure this support will come in

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.959 
now I'm sure this support will come in
the<00:02:02.320> future<00:02:02.469> but<00:02:02.799> for<00:02:02.860> now<00:02:03.039> it's<00:02:03.610> very

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
the future but for now it's very

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.060 
the future but for now it's very
bare-bones<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.930> still<00:02:05.289> works<00:02:05.619> though<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.039> I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
bare-bones it still works though so I

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.380 
bare-bones it still works though so I
thought<00:02:06.369> I'd<00:02:06.520> show<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.729> guys<00:02:06.850> some<00:02:07.240> gameplay

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
thought I'd show you guys some gameplay

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.200 
thought I'd show you guys some gameplay
but<00:02:08.110> yeah<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.500> mean<00:02:08.890> building<00:02:09.220> placing

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
but yeah I mean building placing

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.690 
but yeah I mean building placing
breaking<00:02:10.960> running<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.770> look

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
breaking running it look

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.690 
breaking running it look
it<00:02:13.240> all<00:02:13.510> works<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.319> I'm<00:02:14.650> looking<00:02:15.220> forward<00:02:15.640> to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
it all works so I'm looking forward to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.270 
it all works so I'm looking forward to
seeing<00:02:16.030> exactly<00:02:16.660> how<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.050> progresses<00:02:17.319> right

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
seeing exactly how this progresses right

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.580 
seeing exactly how this progresses right
now<00:02:18.489> it's<00:02:18.790> really<00:02:19.150> really<00:02:19.810> hard<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.110> play<00:02:20.349> with

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
now it's really really hard to play with

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.080 
now it's really really hard to play with
though<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.830> do<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.580> admit<00:02:21.880> it's

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
though I do have to admit it's

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.030 
though I do have to admit it's
definitely<00:02:22.930> way<00:02:23.200> harder<00:02:23.620> than<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.860> touch

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
definitely way harder than the touch

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.250 
definitely way harder than the touch
controls<00:02:24.520> or<00:02:24.880> controller<00:02:25.540> support<00:02:25.989> as<00:02:26.110> well

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
controls or controller support as well

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.140 
controls or controller support as well
that's<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.590> lot<00:02:26.800> better<00:02:27.099> than<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.730> keyboard

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
that's a lot better than the keyboard

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.240 
that's a lot better than the keyboard
support<00:02:28.360> right<00:02:28.780> now<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.530> I'm<00:02:29.620> not<00:02:29.739> sure<00:02:29.800> what

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
support right now so I'm not sure what

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.860 
support right now so I'm not sure what
they're<00:02:30.400> gonna<00:02:30.489> do<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.850> change<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.390> but<00:02:31.630> for

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
they're gonna do to change this but for

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.690 
they're gonna do to change this but for
now<00:02:31.930> I'm<00:02:32.319> perfectly<00:02:32.860> fine<00:02:32.950> playing<00:02:33.489> with

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
now I'm perfectly fine playing with

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.120 
now I'm perfectly fine playing with
touch<00:02:33.880> controls<00:02:33.910> or<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.540> controller<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:36.069> is

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
touch controls or a controller this is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.160 
touch controls or a controller this is
just<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.459> cool<00:02:36.670> little<00:02:36.850> uh<00:02:37.030> biggest<00:02:37.900> feature

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
just a cool little uh biggest feature

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.750 
just a cool little uh biggest feature
for<00:02:38.470> anyone<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.860> wants<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.069> try<00:02:39.340> out<00:02:39.370> using

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
for anyone that wants to try out using

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.570 
for anyone that wants to try out using
keyboard<00:02:40.450> in<00:02:40.660> Minecraft<00:02:41.470> Pocket<00:02:41.769> Edition<00:02:42.040> but

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
keyboard in Minecraft Pocket Edition but

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.110 
keyboard in Minecraft Pocket Edition but
I<00:02:42.819> am<00:02:43.209> sure<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.750> over<00:02:44.260> time<00:02:44.800> Mojang<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.850> going

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
I am sure that over time Mojang is going

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.640 
I am sure that over time Mojang is going
to<00:02:46.209> perfect<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.170> going<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.530> become

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
to perfect this and it's going to become

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.729 
to perfect this and it's going to become
flawless<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.910> like<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.510> PC<00:02:50.050> support<00:02:50.530> on

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
flawless just like the PC support on

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.490 
flawless just like the PC support on
keyboards<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.489> hopefully<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.810> comes<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.410> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
keyboards so hopefully that comes in the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.470 
keyboards so hopefully that comes in the
near<00:02:53.709> future<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.250> for<00:02:54.310> now<00:02:54.519> we've<00:02:55.180> got<00:02:55.450> a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
near future but for now we've got a

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.809 
near future but for now we've got a
little<00:02:55.750> bit<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.260> fumble<00:02:56.560> II<00:02:56.830> type<00:02:57.640> of

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
little bit of a fumble II type of

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.610 
little bit of a fumble II type of
keyboard<00:02:58.060> support<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.690> it's<00:02:58.810> perfectly<00:02:59.290> fine

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
keyboard support and it's perfectly fine

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.820 
keyboard support and it's perfectly fine
because<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.220> mean<00:03:00.400> keyboards<00:03:00.850> are<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.480> luxury<00:03:02.410> so

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
because I mean keyboards are a luxury so
