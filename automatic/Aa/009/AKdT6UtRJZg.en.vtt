 Well the truth is that it is a 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.770
 huge responsibility the first time 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.770

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.250
 interesting very funny but has a 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 just little problem that is not very chic 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.920
 and it seems that baseball looks at this greeting 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.290
 but do not you think 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.390

 the most chic artist as almost all by 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 cent because he is yes typical 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.340

 men and well exactly you look 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.600
 let's turn the baseball players into 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 very chic athletes before they enter 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.350
 our model I want to tell everyone 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.149

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.270
 section comes to you sponsored by 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 fashion is to buy clothes because 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.700
 Elegant people who buy 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.680

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.509
 our model 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.509
 pass of flight 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.850
 as you can see this costume is 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.240
 aburridÃ­simo has no 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.860
 depth has no texture for it 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.780
 I brought a few pieces of cloth very 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.340
 cute look for example this adds a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.490
 shine to the face of our players 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.009
 now if you are going to see 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.750
 then the stadium will give you a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.880
 incredible lighting to each of the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.640
 players are going to see many 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.649
 very prominent if you also look at this 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.689
 delay is beautiful because it adds 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.590
 texture then those that are thick 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.929
 we put him here and they look more skinny 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.929
 this looks a lot like each neighborhood 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.670
 good and could even be part of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.209
 this green looks at this 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.380
 of the magallanes marineritos what 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.380
 it seems the sailors 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.170
 but a good accessory yes I'm going to 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.540
 teach what is our model please 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.230
 stretch your hand 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.159
 another the other this old pink glove 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.159
 endurance 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.230
 but then I do not talk about those 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.040
 celestial things 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.770
 and this is so that it helps me so that 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.640
 his style manages to capture the aromas of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.520
 the London drizzle 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.140
 the room of a lovely quinceanera 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.140
 in love with miguel molina 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.430
 As I pronounce Miguel Moly, I will use 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.739
 a ball 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.210
 Look how you look was beautiful glove 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.440
 because it gives continuity to the arm 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.900
 and that gives him a wonder and he knows what 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.819
 I'm going to keep some gloves on that 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.129
 to pablo sandoval how do you think that 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.220
 it looks really, they have very much left but 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.710
 very masculine 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.380
 well, it looks really like a 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.540
 player of the caracas aristocrats 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.980
 and now let's give personality to 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.980
 this macho my love 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.880
 so that it uses to protect the area 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.880
 more important then of men 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.060
 but more important part of the model 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.780
 because you imagine those players 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.010
 running with pretty enough 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.010
 there is a beauty 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.110
 and look but that seems to be 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.110
 madonna is doing nothing 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.960
 good 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.560
 I'm late, luis grabbed me a tail 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.450
 very ugly 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.330
 for that you need to put sequins 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.910
 delays but generate 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.350
 I am your 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.560
 I 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:39.460
 I 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:43.949
 I am me, not me, I am me 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.949
 the two offices 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.660
 Of course I was divine her destiny 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:59.380
 so all chic all and at the end of 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.380
 here we go shopping yes 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.620
 h 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:14.159
 money and a trip hours I swear to you 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.159
 word of sec 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.010
 yes 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.530
 look here tina 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.900
 and what else is this uniform missing for 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.420
 finish being good chic look louis a 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.800
 It seems to me a bit disgusting that 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.350
 baseball players are always 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.020
 spitting that awful thing called 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.020
 At least that will be called boy 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.340
 so I propose that instead of chewing 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.340
 ximo lancen soap bubbles 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.820
 the idea occurred to me look but 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.180
 it's important that you have and let me 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.180
 finish talking piggy 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:14.639
 it is important that you have where to throw them 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.780
 because you're not going to throw them there on the floor 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.670
 they are a dirty 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.790
 you have to throw them in a container of 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:25.249
 glass so please like that headline 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.670
 Yes now 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:30.950
 do not 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.950
 seven layers the country almost as hard not 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.749
 soft and 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.550
 that was almost super chic if they had 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.210
 accomplished 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.210
 look 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:54.150
 and so can the elegant ones of 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:57.090
 aragua or the sturgeon of the guaira 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.990
 It caused me a caviar pie and you 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:04.370

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.370
