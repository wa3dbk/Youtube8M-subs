as dobsonian telescopes and what you
will<00:00:26.039> find<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.090> simple<00:00:27.359> mount

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
will find is it's a very simple mount

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080 
will find is it's a very simple mount
but<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.560> very<00:00:29.010> effective<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:29.670> looking

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
but it's it's very effective for looking

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.150

you looking at Jupiter now looking
pretty<00:00:43.050> good<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.290> being<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.860> low<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.309> sky

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
pretty good for being so low on the sky

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
pretty good for being so low on the sky
and<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.059> four<00:00:45.390> moons<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.840> at<00:00:48.829> quill<00:00:49.829> over<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
stars that go across this way which is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.569 
stars that go across this way which is
the<00:00:56.039> wing<00:00:57.230> okay<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.379> keep<00:00:58.559> coming<00:00:58.829> down<00:00:59.100> and
