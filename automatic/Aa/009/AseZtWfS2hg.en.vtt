00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.910
 hi everyone today second video in 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.730
 collaboration with board store priests e 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.600
 this time I'll talk about a pink nail polish 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.410
 fluo that lights up in the dark of a set 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.109
 from 12 brushes with an ultra-thin tip 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.230
 just appropriate for in the art is one 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.060
 transparent nail polish superman this priest 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.759
 can be applied to any type of 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.250
 colored nail polish to give the matt effect 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.380
 like my nails of all three 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.060
 products you will find the inter infobox in 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.740
 so that you can click on a 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.470
 see the site directly 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.260
 the cost is all there is to it 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.970
 knowing about each product being that the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.920
 video came a little long I have it 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.140
 had to be divided into first part 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.330
 second part in the first time vi 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.730
 I will talk about the pink fluo enamel I will make you 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.820
 see how it is used e 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.940
 the effect it gave to the dark while there 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.239
 second part of the video I will talk about 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.939
 brush and smart opacifier vi 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.409
 I'll show you how it applies and more there 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.450
 will be the tutorial of this beautiful 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.090
 in art as you see it is a lot 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.640
 particular because on the little enamel then 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.140
 at the end the shiny decorations stand out 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.570
 I hope they will follow in great videos 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.319
 for larrivey I leave one with it 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.600
 enamel its a kiss to all hello the 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.819
 vial and 7 ml is the thing that has me 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.399
 hit more than this glaze is that it is 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.219
 truly fluorescent really illuminates the 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.200
 dark orange to have nando I have to 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.840
 emphasize that it has a good drafting 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.729
 it is certain that we must still give two 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.530
 pass because otherwise the color could 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.530
 be slightly transparent 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.329
 to subjugate a few seconds later 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.329
 second pass 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.940
 maybe so we can see the color better 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.920
 unfortunately the sun is gone so I am 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.990
 a little forced to use the lamp e 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.720
 I try to turn it off when a little arrives 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.760
 more light to remove the enamel 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.950
 just keep it a few seconds at all 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.069
 direct sunlight or under one 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.870
 any uv light like that of the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.040
 lamp for gel polymerization 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.770
 on the way I do the race ok as you see 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.190
 it doesn't light up at all now 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.590
 I insert a few seconds into the lamp 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.630
 unfortunately only today and there is none for 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.519
 nothing if not it would have been better 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.239
 let you see it directly with the light 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:50.330
 solar with dates that I'm keeping it 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:56.660
 very few seconds I go out and 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:59.150
 it is already fluorescent or phosphorescent flu 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.920
 I don't know what they say I couldn't say 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.569
 this thing that really decides 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.910
 very much because I already have it 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.739
 i love fluorescent colors but find myself so that 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.150
 it lights up in the dark is really something 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.130
 Crazy 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.750
 the only flaw of this glaze is that there 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.340
 it's a little too dry to dry 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.989
 for that you also receive the glazes 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.980
 a double passed gen two minutes are 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.510
 dry 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.799
 let's say this two minutes more 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.799
 slightly sticky
