 today our recipes will be wings of 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.849
 fried chicken and the ingredients that 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.210
 we will need are the following to 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.140
 diet this chicken 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.400
 Salt 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.580
 oregano 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.090
 White wine 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.330
 both rolled 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.940
 olive or sunflower oil 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.700
 and peppers the first thing we should 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.289
 to do will be to remove all the pens 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.860
 that have 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.770
 to the list if we want to fry them like this 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.620
 we will leave like this and if we want to fry it 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.620
 this way we should cut it 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.920
 the little tip is all the chicken 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.190
 and by the union is the cut 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.500
 also in this way below 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.180
 let's dress the chicken we'll put it in 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.839
 a container where we are going to leave 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.789
 macerate the first thing we're going to put the 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.789
 wine we put a little wine 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.640
 we take the salt 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.180
 to all the pieces 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.180
 we put him 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.759
 freshly ground pepper is much more 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.610
 You can also take it rich in the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.180
 the garlic is already ground 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.180
 laminate 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.390
 and finally 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 the oregano 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.509
 we will move everything very well 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.210
 and so we'll leave it to macerate during 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.820
 At least one hour for this 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.770
 we will put the lid of a film and what 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.720
 we will keep in the refrigerator and to our 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.330
 chicken macerated a few hours already the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.460
 frying time I'm going to fry in 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.440
 Fryer with olive oil if not 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.810
 we have fryer what we should follow 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.130
 in the pan we must put a pan 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.660
 with enough oil and high fire 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.660
 we will be putting the pieces 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.730
 and so we'll leave it until seeing 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.250
 they are golden and we can already get it out 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.400

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.680
 crunchy and we'll be taking out the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.310
