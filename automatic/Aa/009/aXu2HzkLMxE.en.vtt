the<00:01:31.640> race<00:01:31.960> absolutely<00:01:32.960> right<00:01:33.140> but<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:33.799> did<00:01:34.189> come

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
the race absolutely right but I did come

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.370 
the race absolutely right but I did come
there<00:01:34.850> after<00:01:35.030> nearly<00:01:35.570> being<00:01:35.659> dead<00:01:36.110> at<00:01:36.290> the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
there after nearly being dead at the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.230 
there after nearly being dead at the
Nurburgring<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.040> I<00:01:37.070> just<00:01:37.310> was<00:01:37.520> not<00:01:37.729> prepared

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
Nurburgring so I just was not prepared

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.999 
Nurburgring so I just was not prepared
to<00:01:38.390> take<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.659> chance<00:01:39.110> under<00:01:39.439> this<00:01:39.710> terrible

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
to take the chance under this terrible

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.550 
to take the chance under this terrible
weather<00:01:40.310> conditions<00:01:40.939> if<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.030> do<00:01:41.330> remember<00:01:41.810> if

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
weather conditions if you do remember if

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.780 
weather conditions if you do remember if
I<00:01:42.680> would<00:01:42.830> have<00:01:42.950> known<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.400> rain<00:01:43.579> would<00:01:43.759> stop

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
I would have known the rain would stop

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.240 
I would have known the rain would stop
which<00:01:44.689> was<00:01:44.930> not<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.350> case<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:45.860> beginning

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
which was not the case in the beginning

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.760 
which was not the case in the beginning
because<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:47.540> problem<00:01:47.930> there<00:01:48.079> was<00:01:48.259> that<00:01:48.320> for

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
because the problem there was that for

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.890 
because the problem there was that for
about<00:01:48.890> four<00:01:49.310> hours<00:01:49.369> we<00:01:49.939> delayed<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.450> race<00:01:50.630> all

about four hours we delayed the race all
of<00:01:51.140> us<00:01:51.290> because<00:01:52.250> rivers<00:01:52.729> were<00:01:52.909> running<00:01:53.210> over

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
of us because rivers were running over

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.280 
of us because rivers were running over
the<00:01:53.509> circuit<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.170> we<00:01:54.500> do<00:01:54.619> we<00:01:54.979> also<00:01:55.189> recovers

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
the circuit and we do we also recovers

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.190 
the circuit and we do we also recovers
it<00:01:56.500> was<00:01:56.680> over<00:01:57.120> half<00:01:58.120> an<00:01:58.360> hour<00:01:58.480> later<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:59.020> rain

because I nearly killed myself in a

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.660 
because I nearly killed myself in a
Ferrari<00:02:49.930> then<00:02:50.680> Bernie<00:02:50.980> came<00:02:51.250> along<00:02:51.520> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
Ferrari then Bernie came along and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.310 
Ferrari then Bernie came along and
offered<00:02:51.790> me<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> drive<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.630> your<00:02:52.780> program<00:02:53.170> our

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
offered me a drive in your program our

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.290 
offered me a drive in your program our
premiere<00:02:53.770> which<00:02:54.010> was<00:02:54.160> your<00:02:54.310> position<00:02:54.790> and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
premiere which was your position and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.390 
premiere which was your position and
therefore<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.050> left<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.500> then<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.310> end

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
therefore I left and then in the end

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.010 
therefore I left and then in the end
looking<00:02:57.940> backwards<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.480> was<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.630> mistake

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
looking backwards it was a mistake

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.510
