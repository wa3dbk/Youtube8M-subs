00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
 For me and probably many others 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.625
 Zombie themes have completely changed since the The Walking Dead series 

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:14.914
 of AMC television channel is released 

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:17.265
 Even though the world is full of bloody demons 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.789
 but somewhere still exudes a strong vitality of mankind 

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:22.265
 The affection, altruistic hearts they have for each other. 

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:25.062
 Those are the better materials to Video Games 

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:30.046
 an entertainment that has a power that is not inferior to television that gives us an impressive experience 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.390
 Telltale's The Walking Dead game did not make this better 

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:35.953
 Even, lifting this brand to a new level. 

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:39.953
 However, since the release of Survival Instinct, a first-person perspective game 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.921
 Focusing heavily on survival has worried all fans of this series 

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:49.007
 Is FPS the right category to continue to convey the feelings that The walking dead has? 

00:00:49.078 --> 00:00:52.320
 And is it really necessary for a game to get a zombie theme? 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.937
 Time went by and with little information that Activision released 

00:00:55.977 --> 00:00:59.460
 A trailer is not really impressive and the price is only $ 50 

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:02.343
 Ultimate Survival Instinct is a game like? 

00:01:02.383 --> 00:01:04.383
 And is it worth the time you spent? 

00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.367
 Sologame will give you the following answer. 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.499
 I can tell right away, the quality of Survival Instinct is very bad 

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:20.265
 Although not as bad as quality on PS1, PS2 or early Xbox 

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.867
 which many gamers have identified 

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:26.664
 But the developer will definitely not be able to make players impressed and sink into the world they create 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.601
 If you decide to follow a real-life image, also called Photo Realistic 

00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:32.546
 then they have to do more than that 

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.828
 A lot of Texture is not designed in detail, 

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:38.843
 making them blurry and even breaking into pixels in close proximity. 

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:43.343
 The character model designed for Daryl and his brother Merel Dixon is quite detailed 

00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:46.953
 and you can easily recognize their looks in Cutscene segments 

00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:49.585
 However, do not expect the actor's acting to be transmitted 

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.984
 with quality of Motion Capture technology here 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.632
 Zombie, the thing you caught most during the game was too sketchy, 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.734
 Small quantity and very very creative 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.101
 The surrounding environment is also not better with repeated architectures, 

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:05.140
 errors go through objects, invisible walls block the path and many other inadequacies. 

00:02:05.727 --> 00:02:08.546
 Anyway with development time plus such low budget 

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:11.453
 Graphics quality is also not a factor for me to put too much expectation 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.539
 Because if the gameplay system is carefully invested, 

00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:17.218
 The weakness will be completely erased like The Walking Dead of telltale games 

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:20.273
 And hope that part is retained in the first part of the game 

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:24.757
 In contrast to their original prediction, Survival Instinct is not just a traditional Run And Gun phase 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.351
 Its gameplay clearly emphasizes the Survival Horror element. 

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:33.804
 Basically, each level is the discovery of the main character Daryl Dixon 

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:35.867
 to find the necessary supplies for the trip 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.289
 Essential items such as first aid kit, energy drink 

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:43.045
 food to restore health, to weapons like guns and ammunition 

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:47.046
 Also you can use bottles, jars, flares to attract zombies 

00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:51.085
 And yet another factor that cannot be ignored is: Survivors 

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:54.562
 The weapons you find are more convenient for melee phases 

00:02:54.586 --> 00:02:58.789
 If you look forward to running around and destroying dozens of Zombies with Shotgun like Left 4 Dead 

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:00.827
 This will not be the experience for you 

00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:03.539
 Loyal Instinct Survival with horror style 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.054
 when you face real dangers. 

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:10.250
 If they are cornered by two to three zombies, they will surely gain the upper hand 

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:13.097
 and destroy you in a moment. 

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:22.367
 Your best chance is when using sneaky tactics 

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:25.109
 and destroy each one with a nice killing blow. 

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:29.476
 Although the number of weapons is quite diverse, each with different attack speed and power 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.812
 but all are used by the same technique 

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:34.906
 It is pushing the enemy away and attacking them head-on 

00:03:35.053 --> 00:03:37.295
 And that is the only way for you to win 

00:03:37.414 --> 00:03:40.351
 Although quite logical and loyal to the original series 

00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:44.476
 but it loses its appeal quite quickly and makes every encounter become boring 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.304
 obstacles that you must overcome. 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.203
 Secret play can only last for the first few missions 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.062
 when I found many more ranged weapons like guns 

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:56.875
 even if they attract lots of zombies 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.601
 The crossbow is too strong in this game 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.406
 I can use it, pick up the arrow from the targets that were just defeated and never worry about ammunition 

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:08.179
 Basically now, you have become a true rambo and have no fear at all. 

00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:16.187
 On the way, there will be many survivors that you may encounter 

00:04:16.242 --> 00:04:20.281
 Of course, I can completely ignore it but so the game will not have any value at all 

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:24.460
 Usually, you will have to complete an extra task they assign to look for food 

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:26.468
 First aid and gratitude 

00:04:26.523 --> 00:04:28.343
 They will join your group 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.132
 In terms of ideas, this mechanism is very attractive when you can control a group of people. 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:37.148
 Assign them to find essential items while you protect them from life-threatening 

00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:41.429
 This is probably the aspect of the most recently recreated Survival Instinct compared to the original sereis movie 

00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:43.218
 but only for a short time 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.179
 You will realize this mechanism is completely anti-hollow and is just a trick 

00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.117
 to extend the playing time. 

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:50.421
 Sub-characters do not show any emotion at all 

00:04:50.483 --> 00:04:53.241
 as well as respond to players' actions and choices. 

00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:57.257
 The benefits they bring are too few, while too many items are needed to maintain. 

00:04:57.398 --> 00:05:01.835
 Choosing to stay alone to face danger alone now does not create any difficulties 

00:05:01.922 --> 00:05:04.335
 but inspiring, random 

00:05:04.484 --> 00:05:08.684
 This is difficult to accept for a game bearing The Walking Dead. 

00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:21.011
 Sound a rare aspect that Terminal Reality succeeded 

00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:23.886
 Emphasize the thrill of being alone in a zombie pack 

00:05:23.918 --> 00:05:27.378
 You will hear their breathing close without determining the direction 

00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:31.198
 The music is small, but it contributes to the tension when it comes out 

00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:36.948
 However, the music starts and the Credit is the only two pieces you can remember after playing through the game. 

00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:39.214
 Voiceover quality is acceptable 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.823
 But I look forward to more in actors Michael Rooker and Norman Reedus 

00:05:43.324 --> 00:05:44.987
 The interaction between them is not really convincing 

00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:49.972
 but partly due to the poor movement and expression of the characters plus the in-depth plot 

00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.605
 The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is an unforgettable experience 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.941
 even for those who really want to explore the world of this TV series yourself 

00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:02.784
 Play shallow, repeat too much to break all emotional values ​​that this brand has created 

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:07.448
 Once again, Activision has shown itself to be a publisher that puts money first 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.503
 and don't care about the elements to make a good game 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:14.573
 Spiderman, 007 Legends and now comes to Survival Instinct 

00:06:14.668 --> 00:06:17.651
 How many failures are enough for them to recognize this lesson? 

00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:20.089
 See you guys next time and hope 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:23.629
 The game we reviewed next will have better quality.
