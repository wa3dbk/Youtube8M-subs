00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

all<00:00:00.539> right<00:00:00.840> now<00:00:01.170> let's<00:00:01.410> talk<00:00:01.530> about<00:00:01.650> some<00:00:02.100> of

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
all right now let's talk about some of

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.919 
all right now let's talk about some of
the<00:00:02.310> solar<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:03.030> then<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.300> can<00:00:03.480> get<00:00:03.600> into<00:00:03.810> some

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
the solar and then I can get into some

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.089 
the solar and then I can get into some
of<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.380> this<00:00:04.859> stuff<00:00:05.100> even<00:00:05.460> further<00:00:05.730> but

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:07.099 
of the this stuff even further but

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.470 
of the this stuff even further but
especially<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.280> connection<00:00:08.820> side<00:00:09.090> which

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
especially on the connection side which

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.390 
especially on the connection side which
I<00:00:09.570> haven't<00:00:09.780> really<00:00:09.960> gotten<00:00:10.170> into<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
I haven't really gotten into on the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.189 
I haven't really gotten into on the
solar<00:00:14.120> what<00:00:15.120> happens<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.719> you've<00:00:15.960> got

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
solar what happens is you've got

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.750 
solar what happens is you've got
obviously<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> roof<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.310> got<00:00:17.340> cellar

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
obviously on the roof you got cellar

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.939 
obviously on the roof you got cellar

between all the different panels keeping
the<00:00:46.500> voltage<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> same<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> 12-volt

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the voltage the same if it's a 12-volt

you're<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.910> combining<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.570> amps<00:00:51.930> when

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
you're just combining the amps when

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
you're just combining the amps when
you're<00:00:52.320> you're<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:53.160> positive<00:00:53.640> positive

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you're you're going positive positive

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
you're you're going positive positive
negative<00:00:54.149> negative<00:00:54.860> or<00:00:55.860> combining<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
negative negative or combining it in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.760 
negative negative or combining it in
parallel<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.539> they<00:00:57.690> say<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
parallel as they say that's what I

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.099 
parallel as they say that's what I
decided<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.670> right<00:00:59.940> now<00:00:59.969> later<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.960> I'm

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
decided to do right now later on I'm

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
decided to do right now later on I'm
going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> combine<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.370> voltage<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> get

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
going to combine the voltage when I get

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.380 
going to combine the voltage when I get
a<00:01:03.300> better<00:01:03.510> charge<00:01:03.840> controller<00:01:05.000> but<00:01:06.000> anyway

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
a better charge controller but anyway

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750 
a better charge controller but anyway
for<00:01:06.689> me<00:01:06.869> made<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:07.860> sense<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.310> me<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:08.729> now

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
for me made more sense for me right now

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.780 
for me made more sense for me right now
anyway<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.840> combine<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> same

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
anyway to just combine you it's the same

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.570 
anyway to just combine you it's the same
thing<00:01:12.060> obviously<00:01:12.270> amps<00:01:12.990> times<00:01:13.140> volts<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
thing obviously amps times volts is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.109 
thing obviously amps times volts is
watts<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:16.560> combine<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.520> volts<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
watts so you can combine the volts and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.530 
watts so you can combine the volts and
leave<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> amps<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> same<00:01:19.890> level<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.330> can

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
leave the amps the same level or you can

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
leave the amps the same level or you can
combine<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.439> amps<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> leave<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.159> volts<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
combine the amps and leave the volts the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
combine the amps and leave the volts the
same<00:01:23.759> level<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.390> same<00:01:24.630> number<00:01:24.990> it's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
same level you can get same number it's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.530 
same level you can get same number it's
just<00:01:25.770> there's<00:01:26.040> some<00:01:26.280> practical<00:01:26.880> reasons<00:01:27.299> why

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
just there's some practical reasons why

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.780 
just there's some practical reasons why
people<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:28.560> generally<00:01:29.280> better<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.640> combine

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
people it's generally better to combine

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
people it's generally better to combine
the<00:01:30.090> volts<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.780> more<00:01:30.990> efficient<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.590> think

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the volts it's more efficient I think

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
the volts it's more efficient I think
but<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.280> doing<00:01:32.729> I'm<00:01:33.150> combining<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.869> amps

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
but I'm doing I'm combining the amps

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
but I'm doing I'm combining the amps
from<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:35.040> my<00:01:35.220> end<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> few<00:01:36.270> different

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
from from my end for a few different

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.380 
from from my end for a few different
reasons<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.020> anyway<00:01:37.950> needless<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> say<00:01:38.670> at

reasons but anyway needless to say at

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.520 
reasons but anyway needless to say at
the<00:01:39.540> end<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.810> day<00:01:39.930> you're<00:01:40.229> gonna<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.500> a

the end of the day you're gonna have a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.520 
the end of the day you're gonna have a

gonna come out that's gonna be combined

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.770 
gonna come out that's gonna be combined

just click together you don't even have
to<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.810> we're<00:01:54.899> gonna<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.320> crimp

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to you know we're gonna have to crimp

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.440 
to you know we're gonna have to crimp
them<00:01:56.040> or<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.030> anything

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
them or what you know do anything

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.760 
them or what you know do anything
special<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:58.140> these<00:01:58.350> things<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.740> just

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
special with these things you just

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.190 
special with these things you just
literally<00:01:59.640> plug<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.299> play<00:02:00.479> doesn't<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.049> any

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
literally plug and play doesn't get any

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.350 
literally plug and play doesn't get any
simpler<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.219> once<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.820> get<00:02:02.969> those<00:02:03.119> things

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
simpler so once you get those things

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.030 
simpler so once you get those things
mounted<00:02:03.899> you're<00:02:04.200> gonna<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> positive

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
mounted you're gonna have a positive

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.980 
mounted you're gonna have a positive
negative<00:02:05.189> lead<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.119> got<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.659> some<00:02:06.869> kind

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
negative lead you got to have some kind

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.990 
negative lead you got to have some kind
of<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.170> disconnect<00:02:07.619> box<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.520> my<00:02:08.670> solar

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
of a disconnect box this is my solar

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.950 
of a disconnect box this is my solar
disconnect<00:02:09.720> box<00:02:09.929> what<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.009> does

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
disconnect box what this does

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.530 
disconnect box what this does
is<00:02:13.280> your<00:02:14.280> positive<00:02:16.400> lead<00:02:17.400> coming<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.300> your

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
is your positive lead coming in and your

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.710 
is your positive lead coming in and your
negative<00:02:19.080> lead<00:02:19.110> coming<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.010> um<00:02:20.490> go<00:02:21.480> through

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
negative lead coming in um go through

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.310 
negative lead coming in um go through
this<00:02:21.900> box<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.430> your<00:02:23.760> positive<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:24.960> and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
this box and then your positive out and

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.950 
this box and then your positive out and
negative<00:02:25.770> out<00:02:25.980> come<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.150> box<00:02:27.480> you

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
negative out come out of this box you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.900 
negative out come out of this box you
don't<00:02:28.080> see<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> wires<00:02:28.620> here<00:02:29.070> because

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
don't see the wires here because

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.370 
don't see the wires here because
obviously<00:02:30.090> I've<00:02:30.570> got<00:02:30.720> them<00:02:30.810> all<00:02:30.930> behind<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
obviously I've got them all behind the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.860 
obviously I've got them all behind the
board<00:02:31.620> here<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.190> make<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.520> clean<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.420> you're

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
board here to make it clean but you're

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.990 
board here to make it clean but you're
gonna<00:02:33.960> have<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.230> positive<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.130> negative<00:02:35.160> out

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
gonna have a positive and a negative out

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.940 
gonna have a positive and a negative out
so<00:02:36.510> your<00:02:36.660> positive<00:02:36.990> negative<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.410> positive

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
so your positive negative and positive

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.420 
so your positive negative and positive
negative<00:02:38.100> valve<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.980> pulley<00:02:41.220> ball

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
negative valve this is a pulley ball

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.750 
negative valve this is a pulley ball
fuse<00:02:42.320> once<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.500> do<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.160> killed<00:02:44.610> my

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
fuse once I do that I just killed my

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.230 
fuse once I do that I just killed my
power<00:02:45.290> from<00:02:46.290> my<00:02:46.470> Solar<00:02:47.310> I've<00:02:47.610> got<00:02:47.790> no<00:02:47.940> solar

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
power from my Solar I've got no solar

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.510 
power from my Solar I've got no solar
coming<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.750> fact<00:02:49.410> you'll<00:02:49.560> see<00:02:49.650> my<00:02:49.890> Watts<00:02:50.160> right

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
coming in fact you'll see my Watts right

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.850 
coming in fact you'll see my Watts right
now<00:02:50.780> coming<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:52.130> zero<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:54.750> pulled<00:02:55.320> my<00:02:55.440> fuse

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
now coming in zero I just pulled my fuse

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.360 
now coming in zero I just pulled my fuse
plug<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.940> sucker<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.690> and<00:03:00.860> now<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:01.920> got<00:03:02.160> power

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
plug that sucker in and now we got power

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.850 
plug that sucker in and now we got power
again<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.390> that's<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.050> purpose<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.530> obviously

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
again so that's the purpose of obviously

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.530 
again so that's the purpose of obviously
the<00:03:04.950> disconnect<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.090> want<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.330> start

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the disconnect is if I want to start

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.930 
the disconnect is if I want to start
working<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:06.930> my<00:03:07.110> equipment<00:03:07.460> you<00:03:08.460> got<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.790> pull

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
working on my equipment you got to pull

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.760 
working on my equipment you got to pull
this<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.510> got<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.020> got<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.200> disconnect

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
this you got to you got to disconnect

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.040 
this you got to you got to disconnect
your<00:03:11.190> load<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.300> don't<00:03:12.570> electrocute

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
your load so you don't electrocute

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.360 
your load so you don't electrocute
yourself<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.550> safety<00:03:14.820> situation<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.440> you

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
yourself so it's safety situation so you

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.100 
yourself so it's safety situation so you
should<00:03:17.520> also<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.820> one<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.270> these<00:03:18.390> disconnect

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
should also have one of these disconnect

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.800 
should also have one of these disconnect
boxes<00:03:19.700> accessible<00:03:20.700> on<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> outside<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.720> your

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
boxes accessible on the outside of your

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.630 
boxes accessible on the outside of your
house<00:03:22.050> for<00:03:23.010> any<00:03:24.350> utility<00:03:25.350> people<00:03:25.740> that<00:03:26.070> if<00:03:26.280> you

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
house for any utility people that if you

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.280 
house for any utility people that if you
know<00:03:26.760> they're<00:03:26.940> working<00:03:27.060> on<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.390> lines<00:03:27.630> they

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
know they're working on the lines they

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.580 
know they're working on the lines they
need<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> ability<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:30.080> disconnect<00:03:31.080> your<00:03:31.290> box

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
need the ability to disconnect your box

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
need the ability to disconnect your box
so<00:03:31.950> they<00:03:32.100> for<00:03:32.550> safety<00:03:32.970> reasons<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.390> they<00:03:33.600> don't

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
so they for safety reasons so they don't

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.800 
so they for safety reasons so they don't
so<00:03:34.410> you're<00:03:34.800> not<00:03:34.950> feeding<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.730> grid<00:03:36.060> while

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
so you're not feeding the grid while

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.380 
so you're not feeding the grid while
they're<00:03:36.990> trying<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.380> work<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.390> you'll

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
they're trying to work on it and you'll

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.930 
they're trying to work on it and you'll
execute<00:03:39.780> alignment<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.860> obviously<00:03:41.400> you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
execute alignment so obviously you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.010 
execute alignment so obviously you
should<00:03:42.120> have<00:03:42.270> one<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.510> these<00:03:42.660> on<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.990> other

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
should have one of these on the other

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.620 
should have one of these on the other
side<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> house<00:03:43.710> as<00:03:43.950> well<00:03:44.300> even<00:03:45.300> if<00:03:45.510> you

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
side of the house as well even if you

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.600 
side of the house as well even if you
have<00:03:45.840> an<00:03:45.960> island<00:03:46.110> protected<00:03:46.860> grid<00:03:47.370> tie

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
have an island protected grid tie

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.790 
have an island protected grid tie
inverter<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.330> still<00:03:48.630> should<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:49.050> one<00:03:49.290> as<00:03:49.740> a

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
inverter you still should have one as a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.540 
inverter you still should have one as a
safety<00:03:50.190> precaution<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:51.210> it's<00:03:51.420> required<00:03:51.870> by

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
safety precaution and it's required by

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.860 
safety precaution and it's required by
the<00:03:53.550> code<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:54.870> anyway<00:03:55.230> that's<00:03:55.770> your<00:03:56.010> first

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
the code so anyway that's your first

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.390 
the code so anyway that's your first
component<00:03:57.870> your<00:03:58.560> positive<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.310> your

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
component your positive and your

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.980 
component your positive and your
negative<00:03:59.490> we're<00:03:59.970> gonna<00:04:00.090> run<00:04:00.330> through<00:04:00.630> your

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
negative we're gonna run through your

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.600 
negative we're gonna run through your
disconnect<00:04:01.560> box<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:02.220> then<00:04:02.430> they're<00:04:02.550> gonna

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
disconnect box and then they're gonna

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.420 
disconnect box and then they're gonna
run<00:04:02.880> out<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.330> disconnect<00:04:03.660> box<00:04:04.110> and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
run out of that disconnect box and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.780 
run out of that disconnect box and
continue<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.670> in<00:04:05.700> my<00:04:06.240> case<00:04:06.570> those<00:04:07.580> continue<00:04:08.580> on

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
continue on in my case those continue on

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.330 
continue on in my case those continue on
now<00:04:09.030> they<00:04:09.210> can<00:04:09.360> go<00:04:09.480> obviously<00:04:09.830> to<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.950> battery

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
now they can go obviously to the battery

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.580 
now they can go obviously to the battery
to<00:04:11.970> charge<00:04:12.000> your<00:04:12.360> battery<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:13.020> then<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.470> can

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
to charge your battery and then you can

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.190 
to charge your battery and then you can
run<00:04:13.740> off<00:04:13.890> your<00:04:14.040> batteries<00:04:14.490> or<00:04:14.960> you<00:04:15.960> can<00:04:16.080> take

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
run off your batteries or you can take

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.640 
run off your batteries or you can take
that<00:04:16.350> power<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:18.109> put<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.170> into<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.440> grid

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
that power and put it into the grid

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.590 
that power and put it into the grid
through<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.580> is<00:04:20.760> just<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.000> little<00:04:21.210> plug<00:04:21.390> in

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
through this is just a little plug in

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.560 
through this is just a little plug in
grid<00:04:21.780> tie<00:04:21.960> inverter<00:04:21.989> which<00:04:22.530> I've<00:04:22.710> used<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.570> put

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
grid tie inverter which I've used so put

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.840 
grid tie inverter which I've used so put
it<00:04:24.630> into<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.870> grid

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
it into the grid

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.580 
it into the grid
now<00:04:27.530> what<00:04:28.530> I've<00:04:28.680> set<00:04:29.460> up<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.260> this<00:04:31.260> is<00:04:31.380> just<00:04:31.530> a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
now what I've set up is a this is just a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.070 
now what I've set up is a this is just a
transfer<00:04:32.130> switch<00:04:32.360> fact<00:04:33.360> let<00:04:33.540> me<00:04:33.660> start<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.930> new

transfer switch fact let me start a new

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.720 
transfer switch fact let me start a new
video<00:04:34.290> we'll<00:04:35.070> continue<00:04:35.370> on<00:04:35.760> solar<00:04:36.090> part<00:04:36.450> 2
