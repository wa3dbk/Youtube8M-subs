I've learned I pretty much learn like

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.410 
I've learned I pretty much learn like
we're<00:01:14.200> all<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.590> impulse<00:01:15.520> corners<00:01:16.090> are<00:01:16.270> is

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
we're all the impulse corners are is

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.749 
we're all the impulse corners are is
what<00:01:16.630> i<00:01:16.660> call<00:01:16.930> them<00:01:17.110> because<00:01:17.440> people<00:01:18.430> are<00:01:18.580> just

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
what i call them because people are just

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.510 
what i call them because people are just
impulsively<00:01:19.330> are<00:01:19.960> compulsively<00:01:20.830> go<00:01:21.250> into

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
impulsively are compulsively go into

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.120

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:11.479 
entertaining for a little while until I

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.449 
entertaining for a little while until I
mean<00:04:11.750> until<00:04:12.199> people<00:04:12.379> figured<00:04:12.829> out<00:04:12.979> the<00:04:13.220> the

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
mean until people figured out the the

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.819

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
just it bothers me that they actually

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.979 
just it bothers me that they actually
use<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:17.930> as<00:04:18.229> a<00:04:18.260> tactic<00:04:18.769> now<00:04:18.919> like<00:04:19.159> they<00:04:19.310> don't

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989
