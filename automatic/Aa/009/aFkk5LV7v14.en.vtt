 of the triqui ethnic group have searched 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.290
 for decades a decent housing migrated 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.059
 from his native san juan cópala oaxaca in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.130
 look for a better future for them and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.259
 their families but they say that living in 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.800
 the city ​​has not been easy eduardo 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.810
 martínez has the story 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.250
 the alley juan de las casas is one of 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.560
 the most popular neighborhood of the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.090
 mercy for these directions everyone knows that 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.160
 here the triquis have settled 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.670
 natives of San Juan Cópala 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.230
 oaxaca and we have been fighting 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.230
 more than 30 years 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:42.440
 in this place and also 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.399
 in this city ​​and to date we have not 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.379
 advanced a lot and they do not advance they say because 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.420
 they are forgotten and they are not a priority either 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.070
 for the government that is why they live 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.840
 under these roofs of the mine where no 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.489
 they just sleep but they produce 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.220
 crafts sold in the streets 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.260
 Maria Dolores for example makes looms 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.220
 typical of Oaxaca where it has not returned 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.740
 15 years 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 yesterday I felt calmer was more 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.220
 beautiful 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.179
 although we did not have money it was very 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.909
 difficult I would like to return but the passage 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.649
 goes up expensive in this site they live about 300 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.750
 People who like Maria 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.210
 pains left their land to be forged 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.490
 a future however they came across a 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.049
 city ​​they claim that discriminates 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.539
 because they do not talk and dress like the 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.800
 most of its inhabitants the 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.800
 indigenous populations 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.780
 according to the rights program 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.790
 of the federal district constitute 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.950
 one of the 11 groups that are 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.950
 considered as higher risk 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.320
 violation of their human rights are 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.880
 calculates 123,000 the number of 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.070
 indigenous people who have migrated to the capital 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.710
 Mexican mainly from ethnic groups 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.960
 triqui mazahua otomí mixe and nagua 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.510
 many of them do not speak very well 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.409
 Spanish then when they are accused or 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.409
 commit any crime or alleged crime 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.240
 they can not defend themselves and that is that 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.250
 It has become difficult to find translators 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.590
 for the 68 indigenous languages ​​that are 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.180
 speak in the country to this adds that 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.130
 every year the indigenous population in the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.319
 city increases by about 7000 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.850
 people and although they are far from their 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.410
 land the original groups that have 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.180
 come here they are reluctant to lose 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.770
 their identity cling to their 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.540
 traditions because they say the only thing 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.190
 they can not get away is the great 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.000
 inheritance left to them by their 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.670
 ancestors
