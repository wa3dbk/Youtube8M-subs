that's<00:02:57.580> par<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.120> nutshell<00:02:58.530> okay<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.950> a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
that's par in a nutshell okay that's a

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.830 
that's par in a nutshell okay that's a
great<00:03:00.220> technical<00:03:00.610> explanation<00:03:01.390> but<00:03:01.660> can<00:03:01.780> you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
great technical explanation but can you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.720 
great technical explanation but can you
also<00:03:02.170> describe<00:03:02.530> par<00:03:02.799> in<00:03:02.950> another<00:03:03.220> way<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.430> we

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
also describe par in another way that we

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.780 
also describe par in another way that we
can<00:03:03.849> apply<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.180> growing<00:03:04.540> plants<00:03:04.980> sure<00:03:05.980> let's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
can apply to growing plants sure let's

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.640 
can apply to growing plants sure let's
look<00:03:07.000> at<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.239> chart<00:03:07.299> which<00:03:07.900> shows<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.349> color

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
look at this chart which shows the color

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.289 
look at this chart which shows the color
of<00:03:08.860> light<00:03:09.099> that<00:03:09.459> human<00:03:09.819> eyes<00:03:09.970> can<00:03:10.000> perceive

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
of light that human eyes can perceive

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.140 
of light that human eyes can perceive
and<00:03:10.959> what<00:03:10.989> plants<00:03:11.860> use<00:03:12.069> for<00:03:12.340> photosynthesis

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
and what plants use for photosynthesis

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.229 
and what plants use for photosynthesis
as<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:14.290> can<00:03:14.440> see<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:15.099> human<00:03:15.459> eye<00:03:15.579> range<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.090> in

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
as you can see the human eye range is in

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.300 
as you can see the human eye range is in
the<00:03:16.360> middle<00:03:16.690> center<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> color<00:03:18.010> spectrum

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
the middle center of the color spectrum

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.660 
the middle center of the color spectrum
while<00:03:19.030> par<00:03:19.480> light<00:03:19.720> or<00:03:19.959> plant<00:03:20.620> absorption<00:03:21.519> is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
while par light or plant absorption is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.420 
while par light or plant absorption is
across<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.510> entire<00:03:22.540> color<00:03:23.230> spectrum<00:03:23.829> and<00:03:24.010> at

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
across the entire color spectrum and at

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.699 
across the entire color spectrum and at
different<00:03:24.610> levels<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.930> while<00:03:26.079> human<00:03:26.530> eye

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
different levels so while human eye

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.220 
different levels so while human eye
light<00:03:26.950> is<00:03:27.099> measured<00:03:27.250> by<00:03:27.549> intensity<00:03:28.239> lumens

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
light is measured by intensity lumens

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.160 
light is measured by intensity lumens
Lux<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.040> foot<00:03:30.250> candles<00:03:30.700> par<00:03:31.390> is<00:03:31.510> measured<00:03:31.959> by

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
Lux and foot candles par is measured by

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.770 
Lux and foot candles par is measured by
the<00:03:32.230> useful<00:03:32.819> absorption<00:03:33.819> intensity<00:03:34.660> of

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
the useful absorption intensity of

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.930 
the useful absorption intensity of
colors<00:03:35.139> so<00:03:35.350> if<00:03:35.859> plant<00:03:36.130> lighting<00:03:36.459> is<00:03:36.549> measured

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
colors so if plant lighting is measured

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.420 
colors so if plant lighting is measured
by<00:03:37.060> colors<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.690> not<00:03:37.870> intensity<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.980> there<00:03:39.370> a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
by colors and not intensity is there a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.190 
by colors and not intensity is there a
difference<00:03:39.790> between<00:03:39.850> our<00:03:40.299> eye<00:03:40.630> grow<00:03:40.930> light

also about the quality of light produced

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.320 
also about the quality of light produced
ok<00:04:33.039> so<00:04:33.370> now<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.520> we<00:04:33.789> know<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:34.150> light

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
ok so now that we know that light

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.240 
ok so now that we know that light
quality<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:34.930> critical<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.620> growing<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:35.950> healthy

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
you how is it that I grow can develop

you how is it that I grow can develop
and<00:05:37.150> create<00:05:37.270> these<00:05:37.570> really<00:05:37.900> unique<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.440> plant

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860
