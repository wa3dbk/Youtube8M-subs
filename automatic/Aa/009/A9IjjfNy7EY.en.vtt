00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.470 
one one day at home only last Thursday
because<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.670> got<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.060> Wednesday<00:02:12.420> but

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
because I got it on Wednesday but

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
because I got it on Wednesday but
wednesday<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.020> service<00:02:13.319> interval

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
wednesday the service interval

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
wednesday the service interval
but<00:02:14.340> at<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.000> suppose<00:02:15.210> one<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.540> really<00:02:15.720> hard<00:02:16.020> to

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
but at I suppose one is really hard to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.320 
but at I suppose one is really hard to
get<00:02:16.500> known<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.550> menus<00:02:17.970> are<00:02:18.150> very

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
get known to to the menus are very

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.120 
get known to to the menus are very
different<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.290> online<00:02:19.560> gameplay<00:02:19.800> is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
different but the online gameplay is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.440 
different but the online gameplay is
better<00:02:20.160> because<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:20.910> less<00:02:21.090> lag<00:02:21.300> because

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
better because you have less lag because

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.810 
better because you have less lag because
they're<00:02:21.780> dedicated<00:02:22.380> servers<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.340> think<00:02:23.460> in

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
they're dedicated servers so I think in

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.400 
they're dedicated servers so I think in
the<00:02:23.910> end<00:02:23.940> Xbox<00:02:24.510> one<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.230> better

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
the end Xbox one is going to be better

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.100 
the end Xbox one is going to be better
just<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.370> get<00:02:26.550> get<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.090> know<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.630> menu<00:02:27.840> and

yourself moving on tomorrow what your
predictions<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:27.870> tomorrow<00:03:28.170> how<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.980> you

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
predictions for tomorrow how do you

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.670 
predictions for tomorrow how do you
think<00:03:29.280> everything's<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.850> go<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:31.110> think

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
think everything's going to go I think

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.280 
think everything's going to go I think
epsilon<00:03:32.040> will<00:03:32.250> win<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> think<00:03:33.870> we<00:03:33.990> can<00:03:34.110> beat

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
epsilon will win but I think we can beat

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.130 
epsilon will win but I think we can beat
every<00:03:34.590> team<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:35.520> not<00:03:35.550> epsilon<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.720> hope<00:03:36.930> if

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
every team but not epsilon so I hope if

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.630 
every team but not epsilon so I hope if
we<00:03:37.350> mesh<00:03:37.620> them<00:03:37.770> in<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.920> final<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.370> give<00:03:38.490> them

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
we mesh them in the final and give them

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.920 
we mesh them in the final and give them
a<00:03:38.700> good<00:03:38.790> game<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.030> hopefully<00:03:39.300> we<00:03:39.630> can<00:03:39.780> beat

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
a good game and hopefully we can beat

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.360 
a good game and hopefully we can beat
them<00:03:40.080> but<00:03:40.320> anything<00:03:40.800> can<00:03:40.860> happen<00:03:40.980> maybe<00:03:41.190> we

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
them but anything can happen maybe we

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.620 
them but anything can happen maybe we
will<00:03:41.459> lose<00:03:41.580> against<00:03:41.910> another<00:03:42.120> team<00:03:42.300> tomorrow

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630
