00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.950
 wh 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 Hmm 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.250
 Hello everyone b tv network vfx class a welcome 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.370
 But is suddenly Do you Zonchi What you Zentanguru 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.960
 not 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:10.380
 Let's explain Zen tangle is very popular in America now 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 Pattern art that anyone can enjoy beautiful art just by drawing simple patterns 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.869
 The birthplace of Zentangles is Massachusetts, USA 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.360
 Massachusetts 4 species Massachusetts is a slaying and slaughtering Massachusetts 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.490
 Middle 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.079
 Iro installed 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.439
 Produced by Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas of Massachusetts, USA 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.149
 Was 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.330
 In fact, I was once trained as monks person that this stand clover and Mr. 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:37.020
 Maria Thomas is a botanical art 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.510
 In other words, you were an artist of plant miniatures 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.080
 The botanical art was in the details of the plants 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:50.190
 I write precisely so far, Mr. Maria's concentration power This is already going for meditation 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:55.170
 I am in a state where I concentrate my mind and enter an impersonal position 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:02:00.330
 So Rick, who was a monk, felt that way when she saw Mr. Maria. 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:06.070
 The state I was writing intensively was the state before I said so-called in Japan 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:12.160
 Before the Zentangle born in the United States, it means that it is before Japan 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.910
 It is Japanese culture and thought I have a very love haves and think involved by everyone I ne 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.080
 How about 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:23.500
 In say why was this time addressed this Zentanguru When this Zentanguru 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.760
 There is no need for artistic elements in art etc. Is there any mischief if you say that you do not need artistic elements? 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.090
 Though I may not 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.660
 Artistic system 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:35.840
 If it is said that it can not be done without a sense, such a thing is actually this Zentangle 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.410
 I don't have a movie like this after how to come 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.730
 But I want to write I want such people to read by all means 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.190
 Please take a good look at my mind. This is not my face. 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:52.530
 Pattern art that anyone can write with one pen 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:55.980
 I was convinced that I could read this book and anyone could do it 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.780
 Let's introduce such three keywords Part 1 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:07.210
 Up and down is not Zentanguru is You can either started over from where 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:11.020
 When viewed from any angle it's also good 10 people at the front end tool if put 10 people there is no correct answer to the 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:14.950
 There is a straight line and a good curve and a good curve 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:20.620
 There is no correct answer. All 3 correct answers. There is no failure. 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:25.390
 Zentanguru only to say I failed no no this failure must also correct it Sorya likely 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.200
 I think that is the rule of can you erase past mistakes and experiences? 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.269
 Past does not care in life 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.959
 Just as there is no one that I wrote once before this dangle can not be erased 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:41.150
 In short, neither eraser nor correction point should be used 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.620
 Of course, if you use the eraser, it is not something that will bring down the punishment or something like that. I 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.180
 Will take off 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.569
 I and the thing is if really say in short there even if this Zentanguru is gone fails 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.650
 It is that new that good once you start writing start from 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:58.849
 This Zentangle I wrote for the first time does not know what will happen in the future 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.120
 If you don't start it, your life will be the same, maybe it 's a straight line 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.610
 Maybe something like my life waves will come to an end 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.590
 Just a store 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.930
 It may become a tent, and this Zentangle only writes on paper 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.650
 It's not that already in America 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.730
 Jewelry version of paper craft objects 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:22.630
 This abtv network vfx is also applied to clothing 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:26.170
 If you live there is a friendship association that will teach you how to write this Zen Tangle 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.020
 Why take it where underground is necessary 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.520
 America 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:37.349
 Iku Ikuno I Seriously'll go if 8 e 9 of me and chicken 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.819
 If it is too early to teach you, why not try making your life art 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.819
 So we'll see you at the next lesson 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.780
 We are good
