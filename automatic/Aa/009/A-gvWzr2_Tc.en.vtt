exercise<00:00:17.029> because<00:00:17.570> we<00:00:17.779> have<00:00:18.140> found<00:00:18.410> of<00:00:18.770> all<00:00:19.340> of

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
exercise because we have found of all of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.890 
exercise because we have found of all of
the<00:00:19.790> different<00:00:20.120> strategies<00:00:20.360> that

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
the different strategies that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.480 
the different strategies that
neuroscience<00:00:21.620> has<00:00:21.740> been<00:00:21.920> able<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.280> document

neuroscience has been able to document
this<00:00:23.480> one<00:00:23.840> will<00:00:24.320> lower<00:00:24.560> stress<00:00:25.130> for<00:00:25.640> you

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
this one will lower stress for you

this one will lower stress for you
throughout<00:00:26.539> most<00:00:27.289> of<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.770> day<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.220> it's<00:00:28.880> a

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
throughout most of the day and it's a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.260 
throughout most of the day and it's a
two-part<00:00:29.930> exercise<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.760> first<00:00:32.029> part

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
two-part exercise and the first part

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.600 
two-part exercise and the first part
even<00:00:32.989> though<00:00:33.079> it<00:00:33.230> may<00:00:33.350> seem<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.649> little<00:00:33.739> odd<00:00:34.160> or

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
even though it may seem a little odd or

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.560 
even though it may seem a little odd or
silly<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.180> you

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
silly to you

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.590 
silly to you
it's<00:00:35.960> simply<00:00:36.530> yawning<00:00:37.370> even<00:00:38.120> if<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:38.360> don't

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
it's simply yawning even if you don't

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.680 
it's simply yawning even if you don't
feel<00:00:38.930> like<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.380> all<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:39.980> want<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.790> do<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.329> he

feel like it all I want you to do is he

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.139 
feel like it all I want you to do is he
on<00:00:41.930> about<00:00:42.470> ten<00:00:42.860> times<00:00:43.100> what<00:00:43.550> do<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:43.730> feel<00:00:44.000> like

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
on about ten times what do you feel like

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.090 
on about ten times what do you feel like
they're<00:00:44.450> not<00:00:44.649> even<00:00:45.649> if<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:45.770> feel

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
they're not even if you feel

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.069 
they're not even if you feel
uncomfortable<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:47.329> you<00:00:47.570> kind<00:00:47.809> of<00:00:47.840> breathe

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
uncomfortable just you kind of breathe

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.080 
uncomfortable just you kind of breathe
in<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:48.680> make<00:00:48.829> a<00:00:48.860> yawn<00:00:49.250> sigh<00:00:49.820> sound<00:00:50.690> like<00:00:51.610> no

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.510 

when<00:00:56.090> you<00:00:56.270> do<00:00:56.540> this<00:00:56.750> particular<00:00:57.170> exercise<00:00:57.860> a

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
when you do this particular exercise a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.209 
when you do this particular exercise a
very<00:00:59.180> specific<00:00:59.600> part<00:01:00.170> of<00:01:00.260> your<00:01:00.320> brain<00:01:00.710> called

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
very specific part of your brain called

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.250 
very specific part of your brain called
the<00:01:01.340> perk<00:01:01.579> unius<00:01:02.000> right<00:01:02.450> back<00:01:02.690> up<00:01:02.930> here<00:01:03.170> and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
the perk unius right back up here and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.130 
the perk unius right back up here and
your<00:01:03.379> parietal<00:01:03.620> lobe<00:01:04.210> begins<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.479> glow<00:01:05.630> and

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
your parietal lobe begins to glow and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.260 
your parietal lobe begins to glow and
this<00:01:06.619> is<00:01:06.740> one<00:01:06.920> of<00:01:07.039> the<00:01:07.159> key<00:01:07.490> centers<00:01:08.090> of

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
this is one of the key centers of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.459 
this is one of the key centers of
consciousness<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.709> it<00:01:09.920> means<00:01:10.159> that<00:01:10.369> yawning

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
consciousness so it means that yawning

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.010 
consciousness so it means that yawning
actually<00:01:12.469> arouses<00:01:13.069> your<00:01:13.219> petunias<00:01:14.020> actually

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
actually arouses your petunias actually

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.069 
actually arouses your petunias actually
increases<00:01:15.920> consciousness<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:17.389> in<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:17.630> very

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
increases consciousness but in a very

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.590 
increases consciousness but in a very
specific<00:01:18.409> way<00:01:18.799> it<00:01:19.789> reduces<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.539> stress

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
specific way it reduces the stress

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.139 
specific way it reduces the stress
neural<00:01:21.350> chemicals<00:01:21.889> throughout<00:01:22.729> your<00:01:22.969> entire

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
neural chemicals throughout your entire

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.169 
neural chemicals throughout your entire
brain<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.649> it's<00:01:24.799> very<00:01:24.979> simple<00:01:25.429> all<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.149> have

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
brain so it's very simple all you have

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.679 
brain so it's very simple all you have
to<00:01:26.509> do<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.840> get<00:01:27.020> over<00:01:27.289> 500<00:01:28.100> years<00:01:28.429> of<00:01:28.759> old

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
to do is get over 500 years of old

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.620 
to do is get over 500 years of old
medieval<00:01:30.079> notion<00:01:30.889> that<00:01:31.279> when<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.549> yawn<00:01:31.939> evil

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
medieval notion that when you yawn evil

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.629 
medieval notion that when you yawn evil
spirits<00:01:33.049> might<00:01:33.439> be<00:01:33.709> escaping<00:01:34.279> from<00:01:34.429> your

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:34.639 
spirits might be escaping from your

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.399 
spirits might be escaping from your
mouth<00:01:34.849> we<00:01:35.539> don't<00:01:35.749> think<00:01:35.869> that's<00:01:36.049> true<00:01:36.380> for

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
mouth we don't think that's true for

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.499 
mouth we don't think that's true for
anymore<00:01:36.889> and<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:37.729> I'd<00:01:37.849> like<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.209> to<00:01:38.389> begin

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
anymore and so I'd like you to begin

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.559 
anymore and so I'd like you to begin
because<00:01:39.139> this<00:01:39.469> is<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.649> series<00:01:40.189> for<00:01:40.429> 60<00:01:41.029> seconds

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
because this is a series for 60 seconds

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.959 
because this is a series for 60 seconds
to<00:01:41.749> change<00:01:41.990> your<00:01:42.259> brain<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.340> let's<00:01:43.579> begin<00:01:43.759> with

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
to change your brain so let's begin with

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.849 
to change your brain so let's begin with
me

God even stretch a little bit and by the
way<00:01:53.599> of<00:01:53.779> breathing<00:01:54.469> and<00:01:54.740> moving<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:56.119> creates

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
way of breathing and moving that creates

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.410 
way of breathing and moving that creates
the<00:01:57.259> greatest<00:01:57.700> amount<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:59.029> pleasure

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.290 

go<00:02:02.420> up<00:02:02.570> again<00:02:02.870> it's<00:02:03.620> contagious

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.680 

and<00:02:08.650> even<00:02:09.650> if<00:02:09.830> they're<00:02:10.040> faked<00:02:10.369> by<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.270> third

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
and even if they're faked by the third

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.050 
and even if they're faked by the third
or<00:02:11.900> fourth<00:02:12.200> yawn<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:13.100> will<00:02:13.220> begin<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.670> really

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
or fourth yawn you will begin to really

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.850 
or fourth yawn you will begin to really
feel<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:15.160> spontaneous<00:02:16.160> deep<00:02:16.970> level<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:18.020> opening

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
feel a spontaneous deep level of opening

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:30.930 
feel a spontaneous deep level of opening
in<00:02:19.100> your<00:02:19.460> chest<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.120> in<00:02:20.720> your<00:02:20.900> consciousness

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.500 

and<00:02:32.110> each<00:02:33.110> time<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.530> young<00:02:34.180> you're<00:02:35.180> going<00:02:35.390> to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
and each time you young you're going to

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.740
