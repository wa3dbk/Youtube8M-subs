okay folks after getting a whole lot of
requests<00:00:03.990> from<00:00:04.170> folks<00:00:04.500> about<00:00:04.759> building<00:00:05.759> them

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
requests from folks about building them

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.440 
requests from folks about building them
a<00:00:05.910> frame<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.950> warned<00:00:07.950> them<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.099> they<00:00:08.820> they<00:00:09.210> said

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
a frame I warned them but they they said

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.419 
a frame I warned them but they they said
they<00:00:09.719> don't<00:00:09.840> care<00:00:10.050> either<00:00:10.559> way<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.889> started

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
they don't care either way I started

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.810 
they don't care either way I started
building<00:00:11.580> some<00:00:11.820> frames<00:00:12.530> these<00:00:13.530> are<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.639> some

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
building some frames these are have some

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.279 
building some frames these are have some
improvements<00:00:15.540> over<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.809> old<00:00:15.990> ones<00:00:17.630> namely<00:00:18.630> we

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
improvements over the old ones namely we

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.279 
improvements over the old ones namely we
have<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:20.460> flat<00:00:20.939> screw<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.930> when<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.109> put<00:00:22.260> your

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
have all flat screw so when you put your

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.160 
have all flat screw so when you put your
velcro<00:00:23.420> you're<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:24.539> kind<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.779> fighting<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
velcro you're not kind of fighting the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.570 
velcro you're not kind of fighting the
little<00:00:25.410> bump<00:00:25.590> sticking<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.250> down<00:00:26.400> like

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
little bump sticking up and down like

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.679 
little bump sticking up and down like
that

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.150 
that
number<00:00:28.289> two<00:00:28.529> I've<00:00:29.099> gotten<00:00:29.869> drill<00:00:30.869> press<00:00:31.160> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
number two I've gotten drill press and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.700 
number two I've gotten drill press and
I've<00:00:32.520> gotten<00:00:32.850> straight<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.110> stuff<00:00:34.380> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
I've gotten straight on all my stuff so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.100 
I've gotten straight on all my stuff so
it's<00:00:35.160> not<00:00:35.309> cooking<00:00:35.579> anymore<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it's not cooking anymore this is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.479 
it's not cooking anymore this is
basically<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.710> fiberglass<00:00:40.129> four<00:00:41.129> millimeter

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
basically a fiberglass four millimeter

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.150 
basically a fiberglass four millimeter
rod<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> collar<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.300> not<00:00:45.950> loose<00:00:46.950> or

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
rod with a collar and it's not loose or

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069 
rod with a collar and it's not loose or
wimpier<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.730> let<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.030> you've<00:00:48.719> got<00:00:48.870> two

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
wimpier and let that you've got two

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.470 
wimpier and let that you've got two
holes<00:00:49.350> drilled<00:00:49.680> into<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:52.309> closer

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
holes drilled into it one for the closer

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.180 
holes drilled into it one for the closer
one<00:00:54.480> farther<00:00:54.840> away<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.350> depending<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:55.980> how<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
one farther away so depending on how you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
one farther away so depending on how you
want<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.699> servo<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.480> long<00:00:57.690> arm<00:00:57.930> or

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
want your servo if it's a long arm or

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.819 
want your servo if it's a long arm or
short<00:00:58.350> arm<00:00:58.530> how<00:00:58.770> much<00:00:58.949> it'll<00:00:59.100> stick<00:00:59.340> out<00:01:00.829> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
short arm how much it'll stick out it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.859 
short arm how much it'll stick out it
does<00:01:02.039> fold<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.850> I<00:01:05.850> want<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> discover<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
does fold and I want to discover a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.630 
does fold and I want to discover a
couple<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.320> things<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.130> people

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
couple of things that I think people

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
couple of things that I think people
need<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.020> kind<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.380> about<00:01:11.750> building<00:01:12.750> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
need to kind of know about building this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170 
need to kind of know about building this
the<00:01:13.530> number<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.159> attaching<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> motors<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the number one is attaching the motors a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.960 
the number one is attaching the motors a
lot<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.570> those<00:01:15.750> who<00:01:16.490> wanted<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> use<00:01:17.640> motor

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
lot of those who wanted to use motor

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.630 
lot of those who wanted to use motor
plates<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.930> they're<00:01:19.140> wanting<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> use

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.620 

fiberglass<00:01:24.530> carbon<00:01:25.530> fiber<00:01:26.180> all<00:01:27.180> sorts<00:01:27.570> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
fiberglass carbon fiber all sorts of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.649 
fiberglass carbon fiber all sorts of
funky<00:01:27.930> stuff<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.920> basically<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.850> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
funky stuff so basically what we do in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
funky stuff so basically what we do in
this<00:01:30.780> table<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.229> put<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.310> piece<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
this table do put a little piece of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.010 
this table do put a little piece of
two-faced<00:01:33.000> tape<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:33.659> should<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:33.930> been

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
two-faced tape which should have been

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.890 
two-faced tape which should have been
it's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.409> bit<00:01:34.530> bigger<00:01:34.710> than<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.900> take

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it's a little bit bigger than that take

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:51.670 
it's a little bit bigger than that take
a<00:01:36.930> zip<00:01:37.229> tie<00:01:41.360> zip<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:07.640 

another<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:55.580> back<00:01:56.580> side<00:01:58.190> zip<00:01:59.190> it<00:02:06.410> go<00:02:07.410> side

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
another one back side zip it go side

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:22.340 
another one back side zip it go side
cheat<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.890> okay<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.670> found<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.270> motor<00:02:21.350> it's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
cheat so okay I just found a motor it's

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.560 
cheat so okay I just found a motor it's
been<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.740> stick<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.250> move<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.580> now<00:02:24.360> good

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
been the stick and I move it now good

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.880 
been the stick and I move it now good
thing<00:02:24.750> about<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:25.740> hit

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
thing about this is if you really hit

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.010 
thing about this is if you really hit
hard<00:02:26.120> it'll<00:02:27.120> usually<00:02:27.950> snap<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.690> come<00:02:30.870> off

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
hard it'll usually snap and come off

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.750 
hard it'll usually snap and come off
instead<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.470> busting<00:02:31.770> your<00:02:31.860> plate<00:02:32.130> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
instead of busting your plate and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.590 
instead of busting your plate and
busting<00:02:33.060> everything<00:02:33.300> else<00:02:33.450> damage<00:02:34.260> up<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
busting everything else damage up so it

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.930 
busting everything else damage up so it
snaps<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.080> comes<00:02:37.290> loose<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:38.400> doesn't<00:02:38.760> damage

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
snaps it comes loose it doesn't damage

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.530 
snaps it comes loose it doesn't damage
the<00:02:39.420> motor<00:02:40.140> doesn't<00:02:40.440> damage<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.890> shaft<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the motor doesn't damage the shaft and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.360 
the motor doesn't damage the shaft and
all<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.140> also<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.680> dampening<00:02:44.130> here

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
all that and also the dampening here

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.640 
all that and also the dampening here
with<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.580> wood<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.990> with<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.170> film<00:02:46.410> here

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
with the wood on and with the film here

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.330 
with the wood on and with the film here
gives<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.280> really<00:02:47.310> smooth<00:02:47.790> video

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
gives you a really really smooth video

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.310 
gives you a really really smooth video
as<00:02:50.340> far<00:02:50.550> as<00:02:50.640> catching<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> servo<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.720> back

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
as far as catching the servo in the back

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.580

basically<00:05:01.760> come<00:05:02.000> in<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.600> it's<00:05:03.080> gonna

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
basically come in and it's gonna

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.920 
basically come in and it's gonna
collapse<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.250> arm<00:05:04.400> back<00:05:04.640> sorry<00:05:05.600> about<00:05:05.720> that

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
collapse the arm back sorry about that

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.040 
collapse the arm back sorry about that
claps<00:05:06.530> arm<00:05:06.740> back<00:05:07.180> and<00:05:08.180> usually<00:05:08.510> does<00:05:08.690> not

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
claps arm back and usually does not

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.140 
claps arm back and usually does not
break<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:10.040> arm<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.370> can<00:05:10.690> but<00:05:12.580> it's<00:05:13.580> unusual

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
break the arm it can but it's unusual

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.760 
break the arm it can but it's unusual
then<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.390> other<00:05:14.570> thing<00:05:14.780> is<00:05:14.810> you<00:05:15.560> can

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770

sometimes break an arm when you're uh
when<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.700> smack<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.710> back<00:05:21.710> here's<00:05:22.070> here's

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
when you smack the back here's here's

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.930 
when you smack the back here's here's
the<00:05:23.230> start<00:05:24.230> with<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.380> broken<00:05:24.680> prop<00:05:24.890> let<00:05:25.700> friend

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
the start with a broken prop let friend

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.910 
the start with a broken prop let friend
of<00:05:26.000> mine<00:05:26.120> fly<00:05:26.330> this<00:05:26.510> but<00:05:27.170> here's<00:05:27.350> the<00:05:27.470> setup<00:05:27.800> on

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
of mine fly this but here's the setup on

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.940 
of mine fly this but here's the setup on
the<00:05:28.010> back<00:05:28.190> hinge<00:05:29.350> this<00:05:30.350> one's<00:05:30.560> probably<00:05:30.710> got

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
the back hinge this one's probably got

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.530 
the back hinge this one's probably got
about<00:05:31.010> twenty<00:05:31.430> hours<00:05:31.730> on<00:05:31.940> it<00:05:32.090> so<00:05:32.240> it's<00:05:32.360> got<00:05:32.510> a

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
about twenty hours on it so it's got a

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.590 
about twenty hours on it so it's got a
little<00:05:32.780> bit<00:05:33.190> of<00:05:34.190> play<00:05:34.520> but<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:34.940> can<00:05:35.300> be<00:05:35.390> fixed

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
little bit of play but that can be fixed

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.870 
little bit of play but that can be fixed
by<00:05:35.780> putting<00:05:36.050> another<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:37.310> actually<00:05:37.400> tighten

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
by putting another and actually tighten

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.220 
by putting another and actually tighten

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
way unless that's actually the servo if

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.430 
way unless that's actually the servo if
I'm<00:05:42.410> looking<00:05:42.530> at<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:42.800> right<00:05:44.110> servos<00:05:45.110> actually

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440

move it's not really the play on on the

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.850 
move it's not really the play on on the
actual<00:05:48.100> pivot<00:05:49.100> point<00:05:49.460> back<00:05:49.670> here<00:05:49.960> so<00:05:50.960> cool

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
actual pivot point back here so cool

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.230

this frame has been through a lot of
crashes<00:05:59.930> and<00:06:00.740> then<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.250> other<00:06:01.370> nice<00:06:01.580> thing<00:06:01.610> is

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
crashes and then the other nice thing is

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.600 
crashes and then the other nice thing is
you<00:06:02.060> can<00:06:02.150> make<00:06:02.450> your<00:06:02.720> own<00:06:02.960> foam<00:06:03.590> cover<00:06:04.160> to<00:06:04.490> go

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
you can make your own foam cover to go

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.560 
you can make your own foam cover to go
over<00:06:05.410> that<00:06:06.410> if<00:06:06.620> I<00:06:06.740> could<00:06:06.920> find<00:06:07.070> some<00:06:07.370> EPP<00:06:07.910> I'm

over that if I could find some EPP I'm

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.740 
over that if I could find some EPP I'm
making<00:06:08.930> myself<00:06:09.080> but<00:06:09.790> I<00:06:10.790> couldn't<00:06:11.480> find<00:06:11.600> the

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
making myself but I couldn't find the

making myself but I couldn't find the
easy<00:06:11.900> teams<00:06:12.230> recently<00:06:12.950> so<00:06:13.160> I<00:06:13.190> had<00:06:13.490> a<00:06:13.520> pool

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
it's not really quite as fused but you

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.450 
it's not really quite as fused but you
know<00:06:20.199> what<00:06:20.349> it<00:06:20.469> functions<00:06:20.979> it's<00:06:21.219> light<00:06:22.110> and

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
know what it functions it's light and

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
and all that type of thing so when you

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.019 
and all that type of thing so when you
do<00:06:30.009> this<00:06:31.919> it's<00:06:32.919> not<00:06:33.069> gonna<00:06:33.400> damage<00:06:33.639> anything

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:34.029 
do this it's not gonna damage anything

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:39.059 
do this it's not gonna damage anything
okay<00:06:35.099> watch<00:06:36.099> it<00:06:36.129> happen<00:06:36.520> either<00:06:36.729> way<00:06:38.069> so

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
okay watch it happen either way so

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.830 
okay watch it happen either way so
that's<00:06:39.129> about<00:06:39.310> it<00:06:39.460> when<00:06:40.090> I<00:06:40.120> mount<00:06:40.360> a<00:06:40.449> camera<00:06:40.689> on

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
that's about it when I mount a camera on

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.040 
that's about it when I mount a camera on
the<00:06:40.930> front<00:06:40.960> I<00:06:42.120> mounted<00:06:43.120> up<00:06:43.210> here<00:06:43.569> I<00:06:43.749> put<00:06:43.990> the

the front I mounted up here I put the

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.480 
the front I mounted up here I put the
battery<00:06:44.379> on<00:06:44.469> back<00:06:44.680> I<00:06:44.919> think<00:06:44.979> I<00:06:45.129> said<00:06:45.279> that<00:06:45.310> in

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
battery on back I think I said that in

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.189 
battery on back I think I said that in
the<00:06:45.520> video<00:06:45.789> earlier<00:06:45.819> works<00:06:46.330> great<00:06:46.719> the<00:06:46.749> videos

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 
the video earlier works great the videos

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.119 
the video earlier works great the videos
are<00:06:47.349> very<00:06:47.710> very<00:06:47.949> smooth<00:06:49.409> no<00:06:50.409> vibration<00:06:51.009> at

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.129 
are very very smooth no vibration at

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.730 
are very very smooth no vibration at
least<00:06:51.310> at<00:06:51.430> 7:20<00:06:52.270> I<00:06:52.449> don't<00:06:53.080> do<00:06:53.139> a<00:06:53.169> lot<00:06:53.229> of<00:06:53.349> 1080

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
least at 7:20 I don't do a lot of 1080

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.519 
least at 7:20 I don't do a lot of 1080
by<00:06:53.770> a<00:06:53.889> video<00:06:54.849> you<00:06:55.779> can<00:06:55.839> mount<00:06:56.110> your<00:06:56.169> receiver

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:56.529 
by a video you can mount your receiver

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:58.290 
by a video you can mount your receiver
anywhere<00:06:56.800> you<00:06:56.889> want<00:06:57.129> and<00:06:57.849> it<00:06:57.969> doesn't<00:06:58.210> really
