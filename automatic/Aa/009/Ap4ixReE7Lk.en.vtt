 NATO command in Afghanistan for 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.600
 the event cause is banal about it he 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.540
 stated at the hearing information 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.359
 punished hall 4 m 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.839

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:18.829
 american dermatologists 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.269
 plastic surgeons hit the folk 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.390
 medicine yes 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.269
 they offer forgotten drops 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.619
 ashy creams instead doctors 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.900
 recommend to their patients 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.750
 unconventional treatments 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.169
 for example on burn beds 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.120
 advise compresses with milk 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.699
 how it will affect the effectiveness 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.390
 filmed 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.440
 to the most useful connections with arrest and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.510
 wear 0 in March decreased by 2 nd 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.130
 a minute 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.680
 well and able to handle 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 stressed that these drinks and break 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.040
 the course of the incident FSB operatives in 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.500
 team favor is just interesting and secondly 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.640
 can use of them candidates in 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.420
 State Duma can be but probably not needed 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.880
 correctly end up products all 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.979
 still better how you can find the strength they want and 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.179
 and unstable need they eat then 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:06.670
 the problem of overweight and wonder the most 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.530
 but by the way the list of causes of obesity 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.670
 There is a new line of American 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.209
 Chinese scientists called food 

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.149
 monosodium glutamate additive one of 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.300
 the main culprits of accuracy 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.320
 is it really terrible glutamate found out our 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.650
 correspondent Andrei Alekseenko 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.830
 here and modern stores 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.050
 oligarchic laboratories 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.980
 there is a whole list on each product 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.400
 intricate substances use such 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.650
 they are very much like a gift 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.030
 in the group information is impossible 3 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 results grace is very difficult 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.000
 all because even familiar to us 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.870
 products pretty much stuffed 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.280
 various preservatives and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.600
 flavor enhancers 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.250
 some of them performs quite 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.180
 unusual functions take at least 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.439
 monosodium glutamate on packs of gray 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.990
 still mean like 121 more at the beginning of the century 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.670
 the Japanese learned to cook it from 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.299
 fermented fish products or loan seemingly 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.840
 it is a colorless and tasteless powder but 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.920
 when adding food behaves quite 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520
 Unusually any food with such an additive 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.289
 seems incredibly tasty 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.840
 manufacturers understood this very quickly and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.209
 become more and more active volt will 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.609
 composition of products 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.919
 by the way most often sales obscenities on cut 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.180
 fans of asian cuisine are sad 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.750
 for example whether Muscovite order such 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.530
 food straight to the house she says and tasty 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470
 and give her neither get fat instead 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.490
 fount did not think when he Oleg 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.199
 lean Asians 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.269
 until just the dates of the french 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.329
 you know it does not know for what reason 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.129
 Chinese woman I did not understand 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.879
 The reasons are so slim and Asians 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.079
 Russian experts simply explain 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.509
 monosodium glutamate alone cannot become 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.939
 cause overweight he only provoke 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.799
 man will continue cancer aesop but 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.309
 overeat low-calorie 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:49.290
 food does not lead to more than problems 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.169
 weight and then a completely different diet 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.359
 this is rice sarybay final score that is 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.289
 there is no 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.069
 so many digestible 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.269
 carbohydrate animal protein 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.519
 it is completely all other it turns out that 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.389
 In this situation, much depends before 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.380
 total calorie foods 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.370
 so fat European food with 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.930
 flavor enhancers will give a completely different 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.079
 effect via the Internet 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.419
 initiators cease to perceive tastes 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.459
 without this item mate sodium 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.289
 and so all other food 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.039
 becomes tasteless 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.199
 we're addictive when rub 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.229
 causes people to want it 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:27.939
 consume more and more 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.429
 the consequences of such meals foresee 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.900
 easy people handed over fat 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.420
 and acquire a whole bunch of diseases from 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.280
 cardiovascular yes diabetes seek 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.120
 guilty in this case already 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.359
 meaningless 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.109
 but if everything was limited only 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.089
 monosodium glutamate virtually all 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:47.829
 food supplement food and 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:48.699
 preservatives dyes 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.189
 stabilizers and 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.439
 there with similar crimes 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.359
 to accept the stipulated 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.239
 these children really 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.530
 government initiative 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.600
 but how dangerous such a task 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.410
 of our 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.690
 No, but this is a trend than it was 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.970
 make up to 3 medical sciences on 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.180
 the scene this moment man 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.950
 Russian Federation time 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.289
 but now we looked 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:10.349
 paper tell how much 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.169
 really dangerous 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.319
 for example 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.939
 president iraq triptych logistics a 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.149
 I absolutely agree with the experts that it is for 

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.649
 let's say art salon oriental cuisine 

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.899
 low calorie cardio 

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:22.620
 principle 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.150
 interest dishes flight Kiev 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.020
 let's say shrimp indian fresh fish 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.159
 distinctly 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:31.830
 but then it's pretty harmless 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.660
 and also on the flank of the defense of Russia 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.150
 Austrian and this will be dangerous because this 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.590
 can increase appetite provoke tea 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.430
 check agapov but we still buy taxes 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.059
 this too 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:47.039
 in the packaging beautifully fresh in the capital 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.749
 fragrant 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.799
 in the composition that sustainable avoid 

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:52.849
 story with students 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.580
 which means everything goes 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.899
 testing and especially nice to say 

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:58.059
 even preservative stabilizers 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:00.009
 deadly 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.129
 percent katcher media industry 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.919
 including 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.080
 it's good that at least our viewers 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.169
 and includes the composition so the food should just 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.909
 pay attention to the fact that all the same 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.650
 preferably buy products 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.680
 yet at which with a shorter period 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.599
 storage 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.740
 interest and it is advisable to buy products where 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.509
 written without preservatives and which 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.709
 now goes much greater risk 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:24.840
 unfinished generally represents 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:28.830
 the development of bacteria in food and one is the heels here 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.659
 and if we see the score was 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.219
 but if you imagine that all 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.059
 hunted seemed preservative 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.059
 theater let's say totrov from toxin which 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.830
 develop elemental fungi 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.110
 food replenishment to which is 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.729
 the fact that cues is covered on bread there 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.300
 Slovenia home but here I am the hostess 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.639
 same continues to lead the butterfly on this 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.149
 hardest so generous if like this group 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:57.779
 risk we are by no means a preservative 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.809
 down on the wait for the topic 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:02.809
 sellers man works pregnant 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.090
 but just within the station 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.490
 I just had a baby and I love breasts 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.250
 baby and eat if you look carefully 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.560
 internally packaging and I'm avoiding the future 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.060
 must reserves all regions of dyes 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.020
 all kinds 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.110
 a preservative a few years ago 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.620
 on the TV screen allowed to save for sugar 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.120
 change and now and vice versa when 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.360
 impact that this is not the only thing 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.230
 you say 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.150
 And the part is not of course, but this is correct because 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.710
 what are chemical 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.289
 substances that we tell replace 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.800
 percent sugar they are much more dangerous than 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.960
 fact itself but again we are speaking as leader 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.889
 risk groups 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:42.949
 most often all the same it does not mean 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.039
 who are you selling his chair which 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.409
 what is left is tolerance to 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.590
 glucose i.e. theater sugar on top 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.639
 border of norm 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.840
 or has a price for overweight 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.539
 obesity is a lot of extra kilos and here 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.650
 this mentality kilos they 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.800
 much more harmful to health than here 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.289
 these sweetener tablets 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.409
 now their drugs have appeared 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:03.919
 natural herb 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.680
 and which 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.199
 prices on the website rfpl years yes relatives she gave 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.780
 contains two candidates in a thousand 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.400
 times sweeter than sugar after and this place 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.880
 rhythm so here children are naturally south 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.889
 is it a natural drugs though 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.339
 composition of food additives 

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.050
 sold in pharmacies 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.430
 i do a lot of things 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.930
 all kinds of products him 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.400
 Maletskaya married think seek precisely 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.259
 our organism is fit for everything 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:31.819
 own weight Anton too 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:33.750
 opportunists pounce on everyone 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.940
 these inscriptions on the packaging but what we 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.339
 with you and said that he is still 

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:39.780
 much more dangerous 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.510
 exactly give arska page to bacteria and
