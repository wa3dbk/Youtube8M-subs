I<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:15.470> think<00:02:15.820> BAM<00:02:16.820> in<00:02:17.030> my<00:02:17.180> head<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.630> correct

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
I just think BAM in my head the correct

I just think BAM in my head the correct
timing<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.350> needed<00:02:18.710> but<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.520> realized<00:02:20.030> now<00:02:20.350> it

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
timing I needed but I realized now it

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.830

starts<00:02:21.710> early<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.280> man<00:02:22.670> kiyah<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
starts early a man kiyah for the

starts early a man kiyah for the
sixteenth<00:02:24.290> stream<00:02:24.680> those<00:02:25.490> quarters<00:02:25.940> are<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
sixteenth stream those quarters are so

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.060 
sixteenth stream those quarters are so
so<00:02:27.950> off<00:02:28.220> at<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.120> part<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:30.050> two<00:02:30.290> notes<00:02:30.680> after

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
so off at that part the two notes after

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.750 
so off at that part the two notes after
the<00:02:31.220> 16th<00:02:32.080> after<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.070> gets<00:02:34.430> even

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the 16th after that it just it gets even

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.240 
the 16th after that it just it gets even
more<00:02:34.790> up<00:02:35.120> sync<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:36.380> floats<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.710> little<00:02:36.740> bit

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
more up sync it floats a little bit

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.050 
more up sync it floats a little bit
farther<00:02:37.490> down<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.660> very<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.730> chart<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.850> try<00:02:41.030> a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
farther down so very a chart to try a

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.100 
farther down so very a chart to try a
triple-a<00:02:41.540> it's<00:02:42.230> very<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:44.150> difficult<00:02:44.870> but

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
triple-a it's very it's difficult but

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.480 
triple-a it's very it's difficult but
it's<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.530> really<00:02:45.770> straightforward<00:02:46.010> chart

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
it's a really straightforward chart

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.000 
it's a really straightforward chart
otherwise<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.510> don't<00:02:48.200> know<00:02:48.350> if<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.530> guys<00:02:48.770> can

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
otherwise I don't know if you guys can

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.770 
otherwise I don't know if you guys can
really<00:02:49.160> get<00:02:49.370> my<00:02:49.460> drift<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.300> hard

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
really get my drift on that it's hard

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.590 
really get my drift on that it's hard
because<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:52.340> off<00:02:52.490> sync<00:02:52.760> issues<00:02:53.090> by<00:02:53.270> our

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
because the the off sync issues by our

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.900 
because the the off sync issues by our
than<00:02:53.780> add<00:02:53.930> straight<00:02:54.200> forward<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:55.310> that's<00:02:55.670> a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
than add straight forward so that's a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.880 
than add straight forward so that's a
triple-a<00:02:56.390> number<00:02:57.070> 1056<00:02:58.070> for<00:02:58.280> me<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.970> t<00:02:59.150> love

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
triple-a number 1056 for me to t love

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.770
