old-world spot that is still really
really<00:00:14.940> good<00:00:15.120> for<00:00:15.270> making<00:00:15.389> gold<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.500> we're

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
really good for making gold so we're

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.850 
really good for making gold so we're
here<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:16.860> tears<00:00:17.130> hand<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.680> NPC's<00:00:19.680> of

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
here at tears hand and the NPC's of

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.360 
here at tears hand and the NPC's of
interest<00:00:20.280> are<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.520> scarlet<00:00:21.270> arcs<00:00:21.510> pages<00:00:21.870> and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
interest are the scarlet arcs pages and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.980 
interest are the scarlet arcs pages and
what<00:00:23.370> we're<00:00:23.910> looking<00:00:24.270> for<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.780> drop

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
what we're looking for them to drop

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.550 
what we're looking for them to drop
specifically<00:00:25.860> is<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:27.020> enchanting<00:00:28.020> formula

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
specifically is the enchanting formula

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.550 
specifically is the enchanting formula
for<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.950> Crusader<00:00:29.370> weapon<00:00:29.820> enchant<00:00:30.560> even

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
for the Crusader weapon enchant even

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.080 
for the Crusader weapon enchant even
though<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.770> is<00:00:31.920> an<00:00:32.040> old-world<00:00:32.340> enchant<00:00:32.910> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
though this is an old-world enchant it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.479 
though this is an old-world enchant it
still<00:00:33.329> has<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.780> lot<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.020> usability<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:35.040> twinks

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
still has a lot of usability for twinks

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.069 
still has a lot of usability for twinks
or<00:00:35.640> people<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.210> lower<00:00:36.360> level<00:00:36.660> characters

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
or people with lower level characters

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.160 
or people with lower level characters
battleground<00:00:37.710> stuff<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.429> and<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
battleground stuff like that and so the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.560 
battleground stuff like that and so the
pattern<00:00:40.769> or<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.280> formula<00:00:41.789> still<00:00:42.059> goes<00:00:42.269> for

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
pattern or the formula still goes for

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
pattern or the formula still goes for
like<00:00:42.719> three<00:00:43.050> four<00:00:43.079> hundred<00:00:43.739> gold<00:00:43.980> most<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
like three four hundred gold most of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.759 
like three four hundred gold most of
time<00:00:44.870> I've<00:00:45.870> checked<00:00:46.170> around<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> few

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
time I've checked around on a few

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.020 
time I've checked around on a few
servers<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.429> can't<00:00:47.609> find<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.940> for

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
servers you really can't find it for

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.059 
servers you really can't find it for
less<00:00:48.089> than<00:00:48.300> about<00:00:48.480> 200<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> goes<00:00:49.620> upwards

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
less than about 200 and it goes upwards

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.020 
less than about 200 and it goes upwards
sometimes<00:00:50.519> at<00:00:50.699> 800<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.690> depends<00:00:53.030> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
sometimes at 800 really depends so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.639 
sometimes at 800 really depends so

8%<00:01:18.840> health<00:01:19.490> scrub<00:01:20.539> anyway<00:01:21.539> so<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.700> path<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
8% health scrub anyway so the path the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.609 
8% health scrub anyway so the path the
formula<00:01:24.450> has<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> pretty<00:01:24.899> good<00:01:25.049> drop<00:01:25.259> rate<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
formula has a pretty good drop rate you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.139 
formula has a pretty good drop rate you
can<00:01:25.740> expect<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.579> probably<00:01:26.969> about

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
can expect to get one probably about

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.050 
can expect to get one probably about
every<00:01:27.360> hour<00:01:28.189> Here<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.219> am<00:01:29.310> four<00:01:29.579> minutes<00:01:29.880> into

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
every hour Here I am four minutes into

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.870 
every hour Here I am four minutes into
my<00:01:30.180> video<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.750> get<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.610> maybe<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.759> was

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
my video and I get one maybe it was

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.849 
my video and I get one maybe it was
because<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.210> dominated<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> DK<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.439> hard<00:01:34.680> I'm

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
because I dominated the DK so hard I'm

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.849 
because I dominated the DK so hard I'm
not<00:01:34.950> sure<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.200> rare<00:01:37.590> ever

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
not sure but it's not all that rare ever

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.440 
not sure but it's not all that rare ever
drop<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> reason<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.850> expensive<00:01:39.180> is

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
drop the reason it's so expensive is

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
drop the reason it's so expensive is
because<00:01:39.479> there's<00:01:40.170> no<00:01:40.469> one<00:01:40.649> here<00:01:40.920> leveling

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
because there's no one here leveling

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.149 
because there's no one here leveling
anymore<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.930> there's<00:01:43.109> not<00:01:43.259> many<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.920> them

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
anymore and so there's not many of them

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.660 
anymore and so there's not many of them
they<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.460> dropped<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.229> subsequently<00:01:46.229> sold

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
they get dropped and subsequently sold

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
they get dropped and subsequently sold
this<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.850> also<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.479> great<00:01:48.689> place

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this is also a really great place

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
this is also a really great place
because<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.560> has<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.740> fantastic<00:01:50.280> drop<00:01:50.850> rate<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
because it has a fantastic drop rate of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.399 
because it has a fantastic drop rate of
just<00:01:51.479> coins<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.259> rune<00:01:52.469> cloth<00:01:52.740> grays<00:01:53.729> greens
