00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.740
 we are sitting here shortly after the 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.750
 book presentation 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.830
 there is the new book by helmut schulte 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.960
 helmut before we talk about your book though 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.820
 has now been released a bit 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.100
 chat 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.080
 Nevertheless, the question has a few days ago 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
 rapidly lost in Carinthia 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 much has already been written about it 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.840
 much was talked about 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.060
 I would now also offer to be 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.740
 a sports director on this topic 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.900
 running camera for the rapid fans 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.940
 Express what they are doing here 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.850
 after the game against wolfsburg 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.250
 I believe that we all are all for 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 are rapid and the rapid in the heart 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.219
 that they all very disappointed 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.829
 of course for the third time against 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.140
 wolfsburg lost what i heard 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 and then we had the game in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.610
 the right direction and the right direction 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.920
 supporting the audience of ours 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.660
 spectators in wolfsberg was also from the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.820
 first to the last minute I have to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.260
 say exemplary, unfortunately we have that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.329
 not done that in the square 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.809
 To implement are with a very good 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.610
 starting position did not do justice 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.810
 We have to take you out of hand 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 and then we do not have the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.130
 Proper means found around this game 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.170
 I think there was one too 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.210
 small blockade in the minds of the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 but players have tried everything 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.580
 have used the wrong means 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.799
 chosen wrong way and therefore stood 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.780
 At the end of this result with the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.280
 outnumbered and the missed eleven meters 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.079
 which of course makes us very disappointed 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 then you just have to say only the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.530
 disappointment the frustration must be in 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.979
 positive energy to be transformed where 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 is this 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.090
 Sometimes there are defeats 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.500
 can not imagine and the man 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.899
 also do not want to have but you have to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.820
 the right tour and I think 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.470
 our trainers and I know that because 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.509
 I was on the way with the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.750
 enter the team 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.750
 that these results of the past 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.030
 belong what is the right thing to do 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.860
 after such a defeat for now 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.469
 in a home game against mattersburg 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.440
 a week later against admira here full 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.330
 to score points 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.280
 full concentration on the next game 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.290
 full concentration every player on 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.630
 his task he has to fulfill there 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.430
 and self-confidence, yes, he needs 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.980
 you do not put people under pressure 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.630
 but because you have to trust them that 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.040
 Give and you must trust with 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.660
 go into the square that you the opponent 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.250
 beat the next opponent and it 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.320
 is worked through in the training 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.540
 certain types of training as well 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.430
 through conversations we have made 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.860
 Peter in front of the team I with the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.840
 one or the other and in the end the must 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.620
 team or are the players then 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.440
 accumulate 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.790
 which must then be supported and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.420
 to win the next game altogether 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.720
 easy 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.840
 and only if we stick together 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.150
 We can handle this quite difficult phase 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.240
 to survive 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.430
 I have today at the book presentation 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.830
 in the beginning we want to do today 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.050
 do not celebrate the book big there is 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.120
 a presentation and it should not be that 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.680
 we want to make an impression 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.510
 Distracting difficult time 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.750
 we do not want to do that now 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.360
 the book has been created well before 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.040
 time still as sports director with us 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.770
 why is this book? 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.050
 given 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.420
 my longtime friend and journalist 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.830
 and writer werner langmaack has 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.360
 asked me if I did not want to 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.670
 just the whole st pauli stories 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.340
 to tell these three episodes and 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.510
 At some point I am there I have 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.980
 let me spread it we said 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.320
 okay let's do that and we have 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.880
 met us once a week and me 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.620
 I had told in a matter in one 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.650
 manuscript and I had that 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.350
 feeling okay i can out of my life 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.200
 and tell in the life of the fc st pauli 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.060
 the interesting things if you have one 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.739
 wrote book is maybe 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.209
 not the worst either and if I am 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.500
 now the book so i have to each other 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.110
 say good the work was worth it 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.850
 has been working for a whole year, we 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.459
 have produced that themselves so 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.650
 let print layout let everything 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.239
 we have made ourselves we only have 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.850
 the workshop was taken to the publisher 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.470
 to organize the sales and it 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.959
 is just then also a great feeling 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.489
 And I hope that's fun this book 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.660
 should make fun should make fun 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.850
 read but also make fun 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.440
 are to be looked at 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.850
 nice pictures in it from a photographer 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.190
 the know also long been the 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.380
 has taken many pictures in his pauli 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.320
 and i hope that by reading one 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.580
 not always it will be a big one 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.850
 challenge but we have ourselves 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.680
 put and let's see so I have 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.840
 no conscientiousness and my 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.570
 beings or my ideas or mine 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.020
 Thoughts should recover the world, but me 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:42.670
 think the fc st pauli is in the last 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.620
 25 30 years what has become what many 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.420
 what is special there is no 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.630
 special club did a special one 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.160
 appearance special culture and allowed 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.980
 I witness in three different ways 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.240
 sections and functions and that have 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.420
 I thought maybe for one 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.100
 or other could be interesting 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.590
 now there is the headline outside 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.440
 Price a few lives inside one 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.620
 more under headline if you want that 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.480
 so called 3 st pauli live 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.350
 results experiences a 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.160
 dot supplier which means one thing 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.650
 points supplier 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.020
 if I'm a player or coach 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.750
 manager sports director then works 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.990
 I'm expected by me points 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.160
 So deliver points and a 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.220
 points supplier 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.750
 there is two meaning if you 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.130
 that looks right so you deliver 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.660
 points for your own club sometimes 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.400
 You can also deliver points 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.020
 points for the opposing club and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.850
 I have so much fun with this pun 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.920
 and as a long bank that 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.240
 suggested as a study that 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.510
 is not a working title that is the 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.580
 subtitle I say thank you more 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.740

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.280
 book is available in exactly one week 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.540
