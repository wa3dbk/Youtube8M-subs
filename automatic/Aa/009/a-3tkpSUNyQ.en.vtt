00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.570
 Welcome to our guide to 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.939
 success with him he is it that is called it 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.760
 is also without tears and on the spot 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.099
 maybe to info we will be in this 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.869
 Just ask the boss for the video 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 the success is relevant that means we 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.949
 will not show the whole boss fight 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.890
 will say in this success as always 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:39.160
 only what you know for success 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.750
 If so it must be in which 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.129
 special features are where he gets the tactics 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.710
 maybe change the bus is say 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.350
 Of course we still have it 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.780
 Generally it's just about the jobs 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.469
 where you have to make the success and how 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.430
 you make the success with ms it is 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.789
 pretty easy 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.850
 He plays the boss in the basics 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.530
 Otherwise you just have to go to the 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.009
 between live where the boss is down 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.890
 and note these blogs com what is there 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.190
 would have to be within the box fight 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.490
 10 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.340
 of these clubs stop them 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.740
 not in the bus run in the can 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.630
 you stop then freeze for 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.190
 example with this eternal winter from the dk 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.860
 Just look that they are not in 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.170
 get in the bus sometime at the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.090
 time the bus comes up and then 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.429
 These blogs and social change 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:40.119
 he then turns around so small elementary 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:44.289
 We would recommend this twice 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.599
 So make 5 and 5 that more enjoyable 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.509
 We once got around the bus and 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:52.179
 set up marx then you look where 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.250
 just most of these black ones 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.509
 clubs when it comes to the black clubs 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.130
 not the blue ones all that 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.750
 important 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.190
 because then you look at which 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.630
 Market the most of this black 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.240
 then he says modestly then run 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.259
 then all is gone then they are not watching 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.180
 that they do not run when the middle and 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.180
 then the thing should have been eaten 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:20.660
 it just suits you yes if I'm in the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.580
 Android theme comes with the boss so you 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.170
 Still have to be the best healer 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.370
 maybe the flight search stops then 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.950
 a little bit of the energy 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.880
 goes down 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.980
 otherwise it is actually relatively easy 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.890
 the success is now done in flex 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.870
 simply because it's essential 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.610
 is easier because normally we have a 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.140
 we would give you a little more leeway 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.000
 So also recommend that in flex too 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.440
 do 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 otherwise it would be for this success 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.250
 has, as I said we had always a 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.360
 a bit short 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.680
 you really only need those 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.230
 key information for one 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.459
 success and me the whole boss fight 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.020
 Feel free to feedback in the comments we 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.680
 See us at the next criminal 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.680
 wanted to go in
