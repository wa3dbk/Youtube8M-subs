self-tanner and stuff doesn't really

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:24.920

stick too well

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.849 
stick too well
so<00:00:25.710> let's<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.539> some<00:00:27.960> little

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
so let's see I do have some little

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.519 
so let's see I do have some little
blemishes<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.900> let's<00:00:31.109> see<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
blemishes going on so let's see what it

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.880 
blemishes going on so let's see what it
covers

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.190 

so<00:00:34.890> far<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.329> nice<00:00:36.510> match<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.140> do

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
so far it's a really nice match I do

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.110 
so far it's a really nice match I do
like<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.770> color<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> again<00:00:38.489> medium<00:00:38.879> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
like this color this is again medium so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
like this color this is again medium so
if<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.989> usually<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> medium<00:00:41.040> skin

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
if you are usually like a medium skin

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340 
if you are usually like a medium skin
tone<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:42.210> probably<00:00:42.690> want<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> go<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
tone you probably want to go for a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.040 
tone you probably want to go for a
darker<00:00:43.739> shade<00:00:44.180> because<00:00:45.180> obviously<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:45.840> not

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it did a very very good job in my in my

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
it did a very very good job in my in my
mind<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.320> covering<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.220> thought<00:01:38.430> CC<00:01:38.759> creams

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
mind of covering I thought CC creams

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.569 
mind of covering I thought CC creams
were<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> lot<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.540> sheer<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.400> is

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
were a lot more sheer so this is

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.340 
were a lot more sheer so this is
definitely<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.860> full<00:01:43.860> coverage<00:01:44.100> CC<00:01:44.670> cream

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
definitely like a full coverage CC cream

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.270 
definitely like a full coverage CC cream
covers<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.619> better<00:01:46.829> than<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> lot<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
covers up a lot better than a lot of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.030 
covers up a lot better than a lot of

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.770 
outside a lot especially like in the
summertime<00:01:58.850> for<00:01:59.850> me<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.240> spring<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.719> fall

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
summertime for me the spring and fall

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.389 
summertime for me the spring and fall
seems<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.590> am<00:02:01.710> outside<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> most

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
seems to be when I am outside the most

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.870 
seems to be when I am outside the most
because<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.719> hot<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:05.729> I'm

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
because it's not as hot so you know I'm

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.020 
because it's not as hot so you know I'm
out<00:02:06.030> taking<00:02:06.210> walks<00:02:06.659> or<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> park

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
out taking walks or going with the park

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.320 
out taking walks or going with the park
so

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
so

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.570 
so
I'll<00:02:09.479> say<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> little<00:02:09.810> bit<00:02:10.140> more<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.770> cooler

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I'll say a little bit more in the cooler

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.900 
I'll say a little bit more in the cooler
months<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.000> could<00:02:12.090> still<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.720> sunburned

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
months but you could still get sunburned

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.590 
months but you could still get sunburned
even<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.300> it's<00:02:15.540> cloudy<00:02:16.020> out<00:02:16.320> because<00:02:16.770> still

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
even if it's cloudy out because still

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.440 
even if it's cloudy out because still
that<00:02:18.600> sun<00:02:18.810> exposure<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.270> does

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
that sun exposure so I like that it does

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.750 
that sun exposure so I like that it does
had<00:02:21.630> SPF<00:02:21.990> 50<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.620> educational<00:02:23.220> moisturizers

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
had SPF 50 and educational moisturizers

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.620 
had SPF 50 and educational moisturizers
don't<00:02:24.120> already<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.630> SPF<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.090> one

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
don't already have SPF so that is one

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.010 
don't already have SPF so that is one
layer<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.200> think<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> covered<00:02:29.100> amazingly<00:02:30.020> and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
layer I think it covered amazingly and

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.320 
layer I think it covered amazingly and
it<00:02:31.140> blends<00:02:31.440> really<00:02:31.890> really<00:02:32.100> nice<00:02:32.280> with<00:02:32.580> my<00:02:32.850> you

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
it blends really really nice with my you

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.320 
it blends really really nice with my you
know<00:02:33.450> neck<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.250> with<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.400> self-tanner<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.300> I

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
know neck and with my self-tanner so I

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.730 
know neck and with my self-tanner so I
really<00:02:36.870> really<00:02:36.960> like<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.410> color<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.710> think

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
really really like this color I think

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.620 
really really like this color I think
even<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.520> little<00:02:38.670> bit<00:02:38.910> fairer<00:02:39.210> as<00:02:39.420> far

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
even if I was a little bit fairer as far

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.690 
even if I was a little bit fairer as far
as<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.900> my<00:02:40.020> self<00:02:40.290> tanner<00:02:40.530> because<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.550> haven't

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
as like my self tanner because I haven't

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.760 
as like my self tanner because I haven't
done<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.030> about<00:02:42.270> three<00:02:42.570> days<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.170> think

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
done it for about three days I think

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.140 
done it for about three days I think
medium<00:02:44.100> would<00:02:44.220> still<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> good<00:02:44.820> shape<00:02:45.120> so

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
medium would still be a good shape so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.850 
medium would still be a good shape so
that<00:02:45.330> does<00:02:45.960> tell<00:02:46.200> me<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.440> they're<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
that does tell me that they're the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.680 
that does tell me that they're the
lighter<00:02:47.040> shades<00:02:47.430> obviously<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.420> cater<00:02:48.570> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
lighter shades obviously will cater to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:10.270 
lighter shades obviously will cater to
quite<00:02:49.050> fair<00:02:49.790> skin<00:02:50.790> which<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.060> nice<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:01.500> moved

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.920 

okay<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:11.940> has<00:03:12.060> had<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> few

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
okay so now that it has had a few

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.810 
okay so now that it has had a few

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
feels like skin it's not sticky or tacky

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.440 
feels like skin it's not sticky or tacky

it's not really broken down or anything

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.199 
it's not really broken down or anything
really<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.709> even<00:03:50.010> oily<00:03:50.519> just<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.850> little<00:03:51.060> bit

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
really not even oily just a little bit

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.970 
really not even oily just a little bit
of<00:03:51.300> doing<00:03:51.600> this<00:03:51.750> here<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.260> think<00:03:52.650> that's<00:03:52.830> some

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
of doing this here I think that's some

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.250 
of doing this here I think that's some
blotting<00:03:53.250> sheets<00:03:53.459> or<00:03:53.670> taking<00:03:54.030> like<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.390> powder

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
blotting sheets or taking like a powder

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.860 
blotting sheets or taking like a powder
brush<00:03:55.560> like<00:03:55.890> this<00:03:56.100> wouldn't<00:03:56.459> do<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:57.420> know<00:03:57.510> so

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
brush like this wouldn't do you know so

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.860 
brush like this wouldn't do you know so
if<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.050> just<00:03:59.209> disturbed<00:04:00.209> here<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.570> don't<00:04:00.660> have

if I just disturbed here I don't have

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.370 
if I just disturbed here I don't have
any<00:04:01.260> additional<00:04:01.410> product<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:02.880> kind<00:04:03.150> of
