00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
thing about this product is it isn't

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.330 
thing about this product is it isn't
technically<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> lip<00:00:31.260> plumper<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.980> more<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
technically a lip plumper it's more of a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.310 
technically a lip plumper it's more of a
lip<00:00:32.460> treatment<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> why<00:00:33.480> that's<00:00:33.660> cool<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
lip treatment and why that's cool is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
lip treatment and why that's cool is
because<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> temporary<00:00:35.520> fix<00:00:35.820> this

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
because it's not a temporary fix this

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.850 
because it's not a temporary fix this
treatment<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:37.050> actually<00:00:37.440> make<00:00:37.559> your<00:00:37.710> lips

get<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.340> bit<00:00:38.430> larger<00:00:38.579> over<00:00:39.120> time<00:00:39.149> I've

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
get a little bit larger over time I've

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180 
get a little bit larger over time I've
using<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> rather<00:00:40.230> than<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.500> lip<00:00:40.680> plumper<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
using it rather than a lip plumper that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.319 
using it rather than a lip plumper that
might<00:00:41.460> only<00:00:41.610> last<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.059> couple<00:00:42.090> hours

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
might only last for a couple hours

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
might only last for a couple hours
basically<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.469> ingredients<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.129> stimulate

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
basically has ingredients that stimulate

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
basically has ingredients that stimulate
natural<00:00:45.030> collagen<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.629> elastin<00:00:46.050> production

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
natural collagen and elastin production

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.229 
natural collagen and elastin production
so<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.160> kind<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.370> tricks<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.789> cells<00:00:48.000> into

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
so it kind of tricks your cells into

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
so it kind of tricks your cells into
thinking<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.570> they're<00:00:48.809> damaged<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
thinking that they're damaged and it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.229 
thinking that they're damaged and it
stimulates<00:00:50.160> new<00:00:50.579> production<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> collagen

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
stimulates new production of collagen

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.450 
stimulates new production of collagen
which<00:00:51.750> causes<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.199> lips<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.559> swell<00:00:52.770> up<00:00:52.920> it's

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
which causes your lips to swell up it's

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.889 
which causes your lips to swell up it's
not<00:00:53.670> dangerous<00:00:53.940> don't<00:00:54.360> worry<00:00:54.629> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
not dangerous don't worry it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.450 
not dangerous don't worry it's
completely<00:00:55.289> pain-free<00:00:55.530> which<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.370> of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
completely pain-free which is kind of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.160 
completely pain-free which is kind of
cool<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.850> most<00:00:57.329> lip<00:00:57.480> plumpers<00:00:57.840> make<00:00:58.050> your

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
cool because most lip plumpers make your

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.080 
cool because most lip plumpers make your
lips<00:00:58.289> tingle<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> sting<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
lips tingle or kind of sting and you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.790 
lips tingle or kind of sting and you
don't<00:01:00.239> even<00:01:00.359> feel<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:01.050> after<00:01:01.680> you've

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
don't even feel this on after you've

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.080 
don't even feel this on after you've
applied<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.250> rest<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.640> makeup<00:01:02.820> you're

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090

applied the rest of your makeup you're
ready<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> move<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.840> lips<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.350> can

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
ready to move on to your lips you can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
ready to move on to your lips you can
wipe<00:01:04.799> off<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> clear<00:01:05.460> treatment<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.090> then

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
wipe off the clear treatment and then

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.420 
wipe off the clear treatment and then
start<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.200> lip<00:01:07.350> liner<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
start in with your lip liner and the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.100 
start in with your lip liner and the
trick<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.760> I've<00:01:08.880> been<00:01:09.060> doing<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.540> i<00:01:09.780> line<00:01:10.080> my

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
trick that I've been doing is i line my

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.840 
trick that I've been doing is i line my
bottom<00:01:10.560> lip<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.189> I'll<00:01:11.310> leave<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
bottom lip but I'll leave out the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.640 
bottom lip but I'll leave out the
corners<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> basically<00:01:12.810> make<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.470> little

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
corners so I basically make it a little

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
corners so I basically make it a little
bit<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.070> full<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.430> overdrawn<00:01:15.060> at<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> very

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
bit more full and overdrawn at the very

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.630 
bit more full and overdrawn at the very
base<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> my<00:01:16.259> lip<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> move<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> my

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
base of my lip and then I move on to my

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
base of my lip and then I move on to my
top<00:01:17.850> lip<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.540> focus<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> Cupid's<00:01:19.470> bow

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
