in a new generation a new avatar and
slightly<00:00:31.500> tweaked<00:00:31.890> looks<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.460> car

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
slightly tweaked looks the car

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.910 
slightly tweaked looks the car
definitely<00:00:33.329> looks<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> Swift<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
definitely looks like the Swift but it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.520 
definitely looks like the Swift but it
has<00:00:35.130> grown<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.360> size<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:37.140> also<00:00:37.200> in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
has grown not just in size but also in

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
has grown not just in size but also in
stature<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.640> drives<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.210> all

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
stature because the way it drives it all

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
stature because the way it drives it all
feels<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.899> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.200> more<00:00:40.379> mature<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.250> do

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
feels a little bit more mature you do

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.010 
feels a little bit more mature you do
have<00:00:41.579> two<00:00:41.790> engine<00:00:42.030> options<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.540> word<00:00:42.809> go

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
have two engine options from word go

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
have two engine options from word go
this<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.890> you've<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.399> DD<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.820> which

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
this time so you've got the DD is which

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.970 
this time so you've got the DD is which
is<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> course<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.809> diesel<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.649> VVT

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
is of course the diesel and the VVT

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
is of course the diesel and the VVT
which<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> new<00:00:47.969> updated<00:00:48.450> 1.2<00:00:49.170> litre

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
which is the new updated 1.2 litre

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.020 
which is the new updated 1.2 litre
petrol<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.309> same<00:00:50.460> diesel<00:00:50.789> engine

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
petrol so it's the same diesel engine

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.279 
petrol so it's the same diesel engine
from<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> old<00:00:51.420> Swift<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.020> they've<00:00:52.140> done

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
from the old Swift but what they've done

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
from the old Swift but what they've done
with<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:53.100> petrol<00:00:53.460> engine<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
with the same petrol engine is that

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.670 
with the same petrol engine is that
they've<00:00:54.149> tweaked<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> added<00:00:55.110> variable<00:00:55.469> valve

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
they've tweaked it added variable valve

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.049 
they've tweaked it added variable valve
timing<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.160> make<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.550> bit<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:56.820> fuel

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
timing to make it a little bit more fuel

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.910 
timing to make it a little bit more fuel
efficient<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.600> they've<00:00:58.320> also<00:00:58.500> gone<00:00:58.739> ahead

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
efficient and they've also gone ahead

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.760 
efficient and they've also gone ahead
and<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.879> course<00:01:00.300> updated<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.199> terms<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and of course updated it in terms of the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.990 
and of course updated it in terms of the
kind<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> power<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.910> little

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
kind of power you get so it's a little

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.539 
kind of power you get so it's a little
bit<00:01:03.090> perkier<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.290> punchy<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.860> makes<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
bit perkier and punchy and makes it a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280 
bit perkier and punchy and makes it a
little<00:01:05.700> bit<00:01:05.850> sporty<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.390> two<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.990> company<00:01:07.260> is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
little bit sporty or two the company is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.750 
little bit sporty or two the company is
also<00:01:07.439> worked<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> suspension<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
also worked on the suspension of this

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.940 
also worked on the suspension of this
car<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.450> that's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.409> thing<00:01:10.619> because

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
car and so that's a good thing because

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
car and so that's a good thing because
it<00:01:11.520> makes<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.030> car<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:12.990> more

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it makes the car a little bit more

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
it makes the car a little bit more
planted<00:01:13.740> doesn't<00:01:14.010> feel<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.250> light<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.640> its

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
planted doesn't feel as light on its

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
planted doesn't feel as light on its
feet<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.570> fact<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.990> bigger<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.259> wider

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
feet the fact that it's bigger and wider

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
feet the fact that it's bigger and wider
also<00:01:16.979> comes<00:01:17.159> through<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> drive<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.210> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
also comes through in the drive which is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
also comes through in the drive which is
a<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:18.509> thing<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.560> part<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> car<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
a good thing to this part of the car the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.010 
a good thing to this part of the car the
wheelbase<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.970> been<00:01:21.119> increased<00:01:21.479> by<00:01:21.570> 40

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
wheelbase has been increased by 40

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.590 
wheelbase has been increased by 40
millimetres<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.460> gives<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.880> 22

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
millimetres and that gives you 22

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
millimetres and that gives you 22
millimetres<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> will<00:01:25.619> extra<00:01:26.460> leg<00:01:26.610> room

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
millimetres if you will extra leg room

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.920 
millimetres if you will extra leg room
in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> back<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.420> always<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> big

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
in the back which was always the big

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.600 
in the back which was always the big
complaint<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.770> Swift<00:01:29.070> isn't<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
complaint with the Swift isn't it so you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.859 
complaint with the Swift isn't it so you
