 esplanade of Rome but in this case 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.840
 Roman flatbed user like 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.000
 you can also use salami 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.500
 mortadella the ham is cooked e 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.820
 raw any kind of sediment then 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.930
 we will need a scandal 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.110
 use this in aluminum that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.560
 we should butter and then instead of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.499
 andrea flour I have already committed will go 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.659
 to put the breadcrumbs 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:17.429
 let's start immediately with the preparation 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:26.499
 then let's add to the potatoes 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:30.249
 the man is the parmesan I remind you that 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:33.459
 not both parmesan and butter which 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:34.060
 of the butter you have to leave me some 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.369
 part 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:42.999
 so that then we will go and put it 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:49.599
 above I am admitted the day was I go to 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:54.819
 also add the mozzarella and goes from 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:58.119
 amalgamate now I'm going to create the 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:01.319
 first layer all the potatoes then 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.319
 I'm going to spend 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.440
 now I'm going to put the potatoes on top 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.930
 I recommend the esplanade slices 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.640
 salon that you go to use must be 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.640
 thinly sliced 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.150
 now it goes from creating another layer of 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.150
 potatoes 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.010
 now I'm going to create another layer with the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.010
