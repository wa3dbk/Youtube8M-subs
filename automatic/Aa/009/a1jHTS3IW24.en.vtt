00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.800
Good morning

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.700
I'm going to show you a farmhouse

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.000
on the outskirts of Mahon

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.600 position:73%
it is a farmhouse which is practically original

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.000 position:69%
and the house is approximately 300 years old

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.000 position:98%
and over the years it has undergone various additions and alterations

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300 position:89%
it retains all of the style and charm of a Menorcan house

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.200 position:97%
and is waiting for other modernisations to bring it up-to-date

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200
Let's go into the property

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.500
and see the surroundings

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.000 position:98%
as I said, the original structure and style have been conserved

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.400 position:73%
and you can see that it is a very special house

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.000 position:94%
the owner of the house is a well-known painter here in Mahon

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.500 position:97%
and the house is full of paintings and other interesting objects

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:10.000 position:97%
as well as maintaining the style and charm that you would hope to find

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.000 position:61%
and a person who appreciates old things

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.600 position:72%
in terms of conservation, the house is perfect

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.500
although it needs painting

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.800
well, let's move on

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.300
there are 6 bedrooms in total

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.600 position:91%
this space is a distribution corridor and also the hallway

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.900
this is an interior sitting room

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500 position:66%
and continuing on, there are two bathrooms

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.300
1 bathroom sorry, and two bedrooms

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.900 position:58%
we are on the north side of the house

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.100 position:67%
in what used to be the stables of the house

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.600 position:77%
and this bedroom, for example, has been converted

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.000 position:67%
the bedroom used to be in its time a stable

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.100
and here we have the old troughs

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.600
and a fireplace has been added

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.800
here we have another bedroom

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.100 position:73%
which is currently being used as a sitting room

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.700 position:80%
it is a house that could be distributed as you like

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.600
and take full advantage of it

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.100 position:77%
as we find the house in almost its original state

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.000
in terms of its distribution

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.700
there are many possibilities

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.300 position:97%
it has lots of charm, and it is very close to Mahon at the same time

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.800 position:81%
and it has land of approximately 2,900 square metres

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.900 position:81%
just enough land, having countryside right next door

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.500 position:70%
also we are close to the main road from Mahon

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.700
down a small country road

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.900
let's go on... to another bedroom

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.700
this has a vaulted ceiling

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.800 position:66%
normally when a house has vaulted ceilings

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.100 position:61%
it means that it has a considerable age

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.400 position:80%
it usually is that vaulted ceilings are post-Arabic

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.300 position:97%
well, the family of the owner have had the house for hundreds of years

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.100 position:61%
and sure enough another vaulted ceiling

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.400 position:91%
which were introduced in the post-Arabic period in Menorca

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.000
another bedroom

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.600 position:69%
and this has a dressing area with a bathroom

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.900 position:98%
let's look at the bathroom, this is en-suite, as we call them today

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.400
this is the bedroom

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.700 position:72%
plus the other where we found the sitting room

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.000 position:98%
as you can see there is also a wood burning stove in this hallway

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.900
and let's carry on and go upstairs

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
let's go to the first floor

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.000
where we find the artist's studio

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.700 position:95%
this could be perfectly converted into two bedrooms, or three

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.600
you won't be able to appreciate it

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.300 position:69%
but there is a lovely smell of oil and paint

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.000 position:89%
and it is a special experience to visit a house like this

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.000 position:70%
at least for those who love paintings and art

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.900 position:89%
let's continue downstairs and we will look at the kitchen

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.700
and the dining room of the house

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.000 position:77%
let's take a look at this door with stained glass

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.400
and this small sitting room

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.800
which leads us to the dining room

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.100
if you look at the paintwork

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.800 position:81%
these old Menorcan houses were painted in those days

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:36.400 position:98%
with one part painted in white and the higher part in a darker colour

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.300 position:80%
this was because the old kitchens used coal or wood

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.100
and these emitted smoke

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.300 position:97%
and the higher parts of the walls were always discoloured by smoke

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.000 position:66%
and so they pained the room in two colours

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.300 position:66%
and from here we can go out to the terrace

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.300
with a small porch and barbecue

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.800 position:63%
as you hear, we are close to the airport

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.000 position:98%
and this could be a drawback because of the noise from the planes

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.800
the barbecue

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:37.800 position:80%
and here what is the access to the house.....my car

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.300
and the house

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.900 position:64%
and old original bread oven, well an oven

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.500 position:64%
it could be used for a hundreds of things

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.400 position:98%
an oven in working order and the original door has been preserved

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.400
and the paddle to work with it

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.600 position:83%
if you have liked the house and want more information

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.300 position:66%
call our telephone number + 34 971 351 530

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.500
and thank you very much

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.600
Until next time
