because I feel there are three things to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
because I feel there are three things to
keep<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> mind<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.050> are<00:00:31.380> really<00:00:31.710> important

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
keep in mind that are really important

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.400

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
to one reselling and to not really

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.470 
to one reselling and to not really
perpetuating<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.250> whole<00:00:35.430> reselling<00:00:36.059> cycle

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
perpetuating this whole reselling cycle

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810 
perpetuating this whole reselling cycle
so<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.590> foremost<00:00:37.920> let's<00:00:38.250> pretend<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
so first and foremost let's pretend that

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.410 
so first and foremost let's pretend that
reselling<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> big<00:00:40.320> old<00:00:40.680> pie<00:00:41.210> right<00:00:42.210> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
reselling is a big old pie right so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.000 
reselling is a big old pie right so
everyone<00:00:42.840> gets<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.440> bit<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.800> piece<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
everyone gets a little bit of piece of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.459 
everyone gets a little bit of piece of
it<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.520> think<00:00:45.450> where<00:00:45.539> people<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.899> wrong<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.379> they

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it I think where people go wrong is they

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.830 
it I think where people go wrong is they
try<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.680> take<00:00:46.920> way<00:00:47.460> too<00:00:47.520> much<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.539> you'll<00:00:48.750> get

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
really think the reselling has to do a

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.250 
really think the reselling has to do a
lot<00:03:44.489> with<00:03:44.550> what<00:03:44.790> people<00:03:45.150> are<00:03:45.540> willing<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.930> pay

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
lot with what people are willing to pay

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.660 
lot with what people are willing to pay
and<00:03:46.590> those<00:03:46.709> are<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> people<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.340> drive<00:03:47.489> the

and those are the people that drive the
market<00:03:48.000> but<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.239> has<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> lot<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.690> do<00:03:49.050> with<00:03:49.230> the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
market but it has a lot to do with the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.500 
market but it has a lot to do with the
cutthroat<00:03:49.620> environment<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.910> not<00:03:51.090> wanting<00:03:51.390> to
