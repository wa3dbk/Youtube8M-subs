00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.170
 moore I am there we are completely committed 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.290
 a new video on my channel people 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.390
 Talk to you about active aggression 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.340
 This game I had my three 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.580
 highlight video have shown a lot 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.039
 she thought that's never heard of 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.100
 this game currently you can see the beta 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.410
 play when activation is presented 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.210
 and yes I imagined it 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.850
 So the beta can play in general 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.739
 say yes he also pre-order that 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.120
 you can also do it later but good then 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.210
 he already play the beta 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.280
 to give the impression of aggression 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.879
 and again loads reason that acts 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.320
 it is a composition strategy game 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.670
 command conquer and co 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.170
 you can always be very great 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.059
 I will also draw comparisons 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.600
 within the videos and that is 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.040
 well a genre which is very little 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.500
 it has become since then 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.059
 Really much choice clear 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.280
 building strategy you still have 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.030
 starcraft that's really that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.979
 big game afterwards but it's clear 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.409
 less and would like to join you now 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.149
 this video in the small first impression 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.359
 from the game I give to me 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.740
 habs now say five so I've got it 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.689
 five minutes was exactly how I played 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.390
 played for five hours now and I am 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.549
 also slowly in it one can say 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.560
 At first I have nothing at first 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.060
 I checked though before I took care of it 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.100
 You played, a bit 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.240
 overwhelmed what they should do then at 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.299
 I found a few minutes 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.960
 used and now for each additional one 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.640
 round leather which becomes faster 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.890
 fixes previous mistakes and improves 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.359
 from time to time in the game has something 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.259
 How do you motivate each other again and again? 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.020
 getting better 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.009
 I have to say I'm playing right now 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.810
 only against ki opponents around me first 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.460
 get used to the game because yes now in 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.140
 multiplayer matches go after the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.920
 beta to be there is right on your mouth 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.689
 to get 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.189
 we can gladly later on the mouth 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.950
 Only then do I want a little bit in the 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.109
 combat mode against ks play with there 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.460
 to look something like that as well as do the 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.590
 the possibly player because of his own 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.539
 find tactics but first come in 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.910
 first learn what bring what 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.230
 upgrades because you have many things 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.269
 which one can apply many units 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.600
 many upgrades and I have to go first 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.210
 Everybody ever know 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.100
 to get used to me then closely one purely 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.380
 and then at some point in the right one 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.000
 to play multiplayer 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.640
 the beta itself, of course, only houses 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.140
 he is a small part of the game away 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.480
 To see in the end would be for example 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.490
 only two out of a total of three 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.650
 Beta fractions available 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.750
 we can only fight like that 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.400
 play multiplayer matches and tore up 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.840
 also sees only one game mode in it 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.310
 makes the impression as if playing 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200
 give several game modes 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.690
 singleplayer is currently not 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.150
 available i just offer a small one 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.620
 impression of the game and works 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.420
 actually very good and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.220
 nice to describe it starts 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.860
 Logically, that I first 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.640
 my basis is construction with different ones 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.470
 buildings 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.540
 Then you start with it 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.310
 of course, refineries build around themselves 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.340
 for example, to get raw materials 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.590
 below it falls aluminum oil and later 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.350
 later also rare earth 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.900
 You can also bank it by 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.880
 they also manned money with soldiers 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.390
 you earn that almost endless 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.370
 sources of money because, for example, oil as 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.880
 also aluminum and rare 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.190
 earth 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.710
 I can tell you that consumed 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.360
 It will be a consumption of raw material 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.070
 and if you break everything down there 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.210
 have the next area around there 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.830
 to break down again 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.050
 This creates a very cool mix 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.490
 In the beginning I was also the raw material 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.000
 a bit confused how do i have that 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.100
 use 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.900
 slowly I am acting well in it 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.210
 use the different factions 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.010
 maybe the raw material more the less 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.560
 the one needs in the commodity team 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.900
 the very cool you have because since the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.880
 find good balance and that it is better 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.860
 as thought at first 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.120
 of course, having its raw materials 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.270
 and also tried to collect 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.340
 More buildings at Baumann builds barracks 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.890
 or vehicle factories and can be next to 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.900
 There his army create the mouse in 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.780
 Madrid has light armor 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.060
 Vehicles he read what is missing are 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.250
 example that the boats gave them 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.230
 not and I think that will also in the 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.609
 Do not give later game but 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.560
 Overall, there was really enough 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.900
 Diversity that you can say you can do that 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.100
 so many different vehicles reached 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.140
 which one has if some of us have 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.000
 Already no one has to be with him 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.100
 which ones willich upgrade which ones 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.639
 for example not because it is very 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.069
 many upgrade for 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.180
 any units for too similar 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.099
 You can also walk behind the building 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.249
 upgrade and that's just too expensive 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.719
 everything somehow to push as needed 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.150
 she has already thought about which 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:44.610
 things i find important which unit 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.719
 I use a lot of what I invest my 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.300
 which things I tend to apply 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.840
 lie that is really cool really makes 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.310
 fun 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.340
 and then they just focus 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.080
 certain 1 one finds good and then 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.879
 I want to say works just fine 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.860
 The scissors stone paper principle called 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.499
 they are quite happy to be here too 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.740
 passable implemented that pleases me quite 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.110
 Well 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.719
 of course, as with command conquer 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.180
 there are also nuclear weapons here again 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.240
 the one also at the later time of 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.469
 So building a game can be a total 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.500
 he can do that again 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:18.900
 find his style and upgrade what he does 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.719
 good and finds its basis in the 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.830
 direction build the style of his 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.289
 appealing is a bit quick 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.449
 But first she wants to let her fall 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.939
 and playing a big attack is coming 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.189
 that works in any case 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:34.169
 and that's why I like it so far 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:36.089
 really good 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.080
 be definitely fun 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.120
 We continue to play a bit 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.539
 improve and for those of course 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.819
 ask reminds you of command conquer 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:48.120
 General on forever are the similarities 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.099
 It has found wider commodity system 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.620
 better fighting system much more upgrades 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:55.199
 it is new, so it is clear that there is 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.990
 similarities with general but it will be 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.639
 many of my own ideas are introduced to me 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.009
 Personally I also appeal to you 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.300
 Well, I think I have already seen criticism 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.250
 that some even mean this 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.319
 rohstoffs system does not like him at all 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.240
 At the beginning I was also weird to him 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.219
 have found her in there too 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.270
 very good and I have it now 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.120
 not so much to complain 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.819
 for the beta also performance moderately very 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.250
 good at it when many units 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.680
 on the battlefield are sinking too 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.120
 the fps thing is still the case 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.099
 It's still a strategy to play 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.580
 bit bearable when the fps number 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:31.740
 with such a play under 30 sinks disturbs 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.449
 That's not so much with a shooter 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.560
 Of course it would be completely different here 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.419
 it still is not that bad 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.060
 the graphics also relatively high 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.610
 that's why the performance fits 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.390
 moderately a thing but later 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.210
 also a problem 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.010
 could be what you unfortunately in the beta 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.080
 can not assess that bad either 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.990
 so much can be on it is the theme 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.050
 balancing it is just a beta is there 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.600
 much tested because now a judgment too 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.420
 I would not meet like that now 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.090
 to think right but let's see how 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.170
 the later looks like the quasi scaffold 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.760
 the game works in any case very much 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.470
 good and I'm looking forward to the 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.360
 campaign because campaigns are always mine 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.970
 I like to play things that way 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.500
 against bots makes me just fun but 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.870
 logically also in the future 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.180
 multiplayer-maps against friends as well 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.250
 online shop that 's it with this video 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.590
 does you like it there must always entirely 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.820
 cool if you cheap games gravel 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.770
 seeks and namely while shopping 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.480
 Want to support her link in 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.470
 the description will be next 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.470
 skin in
