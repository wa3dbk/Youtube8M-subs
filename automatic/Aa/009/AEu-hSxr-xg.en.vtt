00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
for the purposes of this demonstration

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.700 
for the purposes of this demonstration
we're<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.080> ahead<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.440> we're<00:02:04.680> going

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
to run that also on the stone back and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.800 
to run that also on the stone back and
forth<00:02:07.890> until<00:02:08.130> we<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> good<00:02:08.790> solid<00:02:09.060> line<00:02:09.509> out

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
forth until we get a good solid line out

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.320 
forth until we get a good solid line out
of<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.220> I'm<00:02:11.220> running<00:02:11.460> all<00:02:11.670> over<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.060> stone

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
of that I'm running all over to stone

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.750 
of that I'm running all over to stone
i'm<00:02:12.600> not<00:02:12.780> doing<00:02:13.110> real<00:02:13.290> good<00:02:13.320> there<00:02:13.890> okay<00:02:14.700> so

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
i'm not doing real good there okay so

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.710 
i'm not doing real good there okay so
item1<00:02:15.480> item2<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.740> here<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.400> item<00:02:17.760> three<00:02:18.150> we

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
item1 item2 and here is item three we

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.960 
item1 item2 and here is item three we
don't<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:19.110> whether<00:02:19.290> that's<00:02:19.410> gold<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:20.100> not<00:02:20.280> so

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
don't know whether that's gold or not so

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.550 
don't know whether that's gold or not so
we're<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.180> going<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.660> go<00:02:21.810> ahead<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.320> scratch

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
we're just going to go ahead and scratch

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.730 
we're just going to go ahead and scratch
that<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:23.130> there<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.930> looking<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.500> it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
that on there and it's looking like it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.810 
that on there and it's looking like it
might<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.040> ok<00:02:26.790> now<00:02:27.060> comes<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.200> acid<00:02:28.830> test<00:02:29.130> when

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
might be ok now comes the acid test when

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.730 
might be ok now comes the acid test when
we<00:02:29.850> determine<00:02:30.540> whether<00:02:30.780> these<00:02:31.020> are<00:02:31.290> actually

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
we determine whether these are actually

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.890 
we determine whether these are actually
gold<00:02:32.010> or<00:02:32.220> not<00:02:32.400> we're<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.390> start<00:02:33.660> with

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
gold or not we're going to start with

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.460 
gold or not we're going to start with
the<00:02:33.960> 10<00:02:34.320> karat<00:02:34.950> test<00:02:35.760> acid<00:02:36.300> right<00:02:36.480> there<00:02:36.870> here

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
the 10 karat test acid right there here

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.380 
the 10 karat test acid right there here
we<00:02:37.620> go<00:02:37.830> we're<00:02:38.340> going<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.550> put<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.820> streak<00:02:39.209> across

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
we go we're going to put a streak across

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.790 
we go we're going to put a streak across
the<00:02:39.870> top<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.560> now<00:02:43.560> if

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
the top of this like that and now if

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.240 
the top of this like that and now if
you'll<00:02:43.980> look<00:02:44.570> you'll<00:02:45.570> see<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:46.200> two<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.100> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
you'll look you'll see that two of the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.540 
you'll look you'll see that two of the
lines<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:48.060> disappeared<00:02:48.840> over<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.220> end

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
lines have disappeared over on this end

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.360 
lines have disappeared over on this end
it's<00:02:51.000> gone<00:02:51.360> over<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.230> end<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.920> line<00:02:53.130> is

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
it's gone over on this end the line is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.030 
it's gone over on this end the line is
gone<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.180> middle<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:55.110> line<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.680> they're

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
gone in the middle the line is they're

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.970 
gone in the middle the line is they're
nice<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.030> bright<00:02:57.300> which<00:02:57.990> means<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.740> is

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
nice and bright which means that that is

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.610 
nice and bright which means that that is
at<00:02:59.160> least<00:02:59.190> 10<00:02:59.670> carats<00:03:00.180> that's<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.110> least<00:03:01.320> 10

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
at least 10 carats that's the least 10

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.830 
at least 10 carats that's the least 10
karat<00:03:02.010> gold<00:03:02.040> we're<00:03:02.970> going<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.270> test<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.690> one

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
karat gold we're going to test it one

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.230 
karat gold we're going to test it one
more<00:03:04.020> time<00:03:04.320> now<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:05.280> already<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.090> other

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
more time now we already know the other

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.780 
more time now we already know the other
two<00:03:06.540> are<00:03:06.570> not<00:03:07.170> gold<00:03:07.500> we're<00:03:08.190> going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.459> go<00:03:08.550> back

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
two are not gold we're going to go back

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.670 
two are not gold we're going to go back
and<00:03:08.820> we're<00:03:09.120> going<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.420> take<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.810> 14<00:03:10.380> karat

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
and we're going to take the 14 karat

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.160 
and we're going to take the 14 karat
acid<00:03:11.340> right<00:03:11.550> here<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.450> we're<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.900> test

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
acid right here and we're going to test

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.949 
acid right here and we're going to test
that<00:03:13.470> line<00:03:13.830> as<00:03:14.130> well<00:03:14.459> before<00:03:15.209> we<00:03:15.360> do<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.570> I'm

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
that line as well before we do that I'm

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.140 
that line as well before we do that I'm
just<00:03:16.200> going<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.470> run<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.860> across<00:03:17.130> there<00:03:17.550> so

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
just going to run that across there so

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.699 
just going to run that across there so
that<00:03:18.180> we've<00:03:18.450> got<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.690> good<00:03:18.989> line<00:03:19.260> all<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.560> way

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
that we've got a good line all the way

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.570 
that we've got a good line all the way
across<00:03:20.000> ok<00:03:21.000> here's<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.360> 14<00:03:21.989> karat<00:03:22.290> acid<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
across ok here's the 14 karat acid and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.759 
across ok here's the 14 karat acid and
as<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.000> go<00:03:24.209> across<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.900> notice<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.350> other<00:03:25.530> two

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
as I go across you notice the other two

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.400 
as I go across you notice the other two
are<00:03:25.800> flat<00:03:26.220> gone<00:03:26.550> they<00:03:27.239> are<00:03:27.269> gone<00:03:27.480> right<00:03:28.230> out<00:03:28.260> of

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
are flat gone they are gone right out of

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.590 
are flat gone they are gone right out of
the<00:03:28.620> chute<00:03:28.920> there<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.640> no<00:03:29.880> doubt<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
the chute there is no doubt that the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.320 
the chute there is no doubt that the
other<00:03:30.780> two<00:03:31.080> are<00:03:31.110> not<00:03:31.620> gold<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.030> look

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
other two are not gold but if you look

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.570 
other two are not gold but if you look
at<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.600> one<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.019> middle<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.739> gold<00:03:35.040> shines

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
at the one in the middle the gold shines

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.660 
at the one in the middle the gold shines
through<00:03:36.150> that's<00:03:36.900> how<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.170> test<00:03:37.620> an<00:03:37.920> item<00:03:38.640> to

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
through that's how you test an item to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.940 
through that's how you test an item to
determine<00:03:39.330> whether<00:03:39.360> it's<00:03:39.780> actually<00:03:40.320> gold<00:03:40.620> or

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
determine whether it's actually gold or

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.180 
determine whether it's actually gold or
not<00:03:41.459> once<00:03:42.209> you've<00:03:42.390> done<00:03:42.540> your<00:03:42.600> acid<00:03:43.200> test<00:03:43.500> it

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
not once you've done your acid test it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.340 
not once you've done your acid test it
is<00:03:44.489> important<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.690> go<00:03:45.930> ahead<00:03:46.080> and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
is important that you go ahead and

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.520 
is important that you go ahead and
scrape<00:03:47.250> all<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.820> stuff<00:03:48.180> off<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.450> there<00:03:48.660> that

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
scrape all that stuff off of there that

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.490 
scrape all that stuff off of there that
is<00:03:49.739> acid<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.670> will<00:03:50.910> burn<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:52.140> want<00:03:52.380> to
