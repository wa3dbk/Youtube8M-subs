00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello to all guys well found at one 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.480
 new top app of the week installment 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.519
 also this one with iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.580
 so the episode is dedicated to the best 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.799
 applications of the week for iphone 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 so let's see what are the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.880
 applications we have selected for 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.810
 this week and find out what 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.680
 they can do how they can help us in 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.430
 certain operations 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.430
 let's start right away 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 hello guys then first of all good 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.530
 Monday good start to everyone 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.089
 I hope he didn't go well 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.190
 then let's start with the best ones 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.469
 applications this week like 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.620
 first application or to show you 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.989
 the Milan Expo application obviously 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.289
 you all know and expo milano 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.930
 most important gastronomic fair of the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.579
 last times so let's see 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.019
 directly the application we talk about 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.600
 an application that will allow us to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.220
 filter and also choose through 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.100
 categories etc. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.810
 all the recipes the preparations i 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.179
 ingredients all we can 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.860
 find within the expo via 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.740
 recipes to be able to replicate 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.929
 certain dishes certain dishes 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.210
 even at home so it's a way like a 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.580
 another to get closer to the expo even though 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.310
 we do not have the possibility at the time of 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.159
 go to visit the fair but also a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.250
 way to go and learn new types of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.310
 dishes new customs and learn then to 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.170
 vary our type of diet and therefore 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.450
 to eat something that maybe not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.390
 therefore it is typical only of our areas 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.189
 to extend our borders a little 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.840
 the application is done very well there 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.930
 will allow to see both through 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.689
 ingredient either by plate type 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.149
 so maybe appetizer or what can 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.549
 be sweet, etc. then everything 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.170
 what we wish we could find it 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.520
 inside the application anyway 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.679
 well done maybe the times of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.090
 Content uploading is not 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.310
 yet optimized to the best though 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.229
 the application as a whole works 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.060
 very well 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.709
 let's move on to the second application 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.410
 let's talk about an application that is 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.510
 call this application as 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.530
 it works then it's a bit run 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.140
 nice 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.840
 I'll explain to you immediately I am with mine 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.359
 iphone in this area of ​​the world in 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.810
 in this case I find myself in a cheat and I can 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.390
 going to communicate with others 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.069
 bari people without having to have to 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.560
 necessarily forces the name of the 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.410
 contact etc. simply by air 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.650
 because the geolocation will insert in 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.090
 a kind of circle in a kind of 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.920
 group then the one tied in this 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.860
 case in Bari but we can do it in Rome 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.459
 as in others in other countries in others 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.480
 areas or even in some places 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.000
 details such as 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.800
 a university and so on and talk 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.110
 with the people who are localized 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.209
 there and they obviously opened 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.760
 the application then signed up 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.459
 really a cute application to be able to 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.150
 talk to those we don't even know 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.970
 and that, however, is in short in the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.260
 our area close and fun because 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.940
 however a kind of is created 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.680
 group conversations a bit like 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.930
 happens on whatsapp however on the groups 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.330
 of messaging applications e 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.489
 we could talk to other people 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.950
 even if we don't know them at the moment 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.530
 however you can see the profiles i 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.110
 names and also contact the single ones 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.380
 people individually if not 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.579
 we want to talk for example in the group 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.680
 let's talk about the next one 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.780
 application certainly the most 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.480
 interesting of this top episode 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.400
 app of the week or wallet saver 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.980
 this application what allows us to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.989
 do is an application that allows us 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.180
 to analyze our style of 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.400
 use of our smartphone ei 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.400
 our types of consumption therefore for how much 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.910
 concerns the voice message offers 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.859
 etc 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.630
 so with this application we can 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.600
 choose and better understand ours 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.790
 next offer so as to have a plan 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.230
 tariff offer best suited to 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.170
 our needs without obviously 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.760
 maybe waste minutes or messages 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.709
 this is an interesting application 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.289
 which can also be used for 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.970
 make calls safely for 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.280
 send messages in such a way as to 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.169
 analyze our habits better 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.460
 because obviously if we carry out one 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.160
 called by the iphone app 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.690
 we would not have had the data entered 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.220
 within this application 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.110
 instead if we call from this 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.200
 application that always puts with the 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.780
 our sim we could all have anyway 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.150
 the data 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.350
 inside the app and discover then 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.650
 after a while 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.400
 what are our types of use 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.440
 defaults or in any case those that 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.060
 we use more in this way 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.400
 we can then choose the plan 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.820
 tariff system more suitable for us but not only 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.560
 also the type of operator because a 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.510
 depending on the coverage in a 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.430
 certain place maybe there are 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.620
 advice regarding the operator 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.080
 best to select 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.330
 okay this is therefore an application 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.550
 let's say of per analysis 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.680
 analyze a little what you can 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.200
 perhaps to serve ourselves from a future perspective 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.970
 I am also using it because I am 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.800
 trying to figure out which one will be mine 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.200
 next rate plan since yes 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.210
 nears the end of my contract 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.650
 of my promotion so I will go to 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.030
 choosing something else afterwards is fine 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.800
 guys we got to the last one 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.750
 finger application just him who for 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.610
 there have been few this week 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.320
 applications this week a lot 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.330
 probably this decrease of 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.830
 applications is due a little to 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.870
 frequent updates that are there 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.270
 states especially for compatible apps 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.120
 with apple watch so maybe for iphone 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.380
 in itself many are no longer concentrated 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.710
 in fact I was not able to 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.560
 find lots of solutions for this 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.970
 so many applications bet 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.680
 let's say you find only 4 command 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.630
 at the last application an application 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.400
 for the really interesting design yes 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.289
 call pains tools and it's an application 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.360
 that makes us available 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.240
 a very convenient interface a lot 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.460
 reactive and very complete to go to 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.770
 perform our portrayed drawings 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.900
 sketch sketches etc. on our iphone 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.669
 it's not really like sketchbook because 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.229
 the interface is a little different and also 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.150
 because the accuracy of the application 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.400
 I was also surprised by the kind of style 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.350
 the graphics are really very nice 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.940
 seems to really have a canvas in front 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.890
 ready to be filled with colors 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.320
 though I absolutely don't know 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.539
 draw well I found myself well at 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.030
 try this app for per 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.470
 show it into bubble durc because i am 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.930
 sure that many of you can 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.810
 interesting to be able to do maybe even 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.760
 some kind of skizzo design etcetera 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.460
 around maybe take inspiration 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.169
 where an application really happens 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.860
 comfortable then on the big display like 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.259
 that of 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.689
 with 6 plus maybe it can be even more 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:54.330
 comfortable because he writes to go and draw 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:55.620
 on the display this is much more 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.129
 simple compared to one more display 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.389
 small however really application 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:02.520
 good guys recommended with this one 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.199
 episode we have finished I will

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.300
 Interesting 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.800
 okay if you have applications that 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.750
 have not yet been treated but that 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.669
 you think they are important and should 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.250
 be included in top a cold week 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:35.069
