hello<00:00:01.020> everyone<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:02.159> when<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.610> left<00:00:02.790> off<00:00:02.970> last

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hello everyone so when we left off last

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.030 
hello everyone so when we left off last
time<00:00:03.360> we<00:00:03.720> were<00:00:03.840> creating<00:00:04.319> chunks<00:00:04.650> like<00:00:04.770> this

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
time we were creating chunks like this

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.680 
time we were creating chunks like this
and<00:00:05.339> you<00:00:05.549> can<00:00:05.700> see<00:00:05.819> they<00:00:06.000> spawn<00:00:06.299> in<00:00:06.480> rather

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
and you can see they spawn in rather

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.759 
and you can see they spawn in rather
slow<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.290> they<00:00:07.440> don't<00:00:07.560> spawn<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.179> very<00:00:09.769> they

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
slow and they don't spawn in very they

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.870 
slow and they don't spawn in very they
don't<00:00:10.950> they<00:00:11.070> don't<00:00:11.099> spawn<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.519> with<00:00:11.639> any<00:00:11.759> kind

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
don't they don't spawn in with any kind

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.120 
don't they don't spawn in with any kind
of<00:00:11.969> preference<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:13.139> get<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.380> giant<00:00:13.620> cube<00:00:14.009> of

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
of preference you get this giant cube of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.289 
of preference you get this giant cube of
things<00:00:14.370> when<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.549> first<00:00:14.759> spawned<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.179> know<00:00:15.240> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
things when you first spawned I know a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.820 
things when you first spawned I know a
lot<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> people<00:00:15.570> wanted<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.080> do<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
lot of people wanted to do like a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.230 
lot of people wanted to do like a
loading<00:00:17.190> screen<00:00:17.220> where<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.699> load<00:00:17.850> those<00:00:18.029> up

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
loading screen where you load those up

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
loading screen where you load those up
but<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.230> actually<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> need<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
but it's actually what I need to do is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.840 
but it's actually what I need to do is
is<00:00:20.850> fix<00:00:21.510> how<00:00:22.050> they<00:00:22.230> spawn<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.859> similarly<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
is fix how they spawn in and similarly I

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.420 
is fix how they spawn in and similarly I
want<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.359> fix<00:00:24.600> how<00:00:25.260> they<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:25.560> away<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
want to fix how they go away because a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.769 
want to fix how they go away because a
lot<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.180> started<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.480> play<00:00:27.660> around

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
lot of you have started to play around

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.990 
lot of you have started to play around
with<00:00:28.380> longer<00:00:28.830> view<00:00:29.039> ranges<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> walking

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
with longer view ranges and walking

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359 
with longer view ranges and walking
further<00:00:30.210> distances<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.529> you've

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
further distances like this and you've

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
further distances like this and you've
started<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> realize<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.239> chunks<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:33.840> not

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
started to realize that chunks are not

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.840 
started to realize that chunks are not
free<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> lot<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> chunks<00:00:35.670> in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
free when you get a lot of chunks in

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.200 
free when you get a lot of chunks in
your<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:36.930> RAM<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.550> really<00:00:39.149> start

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
your in your RAM then they really start

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
your in your RAM then they really start
to<00:00:39.570> bog<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.930> down<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> start<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> go

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
to bog you down and you start to go

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.920 
to bog you down and you start to go
slowly<00:00:41.280> my<00:00:42.059> computer<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> bit<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> beast

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
slowly my computer is a bit of a beast

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.400 
slowly my computer is a bit of a beast
so<00:00:43.399> it<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.550> handle<00:00:44.670> quite<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> few<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.870> there

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
so it can handle quite a few but there

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
so it can handle quite a few but there
is<00:00:46.440> an<00:00:46.680> upper<00:00:46.920> limit<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.789> well<00:00:47.969> unity

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
is an upper limit to how well unity

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
is an upper limit to how well unity
could<00:00:48.539> handle<00:00:48.780> objects<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
could handle objects and this is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
could handle objects and this is
actually<00:00:50.160> why<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> can't<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.120> spawn<00:00:51.510> in

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
actually why you can't just spawn in

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
actually why you can't just spawn in
cubes<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.559> every<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:55.140> can't<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.410> spun<00:00:55.590> in

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
cubes for every you can't just spun in

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.920 
cubes for every you can't just spun in
cubes<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.280> every<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.879> every<00:00:56.910> voxel<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.840> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
cubes for every for every voxel that you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
cubes for every for every voxel that you
need<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.829> spawn<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.250> chunks<00:00:59.609> because

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
need you have to spawn in chunks because

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.849 
need you have to spawn in chunks because
there's<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> maximum<00:01:01.170> limit<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> number<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
there's a maximum limit to the number of

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.149 
there's a maximum limit to the number of
objects<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.059> handle<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
objects that you know you can handle it

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.640 
objects that you know you can handle it
only<00:01:05.159> works<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.820> well<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> reason<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
only works so well but the reason that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
only works so well but the reason that
that<00:01:08.100> i'm<00:01:08.520> walking<00:01:09.390> over<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.930> right

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that i'm walking over like this right

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050 
that i'm walking over like this right
now<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.409> front<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.100> i<00:01:11.549> wanted

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
now in front of you is because i wanted

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.570 
now in front of you is because i wanted
to<00:01:12.180> show<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.390> how<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.810> happens<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> see

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to show you how it happens you can see

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.789 
to show you how it happens you can see
that<00:01:14.610> we've<00:01:14.820> got<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.060> giant<00:01:15.360> map<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:16.680> we're

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that we've got this giant map what we're

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.410 
that we've got this giant map what we're
going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.670> episode<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.299> we're

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
going to do in this episode is we're

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
going to do in this episode is we're
going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:20.220> only<00:01:20.460> spawn

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
going to make it so that a we only spawn

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.350 
going to make it so that a we only spawn
in<00:01:21.090> circles<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.689> b<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.920> despawn<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:24.030> wander

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
in circles and b we despawn as we wander

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.539 
in circles and b we despawn as we wander
along<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.799> should<00:01:25.890> help<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
along and this should help a lot of you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.390 
along and this should help a lot of you
for<00:01:26.909> optimization<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.869> world

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
for optimization so here in the world

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.130 
for optimization so here in the world
script<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.420> thing<00:01:33.630> where<00:01:33.900> we

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
script we have this thing where we

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.880 
script we have this thing where we
actually<00:01:34.320> look<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.579> chunks<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.890> we

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
actually look for what chunks we want we

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
actually look for what chunks we want we
go<00:01:38.070> through<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.670> look<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.329> square

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
go through and we look in this square

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
go through and we look in this square
around<00:01:40.619> our<00:01:40.829> camera<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.759> figure<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.210> whether

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
around our camera to figure out whether

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.020 
around our camera to figure out whether
or<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> chunk<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
or not a chunk is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.850 
or not a chunk is
in<00:01:45.479> whether<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.500> need<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.830> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
in whether or not we need to have a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.280 
in whether or not we need to have a
chunk<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> given<00:01:47.520> area<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.080> first<00:01:49.260> thing

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
chunk in a given area so the first thing

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.330 
chunk in a given area so the first thing
we're<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.860> we're<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.190> make

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
we're going to do is we're going to make

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
we're going to do is we're going to make
this<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.729> circle<00:01:51.150> rather<00:01:51.330> than<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.600> square<00:01:51.869> there

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
this a circle rather than a square there

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.280 
this a circle rather than a square there
are<00:01:52.650> actually<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.950> lot<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.190> ways<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
are actually a lot of ways to do that

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.170 
are actually a lot of ways to do that
but<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:56.100> easiest<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:56.700> from<00:01:56.850> my<00:01:56.940> perspective

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
but the easiest way from my perspective

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.660 
but the easiest way from my perspective
is<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.869> shave<00:01:58.110> it<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:02.130> way<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.399> do<00:02:02.520> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
is just to shave it the way we do that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.789 
is just to shave it the way we do that
is<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.940> say<00:02:03.300> if<00:02:03.630> pause<00:02:04.790> we<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.000> say<00:02:06.119> vector3

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
is we say if pause we just say vector3

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.100 
is we say if pause we just say vector3
delta<00:02:07.799> equals<00:02:08.369> pause<00:02:08.729> minus<00:02:09.330> transformed<00:02:10.020> up

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
delta equals pause minus transformed up

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.770 
delta equals pause minus transformed up
position<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.459> say<00:02:11.640> delta<00:02:12.180> y<00:02:12.480> equals

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
position and then we say delta y equals

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.010 
position and then we say delta y equals
zero<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.319> we<00:02:13.410> say<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:13.970> delta<00:02:14.970> magnitude<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
zero and we say if delta magnitude is

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.430 
zero and we say if delta magnitude is
greater<00:02:16.830> than<00:02:17.040> or<00:02:17.190> equal<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.430> view<00:02:18.150> range<00:02:18.440> how

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
greater than or equal to view range how

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.390 
greater than or equal to view range how
about<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.709> greater<00:02:19.950> than<00:02:20.070> do<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.220> arrange

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
about just greater than do you arrange

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.479 
about just greater than do you arrange
and<00:02:21.209> continue<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:25.470> will<00:02:25.650> spawn<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.250> a

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
and continue and that will spawn in a

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.449 
and continue and that will spawn in a
circle<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:28.709> can<00:02:28.830> already<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.310> that

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
circle and you can already see that

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.140 
circle and you can already see that
we've<00:02:29.580> got<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> circle<00:02:30.180> rather<00:02:30.390> than<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.630> square

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
we've got a circle rather than a square

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.460 
we've got a circle rather than a square
that's<00:02:33.150> only<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.450> little<00:02:33.630> bit<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.870> optimization

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
that's only a little bit of optimization

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.720 
that's only a little bit of optimization
but<00:02:34.680> you'll<00:02:34.800> notice<00:02:34.980> pretty<00:02:35.310> quickly<00:02:35.580> that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
but you'll notice pretty quickly that

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.280 
but you'll notice pretty quickly that
that<00:02:35.970> actually<00:02:36.330> really<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> massive

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
that actually really is a massive

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.470 
that actually really is a massive
optimization<00:02:37.980> because<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.760> no<00:02:38.880> longer<00:02:38.910> spawn

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
optimization because you no longer spawn

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.559 
optimization because you no longer spawn
in<00:02:39.690> these<00:02:39.900> giant<00:02:40.440> lines<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:41.819> instead<00:02:42.120> spondon

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
in these giant lines you instead spondon

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.490 
in these giant lines you instead spondon
much<00:02:42.780> more<00:02:42.989> manageable<00:02:43.200> small<00:02:43.830> arcs<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
much more manageable small arcs the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.660 
much more manageable small arcs the
other<00:02:46.620> thing<00:02:46.769> we<00:02:46.860> need<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.280> d<00:02:47.430> spawn

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
other thing we need to do is d spawn

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
other thing we need to do is d spawn
behind<00:02:47.850> us<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.019> do<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.230> we're<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.799> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
behind us so to do that we're going to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.500 
behind us so to do that we're going to
go<00:02:50.040> through<00:02:50.310> all<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.000> chunks<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.360> we

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
go through all of the chunks that we

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.710 
go through all of the chunks that we
have<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.880> despawn<00:02:53.880> any<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.239> them<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.510> fall

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
have and despawn any of them that fall

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.350 
have and despawn any of them that fall
with<00:02:54.959> outside<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.739> our<00:02:55.860> view<00:02:56.100> range<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:59.360> is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
with outside of our view range so a is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.210 
with outside of our view range so a is
less<00:03:00.540> than<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.560> where<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.799> store<00:03:02.010> all<00:03:02.040> of

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
less than this is where we store all of

less than this is where we store all of

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
our chunk and chunks up chunks so all of

our chunk and chunks up chunks so all of
the<00:03:05.040> junks<00:03:05.340> sign<00:03:05.640> up<00:03:05.880> when<00:03:06.090> they're<00:03:06.239> created

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
the junks sign up when they're created

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.210 
the junks sign up when they're created
they<00:03:06.720> sign<00:03:06.959> up<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.440> particular<00:03:07.709> list

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
they sign up for that particular list

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.560 
they sign up for that particular list
and<00:03:08.430> we're<00:03:08.820> going<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> go<00:03:09.120> through<00:03:09.150> them<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
and we're going to go through them and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:19.090 
and we're going to go through them and
delete<00:03:09.780> them<00:03:09.900> so

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.540 

and<00:03:19.670> we<00:03:19.820> say<00:03:20.060> vector3<00:03:21.050> delta<00:03:21.710> equals<00:03:22.160> pause

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
and we say vector3 delta equals pause

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.590 
and we say vector3 delta equals pause
minus<00:03:23.240> transformed<00:03:24.140> opposition<00:03:24.590> delta<00:03:25.600> y

actually want to have a little bit of

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.550 
actually want to have a little bit of

wash here we don't want it to
continually<00:03:40.220> despawn<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.910> spawn<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.300> chunks

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
continually despawn and spawn in chunks

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.210 
continually despawn and spawn in chunks
just<00:03:41.900> because<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.230> player<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.590> walking<00:03:43.010> back

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
just because the player is walking back

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.100 
just because the player is walking back
and<00:03:43.250> forth<00:03:43.460> like<00:03:43.700> 1<00:03:44.000> meter<00:03:44.210> so<00:03:44.840> we're<00:03:44.930> going<00:03:45.020> to

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
and forth like 1 meter so we're going to

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.090 
and forth like 1 meter so we're going to
go<00:03:45.200> ahead<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.380> add<00:03:45.590> in<00:03:45.830> some<00:03:46.580> chunk<00:03:46.820> width

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
go ahead and add in some chunk width

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.710 
go ahead and add in some chunk width
let's<00:03:49.100> give<00:03:49.250> ourselves<00:03:49.370> three<00:03:49.940> chunks<00:03:50.240> worth

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
let's give ourselves three chunks worth

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.160 
let's give ourselves three chunks worth
of<00:03:51.760> sloshed<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.270> can<00:03:53.420> customize<00:03:53.600> that<00:03:54.020> if

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
of sloshed and you can customize that if

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.140 
of sloshed and you can customize that if
you'd<00:03:54.290> prefer<00:03:54.610> that'll<00:03:55.610> make<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.030> that

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
you'd prefer that'll make it so that

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.580 
you'd prefer that'll make it so that
it's<00:03:56.480> pretty<00:03:56.660> clear<00:03:56.960> that<00:03:56.990> if<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.350> player<00:03:57.560> is

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
it's pretty clear that if the player is

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.490 
it's pretty clear that if the player is
wandering<00:03:58.160> away<00:03:58.390> then<00:03:59.390> then<00:03:59.840> we'll<00:04:00.260> get<00:04:00.380> rid

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
wandering away then then we'll get rid

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.720 
wandering away then then we'll get rid
of<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> chunk<00:04:00.890> but<00:04:01.070> if<00:04:01.130> he's<00:04:01.250> just<00:04:01.310> kind<00:04:01.520> of<00:04:01.550> a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
of the chunk but if he's just kind of a

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.880 
of the chunk but if he's just kind of a
little<00:04:02.300> bit<00:04:02.480> gun<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.960> it<00:04:03.230> might<00:04:03.500> come<00:04:03.740> back

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
little bit gun and it might come back

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.920 
little bit gun and it might come back
we'll<00:04:04.190> leave<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.520> in<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.760> ram<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.780> we<00:04:05.870> don't

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
we'll leave it in a ram so that we don't

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.850 
we'll leave it in a ram so that we don't
have<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.170> recreate<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.560> next<00:04:09.770> step

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
have to recreate it this the next step

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.600 
have to recreate it this the next step
is<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.130> course<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.370> destroy<00:04:10.460> the<00:04:10.820> chunk<00:04:12.610> now

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
is of course to destroy the chunk now

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.030 
is of course to destroy the chunk now
here<00:04:13.850> is<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.000> first<00:04:14.360> of<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.660> gotchas<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.290> think

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
here is the first of the gotchas I think

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.699 
here is the first of the gotchas I think
a<00:04:16.130> lot<00:04:16.160> of<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.610> did<00:04:17.570> this<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.290> think<00:04:18.350> that

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
a lot of you did this and I think that

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.840 
a lot of you did this and I think that
might<00:04:18.860> be<00:04:18.890> my<00:04:19.100> fault<00:04:19.130> because<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:19.580> think<00:04:19.640> that

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
might be my fault because I think that

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.810 
might be my fault because I think that
might<00:04:20.030> be<00:04:20.090> what<00:04:20.330> I<00:04:20.360> told<00:04:20.450> you<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.930> do<00:04:21.580> of<00:04:22.580> course

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
might be what I told you to do of course

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.220 
might be what I told you to do of course
what<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.000> actually<00:04:23.180> need<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.480> do<00:04:23.600> is<00:04:23.750> that<00:04:23.990> if

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
what you actually need to do is that if

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.650 
what you actually need to do is that if
you<00:04:24.830> just<00:04:25.070> destroy<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.400> chunk<00:04:25.790> then<00:04:26.480> the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
you just destroy the chunk then the

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.230 
you just destroy the chunk then the
actual<00:04:27.110> game<00:04:27.140> object<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.250> mesh<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.850> the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
actual game object and the mesh and the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.280 
actual game object and the mesh and the
collision<00:04:29.720> mesh<00:04:29.900> all<00:04:30.170> remain<00:04:30.920> behind<00:04:32.290> so

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
collision mesh all remain behind so

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.440 
collision mesh all remain behind so
obviously<00:04:33.770> that's<00:04:33.950> no<00:04:34.160> good<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:35.030> other<00:04:35.180> thing

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
obviously that's no good the other thing

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.970 
obviously that's no good the other thing
we<00:04:35.540> need<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.810> think<00:04:35.960> about<00:04:36.110> is<00:04:36.260> we've<00:04:36.680> got<00:04:36.830> this

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
we need to think about is we've got this

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.250 
we need to think about is we've got this
chunk<00:04:37.340> chunk<00:04:37.850> stop<00:04:38.090> count<00:04:38.840> here<00:04:39.080> we've<00:04:39.230> got

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
chunk chunk stop count here we've got

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.380 
chunk chunk stop count here we've got
this<00:04:39.470> list<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:39.950> chunks<00:04:40.340> now<00:04:40.850> if<00:04:40.940> we<00:04:41.030> destroy<00:04:41.360> a

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
this list of chunks now if we destroy a

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.630 
this list of chunks now if we destroy a
chunk<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:41.990> won't<00:04:42.290> actually<00:04:42.500> remove<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.490> from

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
chunk it won't actually remove it from

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.180 
chunk it won't actually remove it from
the<00:04:43.730> list<00:04:44.090> it'll<00:04:44.510> leave<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.720> null<00:04:45.080> spot<00:04:45.740> in<00:04:45.980> the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
the list it'll leave a null spot in the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.070 
the list it'll leave a null spot in the
list<00:04:46.460> now<00:04:47.270> if<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:47.420> wanted<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.900> we<00:04:48.050> could

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
list now if you wanted to we could

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.750 
list now if you wanted to we could
remove<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:48.500> from<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.650> list<00:04:48.830> here<00:04:49.280> but<00:04:49.610> there's

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
remove it from the list here but there's

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.610 
remove it from the list here but there's
a<00:04:49.820> better<00:04:49.970> way<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.120> do<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.510> let's<00:04:51.350> go<00:04:51.470> over<00:04:51.560> to

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
a better way to do that let's go over to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.070 
a better way to do that let's go over to
chunk<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.490> we're<00:04:52.640> going<00:04:52.790> to<00:04:52.850> add<00:04:53.030> in<00:04:53.060> void<00:04:53.780> on

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
chunk and we're going to add in void on

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.160 
chunk and we're going to add in void on
destroy<00:04:55.240> now<00:04:56.240> this<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.540> function<00:04:56.960> that<00:04:56.990> gets

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
destroy now this is a function that gets

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.310 
destroy now this is a function that gets
called<00:04:57.470> whenever<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:59.570> object<00:04:59.720> is<00:05:00.110> destroyed

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
called whenever the object is destroyed

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.270 
called whenever the object is destroyed
and<00:05:00.940> therefore<00:05:01.940> we<00:05:02.690> can<00:05:02.870> just<00:05:03.560> assume<00:05:03.950> that

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
and therefore we can just assume that

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.620 
and therefore we can just assume that
we're<00:05:04.460> going<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.610> catch<00:05:04.880> any<00:05:05.180> destructive

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
we're going to catch any destructive

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.140 
we're going to catch any destructive
event<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.220> we<00:05:07.220> can<00:05:07.370> do<00:05:07.580> what<00:05:07.730> we<00:05:07.760> need<00:05:07.940> to<00:05:07.970> do

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
event and we can do what we need to do

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.320 
event and we can do what we need to do
and<00:05:08.360> in<00:05:08.630> this<00:05:08.690> case<00:05:08.870> what<00:05:09.020> we<00:05:09.080> need<00:05:09.170> to<00:05:09.260> do<00:05:09.380> is

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
and in this case what we need to do is

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.540 
and in this case what we need to do is
I chunks<00:05:10.930> remove<00:05:11.409> this<00:05:14.159> now<00:05:15.159> the<00:05:15.220> thing<00:05:15.520> to

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
I chunks remove this now the thing to

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.399 
I chunks remove this now the thing to
remember<00:05:15.669> about<00:05:16.060> this<00:05:16.419> is<00:05:16.599> that<00:05:16.659> undestroyed

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
remember about this is that undestroyed

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.110 
remember about this is that undestroyed
only<00:05:17.830> happens<00:05:18.189> when<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.610> object<00:05:18.729> is

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
only happens when the object is

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.959 
only happens when the object is
destroyed<00:05:19.439> when<00:05:20.439> you<00:05:20.530> say<00:05:20.710> destroy<00:05:21.189> that

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 
destroyed when you say destroy that

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.670 
destroyed when you say destroy that
doesn't<00:05:22.240> immediately<00:05:22.509> destroy<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:23.259> object

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
doesn't immediately destroy the object

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.890 
doesn't immediately destroy the object
it<00:05:23.860> cues<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.550> up<00:05:24.729> so<00:05:25.419> it's<00:05:25.599> going<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.840> be

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
it cues it up so it's going to be

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.559 
it cues it up so it's going to be
destroyed<00:05:26.349> between<00:05:26.860> frames<00:05:27.449> therefore<00:05:28.449> we

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
destroyed between frames therefore we

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.240 
destroyed between frames therefore we
don't<00:05:28.810> have<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.169> do<00:05:29.289> this<00:05:29.439> a<00:05:29.590> minus<00:05:29.889> minus

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
don't have to do this a minus minus

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.469 
don't have to do this a minus minus
thing<00:05:30.520> that<00:05:30.669> you<00:05:30.759> might<00:05:30.969> have<00:05:31.000> done<00:05:31.270> in<00:05:31.419> the

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
thing that you might have done in the

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.420 
thing that you might have done in the
past<00:05:31.659> we<00:05:32.259> don't<00:05:32.409> have<00:05:32.590> to<00:05:32.740> do<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:32.889> because

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
past we don't have to do that because

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.089 
past we don't have to do that because
destroy<00:05:34.000> doesn't<00:05:34.360> actually<00:05:34.509> get<00:05:34.900> called<00:05:35.259> it

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
destroy doesn't actually get called it

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.950 
destroy doesn't actually get called it
doesn't<00:05:36.340> actually<00:05:36.460> fulfill<00:05:37.060> its<00:05:37.360> destructive

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
doesn't actually fulfill its destructive

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.619 
doesn't actually fulfill its destructive
purpose<00:05:38.289> until<00:05:38.860> after<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.370> frame<00:05:39.610> is<00:05:39.789> done<00:05:40.000> so

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:40.629 
purpose until after the frame is done so

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.029 
purpose until after the frame is done so
we<00:05:40.719> just<00:05:40.900> basically<00:05:40.990> mark<00:05:41.590> them<00:05:41.830> for

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
we just basically mark them for

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.770 
we just basically mark them for
destruction<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.729> that's<00:05:43.330> fine<00:05:43.599> we<00:05:43.750> don't

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
destruction and that's fine we don't

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.330 
destruction and that's fine we don't
need<00:05:44.020> we<00:05:44.289> don't<00:05:44.319> need<00:05:44.469> to<00:05:44.620> say<00:05:44.770> a<00:05:44.800> minus<00:05:45.129> minus

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
need we don't need to say a minus minus

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.830 
need we don't need to say a minus minus
because<00:05:45.580> nothing<00:05:45.819> is<00:05:45.879> being<00:05:46.330> deleted<00:05:46.690> from

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
because nothing is being deleted from

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.140 
because nothing is being deleted from
the<00:05:46.930> list<00:05:47.020> yet

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.470 

alright<00:05:52.930> so<00:05:53.700> this<00:05:54.700> is<00:05:54.910> the<00:05:55.030> sphere<00:05:55.450> of

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
alright so this is the sphere of

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.940 
alright so this is the sphere of
influence<00:05:55.720> we've<00:05:56.140> got<00:05:56.320> let's<00:05:56.560> go<00:05:56.710> ahead<00:05:56.860> and

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
influence we've got let's go ahead and

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.560 
influence we've got let's go ahead and
walk<00:05:57.070> this<00:05:57.280> way<00:05:59.790> let's<00:06:00.790> go<00:06:00.970> a<00:06:01.000> sufficient

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
walk this way let's go a sufficient

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.840 
walk this way let's go a sufficient

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
distance at least three chunks

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.710 
distance at least three chunks
significantly<00:06:03.850> more<00:06:04.060> than<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.390> because<00:06:04.600> I

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
significantly more than that because I

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.690 
significantly more than that because I

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
want to make it clear that way that they

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.820 
want to make it clear that way that they

have been vanishing by the way you can

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.590 
have been vanishing by the way you can

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
put in debug logs about chunks being

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.170 
put in debug logs about chunks being
destroyed<00:06:10.930> if<00:06:11.080> you'd<00:06:11.200> like<00:06:11.320> I<00:06:11.560> didn't<00:06:12.430> but

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
destroyed if you'd like I didn't but

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.370 
destroyed if you'd like I didn't but
that<00:06:13.390> doesn't<00:06:13.690> mean<00:06:13.840> that<00:06:13.990> there's<00:06:14.170> a<00:06:14.230> bad

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
that doesn't mean that there's a bad

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.820 
that doesn't mean that there's a bad
idea<00:06:14.560> I<00:06:15.220> just<00:06:15.430> didn't<00:06:15.670> do<00:06:15.790> it<00:06:16.620> it<00:06:17.620> might<00:06:17.800> be

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
idea I just didn't do it it might be

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.050 
idea I just didn't do it it might be
nice<00:06:18.070> to<00:06:18.130> know<00:06:18.400> the<00:06:18.490> chunks<00:06:18.790> are<00:06:18.880> being

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
nice to know the chunks are being

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.340 
nice to know the chunks are being
destroyed<00:06:19.420> I<00:06:19.570> suppose<00:06:22.050> all<00:06:23.050> right<00:06:23.230> I<00:06:23.260> think

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
destroyed I suppose all right I think

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.440 
destroyed I suppose all right I think
that's<00:06:23.560> far<00:06:23.800> enough<00:06:23.890> to<00:06:24.070> prove<00:06:24.100> the<00:06:24.340> point<00:06:24.520> so

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
that's far enough to prove the point so

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.880 
that's far enough to prove the point so
as<00:06:25.540> you<00:06:25.660> can<00:06:25.780> see<00:06:25.990> we've<00:06:26.140> got<00:06:26.170> a<00:06:26.350> nice<00:06:26.560> circular

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
as you can see we've got a nice circular

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.720 
as you can see we've got a nice circular
area<00:06:27.730> now<00:06:28.180> we<00:06:28.840> have<00:06:29.020> a<00:06:29.050> little<00:06:29.290> bit<00:06:29.350> of<00:06:29.730> wash

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
area now we have a little bit of wash

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.300 
area now we have a little bit of wash
three<00:06:31.660> tiles<00:06:31.870> worth<00:06:32.110> of<00:06:32.290> wash<00:06:32.530> to<00:06:32.950> our<00:06:33.100> Lee

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
three tiles worth of wash to our Lee

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.970 
three tiles worth of wash to our Lee
that<00:06:33.820> is<00:06:33.940> behind<00:06:34.180> us<00:06:34.360> and<00:06:34.570> that's<00:06:35.110> as<00:06:35.320> expected

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
that is behind us and that's as expected

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.040 
that is behind us and that's as expected
so<00:06:36.190> it's<00:06:36.370> not<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.490> perfect<00:06:36.760> circle<00:06:37.300> because<00:06:38.020> a

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
so it's not a perfect circle because a

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.010 
so it's not a perfect circle because a
little<00:06:38.230> bit<00:06:38.470> of<00:06:38.500> it<00:06:38.800> remains<00:06:39.240> visible<00:06:40.240> behind

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
little bit of it remains visible behind

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.650 
little bit of it remains visible behind
us<00:06:41.340> now<00:06:42.340> this<00:06:42.520> works<00:06:42.730> regardless<00:06:42.910> of<00:06:43.450> your

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
us now this works regardless of your

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.420 
us now this works regardless of your
view<00:06:43.960> range<00:06:44.200> but<00:06:44.560> you<00:06:44.680> may<00:06:44.830> have<00:06:45.010> noticed<00:06:45.340> that

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
view range but you may have noticed that

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.610 
view range but you may have noticed that
if<00:06:45.580> you<00:06:45.640> have<00:06:45.760> a<00:06:45.790> very<00:06:45.970> large<00:06:46.210> view<00:06:46.630> range<00:06:46.840> you

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
if you have a very large view range you

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.770 
if you have a very large view range you
have<00:06:47.770> a<00:06:47.850> significant<00:06:48.850> slowdown<00:06:48.970> as<00:06:49.390> you<00:06:49.540> spawn

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
have a significant slowdown as you spawn

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.360 
have a significant slowdown as you spawn
in<00:06:49.960> hundreds<00:06:50.350> and<00:06:50.440> hundreds<00:06:50.890> and<00:06:50.980> hundreds

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.730 
in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
and<00:06:51.580> hundreds<00:06:51.940> of<00:06:52.030> chunks<00:06:52.420> I'm<00:06:53.290> not<00:06:53.470> going<00:06:53.680> to

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
and hundreds of chunks I'm not going to

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.130 
and hundreds of chunks I'm not going to
deal<00:06:53.890> with<00:06:54.070> that<00:06:54.220> today<00:06:54.430> but<00:06:55.420> I<00:06:55.660> want<00:06:55.960> you<00:06:56.050> to

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140 
deal with that today but I want you to

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.560 
deal with that today but I want you to
know<00:06:56.350> that<00:06:56.380> this<00:06:56.710> game<00:06:57.250> i'm<00:06:57.430> making<00:06:57.790> revolves

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
know that this game i'm making revolves

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.140 
know that this game i'm making revolves
around<00:06:58.690> people<00:06:59.200> moving<00:06:59.470> very<00:06:59.590> fast<00:06:59.950> so<00:07:00.730> i<00:07:00.760> am

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
around people moving very fast so i am

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150 
around people moving very fast so i am
going<00:07:01.420> to<00:07:01.510> be<00:07:01.630> implementing<00:07:02.200> a<00:07:02.320> very<00:07:02.740> very

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
going to be implementing a very very

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.100 
going to be implementing a very very
fast<00:07:03.550> chunk<00:07:04.450> spawning<00:07:04.960> system<00:07:05.650> and<00:07:06.240> and<00:07:07.240> that

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
fast chunk spawning system and and that

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.840 
fast chunk spawning system and and that
will<00:07:08.260> be<00:07:08.410> very<00:07:08.560> useful<00:07:08.680> because<00:07:09.070> by<00:07:09.670> that

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
will be very useful because by that

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.040 
will be very useful because by that
point<00:07:09.880> what<00:07:10.240> we'll<00:07:10.390> do<00:07:10.510> is<00:07:10.630> we'll<00:07:10.720> go<00:07:10.840> through

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
point what we'll do is we'll go through

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.960 
point what we'll do is we'll go through
and<00:07:11.170> we'll<00:07:11.260> create<00:07:11.560> all<00:07:11.770> of<00:07:11.800> the<00:07:12.040> chunks<00:07:12.430> at<00:07:12.550> a

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
and we'll create all of the chunks at a

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.450 
and we'll create all of the chunks at a
low<00:07:13.300> level<00:07:13.330> of<00:07:13.780> detail<00:07:14.170> web<00:07:14.590> at<00:07:14.860> first<00:07:15.130> past
