 all or all again here info / 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.270
 olvin forum today I have an application 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.240
 to be able to read on the mobile or on the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.860
 tablet two satellite channels in this case 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.560
 it's channel the application is called channels 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.329
 Spain in this application as you go to 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.689
 see below has a multitude of 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.340
 you can download it from the link 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.250
 that I will leave you in the blog as always 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.739
 good thing is that we have all this the k-1 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.690
 the two series league soccer league 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.489
 champions action cinema with an idea 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.879
 sports and most of them work 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.500
 perfectly there are always some that do not 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.470
 they work at some point in others yes 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.840
 but its general form I have seen several 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.660
 channels and it is used quite remove the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.090
 television and it works properly 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.410
 good good let's do the test of 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.210
 agreement to which we have gone all that 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.329
 let's do squeeze trying with the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.800
 colofox agree I tell you that and 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.049
 recording while I watch television 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.710
 obviously the mobile phone by much 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.420
 much that is or does not give for more 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.820
 a data while loading the buffet but 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.330
 good more or less for you to see that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.330
 works 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.820
 the idea if without cuts and with volume 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.190
 of water 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.760
 and work perfectly well for 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.290
 cent when I commented this is the pit 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.480
 As you can see, it is always loading a buffer 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.090
 but that's why I'm recording 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.230
 the time but with the wifi connection there is no 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.000
 no problem and you see everything 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.560
 perfectly let's try another 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.320
 with another one for soccer lovers by 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.320
 example let's try with channel + league 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.450
 all right 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.090
 it seems to be a little more open 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.840
 other times good but good impressions 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.240
 it opens 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.950
 and here you have here you will see a is a 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.689
 shorter piece because he was always 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.479
 loading the ife had to delete it from 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.030
 agreement but it looks pretty looks 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.200
 pretty good as matches are there 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.269
 channels that are not in high definition 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.530
 but good our motto at the moment 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.299
 download the project application 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.010
 to ask before you can see any 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.840
 channel is to download this other 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.849
 application of the insurance of the player that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.860
 we will also leave the link even though 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.530
 directly the application will not leave a 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.650
 option to download it well 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.750
 application is a player 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.489
 streaming agreement where you can both 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.810
 on television channels like it was 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.400
 directly for example video from 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.849
 youtube you can lose connection 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.519
 directly can be different 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:41.010
 video web pages of videos you can 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.120
 see from within the world if you are from 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.319
 have to enter the page or do 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.030
 applications directly well good a 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.819
 time it stays a bit hung but 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.380
 good for a principle is going pretty well 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.190
 this application and player 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.860
 every time you see 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.480
 every time you have to see a channel 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.820
 television is going to be a little screen 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.230
 which puts save the link where I 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.660
 what for example what I have done is give 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.220
 to remember and cancel for I'm going to 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.300
 ask because it is useless to return 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.580
 to the link because we already have directly 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.470
 the application where they are already saved 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.630
 the good links I hope you have 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.090
 liked it according if you liked it 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.070
 share it and good follow and zara like 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.070
 it is always possible thanks and even another 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.070
 two
