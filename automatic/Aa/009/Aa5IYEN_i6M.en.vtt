00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
yes so right now I'm actually just

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
yes so right now I'm actually just
applying<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> waterless

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
applying there we have a waterless

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
applying there we have a waterless
solution<00:01:28.530> which<00:01:28.710> takes<00:01:29.220> up<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> dirt<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.909> the

solution which takes up the dirt on the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.480 
solution which takes up the dirt on the
car<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:31.110> why<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.560> use<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.280> less

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
car and that's why we can use so so less

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
car and that's why we can use so so less
