main guidelines for this architectural
project<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> little<00:02:40.700> bit

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
project and this is a little bit

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.430 
project and this is a little bit
difficult<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.480> i'm<00:02:41.569> going<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.900> use<00:02:42.170> like

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
difficult so i'm going to use like

management system that is wrong by our
Green<00:04:44.699> Team<00:04:45.320> when<00:04:46.320> we<00:04:46.500> start<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.460> planning

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
Green Team when we start the planning

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.740 
Green Team when we start the planning
part<00:04:48.270> we<00:04:48.840> invite<00:04:49.220> one<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.639> biologists<00:04:51.479> to

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
part we invite one of the biologists to

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.810 
part we invite one of the biologists to
collect<00:04:52.440> his<00:04:52.740> opinion<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.460> what<00:04:53.669> we<00:04:53.789> were

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
collect his opinion of what we were

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.110 
collect his opinion of what we were
doing<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:55.169> suddently

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
doing and suddently

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.610 
doing and suddently
these<00:04:57.210> biologists<00:04:57.900> think<00:04:57.990> we<00:04:58.290> need<00:04:58.470> an

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
these biologists think we need an

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.890 
these biologists think we need an
environmental<00:04:59.460> specialist<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.600> then<00:05:00.750> we

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
environmental specialist and then we

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.960 
environmental specialist and then we
need<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.080> flora<00:05:01.440> person<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.550> then<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:02.820> phone

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
need a flora person and then the phone

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.030 
need a flora person and then the phone
and<00:05:03.210> at<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.510> end<00:05:03.690> we<00:05:04.050> have<00:05:04.770> more

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
and at the end we have more

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.060 
and at the end we have more
environmental<00:05:05.820> people<00:05:06.600> in<00:05:06.919> biologists<00:05:07.919> and

the<00:05:18.330> green<00:05:18.900> team<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:19.470> i<00:05:19.620> invite<00:05:19.949> you<00:05:19.979> to<00:05:20.190> think

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
the green team and i invite you to think

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.060 
the green team and i invite you to think
about<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:21.210> because<00:05:21.930> if<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.199> are<00:05:22.320> really<00:05:22.740> into

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
about it because if you are really into

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.689 
about it because if you are really into
building<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.790> green<00:05:24.360> hotel<00:05:24.930> or<00:05:25.199> go

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
building a green hotel or go

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.950 
building a green hotel or go
environmental<00:05:26.699> you<00:05:26.880> have<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.330> have<00:05:27.540> this<00:05:27.720> kind

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
environmental you have to have this kind

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.290 
environmental you have to have this kind
of<00:05:28.139> programs<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:28.979> of<00:05:29.100> course<00:05:29.400> you<00:05:30.060> have<00:05:30.270> to

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
of programs and of course you have to

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.689 
of programs and of course you have to
have<00:05:30.720> somebody<00:05:30.990> that<00:05:31.260> is<00:05:31.590> fully<00:05:31.889> responsible

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
have somebody that is fully responsible

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.830 
have somebody that is fully responsible
and<00:05:33.270> has<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.810> authority<00:05:33.949> to<00:05:34.949> give<00:05:35.850> a<00:05:36.150> command

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
and has the authority to give a command

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.529 
and has the authority to give a command
to<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.260> other<00:05:37.440> areas<00:05:38.039> the<00:05:38.760> first<00:05:39.000> criteria

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
to the other areas the first criteria

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.290 
to the other areas the first criteria
was<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.930> reduce<00:05:40.320> impact<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.520> minimize<00:05:42.090> the

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
was the reduce impact and minimize the

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.750 
was the reduce impact and minimize the
fragmentation<00:05:42.900> of<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:43.440> present<00:05:43.919> ecosystems

fragmentation of the present ecosystems

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.750 
fragmentation of the present ecosystems
in<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.350> solution<00:05:46.350> was<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.919> we<00:05:47.100> consolidate

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
in the solution was that we consolidate

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.480 
in the solution was that we consolidate
infrastructure<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:48.930> located<00:05:49.710> in<00:05:49.860> areas<00:05:50.130> of

infrastructure and located in areas of
lesser<00:05:50.900> environmental<00:05:51.900> value<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.470> I<00:05:52.530> show<00:05:52.770> it

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
lesser environmental value and I show it

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.120 
lesser environmental value and I show it
