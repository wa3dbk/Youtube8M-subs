but there's not always going to be a

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.920 
but there's not always going to be a
keyboard<00:01:39.170> around<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.450> like<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.570> saw<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
keyboard around so like you saw in the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.100 
keyboard around so like you saw in the
house<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.290> guitars<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:44.240> guitar<00:01:44.420> has<00:01:44.630> six

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
house of guitars this guitar has six

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.670 
house of guitars this guitar has six
strings<00:01:45.470> e<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:48.010> D<00:01:49.420> G<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.350> that's<00:01:51.500> very

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
strings e a D G and that's very

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.750 
strings e a D G and that's very
important<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.400> G<00:01:53.830> it's<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:55.070> one<00:01:55.340> here

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.250 

that's<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.910> same<00:01:59.180> as<00:01:59.210> your<00:01:59.540> mandolin<00:02:00.020> open<00:02:00.410> G

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
that's the same as your mandolin open G

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.200 
that's the same as your mandolin open G
so<00:02:03.260> that's<00:02:03.440> we<00:02:03.590> tune<00:02:03.890> off<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.310> somebody<00:02:04.940> else's

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
so that's we tune off of somebody else's

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.670 
so that's we tune off of somebody else's
guitar<00:02:09.100> but<00:02:10.100> after<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.660> we'll<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.960> take

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
guitar but after that we'll have to take

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.500 
guitar but after that we'll have to take
the<00:02:12.830> frets<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:13.520> press<00:02:13.790> our<00:02:13.910> fingers<00:02:14.330> on

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
the frets and we press our fingers on

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.620
