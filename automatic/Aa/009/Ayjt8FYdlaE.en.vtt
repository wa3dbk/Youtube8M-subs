00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.040
 the police recorded two cases of 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.410
 attempt to steal or steal 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.360
 called blow of the carton machine 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.160
 the bandits present themselves as 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.890
 company employees the equipment 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.740
 being able to do maintenance gives us a 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.560
 way to prepare the machine for cloning 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.920
 the customers card lead consumers 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.770
 and companies 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.290
 In this shop 80% of purchases are made in 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.660
 machines are used with 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.600
 frequency because of this they go through 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.760
 constant maintenance and this service 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.190
 turned target of stellar 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.260
 the police recorded two 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.989
 blow of the field card machine 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.289
 one of the ways to act is to 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.559
 following false employees of companies 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.809
 they go to the shops they introduce themselves and try 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.679
 cloning equipment with the number of 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.409
 series 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.909
 the police alert the merchants 81 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.580
 service hours 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.189
 so here's the alert for the person 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.439
 identify yourself through a badge 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.290
 call center company which he 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.960
 represents to really know if you have 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.350
 a service order if there is a 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.710
 a form of maintenance is not specific 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.920
 in that region then all this is decreasing 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 this probability of the practice of 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.710
 crime 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.140
 vera already know company employee 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.420
 who does maintenance in the machine of the store 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.880
 believes he would not be caught by the coup 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.869
 because it takes the necessary care 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.509
 he has to do all the documentation 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.329
 have to change your company number 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.799
 that machine has to be in that role. 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.270
 How do you know if the movie is a 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.880
 take a little care to take a little 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.369
 the stroke of the card machine 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.100
 resembles the so - called suck-goat in the 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.189
 automatic teller machines for banks and 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.270
 can make victims without them 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.280
 The police are also aware that 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.590
 the merchant after taking all the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.420
 precautions are still not safe 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.700
 allow the employee to 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.620
 maintenance of the machine even more 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.620
 This was not requested by him.
