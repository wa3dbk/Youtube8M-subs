00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 that not all how is this short video 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.870
 is to announce the news of the day and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.940
 is that the sims 4 are already a reality 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.750
 electronic arts confirmed them 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.179
 officially for 2014 what will happen 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.880
 with the sims 3 well let's say you still 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.070
 there are some months of glory like 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.100
 we know in June the expansion will come out 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.930
 adventure the island and at the end of the year 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.519
 announced another expansion in which 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.380
 there will be trips to the future like a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.750
 accessories package on films 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.820
 famous so there are still some 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 surprises to see in the sims 3 and I'm going to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 play I will do well plays of both 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.460
 expansions and of course also to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.430
 gameplay of the sims 4 do not worry 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.000
 what else do we know about the sims 4 good 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.680
 that will be a single- player game 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.360
 again and that will not require connection to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.210
 constant internet I guess that what 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.640
 they announced for what happened with the last 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.710
 simcity in which the fans got angry 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.210
 a little bit because you needed to be 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.739
 connected to the internet constantly 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.020
 good in the sims 4 there will not be that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.789
 problem so that's great news and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.360
 well what else do we only know they put 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.390
 the official logo and a preview or a 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.150
 prior to how the sims and the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.800
 faces of the sims but more than that not 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.180
 they have said nothing so we will have to 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.830
 wait a little bit for them to go 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.720
 releasing more and more information 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.340
 if you want to see those images you can go to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.950
 my blog left the link in the description or 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.110
 the buyvip.com page because it was 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.870
 the page on which option the images 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.040
 for the first time then I think that that's 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.900
 all the information that I can give you 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.729
 I hope that the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.110
 who already knew this news that good 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.090
 They did not know it, so much better 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 can go to the celebration of the sims 4 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.410
 that will surely be very fun and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.119
 well for the moment I say goodbye I'm 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.570
