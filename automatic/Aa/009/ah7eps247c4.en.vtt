Amazon does a 175 to 200 gallons and it
comes<00:00:26.890> in<00:00:27.009> one<00:00:27.160> bag<00:00:27.429> so<00:00:27.699> I<00:00:27.759> got<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:28.000> use<00:00:28.090> the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
comes in one bag so I got to use the

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.599 
comes in one bag so I got to use the
whole<00:00:28.300> bag<00:00:28.630> takes<00:00:29.560> up<00:00:29.710> a<00:00:29.769> whole<00:00:29.920> basket<00:00:30.220> in<00:00:30.580> my

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
whole bag takes up a whole basket in my

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.479 
whole bag takes up a whole basket in my
fx5<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.439> I<00:00:32.739> try<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:34.030> Puritan<00:00:34.629> is<00:00:35.489> 250

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
fx5 so I try this the Puritan is 250

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.690 
fx5 so I try this the Puritan is 250
milliliters<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.829> 250<00:00:38.829> milliliters<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.430> good

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
milliliters and 250 milliliters is good

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.810 
milliliters and 250 milliliters is good
for<00:00:40.360> 250<00:00:41.110> gallons<00:00:41.590> so<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:41.920> know<00:00:42.370> milliliter

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
for 250 gallons so you know milliliter

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.720 
for 250 gallons so you know milliliter
per<00:00:43.120> gallon<00:00:43.629> so<00:00:43.809> I<00:00:44.410> only<00:00:44.710> have<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:44.949> use<00:00:44.980> half<00:00:45.460> of

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
per gallon so I only have to use half of

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.979 
per gallon so I only have to use half of
it<00:00:45.910> if<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:49.180> know<00:00:49.360> we'll<00:00:49.570> see<00:00:49.780> it's

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
it if that and you know we'll see it's

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.410 
it if that and you know we'll see it's
supposed<00:00:50.050> to<00:00:50.289> take<00:00:50.500> out<00:00:50.649> ammonia<00:00:51.420> nitrite

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
supposed to take out ammonia nitrite

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.770 
supposed to take out ammonia nitrite
nitrates<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.730> water<00:00:54.730> is<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:54.940> water<00:00:55.239> polisher

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
nitrates and water is a water polisher

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.410 
nitrates and water is a water polisher
also<00:00:56.199> and<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.699> supposed<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.030> do<00:00:58.149> five

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
also and it's supposed to do five

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.069 
also and it's supposed to do five
hundred<00:00:58.750> percent<00:00:59.050> better<00:00:59.260> than<00:00:59.559> most<00:01:00.280> media's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
hundred percent better than most media's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.720 
hundred percent better than most media's
so<00:01:02.079> we'll<00:01:02.289> see<00:01:02.559> because<00:01:03.039> the<00:01:03.160> chem<00:01:03.370> II<00:01:03.399> put<00:01:03.670> it

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
so we'll see because the chem II put it

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.550 
so we'll see because the chem II put it
on<00:01:03.850> don't<00:01:04.090> get<00:01:04.240> me<00:01:04.390> wrong<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.810> chem<00:01:05.020> II<00:01:05.050> purely

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
on don't get me wrong the chem II purely

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
on don't get me wrong the chem II purely
is<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.520> bomb<00:01:06.730> this<00:01:07.690> stuff<00:01:07.960> is<00:01:08.110> nice<00:01:08.770> man<00:01:09.160> it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
is the bomb this stuff is nice man it

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.400 
is the bomb this stuff is nice man it
takes<00:01:09.880> out<00:01:10.060> everything<00:01:10.540> plus<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:11.050> takes<00:01:11.200> out

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
takes out everything plus it takes out

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.230 
takes out everything plus it takes out
phosphates<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.730> makes<00:01:12.910> your<00:01:13.030> water

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
phosphates and it makes your water

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.030 
phosphates and it makes your water
crystal<00:01:13.690> clear<00:01:13.930> like<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.680> looks<00:01:14.860> like

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
crystal clear like it looks like

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.130 
crystal clear like it looks like
sometimes<00:01:15.310> I<00:01:15.850> don't<00:01:16.210> even<00:01:16.570> have<00:01:16.750> water<00:01:16.960> in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
sometimes I don't even have water in

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.790 
sometimes I don't even have water in
there<00:01:17.260> sometimes

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
there sometimes

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.370 
there sometimes
so<00:01:18.490> we'll<00:01:18.730> see<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.210> just<00:01:19.720> changed<00:01:20.080> over<00:01:20.290> my

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
so we'll see I just changed over my

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.310 
so we'll see I just changed over my
media<00:01:20.710> just<00:01:20.950> now<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> Pure's<00:01:22.690> into<00:01:22.870> my<00:01:22.990> FX

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
media just now put the Pure's into my FX

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.750 
media just now put the Pure's into my FX
file<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.750> we'll<00:01:25.750> see<00:01:26.050> my<00:01:26.650> tank<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.070> just<00:01:27.340> changed

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
file so we'll see my tank I just changed

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.670 
file so we'll see my tank I just changed
out<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:27.940> filter<00:01:28.420> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
out the filter and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.290 
out the filter and
no<00:01:29.680> out<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.040> lines<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.490> always<00:01:30.610> blows<00:01:30.910> that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
no out the lines it always blows that

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.600 
no out the lines it always blows that
stuff<00:01:31.540> out<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.830> blew<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.160> out<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.310> had<00:01:33.520> to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
stuff out and it blew it out I had to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.850 
stuff out and it blew it out I had to
water<00:01:33.760> all<00:01:33.970> cloudy<00:01:34.330> for<00:01:34.720> not<00:01:35.380> even<00:01:35.620> ten

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
water all cloudy for not even ten

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.520 
water all cloudy for not even ten
minutes<00:01:36.250> before<00:01:37.030> it's<00:01:37.780> just<00:01:37.870> crystal<00:01:38.500> clear

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.100 

we'll<00:01:42.160> see<00:01:42.610> ancar<00:01:42.940> box<00:01:43.150> it's<00:01:43.450> not<00:01:43.480> super

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
we'll see ancar box it's not super

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.590 
we'll see ancar box it's not super
crystal<00:01:44.440> clear<00:01:44.760> but<00:01:45.760> we'll<00:01:46.030> see

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
crystal clear but we'll see

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.510 
crystal clear but we'll see
