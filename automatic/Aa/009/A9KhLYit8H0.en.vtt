all<00:00:06.600> joined<00:00:07.020> together<00:00:07.170> by<00:00:07.470> crocheting<00:00:08.099> them

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
all joined together by crocheting them

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.030 
all joined together by crocheting them
together<00:00:08.700> versus<00:00:09.210> sewing<00:00:09.630> them<00:00:09.840> together<00:00:10.040> so

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
together versus sewing them together so

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
finishing the every square after that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.230 
finishing the every square after that
you're<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.039> joining<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:21.000> last

you're going to be joining the last
round<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.260> previous<00:00:22.769> square<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.330> my

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
round to the previous square so on my

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.870 
round to the previous square so on my
sample<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.650> I'm<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.250> using<00:00:26.519> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
in the first chain to form a ring and to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
in the first chain to form a ring and to
do<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.430> your

do that all you do is go back to your
first<00:01:15.090> chain<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.700> yarn<00:01:17.700> over<00:01:18.180> bring

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
first chain right here yarn over bring

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
first chain right here yarn over bring
that<00:01:18.600> through<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.409> bring<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.799> through

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that through and then bring that through

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
that through and then bring that through
the<00:01:21.299> loop<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.080> hook<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.530> that's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the loop that's on your hook and that's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.590 
the loop that's on your hook and that's
joining<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> slip<00:01:23.729> stitch<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
joining with a slip stitch and now you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840 
joining with a slip stitch and now you
have<00:01:24.930> your<00:01:25.170> center<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:25.920> ring<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.159> here

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
have your center of your ring right here

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.780 
have your center of your ring right here
and<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.470> working<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.610> end

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and I'm going to be working over the end

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.859 
and I'm going to be working over the end
of<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.270> starting<00:01:30.780> chain<00:01:31.079> also<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.840> says

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
of my starting chain also so now it says

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
of my starting chain also so now it says
to<00:01:34.590> chain<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.710> work<00:01:37.710> eight<00:01:37.950> single

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
to chain one and work eight single

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.960 
to chain one and work eight single
crochets<00:01:38.939> into<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:40.110> center<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.890> Ring<00:01:41.159> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
crochets into the center of the Ring so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:56.570 
crochets into the center of the Ring so
there's<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.479> two<00:01:46.040> three<00:01:48.320> four<00:01:50.810> five<00:01:53.570> six

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
there's one two three four five six

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.180 

seven<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:59.300> eight<00:02:00.300> and<00:02:00.690> one<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.800> reasons

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
seven and eight and one of the reasons

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.280 
seven and eight and one of the reasons
why<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.090> work<00:02:03.270> over<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.900> end<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.200> my

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
why I like to work over the end of my

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.830 
why I like to work over the end of my
starting<00:02:04.590> chain<00:02:05.010> is<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.790> times<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.690> this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
starting chain is for times like this

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.410 
starting chain is for times like this
when<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.680> hole<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.610> bit<00:02:08.760> big<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.240> my

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
when that hole is a little bit big in my

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.610 
when that hole is a little bit big in my
mind<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.340> pull<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:12.840> end<00:02:13.110> from<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
mind so if I just pull that end from a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.890 
mind so if I just pull that end from a
starting<00:02:14.100> chain<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.880> make<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.300> smaller

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
starting chain I can make that smaller

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.220 
starting chain I can make that smaller
and<00:02:16.970> then<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.180> hole<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> middle<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.080> not

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and then the hole in the middle is not

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.250 
and then the hole in the middle is not
so<00:02:19.470> big<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.760> then<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.690> do<00:02:21.870> here

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
so big so then what you want to do here

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.470 
so big so then what you want to do here
is<00:02:22.290> join<00:02:22.890> with<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> slip<00:02:23.400> stitch<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.210> first

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
is join with a slip stitch to the first

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.170 
is join with a slip stitch to the first
single<00:02:24.870> crochet<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:26.070> right<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:26.970> go

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
single crochet so right here I go

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.590 
single crochet so right here I go
underneath<00:02:27.660> those<00:02:27.990> two<00:02:28.020> loops<00:02:28.590> right<00:02:28.920> there

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
underneath those two loops right there

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.570 
underneath those two loops right there
and<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:31.080> draw<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> loop<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.310> bring<00:02:32.550> that

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
and I draw a loop up and then bring that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.850 
and I draw a loop up and then bring that
through<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> loop<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.510> my<00:02:33.570> hook<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.620> there's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
through the loop on my hook so there's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.680 
through the loop on my hook so there's
my<00:02:35.280> round<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:36.390> complete<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.760> says<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
my round one complete and now it says to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.820 
my round one complete and now it says to
chain<00:02:40.110> one<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.640> now
