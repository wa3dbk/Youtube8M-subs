 Let's pull it, then pull it tight. I can not. 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.150
 to vote that this girl will not undo 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.860
 so you have to pull it out here with 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.860

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.500
 that other side 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.890
 now we'll leave that touch of 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:17.050
 Come on, let's face it, do the same. 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.050
 thing on the other side let's get it here 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:30.130
 Let's go 43 times 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:32.590
 I am four in the head with a two 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.110
 three 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:42.860
 let's move the line in the middle 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.380
 let's pull will be like one's there 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:51.550
 hot made here is another line to 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.550
 pull this line here to there that node 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:00.380
 and now done that the two pulled the 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:06.950
 people will pull both and after a 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:12.980
 closed end and start pulling the 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:15.620
 two well done our meeting a tap 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.180
 Only then I'm going to take a break here at 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.260
 video I will cut the ends that 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.580
 It was enough to show you 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.919
 So I've already cut our 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.570
 ends is ours is not ready 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.250
 so it 's very simple to do is 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.250
 constituted as follows 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.410
 here's how he had done it 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.650
 I showed it to be three laps on one side 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.300
 three laps on the other pulls the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:44.169
 two sides 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:47.180
 and it gets tight and tightly attached 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:53.440
 having it stay 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:56.690
 3 lack of one side and the other side 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.150
 then in practice doing there a 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.990
 fishery of an emergency the whole line 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.510
