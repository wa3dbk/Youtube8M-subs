original stock that was found in South

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.790 
original stock that was found in South

from South Africa and it's been crossed

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.369 
from South Africa and it's been crossed
many<00:00:50.550> times<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.270> still<00:00:51.600> considered<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.199> South

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
many times I still considered a South

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.270 
many times I still considered a South
African<00:00:52.410> plant<00:00:53.899> in<00:00:54.899> agapanthus<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
African plant in agapanthus is just a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
African plant in agapanthus is just a
root<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.910> an<00:00:57.059> eye<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.440> cover<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
root with an eye so I just cover it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
root with an eye so I just cover it
about<00:00:59.070> three<00:00:59.370> inches<00:00:59.640> deep<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> full<00:01:00.750> hot

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
about three inches deep and a full hot

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.920 
about three inches deep and a full hot
Sun<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.940> they've<00:01:02.940> got<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.329> root<00:01:03.510> bound<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
Sun and they've got to be root bound to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.140 
Sun and they've got to be root bound to
bloom<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.799> trick<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> plant<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.850> 2<00:01:06.119> or

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
bloom so my trick is to plant like 2 or

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.929 
bloom so my trick is to plant like 2 or
3<00:01:06.270> bulbs<00:01:06.810> together<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.220> time<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
3 bulbs together at one time so that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.789 
3 bulbs together at one time so that
they're<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.390> mound<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.960> roots<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.560> want

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
they're just a mound of roots you want

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.010 
they're just a mound of roots you want
those<00:01:11.010> roots<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.490> crowded<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.750> more

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
those roots to be crowded so the more

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.940 
those roots to be crowded so the more
the<00:01:13.320> merrier

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the merrier

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
the merrier
whenever<00:01:14.400> I'm<00:01:14.640> planting<00:01:14.909> agapanthus<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.869> want

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
whenever I'm planting agapanthus I want

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
whenever I'm planting agapanthus I want
to<00:01:16.259> crowd<00:01:16.439> them<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.430> them<00:01:17.729> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
to crowd them because you want them to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.910 
to crowd them because you want them to
bloom<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.900> put<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.229> by<00:01:19.350> itself<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.799> might

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
bloom if you put one by itself you might

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
bloom if you put one by itself you might
not<00:01:20.100> get<00:01:20.189> blooms<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> couple<00:01:20.939> years<00:01:20.970> but

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
not get blooms for a couple years but

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.940 
not get blooms for a couple years but
you<00:01:21.450> put<00:01:21.570> three<00:01:21.840> or<00:01:21.869> four<00:01:22.170> together<00:01:22.590> you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you put three or four together you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.320 
you put three or four together you
should<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.220> blooms<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.640> first<00:01:23.850> summer<00:01:24.060> in

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
should get blooms that first summer in

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.620 
should get blooms that first summer in
full<00:01:25.170> hot<00:01:25.439> Sun<00:01:25.580> besides<00:01:26.580> white<00:01:26.909> there's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
full hot Sun besides white there's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.649 
full hot Sun besides white there's
another<00:01:27.930> popular<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.560> called<00:01:28.890> Pinocchio<00:01:29.659> or

another popular one called Pinocchio or
sometimes<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.500> similar<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.130> called<00:01:32.369> Peter

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
sometimes a similar one is called Peter

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
sometimes a similar one is called Peter
Pan<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.810> shorter<00:01:34.290> variety

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
Pan and it's a shorter variety

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.859 
Pan and it's a shorter variety
agapanthus<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.060> only<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> two<00:01:36.689> feet

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
agapanthus so it's only one to two feet

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.499 
agapanthus so it's only one to two feet
tall<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.220> it's<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> dark<00:01:38.700> dark<00:01:39.030> blue<00:01:39.299> as
