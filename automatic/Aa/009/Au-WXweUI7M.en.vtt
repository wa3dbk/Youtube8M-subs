so<00:01:42.040> for<00:01:42.430> me<00:01:42.549> I<00:01:42.909> would<00:01:43.060> probably<00:01:43.450> start<00:01:44.140> off

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
so for me I would probably start off

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.840 
so for me I would probably start off
labeling<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.890> stuff<00:01:45.130> but<00:01:45.310> then<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.520> would<00:01:45.670> end

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
labeling the stuff but then I would end

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.260 
labeling the stuff but then I would end

it where I want to trim it down I would

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.020 
it where I want to trim it down I would
recommend<00:02:11.770> leaving<00:02:11.890> about<00:02:12.160> half<00:02:12.550> an<00:02:12.700> inch<00:02:12.819> of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
recommend leaving about half an inch of

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.720 
recommend leaving about half an inch of
support<00:02:13.390> on<00:02:14.380> each<00:02:14.709> side<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.310> way<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.489> have

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
support on each side that way you have

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.760 
support on each side that way you have
enough<00:02:15.970> room<00:02:16.300> just<00:02:16.330> pull<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.870> down<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.530> it's

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
enough room just pull it down and it's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.220 
enough room just pull it down and it's
not<00:02:17.860> too<00:02:18.160> small<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:18.790> your<00:02:18.910> frame<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.810> then

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
not too small for your frame and then

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.900 
not too small for your frame and then
after<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:20.800> done<00:02:20.980> gluing<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.459> I'm<00:02:21.670> just

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
after I'm done gluing it I'm just

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.520 
after I'm done gluing it I'm just
flipping<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.390> over<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.870> then<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.260> actually

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
flipping it over and then it's actually

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.250 
flipping it over and then it's actually
