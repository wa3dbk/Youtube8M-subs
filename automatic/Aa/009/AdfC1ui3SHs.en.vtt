00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
from zeref in the mid game so you don't

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.590 
from zeref in the mid game so you don't
get<00:05:08.800> that<00:05:09.010> seat<00:05:09.700> with<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.000> cork<00:05:10.240> is<00:05:10.390> there

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
get that seat with the cork is there

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.870 
get that seat with the cork is there
from<00:05:10.840> CJ<00:05:11.350> and<00:05:11.560> then<00:05:11.980> of<00:05:12.130> course<00:05:12.160> because<00:05:12.670> while

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
from CJ and then of course because while

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.730 
from CJ and then of course because while
tol<00:05:13.120> got<00:05:13.360> so<00:05:13.630> many<00:05:13.780> early<00:05:14.110> kills<00:05:14.380> he<00:05:14.590> got

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
tol got so many early kills he got

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.440

straight to infinity edge phantom dancer

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.180 
straight to infinity edge phantom dancer
and<00:05:16.630> then<00:05:16.960> you<00:05:17.050> can<00:05:17.170> really<00:05:17.530> start<00:05:17.680> taking<00:05:18.100> the

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
and then you can really start taking the

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.160 
and then you can really start taking the
fights<00:05:18.430> from<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.210> side<00:05:19.420> of<00:05:19.570> team<00:05:19.750> Salomon

just great engages great shot Cole and
decision-making<00:05:22.750> everything<00:05:23.290> was<00:05:23.410> just

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
decision-making everything was just

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.470
