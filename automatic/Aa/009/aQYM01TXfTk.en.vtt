00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.130
 my dear ladies and gentlemen me 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.590
 Welcome to the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 Press conference after the playoff game 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.940
 between interests without bietigheim 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.640
 steelers endstand 1 to 2 after 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.900
 extension the whole before 3000 and 90 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.060
 spectators here in the energy network 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.289
 arena at the press conference like 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.640
 used to the two coaches 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.070
 on the one hand the trainer of our guests 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880
 Cadet and Thomas profitrainern the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.669
 meets 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.239
 First we want to give the guest the word 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.220
 to hand over 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.450
 I would be fine for a short 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.530
 have an assessment of today's game 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.910
 I was very happy with the two 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 first look mean 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.120
 I think we only have equal scoring 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.510
 given opportunities and as always 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.469
 excellent especially in first 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.329
 40 minutes everything kept the games 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.129
 of course, made tight and then afterwards 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.379
 the dresdners are better in the game 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.479
 come and the last title if the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.149
 overtime was just a battle that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.539
 was playoff hockey at the team 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.729
 seasoned in slices 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.570
 both goalies are very good 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.840
 held 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.149
 in an overtime both teams 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.009
 Some stand and both are keeper like 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.020
 told 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.080
 unbelievable and in the end it was 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.880
 happy team with that was one 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.490
 access to play or not 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.800
 I said since I am in this 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
 league that you need video proof 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.380
 that is when we live profiliga 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.539
 every premier league that I know have 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.539
 or yes and that is the reason 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.509
 for that, of course, I am happy 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.459
 that we got the gates and how 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.360
 said the happier team 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.959
 won 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.399
 Thank you so much amoled for 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.140
 Of course, his assessment goes one way 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.459
 in itself the question as a very 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.459
 close game how did you see that 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.099
 it was luck then kevin and then 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.319
 please no to the second victory 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.640
 yes, in principle, we already have 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.569
 I think everything belongs before the game 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 Summary 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.030
 I think we fought very well 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.819
 worked we know we play against 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.569
 the most offensively strong team of the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.849
 league with a lot of quality we can 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.830
 No hurray can afford it 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.910
 but have to defensively stand well 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.510
 have to watch that was before 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.370
 Pin stitches have the chances yes 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.970
 which we had not so good 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.879
 exploited 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.849
 just 5 to 3 out of each other must be easy 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.500
 have to make it more out of there accents 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.610
 set that we were not able 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.739
 then the game goes into the extension 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.909
 the man there was really a tough one 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.530
 fight for both teams with the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.150
 happier end very clear to please 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.680
 no 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.659
 my flap anyway for 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.000
 Video proof but for the gate I need 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.769
 no video proof because there clearly 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.370
 that the puck is behind the line 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.349
 if the siren comes so anyway 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.970
 it just does not matter we have to 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.459
 next to something will be good we have 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.659
 already get a few strokes and 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.220
 they will also take this away 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.290
 but it is getting more and more difficult 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.359
 just nations after such a game 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.950
 we have to look now that was that 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.480
 he can clear his head and we will 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.159
 of course aggressive after big 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.299
 Thank you very much for your 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.400
 assessment then it works now 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.549
 of course the possibility to ask the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:39.329
 to judge both coaches 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:41.970
 Who does not start asking no questions 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.700
 there are then the others 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.260
 the results look like the older ones 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.829
 the game between Rosenheim and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.220
 bremerhaven ends 2 to 3 landshut 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.049
 beats kassel with 4 to 1 we still have 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.609
 three games are not over yet 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.169
 were in the last third that was 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.109
 play between heilbronn and 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.709
