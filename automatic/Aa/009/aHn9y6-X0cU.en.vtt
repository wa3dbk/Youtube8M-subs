I'll just have the camera live on all
day<00:01:45.400> long<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.000> I've<00:01:46.540> put<00:01:46.720> some<00:01:46.930> casters<00:01:47.350> on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
day long and I've put some casters on

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.170 
day long and I've put some casters on
the<00:01:47.470> bottom<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:47.979> get<00:01:48.100> some<00:01:48.220> nicer<00:01:48.550> kind

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
the bottom and you get some nicer kind

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.310 
the bottom and you get some nicer kind
of<00:01:49.240> bigger<00:01:49.420> wheels<00:01:49.659> so<00:01:49.870> it<00:01:49.900> moves<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.260> little

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
of bigger wheels so it moves a little

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.500 
of bigger wheels so it moves a little
bit<00:01:50.500> easier<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.790> i'll<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.060> have<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.270> camera

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
figure after some kind of motorized head

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.629 
figure after some kind of motorized head
that<00:05:38.819> could<00:05:39.000> be<00:05:39.089> utilized<00:05:39.270> with<00:05:39.659> this<00:05:39.810> guy<00:05:40.639> the

that could be utilized with this guy the

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.920 
that could be utilized with this guy the
only<00:05:41.849> problem<00:05:42.060> with<00:05:42.210> that<00:05:42.240> obviously<00:05:42.659> is<00:05:42.839> it

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
only problem with that obviously is it

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.329 
only problem with that obviously is it
if<00:05:43.020> it's<00:05:43.139> a<00:05:43.259> drop-down<00:05:43.710> head<00:05:43.979> you're<00:05:44.159> going<00:05:44.279> to

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339 
if it's a drop-down head you're going to

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.760 
if it's a drop-down head you're going to
lose<00:05:44.520> some<00:05:45.210> some<00:05:45.779> distance<00:05:46.169> and<00:05:46.379> secondly

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
lose some some distance and secondly

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.529 
lose some some distance and secondly
just<00:05:47.279> make<00:05:47.400> some<00:05:47.550> more<00:05:47.639> complex<00:05:48.089> if<00:05:48.240> you're<00:05:48.389> up

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
just make some more complex if you're up

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.409 
just make some more complex if you're up
above<00:05:48.779> but<00:05:49.289> I<00:05:49.759> think<00:05:50.759> just<00:05:51.000> anyway<00:05:51.300> because

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
above but I think just anyway because

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:52.820 
above but I think just anyway because

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
bothersome to have a motorized head that

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.700 
bothersome to have a motorized head that
I<00:05:57.990> can<00:05:58.139> set<00:05:58.319> up<00:05:58.439> and<00:05:58.589> leave<00:05:58.710> there<00:05:58.919> so<00:05:59.370> anyway
