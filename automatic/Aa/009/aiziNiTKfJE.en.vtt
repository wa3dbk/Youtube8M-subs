00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 good morning I was asked to do 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.670
 several top video books and since not 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 I want to disappoint anyone slowly 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.280
 I will make you all happy 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.889
 today at seven deadly sins or the seven 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 sins of reading and video 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.800
 tag is not mine so I will leave in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.390
 description of the video the link 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.119
 to the original since originally 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.100
 in English the translated and I will leave you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 also the questions in the description qual 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.070
 is the most expensive book you own 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.750
 which is less expensive 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.119
 reading a lot I am a lot 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.399
 short arm so I try to buy 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 the cheapest books that exist 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.430
 because more books are more economical 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.950
 I can predict by spending the same 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.379
 so the most expensive figure is mine 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.059
 despite the vacant seat that I was 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.610
 re-reading so I put a sheet in it 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.430
 randomly and I took it as soon as it came out then 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.289
 I paid the beauty of 22 euros 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.629
 if I think about it, I still feel guilty 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.920
 book less expensive but well I think that 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.860
 it is obvious why this also made one 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 review dreams of dinelli blood 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.930
 and I paid him 99 cents 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.180
 he is not the only one for whom I spent so little 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.790
 because you know that in any case 99 cents 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.740
 they are a nice solid necklace though 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 that's what I read faster 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.260
 so with which author you have one 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.119
 love relationship hate zoran as it is 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.189
 a Serbian author and he is among mine 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.009
 however, I prefer the same time 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.369
 I hate the hate to die because why 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.650
 despite the mediocre style it is so 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.540
 original that you come to the end and there 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.950
 one remains very ill and the ending is 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.720
 exactly the opposite of what 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.820
 it was expected and it is not just the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.619
 contrary is the opposite of the opposite 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.140
 so if I expect that a 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.810
 alive character and I know that he reasons to 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909
 contrary to stuff the character will die 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.740
 but no he does not let you end up in a coma 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.689
 obviously it is an example but it is to do 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.689
 understand how he can be 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.909
 amazing and many of its endings do not 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.890
 they understand each other that even everyone understands 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.049
 what he wants and that is the thing 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.670
 beautiful and ugly type b is there 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.860
 time itself is horrible 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.180
 which book you delightfully devoured 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.280
 several times without any 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.180
 pillory what I've devoured several times 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.190
 I think this is where you obviously do 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.810
 you will all wait because I said more 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.710
 times to find myself in the character of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.060
 matilda but the reality is that I read it 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.860
 many times and despite being a 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.959
 children's book continues rereading it 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
 because it is really beautiful and it has been 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.680
 my childhood and every time 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.390
 I reread I get excited again among other things 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 even the film is very well done and me 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.280
 I always start to cry in it 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.020
 point 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.940
 which book you avoided reading for 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.980
 away of his laziness I must admit 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.020
 that I don't do it very often I don't 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.209
 I leave scared by the number of pages or 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.820
 in fact the difficulty of the subject 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.739
 for better or worse I've always finished them all 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.250
 but my novels have had quite a few 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.680
 problems in finishing this than perhaps from 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.770
 not even seen here but at the level of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.900
 in fact at 1,069 pages and then 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.160
 for goodness sake it is beautiful 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.190
 read it and I recommend it absolutely 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.630
 however, struggling to finish it than 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.190
 book you talk more to look like a 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.480
 intellectual reader seem 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.820
 intellectual is not something to which 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.769
 I aspire I read to amuse myself for 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.530
 learn something to live other lives 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.510
 other worlds is not something I do 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.790
 to be smarter or to 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.519
 it seems to be busy though that 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.680
 when I talk about this book I feel 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.830
 always very clever almost 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.730
 aristocratic I'm talking about 1984's 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.410
 george orwell 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.360
 in short, there would be so much to say about 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.280
 this novel also talked about it in 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.470
 several movies a year cited because 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.110
 however, it is extremely important 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.459
 deals with the very serious issues that 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.680
 they are also quite difficult to 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.209
 to understand I avoid as much as possible of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.680
 talk about orwell because the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.959
 conversation is usually known when 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.269
 it starts but not when it ends because there 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.790
 it's billions of things to say about orwell 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.829
 and I try to hold myself back for this reason 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.690
 usually discussions end 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.190
 also in dtt which attributes you find more 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.010
 attractive in male characters o 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.500
 female 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.299
 heiter aziz i will tell you about the various 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.140
 attributes that the characters prefer 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.150
 male 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.890
 hence the basis of the attributes that 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.269
 like male characters is that in 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.569
 effects have the attributes 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.099
 my ideal character I owe 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.989
 to admit is also very influenced 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.379
 by the actor who plays this 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.890
 character in the film is that great 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.870
 james 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.549
 I really admire game not like 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.900
 character but also as a person because 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.970
 if it were a person it would be me 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.070
 hopelessly in love with him because he is 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.100
 all a girl wants is 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.990
 virile is rebel fights power 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.880
 helps the oppressed is willing to 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.199
 sacrifice his life for others 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.880
 for a better world 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.949
 and of course he would do anything for the 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.169
 girl who loves specifically katniss 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.160
 even if a little impulsive a little head 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.380
 hot 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.090
 I really like it because besides being 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.830
 a great soldier for me is also 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.539
 a great person nowadays where 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.280
 I find in eighteen years that it breaks the 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.070
 back to keep the mother and i 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.960
 little brothers don't find it because it comes a 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.639
 character who does not live in these years 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.720
 which books you would like to receive as a gift 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.849
 well i don't just have a list myself a 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.030
 I will show you the book of the lists 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.940
 just the first page because otherwise 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.370
 we do tomorrow anyway or the books put 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.130
 on two columns with the surname size 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.979
 of the name and title and each time it is 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.599
 I obviously buy the gate 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.970
 a date that there are three erasures 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.740
 cross and unfortunately but I have all my life 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.389
 to buy them no good faults were i 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.900
 my seven deadly sins related 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.940
 to reading 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.949
 what are your let me know in 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.789
 comments or with a video answer to 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.789
 next guys hello 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.560
 Oh God, but you must end up in hell for 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.560
 this stuff
