the<00:00:04.319> new<00:00:04.650> intermediate<00:00:05.400> single<00:00:05.819> track<00:00:06.029> that's

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
the new intermediate single track that's

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.299 
the new intermediate single track that's
being<00:00:06.450> built<00:00:06.540> as<00:00:06.990> we<00:00:07.170> speak<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.680> next<00:00:08.040> trail

being built as we speak the next trail
we're<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> add<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.240> our<00:00:09.269> quiver<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.960> I

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
we're going to add to our quiver and I

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.780 
we're going to add to our quiver and I
want<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> take<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.830> along<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.370> check<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.670> out

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
want to take you along to check it out

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.560 
want to take you along to check it out
let's<00:00:12.150> go<00:00:17.060> essentially<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> beginning<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
let's go essentially the beginning of

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.179 
let's go essentially the beginning of
the<00:00:18.690> new<00:00:18.810> intermediate<00:00:19.350> single<00:00:19.650> track<00:00:19.859> trail

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the new intermediate single track trail

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.040 
the new intermediate single track trail
will<00:00:20.730> branch<00:00:21.060> off<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.570> about<00:00:21.689> where

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
will branch off right about where

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.470 
will branch off right about where
slingshot<00:00:22.619> wilkie<00:00:23.130> branches<00:00:23.609> off<00:00:23.760> from<00:00:24.029> rock

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
slingshot wilkie branches off from rock
crusher<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> intersection<00:00:26.070> will<00:00:26.160> be

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
crusher so the intersection will be

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
crusher so the intersection will be
essentially<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> same<00:00:27.090> off<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> right

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
essentially the same off to the right

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.460 
essentially the same off to the right
towards<00:00:28.320> hagen<00:00:28.800> hill<00:00:29.869> then<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> trail<00:00:31.230> runs

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
towards hagen hill then the trail runs

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260 
towards hagen hill then the trail runs
across<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.980> run<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.399> starts<00:00:32.730> making<00:00:32.880> its<00:00:33.210> way

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
across the run and starts making its way

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.600 
across the run and starts making its way
down<00:00:33.530> following<00:00:34.530> essentially<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> contours

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
down following essentially the contours

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.360 
down following essentially the contours
of<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> run<00:00:36.059> toward<00:00:36.630> time<00:00:37.050> ill<00:00:40.219> there's<00:00:41.219> still

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
of the run toward time ill there's still

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.250 
of the run toward time ill there's still
a<00:00:41.399> couple<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.850> patches<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.180> snow<00:00:42.420> near<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.020> top

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a couple of patches of snow near the top

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.970 
a couple of patches of snow near the top
but<00:00:43.710> they're<00:00:44.129> melted<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.610> quickly

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.440 

one<00:00:53.550> thing<00:00:53.760> that's<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.300> interesting

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
one thing that's going to be interesting

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.479 
one thing that's going to be interesting
about<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:54.989> new<00:00:55.170> trail<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.950> number<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
about this new trail is the number of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.370 
about this new trail is the number of
stream<00:00:57.150> crossings<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.809> will<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
stream crossings that will be on it

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.260 
stream crossings that will be on it
we've<00:00:59.010> got<00:00:59.220> our<00:00:59.250> work<00:00:59.460> cut<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.030> us<00:01:00.059> in

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
we've got our work cut out for us in

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.210 
we've got our work cut out for us in
terms<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.600> bridge<00:01:00.870> building<00:01:01.290> on<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.650> one<00:01:01.860> but

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
terms of bridge building on this one but

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.750 
terms of bridge building on this one but
our<00:01:02.699> guys<00:01:02.850> are<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> challenge

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.910 

so<00:01:10.720> there's<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> lot<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.110> sections<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.680> we've

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
so there's a lot of sections that we've

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.530 
so there's a lot of sections that we've
pretty<00:01:12.280> tightly<00:01:12.520> in<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:12.970> out<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.270> trees

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
pretty tightly in and out of the trees

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.960 
pretty tightly in and out of the trees
and<00:01:13.810> then<00:01:14.080> go<00:01:14.320> cross<00:01:14.680> run<00:01:15.070> out<00:01:15.370> into<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.820> open

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
and then go cross run out into the open

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.220 
and then go cross run out into the open
meadows<00:01:16.450> it's<00:01:16.960> going<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.140> be<00:01:17.260> super<00:01:17.470> fun

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.300 

it<00:01:24.230> eventually<00:01:24.440> turns<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.890> little<00:01:25.070> bit<00:01:25.190> more

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
it eventually turns a little bit more

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.220 
it eventually turns a little bit more
downhill<00:01:25.790> towards<00:01:26.240> squirrel<00:01:26.840> trail<00:01:27.080> if

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
downhill towards squirrel trail if

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.510 
downhill towards squirrel trail if
you're<00:01:27.320> familiar<00:01:27.500> with<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.830> area<00:01:27.980> in<00:01:28.400> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
you're familiar with that area in the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.850 
you're familiar with that area in the
woods

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.840 

right<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.010> bat<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.460> tell<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> i<00:01:38.730> am

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
super excited to ride this trail there's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.800 
super excited to ride this trail there's
going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.190> opportunities<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.570> open

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
going to be opportunities to really open

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.780 
going to be opportunities to really open
up<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.410> some<00:01:43.590> speed<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.250> well<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.640> some

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
up and get some speed as well as some

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.570 
up and get some speed as well as some
tight<00:01:45.000> turns<00:01:45.390> within<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.080> trees<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.680> it

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
tight turns within the trees and it

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:56.810 
tight turns within the trees and it
looks<00:01:47.760> beautiful

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.950 

the<00:01:57.820> trail<00:01:58.030> works<00:01:58.270> its<00:01:58.479> way<00:01:58.540> through<00:01:58.659> the

the trail works its way through the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.840 
the trail works its way through the
trees<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.619> eventually<00:02:00.070> ends<00:02:00.310> up<00:02:00.400> down<00:02:00.610> at<00:02:00.760> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
trees and eventually ends up down at the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.060 
trees and eventually ends up down at the
bottom<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.240> Putin<00:02:01.659> hauler<00:02:01.900> where<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.650> meets<00:02:02.799> up

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
bottom of Putin hauler where it meets up

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.160

with<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.280> top<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.790> Daisy<00:02:04.119> that's<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.990> point

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
with the top of Daisy that's the point

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.990 
with the top of Daisy that's the point
where<00:02:05.380> we<00:02:05.470> want<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.710> get<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.920> trail<00:02:06.159> before<00:02:06.610> we

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
where we want to get the trail before we

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.859 
where we want to get the trail before we
open<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.690> early<00:02:08.080> August<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:10.750> you

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
open it in early August and there you

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.090 
open it in early August and there you
have<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.050> that's<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.350> quick<00:02:11.500> preview<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.920> the
