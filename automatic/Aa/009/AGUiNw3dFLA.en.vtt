00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
and it has been almost two months since

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.660 
and it has been almost two months since
my<00:00:08.820> last<00:00:09.000> update<00:00:09.679> so<00:00:10.679> two<00:00:10.740> months<00:00:11.130> ago<00:00:11.250> I

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
my last update so two months ago I

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.120 
my last update so two months ago I
decided<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.420> cut<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.929> plant<00:00:13.320> completely<00:00:13.740> off

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
decided to cut this plant completely off

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.039 
decided to cut this plant completely off
I<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.670> three<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.120> them<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.389> cut<00:00:15.570> them<00:00:15.660> all<00:00:15.839> off

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I have three of them I cut them all off

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.640 
I have three of them I cut them all off
but<00:00:16.680> then<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.920> decided<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.520> trash<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.650> habanero

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
but then I decided to trash the habanero

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.830 
but then I decided to trash the habanero
so<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.250> only<00:00:20.609> kept<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.180> one<00:00:21.390> because<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> was

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
so I only kept this one because it was

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.170 
so I only kept this one because it was
doing<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> best<00:00:22.560> after<00:00:23.369> cutting<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.910> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
doing the best after cutting this a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.509 
doing the best after cutting this a
month<00:00:24.510> later<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.080> started<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> grow<00:00:25.890> back<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
month later it started to grow back and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.089 
month later it started to grow back and
so<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.060> looks<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.990> haven't<00:00:28.619> done<00:00:28.769> anything

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
so it looks like I haven't done anything

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
so it looks like I haven't done anything
to<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> plant<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.660> I'll<00:00:30.779> include

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
to the plant at all but I'll include

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.810 
to the plant at all but I'll include
some<00:00:31.199> pictures<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.369> hit<00:00:32.579> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
some pictures of what they hit this

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.220 
some pictures of what they hit this
plane<00:00:33.090> looked<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.450> when<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:33.989> cut

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
plane looked like when it was all cut

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.250 
plane looked like when it was all cut
down

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.880 

you

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.010 

so<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:50.920> basically<00:00:51.370> trimmed<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.329> entire<00:00:52.660> tree

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
so I basically trimmed the entire tree

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.420 
so I basically trimmed the entire tree
off<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.469> just<00:00:53.680> about<00:00:54.510> six<00:00:55.510> inches<00:00:55.809> left<00:00:56.079> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
off to just about six inches left and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.389 
off to just about six inches left and
now<00:00:57.430> they<00:00:57.699> are<00:00:58.000> starting<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.510> come<00:00:58.750> back<00:00:58.780> so

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
now they are starting to come back so

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.840 
now they are starting to come back so
check<00:01:00.399> this<00:01:00.519> one<00:01:00.579> out<00:01:00.760> so<00:01:01.149> this<00:01:01.390> was<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
check this one out so this was the this

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.910 
check this one out so this was the this
wasn't<00:01:04.150> was<00:01:04.239> my<00:01:04.360> mystery<00:01:04.809> plant<00:01:05.080> but<00:01:05.590> after

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
wasn't was my mystery plant but after

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.490 
wasn't was my mystery plant but after
looking<00:01:06.550> further<00:01:07.090> into<00:01:07.270> this<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:07.930> think<00:01:08.020> this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
looking further into this I think this

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
looking further into this I think this
is<00:01:08.560> um<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.700> bohemian<00:01:10.420> goat<00:01:10.750> because<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.770> tested

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
is um the bohemian goat because I tested

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.580 
is um the bohemian goat because I tested
the<00:01:12.640> fruits<00:01:12.940> against<00:01:13.420> other<00:01:13.659> Mahane<00:01:14.020> bohemian

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
the fruits against other Mahane bohemian

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.800 
the fruits against other Mahane bohemian
goats<00:01:14.799> and<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.159> looked<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.549> up<00:01:15.640> online<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.270> it

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
goats and I looked it up online and it

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.810 
goats and I looked it up online and it
tastes<00:01:17.140> just<00:01:17.170> like<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.920> Bohemian<00:01:18.430> goat<00:01:18.640> as

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
tastes just like the Bohemian goat as

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.450 
tastes just like the Bohemian goat as
well<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:20.470> mystery<00:01:20.890> plan<00:01:21.070> is<00:01:21.250> probably

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
well so this mystery plan is probably

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.669 
well so this mystery plan is probably
the<00:01:21.789> Bohemian<00:01:22.270> goat<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:23.440> a<00:01:23.500> very

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
the Bohemian goat it's a very

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.950 
the Bohemian goat it's a very
nice-looking<00:01:23.920> plant<00:01:24.550> that<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.270> fruits<00:01:25.690> are

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
nice-looking plant that the fruits are

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.990 
nice-looking plant that the fruits are
beautiful<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.800> orange<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.429> it<00:01:27.550> tastes

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
beautiful and orange and it tastes

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.210 
beautiful and orange and it tastes
really<00:01:28.149> good<00:01:28.360> too<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:28.630> as<00:01:28.750> well

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:55.260 

you

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.580 

the<00:01:56.270> flowers<00:01:56.630> are<00:01:56.750> all<00:01:56.810> coming<00:01:57.170> back<00:01:57.200> right

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
the flowers are all coming back right

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
the flowers are all coming back right
now<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:59.080> started<00:02:00.080> pollinating<00:02:01.009> this<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.400> same

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
now I started pollinating this the same

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.210 
now I started pollinating this the same
way<00:02:01.790> as<00:02:02.119> I've<00:02:02.270> done<00:02:02.450> before<00:02:02.659> just<00:02:03.530> using<00:02:03.950> a

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
way as I've done before just using a

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.749 
way as I've done before just using a
q-tip<00:02:04.670> or<00:02:05.440> just<00:02:06.440> go<00:02:06.650> to<00:02:06.710> each<00:02:06.979> branch<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.580> just

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
q-tip or just go to each branch and just

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.790 
q-tip or just go to each branch and just
sort<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.119> shake<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:09.649> would

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
sort of shake it like that that would

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.190 
sort of shake it like that that would
work<00:02:09.830> as<00:02:10.130> well<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:12.620> also<00:02:12.830> have<00:02:13.130> my<00:02:13.400> Reaper

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
work as well and I also have my Reaper

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.260 
work as well and I also have my Reaper
but<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.380> Reaper<00:02:15.739> has<00:02:16.250> some<00:02:16.730> sort<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.030> leaf

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
but the Reaper has some sort of leaf

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.330 
but the Reaper has some sort of leaf
problem<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.959> I'm<00:02:18.050> afraid<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.620> some<00:02:19.130> it

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
problem and I'm afraid it is some it

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.250 
problem and I'm afraid it is some it
might<00:02:19.520> be<00:02:19.670> some<00:02:19.910> kind<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.209> infection<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.230> I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
might be some kind of infection so I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.820 
might be some kind of infection so I
separated<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:22.190> from<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.660> other<00:02:23.870> one<00:02:24.110> so

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
separated it from this this other one so

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.070 
separated it from this this other one so
as<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.100> can<00:02:25.190> see<00:02:25.250> they<00:02:25.670> believe<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.690> having<00:02:27.019> a

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
as you can see they believe is having a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.020 
as you can see they believe is having a
little<00:02:27.380> problem<00:02:27.709> there<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:28.130> don't<00:02:28.790> know<00:02:28.880> what

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
little problem there I don't know what

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.210 
little problem there I don't know what
that<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.470> don't<00:02:30.680> want<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.920> keep<00:02:31.069> it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
that is but I don't want to keep it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.699 
that is but I don't want to keep it
together<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.819> other<00:02:31.970> plant<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:33.410> this

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
together with the other plant but this

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.979 
together with the other plant but this
one<00:02:33.890> has<00:02:34.010> been<00:02:34.040> cut<00:02:34.430> down<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.790> well<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.450> just

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
one has been cut down as well to just
