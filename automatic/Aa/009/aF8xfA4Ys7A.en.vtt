00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.480
 How it sounds 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.190
 Today I eat sounds that have grown on the street 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.770
 I set my direction without meaning living in detail If there is a tear a heartbeat will be here 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.680
 on the street Because being alive is a priority when sound 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.300
 explode 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.090
 Today I eat sounds that have grown on the street 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.680
 I set my direction without meaning living in detail If there is a tear a heartbeat will be here 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.570
 on the street Because being alive is a priority when sound 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.040
 explode 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.250
 Between awake asleep dreaming of changes I open my eyes early to the reality in which 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.190
 I live while my leader my sign compiled positive 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 And from experience my psychoactive state was formed 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.840
 I've been an addicted rap consuming between the lines 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.990
 Every harmful word does not waste the rhymes Constant to this my Chinese 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.960
 I knew avarice And my verbal richness increases with my greed 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.970
 The street is in my way everyone lives different I do not kill people on sidewalks to create awareness is 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.119
 my instinct Like everyone with problems but I do not facilitate 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.790
 I support myself with nothing in the world is free 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.650
 I learned it ... Between sound and street 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.390
 I understand that ... I grow up because of what I struggle 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.109
 And I continue like this ... Pa 'that life carve me 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.789
 And at every point I will be with my street sound 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.390
 I learned it ... Between sound and street 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.119
 I understand that ... I grow up because of what I struggle 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.090
 And I continue like this ... Pa 'that life carve me 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.780
 And at every point I will be with my street sound 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.630
 Now I do not understand I do not understand everything is different Mark the destination as many I followed my 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.399
 instinct If I represent the street 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.130
 I have tattooed on my soul that both good and evil 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.520
 They mark a pattern in life 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.329
 And still ... Sometimes it's not enough 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.069
 Fight because ... If the fight is so hurtful 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.829
 It's just a matter of choosing what you want 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.549
 To distinguish the options And to face what comes 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.439
 I distrust the good but learn to smile Because not everything is so bad when you learn 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.369
 to live If people stop their dreams because of fears 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.560
 They will not learn that suffering becomes more 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.450
 strong the human 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.360
 I have always thought about continuing in an eradicable habit But it is difficult to continue when it is necessary 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.099
 an alum I find the road dark but there are no buts 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.220
 in this And I recover my life venting in the texts 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.930
 I learned it ... Between sound and street 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.630
 I understand that ... I grow up because of what I struggle 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.580
 And I continue like this ... Pa 'that life carve me 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.300
 And at every point I will be with my street sound 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.830
 I learned it ... Between sound and street 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.590
 I understand that ... I grow up because of what I struggle 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.290
 And I continue like this ... Pa 'that life carve me 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.370
 And at every point I will be with my street sound 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.330
 I had an option that I converted today decision 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.920
 And I know that the only thing that people need to follow 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.060
 It's a reason 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.890
 Do not lose faith And keep looking for that priority that drives 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.960
 to the human being Because I 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.180
 Because I 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.180
 I learned it ... Between sound and street 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.300
 I understand that ... I grow up because of what I struggle 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.210
 And I continue like this ... Pa 'that life carve me 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.590
 and at every point I will be with my street sound. I learned it.
