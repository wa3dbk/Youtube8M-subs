00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
looking at the screen because I'm like

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.900

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
looks like at the back because I've not

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.910 
looks like at the back because I've not
seen<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.790> back<00:02:49.940> obviously<00:02:50.360> but<00:02:51.230> basically<00:02:51.590> I

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
seen the back obviously but basically I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.090 
seen the back obviously but basically I
tend<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.520> split<00:02:52.760> my<00:02:52.970> hair<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.330> half<00:02:53.480> anyway<00:02:54.100> and

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
tend to split my hair in half anyway and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.400 
tend to split my hair in half anyway and
when<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.280> wear<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.670> curls<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.180> just<00:02:57.050> split

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
when I wear it in curls and just split

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.910 
when I wear it in curls and just split
it<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.620> half

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
it in half

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.570 
it in half
curl<00:02:58.760> each<00:02:58.970> side<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.540> then<00:02:59.690> that's<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.350> um

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
curl each side and then that's it um

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.979 
curl each side and then that's it um
hopefully<00:03:01.580> there's<00:03:01.940> no<00:03:02.030> straight<00:03:02.420> bits<00:03:02.630> I'm
