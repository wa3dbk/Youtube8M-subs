all<00:00:04.510> right<00:00:04.660> so<00:00:04.810> what<00:00:04.930> I<00:00:04.960> thought<00:00:05.170> I'd<00:00:05.319> do<00:00:05.529> is

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
all right so what I thought I'd do is

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.820 
all right so what I thought I'd do is
I'd<00:00:05.859> do<00:00:05.980> a<00:00:06.010> quick<00:00:06.100> follow-up<00:00:06.609> video<00:00:06.940> to<00:00:07.830> the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830 
I'd do a quick follow-up video to the

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.650 
I'd do a quick follow-up video to the

Nexus 10 miracast test that I did a few
weeks<00:00:10.809> ago<00:00:11.110> and<00:00:11.559> when<00:00:11.679> here<00:00:11.860> we're<00:00:11.980> using<00:00:12.160> a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
the settings I'm going to go to the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.260 
the settings I'm going to go to the
display<00:00:23.520> and<00:00:24.520> then<00:00:24.730> I'm<00:00:24.820> going<00:00:24.910> to<00:00:25.000> go<00:00:25.090> down<00:00:25.240> to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
the bond I'm going to screencast and if

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.240 
the bond I'm going to screencast and if
you<00:00:28.960> don't<00:00:29.140> pick<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.470> device<00:00:29.710> up<00:00:29.920> right<00:00:30.070> there

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
you don't pick the device up right there

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.350 
you don't pick the device up right there
you<00:00:30.370> might<00:00:30.550> need<00:00:30.670> to<00:00:30.760> go<00:00:30.880> up<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.150> upper

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
you might need to go up to the upper

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.959 
you might need to go up to the upper
corner<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.020> say<00:00:32.980> Nabal<00:00:33.309> wireless<00:00:33.790> display

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
corner and say Nabal wireless display

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.650 
corner and say Nabal wireless display
and<00:00:35.130> then<00:00:36.130> it<00:00:36.250> picks<00:00:36.460> up<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.760> net<00:00:37.180> gear<00:00:37.390> push

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
and then it picks up the net gear push

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.860 
and then it picks up the net gear push
to<00:00:37.840> TV<00:00:38.370> Pvt<00:00:39.370> 3000<00:00:40.000> so<00:00:40.420> I'm<00:00:40.510> going<00:00:40.660> to<00:00:40.690> I<00:00:40.780> can

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
to TV Pvt 3000 so I'm going to I can

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:53.830 
to TV Pvt 3000 so I'm going to I can
click<00:00:40.900> on<00:00:41.170> that

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.990 

all<00:00:54.770> right<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.070> says<00:00:55.250> connected<00:00:55.730> here<00:00:55.970> so

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
all right so it says connected here so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.570 
all right so it says connected here so
we're<00:00:56.330> good<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.570> go<00:00:56.630> I'm<00:00:56.870> gonna<00:00:57.310> swipe<00:00:58.310> back

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
we're good to go I'm gonna swipe back

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.070 
we're good to go I'm gonna swipe back
and<00:00:58.760> forth<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:59.030> few<00:00:59.060> times<00:00:59.390> just<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.750> kind<00:01:00.020> of

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
and forth a few times just to kind of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.390 
and forth a few times just to kind of
give<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:00.260> an<00:01:00.410> idea<00:01:00.440> of<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:00.920> kind<00:01:01.130> of<00:01:01.220> lag

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
give you an idea of the kind of lag

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.670 
give you an idea of the kind of lag
we're<00:01:01.640> looking<00:01:01.880> at<00:01:02.030> here<00:01:02.360> it<00:01:03.230> doesn't<00:01:03.410> appear

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
we're looking at here it doesn't appear

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.320 
we're looking at here it doesn't appear
to<00:01:03.710> be<00:01:03.920> too<00:01:04.100> bad<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:04.519> seems<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.879> be<00:01:05.000> right<00:01:05.150> in

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
to be too bad it seems to be right in

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.510 
to be too bad it seems to be right in
line<00:01:05.570> with<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:08.660> Nexus<00:01:09.350> 10<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.860> we<00:01:09.950> tested

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.850 

I've<00:01:13.520> got<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:13.790> stopwatch<00:01:14.090> here<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.960> thought<00:01:15.710> what

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
I've got a stopwatch here I thought what

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.920 
I've got a stopwatch here I thought what
I<00:01:15.890> would<00:01:15.979> do<00:01:16.250> is<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.460> would<00:01:16.610> actually<00:01:16.940> run<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
I would do is I would actually run the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.500 
I would do is I would actually run the
stopwatch<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.680> then<00:01:19.369> at<00:01:19.910> some<00:01:20.090> point<00:01:20.330> when

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
stopwatch and then at some point when

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.969 
stopwatch and then at some point when
I'm<00:01:20.600> editing<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.110> video<00:01:21.380> what<00:01:21.619> I'll<00:01:21.740> do<00:01:21.890> is

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
I'm editing the video what I'll do is

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.040 
I'm editing the video what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:22.100> actually<00:01:22.280> pause<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.880> video<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.600> you'll

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
I'll actually pause the video and you'll

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.109 
I'll actually pause the video and you'll
be<00:01:24.200> able<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.440> see<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.850> discrepancy<00:01:25.850> or<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
be able to see the discrepancy or the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.889 
be able to see the discrepancy or the
lag<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:28.520> that's<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.000> good<00:01:29.210> way<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.390> tell<00:01:29.660> the

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
lag and that's a good way to tell the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.990 
lag and that's a good way to tell the
benchmark<00:01:30.380> was<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.890> know<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.580> was<00:01:31.700> kind<00:01:31.910> of

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
benchmark was you know it was kind of

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.780 
benchmark was you know it was kind of
neat<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:32.450> little<00:01:32.630> bit<00:01:32.750> more<00:01:32.930> visual<00:01:33.320> but

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
neat and a little bit more visual but

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.120 
neat and a little bit more visual but
this<00:01:34.790> is<00:01:34.940> probably<00:01:35.240> more<00:01:35.450> accurate<00:01:35.830> in<00:01:36.830> terms

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
this is probably more accurate in terms

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.190 
this is probably more accurate in terms
of<00:01:37.340> actually<00:01:37.880> being<00:01:38.030> able<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.330> detect<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
of actually being able to detect the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:48.609 
of actually being able to detect the
delay

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:57.170 

all<00:01:49.619> right<00:01:53.780> one<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.649> obviously<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.520> audio<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
all right one and obviously the audio is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389 
all right one and obviously the audio is
coming<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> TV<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.470> it's<00:01:59.189> being

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
coming out of the TV as it's being

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.130 
coming out of the TV as it's being
transferred<00:01:59.789> through<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> HDMI<00:02:00.810> device

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
transferred through to the HDMI device

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.649 
transferred through to the HDMI device
so<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.210> mayor<00:02:03.390> cast

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
so I think that the the mayor cast

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.179 
so I think that the the mayor cast
functionality<00:02:04.200> works<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.619> fine<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
functionality works just fine on this

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.960 
functionality works just fine on this

Nexus 7 there seems to be no no issues
with<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.630> lag<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.860> terms<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.580> major

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
with the lag in terms of you know major

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.500 
with the lag in terms of you know major
response<00:02:13.760> everything<00:02:14.760> seems<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> be<00:02:15.209> right<00:02:15.480> on

point<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.200> audio<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.769> video<00:02:16.890> seems<00:02:17.310> to
