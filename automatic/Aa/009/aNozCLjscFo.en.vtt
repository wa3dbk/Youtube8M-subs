for<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.720> remote<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:29.420> took<00:00:30.420> off<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.779> little

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
for the remote I took off this little

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.100 
for the remote I took off this little
panel<00:00:31.230> by<00:00:31.500> your<00:00:31.650> feet<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.880> tapped<00:00:33.840> into

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
panel by your feet here and tapped into

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the accessory wire through here this

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
the accessory wire through here this
actually<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.219> whole<00:00:38.399> box<00:00:39.000> comes<00:00:39.300> out<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
actually this whole box comes out and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.709 
actually this whole box comes out and
you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.840> easily<00:00:39.989> tap<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.070> remote<00:00:41.719> so

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
from there ran the remote and the power
wire<00:00:44.690> too<00:00:45.690> lazy<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.230> through<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> firewall

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
wire too lazy to go through the firewall

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.430 
wire too lazy to go through the firewall
and<00:00:47.360> just<00:00:48.360> went<00:00:48.629> through<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> side<00:00:49.140> door<00:00:49.410> or

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.620> wires<00:00:55.800> back<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:56.579> messy

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
of the wires back here it's pretty messy

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.990 
of the wires back here it's pretty messy
I'll<00:00:57.480> clean<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.899> later<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.859> power<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I'll clean it up later but power it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.630 
I'll clean it up later but power it
actually<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.480> runs<00:01:00.690> along<00:01:01.020> through<00:01:01.320> here

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
actually just runs along through here

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.500 
actually just runs along through here
underneath<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.970> everyone's<00:01:05.970> curious<00:01:06.330> as

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
underneath here so everyone's curious as

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.210 
underneath here so everyone's curious as
to<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> fuck<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.380> connect<00:01:07.740> your<00:01:07.890> RCA

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
output converter after doing many hours
of<00:01:13.229> research<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.950> forums<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.460> found<00:01:14.640> no

pictures<00:01:15.119> or<00:01:15.240> videos<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> decided<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
pictures or videos so I decided to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.950 
pictures or videos so I decided to
create<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.970> factory

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
create one so we have here the factory

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.520 
create one so we have here the factory
amp<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.320> tiny-ass<00:01:20.220> factory<00:01:20.759> sub<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:22.080> output

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
amp and tiny-ass factory sub the output

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.060 
amp and tiny-ass factory sub the output
for<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.159> factory<00:01:23.400> amp<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.470> all<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.619> did<00:01:25.799> was

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.770 
for your factory amp and all we did was
I<00:01:26.130> spliced<00:01:26.759> these<00:01:27.030> wires<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.450> cut<00:01:27.630> off<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
I spliced these wires I cut off the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.390 
I spliced these wires I cut off the
factory<00:01:28.229> sub<00:01:28.530> which<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.799> no<00:01:28.920> longer<00:01:29.070> connected

and<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.110> put<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> line<00:01:31.500> output<00:01:31.920> converter

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and I put in the line output converter

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.270 
and I put in the line output converter
wires<00:01:32.549> into<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.329> factory<00:01:33.780> output<00:01:34.280> pretty
