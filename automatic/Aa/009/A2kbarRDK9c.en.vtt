you the chords and then I wrote down the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.779 
you the chords and then I wrote down the
strumming<00:00:16.650> pattern<00:00:16.710> I'm<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.310> really<00:00:17.460> good<00:00:17.699> at

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
strumming pattern I'm not really good at

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.480 
strumming pattern I'm not really good at
doing<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:18.900> hopefully<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.410> helpful<00:00:19.500> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
doing that but hopefully it's helpful to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.920 
doing that but hopefully it's helpful to
some<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.820> y'all<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.859> so<00:00:22.859> we're<00:00:23.090> capo<00:00:24.090> 1

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
that's what we're doing all the chords

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.890 
that's what we're doing all the chords
relative<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> capo<00:00:28.710> okay<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.820> got<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> G<00:00:30.300> and

sharp

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
sharp

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.160 
sharp
it's<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.500> d<00:01:49.770> /<00:01:50.190> f<00:01:50.369> sharp<00:01:50.640> shape<00:01:51.540> /<00:01:52.290> chord<00:01:54.170> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it's a d / f sharp shape / chord so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.290 
it's a d / f sharp shape / chord so
those<00:01:55.320> are<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.530> four<00:01:55.740> chords<00:01:56.070> okay<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
those are the four chords okay and it

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:12.580 
those are the four chords okay and it
sounds<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.630> this

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.650

and that's pretty much the whole entire

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.960 
and that's pretty much the whole entire
song<00:02:15.990> all<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.620> way<00:02:16.740> through<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.490> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
song all the way through so that's the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.820 
song all the way through so that's the
joy<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.480> once<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.080> learn<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.650> got

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830

this

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.790 
this
okay<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:21.060> strumming<00:02:21.840> pattern<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.380> wrote<00:02:22.680> it

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
okay so strumming pattern I wrote it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.950 
okay so strumming pattern I wrote it
down<00:02:22.830> hopefully<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.630> kind<00:02:24.900> of

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
down hopefully this is it it's kind of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.160 
down hopefully this is it it's kind of
the<00:02:25.020> basic<00:02:25.530> strumming<00:02:25.860> pattern<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.870> then<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the basic strumming pattern and then you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.590 
the basic strumming pattern and then you
can<00:02:28.350> add<00:02:28.500> your<00:02:28.740> embellishments<00:02:29.670> or<00:02:29.880> your<00:02:30.420> own

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600
