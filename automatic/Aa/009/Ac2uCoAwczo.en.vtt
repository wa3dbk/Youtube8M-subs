00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
you bring it to the front like this and
try<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.850> make<00:01:50.970> sure<00:01:51.149> these<00:01:51.329> two<00:01:51.570> parts<00:01:51.899> are

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
try and make sure these two parts are

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.209 
try and make sure these two parts are
even<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:54.530> cross<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
even here and then you cross them and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.380 
even here and then you cross them and
then<00:01:56.430> cross<00:01:56.729> them<00:01:57.060> again<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> kind<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.149> get

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
then cross them again so you kind of get

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.370 
then cross them again so you kind of get
this<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.560> twist<00:02:02.130> at<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.520> front<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
this little like twist at the front and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.300 
this little like twist at the front and
then<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:06.090> around<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.570> back

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.380
