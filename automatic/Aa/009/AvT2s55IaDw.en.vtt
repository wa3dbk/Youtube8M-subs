00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:14.219
 go with the initials gentlemen today we go to 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.260
 see how to restore windows 7 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.090
 windows 8 directly from windows to 8.1 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.830
 directly from windows 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.420
 there are various types of ripley yes but there 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.699
 the leak lists are also those with the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.000
 cd windows i wanted you to start 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.460
 directly this in this case is a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.050
 another kind of very rich that by now 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.510
 it looks like this abyss read that little 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.610
 they do but can sometimes be useful to 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.980
 sometimes not what it is but sometimes it can be 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.350
 useful because some people post of 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.079
 make some people for small problems 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 do directly re- do the restore 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.160
 of windows that does nothing but create 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.739
 a copy in driving himself creating 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.199
 so a penny and wasting more space 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.890
 on your computer or some instead 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.300
 make formed in the remain windows 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.910
 tried to do one before a restore 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.409
 simpler than windows i recommend 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.000
 at the beginning 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.750
 let's go to start all the programs 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.020
 accessories system restore utilities 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 system configuration we click 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.110
 ok here at this point asks us the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.990
 recommended recovery and indicates date and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.740
 now or choose a restore point 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.780
 different I usually recommend choose a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.850
 different recovery point because 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 let's go on ahead because question is 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.960
 because I recommend this way 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.909
 now you see few of me because of me 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.860
 I use one percent now on the hard disk 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.640
 precisely because I prepared myself from 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.590
 video guide and to show you boy then 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.930
 the restore point 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.750
 the only recovery points that I for 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:03.960
 my computer dates back to January 6th 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:08.280
 of 2004 January 6 is yes January 6 of 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.760
 2014 to the euro and 324 with the installation 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.200
 of the column software to put the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.360
 password that I mentioned in mine 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.510
 video allows passwords in 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.670
 folders as I look at who I am now 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.540
 wake up what is what I do for 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.730
 you 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.410
 at half past three the fc script they have 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.040
 I repeat with this s that you do n't have it 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.379
 written then I am told now without s 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.230
 let's hope this is done here 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:44.280
 especially for you 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.849
 at half past three 325 I apologize, indeed 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.860
 pignoli for pignoli vineyards at 3 24 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:55.019
 and 25 seconds the suspense uncle to you a 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.670
 place to go around instead of 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.440
 eat that I do it anyway 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.750
 I do the same from the 3 of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.000
 night or worse for you jamie merit 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.000
 urlike only for this at 3 am for 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.670
 However, you feet are the same, however, 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.940
 I think to you I say here at this point that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.819
 let's look for interested programs 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.540
 In this case I do not recommend her useful 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.909
 well because if you did you have 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.340
 you want to restore at a certain time 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.319
 all those who make the computer 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.269
 the beginning of giving bad I remember that 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.909
 there is a bad computer for a week 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:34.019
 so bring your restoration 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.739
 before a week before one 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.110
 week 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.840
 at this point he will take it 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.730
 ten days before 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.920
 however, ten-day old dates back 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.450
 a week tested a week if 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.409
 there is not a week in the ten 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.780
 days before 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.580
 try to restore it said 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.420
 clearly tried to do this first 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:04:00.230
 restoration is good for the rest 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.150
 we press forward and then click on end 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.370
 biologically as some videos say 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.530
 I can't click on it for two reasons 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.360
 first is me you do n't need restore go 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.230
 good that I think of you so much but it is not 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.220
 that in its own way, that is to say, give 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:18.949
 however press end at this point which 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.859
 will do operations alone 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.020
 computer will shut down they restart the 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.510
 computer will tell you sail was 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.580
 wait a certain amount of time making the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.370
 recovery that varies from computer to 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.320
 computer with me will put us like 4 minutes 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.570
 with another person it will put us as well 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.880
 paintings but even an hour said 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.280
 clearly for the next so it's worth 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.430
 to give various from computer to computer is 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.830
 finished gentlemen is simple veil explained 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.270
 in the smallest details try to do 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.400
 first in this way before doing 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.520
 a reinstall of windows that is 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.360
 worse for me back if you need to install 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.539
 windows better format and install 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.430
 windows and don't make a copy of a 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.510
 copy of windows data clearly vi 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.090

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.970
