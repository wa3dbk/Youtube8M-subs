quite<00:01:28.320> often<00:01:28.470> why<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.250> because<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> had

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
quite often why is because when I had

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
quite often why is because when I had
hair<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.380> often<00:01:31.829> did<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.430> long<00:01:32.640> hair

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
hair I often did that with my long hair

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.370 
hair I often did that with my long hair
because<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> was<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.630> lazy<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.350> anything

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
because I was really lazy to do anything

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.670 
because I was really lazy to do anything
with<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:35.040> hair<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.299> could<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.900> tie<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.439> long

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
with my hair so I could just tie a long

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.710 
with my hair so I could just tie a long
ponytail<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> side<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.060> wrap

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
ponytail to the side and then just wrap

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.450 
ponytail to the side and then just wrap
it<00:01:39.750> around<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.560> looking<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it around and have this looking a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190 
it around and have this looking a
looking<00:01:41.579> side<00:01:42.060> button<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> side<00:01:42.869> and

like to do often for the side bun is
choose<00:02:01.700> scarves<00:02:02.700> where<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> pattern<00:02:03.390> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
choose scarves where the pattern is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.990 
choose scarves where the pattern is
different<00:02:04.290> at<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> tip<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> different

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
different at the tip or a different

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.270 
different at the tip or a different
color<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> tip<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> reason<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
color at the tip for the reason that the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
color at the tip for the reason that the
bun<00:02:08.489> becomes

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
bun becomes

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.250 
bun becomes
different<00:02:09.630> color<00:02:10.010> bring<00:02:11.010> it<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> side<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
different color bring it to the side and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.230

my<00:02:13.260> trick<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.800> make<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:13.980> look<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.760> perfect

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
my trick to make it look like a perfect

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.730 
my trick to make it look like a perfect
rose<00:02:15.390> because<00:02:15.570> obviously<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:16.410> easy<00:02:16.590> you

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
rose because obviously it's easy you

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.030 
rose because obviously it's easy you
also<00:02:16.920> do<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.790> then<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.240> go<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.770> make

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
also do this and then like go and make

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.130 
also do this and then like go and make
it<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.340> know<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.460> bun<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.690> big

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
it you know a bun like this if it's big

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.190 
it you know a bun like this if it's big
and<00:02:22.260> large<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.770> clumpy<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.840> my<00:02:24.840> trick<00:02:25.320> is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
and large and clumpy but my trick is

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.790 
and large and clumpy but my trick is
split<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.350> half<00:02:28.850> twist<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.800> twist<00:02:33.800> both

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
split in half twist it and twist both

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.970 
split in half twist it and twist both
ends<00:02:35.810> because<00:02:36.810> by<00:02:36.990> twisting<00:02:37.500> them<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.770> get<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
ends because by twisting them you get to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.760 
ends because by twisting them you get to
like<00:02:38.370> make<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.300> perfect<00:02:39.840> flower<00:02:40.260> looking
