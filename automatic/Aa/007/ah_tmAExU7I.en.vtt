00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
but it's kind of like that in a sense
you<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.530> spawn<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> map<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.369> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
you get spawn on a map you got to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.010 
you get spawn on a map you got to
collect<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.850> some<00:01:27.119> resources<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.840> stuff

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
collect like some resources and stuff

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.780 
collect like some resources and stuff
and<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> last<00:01:29.430> person

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and then you know the last person

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.270 
and then you know the last person
standing<00:01:29.880> wins<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.829> there's<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.920> lot<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> people

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
standing wins so there's a lot of people

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.660 
standing wins so there's a lot of people
in<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.400> community<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.590> don't<00:01:34.590> know

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
in that community that I don't know

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.130 
in that community that I don't know
they're<00:01:35.670> definitely<00:01:35.820> younger<00:01:36.240> kids<00:01:36.659> obvious

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
they're definitely younger kids obvious

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
they're definitely younger kids obvious
it's<00:01:37.710> pretty<00:01:37.890> obvious<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.850> like

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it's pretty obvious because of like

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.550 
it's pretty obvious because of like
their<00:01:39.299> their<00:01:39.600> age<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.810> stuff<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> know

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
their their age and stuff but I know

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.510

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that just have some sort attitudes

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010

UHC which I don't know I guess the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.590 
UHC which I don't know I guess the
people<00:01:50.430> playing<00:01:50.729> kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> bring<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.270> hate<00:01:51.450> on

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
that if you are kind of competitive or

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.850 
that if you are kind of competitive or
if<00:02:58.600> you're<00:02:58.750> mean<00:02:58.900> spirited<00:02:59.380> towards<00:02:59.590> people

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
if you're mean spirited towards people

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.550 
if you're mean spirited towards people
like<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.210> just<00:03:01.210> try<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.870> work<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.320> try<00:03:02.530> to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
like that just try to work on it try to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.650

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
because being competitive brings out the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.530 
because being competitive brings out the
best<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.700> worst<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:07.000> people<00:03:07.060> like<00:03:07.420> you
