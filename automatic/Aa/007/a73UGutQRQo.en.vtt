of<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.610> new<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:02.970> here<00:00:03.270> on<00:00:03.449> my<00:00:03.629> channel<00:00:03.659> I

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
of a new video here on my channel I

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.260 
of a new video here on my channel I
thought<00:00:04.230> I'd<00:00:04.350> finally<00:00:04.620> do<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.950> budget<00:00:05.520> price

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
thought I'd finally do a budget price

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.570 
thought I'd finally do a budget price
range<00:00:06.779> team<00:00:07.140> because<00:00:07.560> there<00:00:08.189> are<00:00:08.340> some

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
range team because there are some

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.730 
range team because there are some
expensive<00:00:08.970> players<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:10.139> now<00:00:10.349> actually

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
expensive players of now actually

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.470 
expensive players of now actually
dropped<00:00:10.980> down<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.250> fair<00:00:11.580> bit<00:00:11.700> probably<00:00:11.969> getting

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
dropped down a fair bit probably getting

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.079 
dropped down a fair bit probably getting
pretty<00:00:12.690> cheaply<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.830> example<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> upgraded

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
pretty cheaply for example the upgraded

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.779 
pretty cheaply for example the upgraded
Lauren<00:00:15.780> cashell<00:00:16.230> me<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.949> decided<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.670> make<00:00:17.699> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
Lauren cashell me so I decided to make a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.760 
Lauren cashell me so I decided to make a
budget<00:00:17.970> team<00:00:18.240> has<00:00:18.390> been<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.810> fairly<00:00:19.199> long<00:00:19.439> time

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
budget team has been a fairly long time

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.340 
budget team has been a fairly long time
since<00:00:19.920> I've<00:00:20.100> done<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.460> really<00:00:21.150> really<00:00:22.020> cheap

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
since I've done a really really cheap

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.170 
since I've done a really really cheap
team<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> price<00:00:23.880> range<00:00:24.090> it's

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
team and because the price range it's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.250 
team and because the price range it's
kind<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> difficult<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.720> work<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.050> exactly

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
kind of difficult to work out exactly

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.320 
kind of difficult to work out exactly
how<00:00:25.650> much<00:00:25.710> its<00:00:25.949> cost<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.519> i<00:00:26.760> think<00:00:27.150> it's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
how much its cost but i think it's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.140 
how much its cost but i think it's
around<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.689> 25<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.859> 35<00:00:29.279> thousand<00:00:29.760> coins<00:00:29.880> if

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
around about 25 to 35 thousand coins if

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.740 
around about 25 to 35 thousand coins if
i'm<00:00:30.900> not<00:00:30.960> mistaken<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.210> sake<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.600> me

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
i'm not mistaken but the the sake of me

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.450 
i'm not mistaken but the the sake of me
not<00:00:33.840> knowing<00:00:34.050> i'm<00:00:34.320> gonna<00:00:34.469> say<00:00:34.620> under<00:00:35.010> forty

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
about this team and why i put some

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
about this team and why i put some
players<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.830> generally<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.159> feel<00:01:08.460> now

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
players and it's generally the feel now

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.090 
players and it's generally the feel now
I<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:08.880> actually<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:11.070> this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
I do actually really really like this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.390 
I do actually really really like this
formation<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.260> strong<00:01:13.860> formation

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
formation it's a strong formation

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
formation it's a strong formation
especially<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> midfield<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.140> lot

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
especially in the midfield you got a lot

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.440 
especially in the midfield you got a lot
of<00:01:16.590> ways<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.189> intercept<00:01:17.670> passes<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
of ways you can intercept passes and a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
of ways you can intercept passes and a
lot<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.720> link<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.110> play<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.189> do

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
lot of link up play that you can do

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
lot of link up play that you can do
because<00:01:20.640> you've<00:01:20.759> pretty<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.030> got<00:01:21.200> four<00:01:22.200> very

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
because you've pretty much got four very

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.149 
because you've pretty much got four very
tightly<00:01:23.130> compacted<00:01:24.000> players<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
tightly compacted players right in the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.390 
tightly compacted players right in the
center<00:01:26.610> point<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.900> two<00:01:28.439> left<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> right

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
center point so your two left and right

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.060 
center point so your two left and right
center<00:01:29.939> mids<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:31.290> actually<00:01:31.560> bunch<00:01:31.799> up

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
center mids they actually bunch up

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.480 
center mids they actually bunch up
pretty<00:01:32.369> nicely<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.450> often<00:01:33.860> move<00:01:34.860> into

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
pretty nicely and they often move into

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.800 
pretty nicely and they often move into
the<00:01:35.610> middle<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.270> you'll<00:01:36.479> send<00:01:36.720> her

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the middle and then you'll send her

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.280 
the middle and then you'll send her
attacking<00:01:37.140> mid<00:01:37.549> often<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> dropping<00:01:40.110> back

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
attacking mid often it is dropping back

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.990 
attacking mid often it is dropping back
a<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:40.680> bit<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.250> moving<00:01:41.400> forward<00:01:41.820> so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a little bit and then moving forward so

of fun it's got too bulky strikers if

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.710 
of fun it's got too bulky strikers if
you<00:04:44.100> like<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.490> probably<00:04:44.790> could<00:04:45.030> cross<00:04:45.690> the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
you like you probably could cross the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.390 
you like you probably could cross the
ball<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.200> all<00:04:46.410> day<00:04:46.590> every<00:04:46.890> day<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.280> he'd

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
ball in all day every day and he'd

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.450 
ball in all day every day and he'd
probably<00:04:47.820> get<00:04:48.180> quite<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.200> few<00:04:49.260> goals<00:04:49.950> from<00:04:50.220> this

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
probably get quite a few goals from this

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.700 
probably get quite a few goals from this
but<00:04:51.450> i<00:04:51.630> think<00:04:52.080> my<00:04:52.170> favorite<00:04:52.380> thing<00:04:52.530> about

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
but i think my favorite thing about

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.340 
but i think my favorite thing about
steam<00:04:53.040> was<00:04:53.190> just<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.400> way<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.910> even<00:04:54.510> mertens

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
steam was just the way that even mertens

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.500 
steam was just the way that even mertens
was<00:04:55.530> great<00:04:55.770> defending<00:04:56.280> like<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:57.000> just<00:04:57.270> seemed

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
was great defending like it just seemed

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.510 
was great defending like it just seemed
to<00:04:57.540> be<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.810> team<00:04:58.200> that<00:04:58.440> kept<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:59.010> ball<00:04:59.190> so

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
to be a team that kept the ball so

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.400 
to be a team that kept the ball so
nicely<00:04:59.790> and<00:05:00.150> if<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.360> didn't<00:05:00.600> have<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.720> ball<00:05:00.960> it

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
nicely and if it didn't have the ball it

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.530 
nicely and if it didn't have the ball it
would<00:05:01.590> intercept<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.370> ball<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:02.850> well<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.360> I

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
would intercept the ball so well and I

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.720 
would intercept the ball so well and I
don't<00:05:04.170> know<00:05:04.230> I've<00:05:04.500> never<00:05:04.680> really<00:05:05.040> had<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.280> team

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
don't know I've never really had a team

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.150 
don't know I've never really had a team
of<00:05:05.910> elevates<00:05:06.450> I'm<00:05:06.930> not<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.740> greater

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
of elevates I'm not that greater

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.970 
of elevates I'm not that greater
intercepting<00:05:09.060> passes<00:05:09.240> but<00:05:09.630> my<00:05:09.980> sentiments

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
intercepting passes but my sentiments

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.220 
intercepting passes but my sentiments
just<00:05:11.160> seem<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.460> be<00:05:11.610> in<00:05:11.910> exactly<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.050> right

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
just seem to be in exactly the right

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.720 
just seem to be in exactly the right
place<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:13.560> don't<00:05:13.770> know<00:05:13.950> if<00:05:14.010> they<00:05:14.130> were<00:05:14.190> or<00:05:14.700> if

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
place so don't know if they were or if

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.460 
place so don't know if they were or if
it's<00:05:15.000> just<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.180> fact<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.480> i<00:05:15.510> often<00:05:15.840> how

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
it's just a fact that i often how

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.050 
it's just a fact that i often how
crowded<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.280> opposition<00:05:17.640> because<00:05:17.760> of<00:05:18.000> this

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
crowded the opposition because of this

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.300 
crowded the opposition because of this
formation<00:05:18.390> but<00:05:18.780> i<00:05:18.990> need<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.410> really<00:05:20.010> really

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
formation but i need a really really

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.660 
formation but i need a really really
competitive<00:05:20.790> team<00:05:21.240> 9.5<00:05:22.200> is<00:05:22.440> what<00:05:23.040> i'm<00:05:23.280> going

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
competitive team 9.5 is what i'm going

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.460 
competitive team 9.5 is what i'm going
to<00:05:23.880> give<00:05:24.090> it<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.300> really<00:05:24.510> fun<00:05:24.630> team<00:05:25.080> would

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
to give it a really fun team would

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.990 
to give it a really fun team would
definitely<00:05:25.890> recommend<00:05:26.010> it<00:05:26.460> it's<00:05:26.640> a<00:05:26.760> little

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
definitely recommend it it's a little

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000 
definitely recommend it it's a little
bit<00:05:27.090> tough<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.480> make<00:05:27.960> an<00:05:28.170> interesting<00:05:28.530> hybrid

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
bit tough to make an interesting hybrid

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.370 
bit tough to make an interesting hybrid
