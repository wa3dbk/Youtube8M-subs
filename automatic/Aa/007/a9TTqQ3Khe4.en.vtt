Lisa<00:02:49.329> it'll<00:02:49.630> be<00:02:49.720> nice<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.320> go<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:50.980> face

Lisa it'll be nice not to go in and face
first<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.730> shot<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.329> then<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.600> drill<00:02:52.870> does

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
first that shot and then the drill does

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.800 
first that shot and then the drill does
sound<00:02:53.799> good<00:02:54.130> well<00:02:54.430> will<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.180> technology

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
sound good well will this technology

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.710 
sound good well will this technology
make<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.170> drill<00:02:56.410> obsolete<00:02:57.510> probably<00:02:58.510> not

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
make the drill obsolete probably not

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.970 
make the drill obsolete probably not
because<00:02:58.930> right<00:02:59.260> now<00:02:59.290> there<00:02:59.650> are<00:02:59.680> still

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
because right now there are still

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.039 
because right now there are still
procedures<00:03:00.489> for<00:03:00.640> which<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.000> drill<00:03:01.299> works<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
procedures for which the drill works the

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.240 
procedures for which the drill works the
best<00:03:02.290> but<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.980> know<00:03:03.070> they're<00:03:03.220> making

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
best but you know they're making

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.699 
best but you know they're making
advances<00:03:04.209> every<00:03:04.329> day<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:04.810> technology<00:03:05.530> so

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
advances every day in this technology so

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:06.810 
advances every day in this technology so
hopefully<00:03:06.130> one<00:03:06.280> day<00:03:06.310> in<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.549> near<00:03:06.640> future

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
hopefully one day in the near future

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.610 
hopefully one day in the near future
will<00:03:07.209> veto<00:03:07.360> be<00:03:07.780> able<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.019> go<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.380> really

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
will veto be able to go in and really

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.620 
will veto be able to go in and really
not<00:03:08.920> face<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.459> any<00:03:09.549> denisof<00:03:10.060> look
