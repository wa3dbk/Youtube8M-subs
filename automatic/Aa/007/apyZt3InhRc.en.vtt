00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 and I like it I've always liked it 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.260
 a lot of chocolate but I think we're 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.270
 at a time when you have to 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.930
 question things a little bit of 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.930
 where they come 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.420
 cocoa comes from a very very society 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.970
 Unequal pay very unfair that very few 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.440
 wages when he pays them to women and 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.410
 so I think it's important that 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.920
 that the big production companies 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.350
 of cocoa and chocolate what then the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.879
 factories and makes it arrive at home it 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.480
 aware that we too 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.480
 we care 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.020
 we care not only how good you are 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.880
 ahead but how it's done and I think 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.630
 this type of campaign is important for 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.630
 the awareness 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.710
 the best thing about the experience is to put the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.299
 data on the table that the chain of 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.150
 production of that chocolate that we 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.180
 it looks so sweet 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.700
 sometimes it has a very bitter beginning and 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.300
 if that put it on the table so that the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.399
 people know him is the best gift that 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.399
 after you can give me this campaign 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.439
 because we are not only consumers without 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.200
 think nothing else and I think we have to 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.540
 be the conscious consumers and 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.159
 help make the world fairer more 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.159
 egalitarian and better 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.320
 then individually from home we can 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.450
 make a very simple thing we are at a 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.030
 click to try to help these women 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.660
 that the inequality behind the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.160
 cocoa disappear with that click we're going 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.560
 to draw attention to those great 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.660
 cocoa producing companies 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.200
 chocolate and we're going to tell you that we 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.750
 they matter to us how it comes to that 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.350
 chocolate to home the chain we care 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.300
 women their salary their position in the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.610
 society matters to us with a single click 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.820
 we can draw attention to these 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.820
 Business 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.390
 The truth is that much better than 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.510
 I was waiting because I like chocolate and 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.790
 it's not the fact of being a brigade 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.290
 chocolate I had never had 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.150
 nothing like that 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.600
 it has not been unpleasant besides the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.600
 cause it deserves
