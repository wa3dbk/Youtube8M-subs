more<00:00:13.120> help<00:00:13.360> because<00:00:13.450> if<00:00:13.630> we're<00:00:13.750> not<00:00:13.840> how<00:00:13.990> to<00:00:14.080> do

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
more help because if we're not how to do

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.780 
more help because if we're not how to do
it<00:00:14.320> so<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.940> want<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.540> actual<00:00:16.960> bracket<00:00:17.790> which

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
it so you want the actual bracket which

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.130 
it so you want the actual bracket which
is<00:00:18.970> somewhere<00:00:19.360> here<00:00:20.550> three<00:00:21.550> to<00:00:21.640> six<00:00:21.910> inches

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
is somewhere here three to six inches

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.470 
is somewhere here three to six inches
roughly<00:00:23.140> away<00:00:23.619> from<00:00:23.859> the<00:00:23.949> window<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.550> the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
roughly away from the window and the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.300 
roughly away from the window and the
height<00:00:25.720> is<00:00:25.960> adjustable<00:00:26.560> but<00:00:26.800> because<00:00:27.160> we

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
height is adjustable but because we

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.529 
height is adjustable but because we
don't<00:00:27.400> have<00:00:27.490> a<00:00:27.609> lot<00:00:27.760> of<00:00:27.789> height<00:00:28.060> here<00:00:28.330> you

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
don't have a lot of height here you

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.050 
don't have a lot of height here you
can't<00:00:28.810> go<00:00:28.930> too<00:00:28.990> high<00:00:29.439> over<00:00:29.769> the<00:00:29.859> window<00:00:30.160> so<00:00:30.429> I'm

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
can't go too high over the window so I'm

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.729 
can't go too high over the window so I'm
going<00:00:31.269> to<00:00:31.300> go<00:00:31.449> three<00:00:31.810> inches<00:00:32.140> out<00:00:32.320> because<00:00:32.619> I

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
going to go three inches out because I

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.229 
going to go three inches out because I
know<00:00:32.800> there's<00:00:33.100> some<00:00:33.280> blocking<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:34.090> don't

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
know there's some blocking so I don't

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.880 
know there's some blocking so I don't
have<00:00:34.330> to<00:00:34.449> put<00:00:34.660> any<00:00:34.809> plugs<00:00:35.170> in<00:00:35.410> behind<00:00:35.769> the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
have to put any plugs in behind the

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.810 
have to put any plugs in behind the
screw<00:00:36.250> and<00:00:37.350> I'm<00:00:38.350> just<00:00:38.589> going<00:00:38.799> to<00:00:38.830> go<00:00:39.040> about<00:00:39.549> I

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
screw and I'm just going to go about I

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.329 
screw and I'm just going to go about I
already<00:00:40.420> pre-measured<00:00:40.989> four<00:00:41.830> and<00:00:42.100> seven

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
already pre-measured four and seven

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.390 
already pre-measured four and seven
inches<00:00:42.610> down<00:00:42.940> which<00:00:43.180> are<00:00:43.330> my<00:00:43.449> two<00:00:43.479> screw<00:00:44.049> holes

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
inches down which are my two screw holes

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.710 
inches down which are my two screw holes
which<00:00:45.400> leaves<00:00:45.699> me<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.879> nice<00:00:46.089> little<00:00:46.330> height

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
which leaves me a nice little height

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.630 
which leaves me a nice little height
above<00:00:47.229> the<00:00:47.290> window<00:00:47.769> so<00:00:48.159> I'm<00:00:48.220> going<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.460> measure

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
above the window so I'm going to measure

00:00:48.640 --> 00:01:00.590 
above the window so I'm going to measure
first<00:00:49.350> my<00:00:50.350> four<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.979> seven<00:00:51.190> inches

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.690 

and<00:01:00.890> then<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:03.619> three<00:01:04.619> inches<00:01:04.979> away<00:01:05.129> from<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and then my three inches away from the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:16.020 
and then my three inches away from the
inside<00:01:06.090> edge<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.509> window

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.960 

and<00:01:16.540> then<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:18.040> little<00:01:18.640> bit<00:01:18.730> more

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
and then so that it's a little bit more

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.640 
and then so that it's a little bit more
accurate<00:01:19.480> I<00:01:19.630> like<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.050> actually<00:01:20.140> take<00:01:20.350> the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
accurate I like to actually take the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
accurate I like to actually take the
bracket<00:01:21.070> itself<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.780> put<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.080> on<00:01:23.170> my<00:01:23.320> lower

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.210 

and<00:01:28.390> draw<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.050> circle<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.740> know<00:01:32.800> you<00:01:33.010> can

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
and draw the circle and I know you can

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.100 
and draw the circle and I know you can
use<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.400> level<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.940> this<00:01:34.180> I'm<00:01:34.450> going<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.780> I'm

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
use a level on this I'm going to I'm

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.650 
use a level on this I'm going to I'm
going<00:01:35.260> to<00:01:35.470> eyeball<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:37.420> come<00:01:37.630> back

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
going to eyeball it and then come back

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.840 
going to eyeball it and then come back
with<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.050> level<00:01:38.470> after<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.830> fact<00:01:39.190> just<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.670> make

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
with a level after the fact just to make

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.370 
with a level after the fact just to make
sure<00:01:39.880> I'm<00:01:40.180> on<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:40.750> I've<00:01:40.840> got<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.050> pretty<00:01:41.229> good

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
sure I'm on so I've got a pretty good

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
sure I'm on so I've got a pretty good
eyeball<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:44.020> now<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.229> have<00:01:44.470> blocking<00:01:44.979> so<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.220> can

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
eyeball and now I have blocking so I can

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.040 
eyeball and now I have blocking so I can
go<00:01:45.550> ahead<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:46.060> screw<00:01:46.360> straight<00:01:46.660> in

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
go ahead and screw straight in

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.200 
go ahead and screw straight in
you<00:01:47.470> can<00:01:47.650> pre-drill<00:01:48.220> these<00:01:48.430> if<00:01:48.640> you<00:01:48.759> want<00:01:49.180> I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
you can pre-drill these if you want I

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.690 
you can pre-drill these if you want I
usually<00:01:49.479> because<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.500> screws<00:01:50.830> self<00:01:51.430> tap

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
usually because the screws self tap

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.880 
usually because the screws self tap
themselves<00:01:52.240> pretty<00:01:52.390> well<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:52.899> go<00:01:53.619> ahead<00:01:53.740> and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
themselves pretty well I go ahead and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.520 
themselves pretty well I go ahead and
screw<00:01:54.250> them<00:01:54.369> straight<00:01:54.729> in<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:56.200> I'm<00:01:56.320> going<00:01:56.470> to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
screw them straight in now I'm going to

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.450 
screw them straight in now I'm going to
repeat<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:57.160> all<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.820> way<00:01:57.880> down<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.270> window

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
repeat this all the way down the window

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.029 
repeat this all the way down the window
you<00:02:00.460> can<00:02:00.820> measure<00:02:01.240> from<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.720> top<00:02:01.990> every<00:02:02.770> time

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
you can measure from the top every time

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.590 
you can measure from the top every time
down<00:02:03.399> doesn't<00:02:04.030> mean<00:02:04.180> it's<00:02:04.360> going<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.539> be

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
down doesn't mean it's going to be

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.139 
down doesn't mean it's going to be
perfectly<00:02:04.990> level<00:02:05.259> or<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.280> can<00:02:06.430> use<00:02:06.580> your<00:02:06.880> tool

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
perfectly level or you can use your tool

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.240 
perfectly level or you can use your tool
somewhat<00:02:07.690> like<00:02:07.930> this<00:02:08.259> which<00:02:08.739> is<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> laser

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
somewhat like this which is a laser

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:19.560 
somewhat like this which is a laser
level<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.060> then<00:02:11.459> actually<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:18.360> once<00:02:19.360> that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
level and then actually and once that

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.210 
level and then actually and once that
levels<00:02:20.019> out<00:02:20.200> there's<00:02:20.620> actually<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:21.070> little

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
levels out there's actually a little

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.490 
levels out there's actually a little
bracket<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.790> attach<00:02:21.820> this<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.600> wall<00:02:22.750> or

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
bracket to attach this to the wall or

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.229 
bracket to attach this to the wall or
you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.709> have<00:02:23.799> a<00:02:23.860> second<00:02:24.250> person<00:02:24.459> like<00:02:24.910> your

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
you can have a second person like your
