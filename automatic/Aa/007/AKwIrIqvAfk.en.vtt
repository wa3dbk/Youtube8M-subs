00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.270
 so if the game does not work it's up to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.409
 because of your java so this so you 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.159
 do that ironically downloads java and 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.470
 and after that it worked 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.860
 what I had never tried without java 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.580
 and it did not work and it works 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:54.850
 so or genres and java 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:02:01.190
 and finally the game works in his game 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.020
