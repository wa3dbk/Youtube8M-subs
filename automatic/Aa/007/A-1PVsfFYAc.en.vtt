00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.570
 hello and welcome to part 2 of this 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.380
 series of the referee system of algae 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.580
 audio 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.320
 this is the head now sitting and this 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.730
 is actually the reference system me 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.560
 to play with 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.600
 let me go and see all that 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.970
 to exist 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.830
 this was also a request from 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.540
 which makes our viewers long for one 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.440
 show those slave frank oomen like it 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.750
 to 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.760
 bring what our lives like and viewers 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.210
 like to see are not there for 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.179
 ourselves that someone for you 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.699
 start with the speakers this is one 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.649
 lentus audio duo 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.620
 lentes is a dutch speaker 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.140
 power and we are with them ago 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.440
 got in touch and we noticed 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 that they build such a nice speaker 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.639
 through simple filters but correct 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.229
 simple components' and often difficult 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:02.010
 stood designing 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.470
 it is a capacitor or transformed with one 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.980
 one twitter and tasting 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.500
 and is a big cupboard for them together 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.970
 at the bottom there are forests fresh gate and we 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.420
 are particularly charmed by this commodity 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.220
 speak because it not only wants detail 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.650
 like tracks but they are also free 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.110
 easy to place and leave whole 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.340
 hear well what is behind it 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.070
 we are very good at this 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.540
 test every subtle difference in allotment 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.820
 strengthening 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.230
 or source is immediately audible and that is 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.250
 naturally important if you have high fives 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.510
 well let's move on 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.510
 behind this cover 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.880
 the playstation 3 but fine 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.390
 blu-ray player with none in between 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.180
 video equipment is good after playstation 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.690
 pure players busy also play the game 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:01.810
 so hence 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:06.340
 below one of the mono's a vicious 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.830
 for ph 3333 100 rock in eight 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.039
 very powerful amplifier special 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.379
 a lot of control and that is good for heat 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.719
 so who likes there may be a little gas 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.819
 eat with these stronger he is 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.250
 modified by physician peak 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.620
 well something nice in the middle and high it 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.650
 layer has become something this handing out 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.750
 but yes not the biggest difference there 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.030
 winters especially the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.920
 the grain that went off and that's you 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.019
 more often true high power amplifiers 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.180
 its very powerful money maze refined 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.859
 and that is even what the best case 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.319
 we will say of two worlds 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:50.430
 no doors or a strong will pay 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:52.260
 can harden well one of my dream 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.299
 amplifiers i 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.750
 works at syfy during my student days 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.159
 studio wilbert and yes you get 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.680
 of course as movies you see 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.540
 but can wish 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.700
 but under this post apps i dash 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.919
 often preamp and I was actually 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.519
 I immediately fell in love and sold 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.459
 will have 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.409
 seven years later my me comes to fetch 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.329
 so performance then 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.209
 and I am still very happy with it 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.849
 very nice little preamplifier 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.909
 coloring a lot of dynamics beautiful 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.280
 volume control so yes a dream come true 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:30.060
 it is green so the one on top is one 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.019
 trend bduck a very nice hunt for 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.760
 the finding and this has been modified 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.549
 so got a little better than it 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.739
 original and after he does just 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.459
 excellent job in fact 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.310
 took off 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.750
 euro no quotes that do better well 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.370
 maybe if we start looking now how 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.090
 has arrived in one direction that there 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.190
 something in between but will be difficult 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.459
 ten lesbi roofs the digital stuff 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.459
 our system 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:01.650
 Below the main source are Almere 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.909
 made bending CD players more but 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.930
 actually not fat in the last year 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.030
 3 CDs behavior their dog liter per sÃ© so 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.889
 scared yes I will get you out of the 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.100
 computer world in between can be fine for hours 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.190
 assemble and 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.630
 this htpc is really completely focused 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:27.350
 on audio power with low ripple 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.900
 separate usb card used for the 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.600
 offer another day so it is not with 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.090
 to heard usb card but separate usb car 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.870
 just ssd or even quieter too 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:42.110
 get super silent king and recently 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.460
 a GTX 660 but not for the audio but 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.370
 clean 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.890
 the player can play and beyond 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.100
 save good cooling here of course 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.820
 does not hear he is really but silent feet 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.890
 trolling 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.440
 to completely dampen them a little more 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.100
 no vibration in the closet free concert 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.780
 imane 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.080
 such a never heard and sounds here 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.080
 excellent 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:10.130
 this course finally no not finally 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.560
 This box is for the test equipment here 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.190
 stood a thea vds 10 that is up 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.710
 moved to the second room and it is 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:23.660
 now the needle set but that is also possible 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:26.870
 all are now so coincidentally engaged 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.530
 and pilgrimage 50 and 52 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.740
 below the second common engine block 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:39.620
 and coincidentally so an m52 that not 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:43.670
 girls a2 monos so 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.570
 and above another show in dhc is a 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.490
 LCD TV 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.500
 it's not the newest down and when 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.680
 good tv 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.820
 there must be much better tv but we are 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.180
 are still very satisfied 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.040
 about the energy supply that they have 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.900
 there is a separate group here 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.570
 double separate group from the 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.970
 fuse box downstairs and actually runs 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.540
 a line directly along all fuses 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.850
 upstairs because here 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.660
 double fuse box with simon scratch 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:17.120
 modules and fuses so fast 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.120
 no switching arrangement and 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.040
 analogue is digitally separated there are 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.360
 three boat socket figure behind one 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.420
 the van is connected 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.200
 pff two filter of avoided on there 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:34.320
 includes the bizarre go and one more 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.820
 another box for low power draw 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.670
 to analog device then in for box 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.530
 we use for the power amplifiers 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.350
 because that which is an inability devices 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:50.130
 they do not go through a filter 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:52.620
 there is a separate connector block with a 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.780
 carlo filter fiery or no mop 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.890
 sensitive to ar ski and a good evening 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.240
 le 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.400
 and another door started out of sockets 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.580
 are other devices that why 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.040
 are tests and TV is among other things 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.320
 separately connected and of course PCs up to 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.430
 participate in the group because that is one 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.800
 government is disturbing 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:14.310
 for whom we do not say directly 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.470
 as far as actually this 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.670
 system for which again warmly 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.670
 watching and until next time
