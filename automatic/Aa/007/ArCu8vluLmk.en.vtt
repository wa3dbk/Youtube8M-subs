 packages 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.290

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.030
 of the r is celis 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.130

 navalón squeeze thugs urges the border 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.709
 the first thing is prudent 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.939
 and in those that are going to eta 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.619
 here is one thing in 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.989
 in the settings that will be 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.549
 the slip of Thursday 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.209
 and once you have to have it always marked 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.300
 per hundred so that if we attack them affected and here they injure their 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.289
 next disc what movie would be like a page to go 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.119
 book 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.629
 so they took 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.840
 and you can also modify the speed for example if the shot is very very 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.969
 slow 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.400

 the hotel that is to install but the yen we have not expired want more 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:01.079
 and because it equaled tracy that is common to tevez good and so very fast let 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.879
 and the chandelier know that they appreciate 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.149

 millet that they would fine thus completely unfortunately it is not so 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.519
