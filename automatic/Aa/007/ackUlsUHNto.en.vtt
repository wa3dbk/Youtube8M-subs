00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
take a look at the big picture we've got

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.790 
take a look at the big picture we've got
a<00:04:48.000> system<00:04:48.270> moving<00:04:48.600> into<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.080> West<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.680> with

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.129 
Dallas so much of the Lone Star State
looking<00:05:08.310> pretty<00:05:08.699> quiet<00:05:09.060> for<00:05:09.240> now<00:05:09.449> but

looking pretty quiet for now but

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.930 
looking pretty quiet for now but
eventually<00:05:10.500> over<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.009> weekend<00:05:11.460> we<00:05:11.550> will<00:05:11.729> see

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
eventually over the weekend we will see

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.310 
eventually over the weekend we will see
a<00:05:11.970> system<00:05:12.360> pushing<00:05:12.750> through<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:12.990> central

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
a system pushing through the central

a system pushing through the central
United<00:05:13.530> States<00:05:13.740> so<00:05:14.160> that<00:05:14.190> means<00:05:14.520> some<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.120> the

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180

areas of Oklahoma will get some
much-needed<00:05:18.270> rain<00:05:18.750> but<00:05:19.229> we'll<00:05:19.349> have<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.620> watch

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
much-needed rain but we'll have to watch

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.650 
much-needed rain but we'll have to watch
out<00:05:19.979> for<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.250> severe<00:05:20.610> aspect<00:05:21.090> and<00:05:21.330> we've<00:05:21.539> got

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
out for the severe aspect and we've got

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.180 
out for the severe aspect and we've got
another<00:05:21.900> system<00:05:22.320> digging<00:05:22.680> in<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:22.979> west

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
another system digging in to the west

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.680 
another system digging in to the west
and<00:05:23.520> that<00:05:23.550> means<00:05:23.849> snow<00:05:24.210> for<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.449> higher

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
and that means snow for the higher

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.810 
and that means snow for the higher
elevations<00:05:25.259> and<00:05:25.440> rain<00:05:26.039> coming<00:05:26.430> in<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.729> the
