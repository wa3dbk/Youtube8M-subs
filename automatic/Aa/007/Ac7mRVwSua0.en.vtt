00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 welcome to the policy in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.020
 this video I want you one of my 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 absolute favorite breakfast show 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.269
 I almost all of it 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 every day and every day is great 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.900
 Super delicious is very easy and that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.230
 great thing is you need it for that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 basic recipe really only two ingredients 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.650
 namely and bananas and how the whole 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.170
 will I show you now all you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.529
 what this simple recipe needs 10 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.610
 2 eggs and a ripe banana that is for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.160
 a person 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.510
 if you have super hungry for 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 Can you still have a second banana and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.090
 take a third thereto or just for 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 two people double the whole on 4 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.469
 eggs us walter two and a half bananas ever 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.120
 There must be more in there 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.559
 be careful if that's a lot 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.710
 ratio must stay the same if very much 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 There is a lot of banana in it and very few 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.850
 then the whole thing is not so 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.359
 bake well that means in the ratio 2 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.910
 1 2 a banana or four eggs and two 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.220
 Depending on the banana, it is also very large 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
 in three eggs and two bananas is too 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.490
 okay and whatever you need 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.700
 In addition, there is a mermaid and a pan 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.159
 with a bit of fat in it what you are now 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:25.520
 The first thing to do is simply to do it 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:28.080
 eggs in the mixer to 1 and the second egg 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.570
 and the banana too 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 Make sure that the banana is ripe 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.439
 The more ripe the banana is the more 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 it will taste better in the end soon 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.900
 sweeter is banana if you want 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.460
 you can also honey a bit 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.820
 I personally need it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.100
 Not 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.070
 So if the banana is nice ripe 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 the thickness of lid on it and enough 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.259
 mix once 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.939
 next you heat up a bit 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.250
 fat in the pan I have here now 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.369
 usually taken butter 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.650
 Coconut oil that is also super healthy and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.320
 heat resistant, so it does not matter if you are 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.420
 butter or or coconut oil nims is both 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.890
 okay please no olive oil 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.539
 That's not good when you 're too hot 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.459
 and lidl of course very healthy though 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.459
 Do not heat in the pan 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.900
 all you're doing is now here are 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.800
 the mixa bananas just blend in the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.019
 Pour the pan to see that everything is in it 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.380
 is that nothing is lost and completely 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.360
 Very important the flame or the heart 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.400
 then turn very small so the whole 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.380
 Actually works similar to 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.470
 a month ago that was just faltering and 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.110
 so it does not burn you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.239
 pretexts can the heat very small 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.160
 regio can pancake your banana 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.200
 Of course I like pure food personally 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.480
 I really like fresh fruit 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.890
 here just a piece of melon half 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.989
 apple and a few grapes 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.410
 but you can take any fruit to it 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.440
 for example, they taste very delicious 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.299
 also mixed bears and everything you do 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.040
 is when you have to cut fruit 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.350
 cut it now while yours 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.359
 Pancake turns from one side 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.709
 As you can see I have this one now 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.150
 Pancake once turned 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.400
 I'm a little bit apart here 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.040
 broken that happen 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.329
 pancake is too big and I am 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.459
 probably not the perfect one 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.170
 pancake so if you this happens not 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.030
 problem after simply smaller 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.570
 pancake or use a smaller one 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.280
 pan 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.720
 So when the franc to the we 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.459
 it can simply be bad walls 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.320
 therefore prefer to make several small ones 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.250
 if it bothers you a bit 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.320
 falls apart 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.239
 you look pretty golden brown baked here 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.760
 the same now from the other side and 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.010
 then we are already finished that way 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.079
 the whole thing out when it's done delicious 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.480
 lanes pancake with the real one 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.299
 fruits as I said you can the fruit 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.350
 naturally choose as you want 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.420
 Berries taste delicious, too 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.459
 other fruits 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.620
 I hope this delicious simple 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.630
 I liked the recipe as I said it 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.370
 you are all my absolute favorite
