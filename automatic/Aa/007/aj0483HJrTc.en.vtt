00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.490
 I welcome comrades gamers for all who 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.770
 at 90 will give out mortal kombat of course 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.700
 something special first is super 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.950
 cool movies 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.320
 but also a great game of course by the way 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.360
 the films were just shot on games but also 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.610
 quite a while we have not spoiled to fresh 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.169
 mortal kombat am console gamers of course 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.230
 played but surely it was much shit 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.690
 Okay , so now mortal kombat 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.680
 capturing edishen again on the computer but it 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.719
 whether not a holiday and so let's start 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.690
 look at the characters here with us 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.769
 a complete set of our most favorite peppers 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.710
 here and lu kang 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.469
 and Ryden and kung glow of scorpions 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.960
 sub-zero and baroque well, in general, all 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.039
 who were all in our place is just 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.710
 can not but rejoice 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.230
 the most delicious game mode I choose 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.390
 the story mod there is a story mode here 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.190
 we have a real plot with rollers 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.370
 characters and cutscenes 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.620
 we fall right into the times of 10 tournedos 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.020
 that is, 9 tournaments have already lost and 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.870
 there was the last one that will decide 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.600
 the fate of the earthly dimension is ours 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.760
 it all go, that is, we will go from 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.820
 very beginning to the very top to 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.040
 Emperor's show to the whole plot is divided 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.080
 into small chapters in each of which 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.090
 we will steer your character and 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.790
 watch his story and what 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.370
 interesting here seems to be the plot to fights 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.860
 the thing is generally not necessary but nevertheless in 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.720
 mortal kombat dion is excellent and can 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.630
 compete with big games 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.970
 also in the game is full of other modes 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.250
 can be entertained as a single player so 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.350
 and be sure to multiplayer even have 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.750
 regime such know two by two when 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.180
 characters change very quickly right in 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.310
 fight time but honestly i'm not at all 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.320
 like well, actually before 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.630
 start playing i would recommend 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.850
 be sure to go through the tutorial he is very 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.770
 simple understandable reminds all the basic 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.610
 tricks can even teach how to do 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.160
 fatalities are in general a very useful thing. 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.200
 let's move on to the gameplay now 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.500
 management we have the most classic 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.020
 which almost did not change 92 years 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.960
 we have two punches two punches 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.390
 block and grab what else grab in 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.610
 You ask, but it's about how in Beijing 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.460
 that is, you press one button and our 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.170
 the hero makes such an ordinary special reception 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.960
 Generally nothing special but in principle 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.660
 two diversify every fighter except 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.820
 ordinary combo arms and legs have 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.400
 surely a bunch of different special moves 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.400
 that can and should be used in combat 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.380
 they all migrated from past games well 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.080
 of course there were some new ones 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.000
 you feel a special thrill when your hands are just 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.030
 solve solve any 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.230
 special techniques like scorpion 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.959
 throws the chain or say sub ziro 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.700
 leaves your clone when you make them 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.700
 on the machine you just feel 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.100
 inexpressible thrill uppercut running board 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.260
 a kick with a turn it all in place 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.660
 and you will immediately remember if you played 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.860
 past mortal kombat so problems 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.709
 should not arise 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.620
 Well, even in the hottest fighting games have 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.019
 we have such a strip of energy or force 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.540
 every beat or vice versa even a pass 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.549
 hitting adds fad this energy and 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.700
 then you can use it for example 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.010
 You can make a particularly powerful special strike or 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.560
 even make such a combo breaker that is 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.230
 block enemy combo well and the most 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.570
 relish it is of course x-ray when you type 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.670
 full line of energy you push two 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.549
 buttons and the enemy is sent to 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.709
 hard flight of his wet and you can watch 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.930
 right on the bone and the skull know how to 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.120
 same elite sniper well, not to say that 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.799
 chip straight fit perfectly into the mortal 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.840
 kombat but basically she is pretty 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.090
 I liked it all the more 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.549
 x-ray discourages half 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.250
 health so he can easily decide 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.680
 the outcome of the fight but there is still such a thing 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.810
 they need something and get there because x-ray 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.299
 can be easily blocked as usual 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.030
 punch so use neatly in 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.370
 overall this is the very good old mortal 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.530
 kombat with a small bundle of innovations and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.660
 also cool graphics and great 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.239
 animation so you will definitely like it 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.250
 and of course the same mortal kombat 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.000
 without fatality here is huge 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.000
 on and set 

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:34.769
 visually the game looks solid 

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:37.439
 top five here and perfectly traced 

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:39.629
 backgrounds and gorgeous bloody scenes and 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:42.029
 just great animation looks all 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:44.249
 well and of course not far behind 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.169
 the voice acting she did very cool and 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.239
 professional enough to remember 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.610
 let's say the same johnny cage who 

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:52.649
 constantly anneals and makes the player very funny 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.419
 but all the others are excellent 

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:56.419
 principle, we have become accustomed to this 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:09.049
 the only thing i can't look at 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.049
 so it is on thong shiva 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:22.800
 Seen no longer razvidet I think that 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.139
 fans of fighting games have long been cut in 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.569
