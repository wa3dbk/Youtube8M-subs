look at and you can see straight away

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.610 
look at and you can see straight away
that<00:00:11.070> white<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.269> actually<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.750> exchange<00:00:13.230> down

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
that white is actually the exchange down

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.369 
that white is actually the exchange down
he<00:00:13.980> has<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.460> bitch<00:00:14.730> full<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.120> porn<00:00:15.540> against<00:00:16.289> the

he has a bitch full of porn against the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.010 
he has a bitch full of porn against the
rook<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.980> black<00:00:17.279> has<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> slight<00:00:18.510> material

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
rook so black has a slight material

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.920 
rook so black has a slight material
advantage<00:00:19.529> however<00:00:20.100> things<00:00:20.609> aren't<00:00:20.939> too<00:00:21.689> bad

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
advantage however things aren't too bad

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.439 
advantage however things aren't too bad
for<00:00:22.170> white<00:00:22.350> because<00:00:23.310> his<00:00:23.460> pieces<00:00:23.760> are<00:00:24.029> so

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
for white because his pieces are so

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.029 
for white because his pieces are so
active<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:25.170> know<00:00:25.199> all<00:00:25.910> pieces<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.090> active<00:00:28.039> he

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
active you know all pieces are active he

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.970 
active you know all pieces are active he
also<00:00:29.340> has<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> very<00:00:30.240> solid<00:00:30.599> King<00:00:31.140> position<00:00:31.590> for

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
also has a very solid King position for

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
also has a very solid King position for
pawns<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.520> front<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> King<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.420> helps

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
pawns in front of the King that helps

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.900 
pawns in front of the King that helps
that<00:00:34.050> means<00:00:34.260> he<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.160> generate<00:00:35.670> activity

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that means he can generate activity

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
that means he can generate activity
without<00:00:36.570> fearing<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.620> his<00:00:37.920> King<00:00:38.190> could<00:00:38.370> be

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
without fearing that his King could be

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.720 
without fearing that his King could be
in<00:00:38.579> trouble<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:40.230> there<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.219> possibilities

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
in trouble and there are possibilities

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.510 
in trouble and there are possibilities
to<00:00:41.820> take<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> pawn<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.829> think

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to take this pawn so all in all I think

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.660 
to take this pawn so all in all I think
things<00:00:45.000> should<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.420> okay<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.719> white<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
things should be okay for white here and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.160 
things should be okay for white here and
he<00:00:47.670> played<00:00:47.910> Knight<00:00:48.450> g6<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:50.539> it's<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.660> slightly

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
he played Knight g6 now it's a slightly

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.660 
he played Knight g6 now it's a slightly
tricky<00:00:52.350> move<00:00:52.739> actually<00:00:53.539> if<00:00:54.980> black<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.280> take

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
tricky move actually if black would take

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.319 
tricky move actually if black would take
on<00:00:56.910> b4<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:57.870> rook<00:00:58.170> d8<00:00:58.640> sets<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.879> some<00:01:00.120> very

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
on b4 then rook d8 sets up some very

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.189 
on b4 then rook d8 sets up some very
interesting<00:01:00.469> complications<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:02.809> don't<00:01:03.809> go

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
interesting complications I don't go

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.140 
interesting complications I don't go
into<00:01:04.350> detail<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> look<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> critical

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
into detail I want to look at a critical

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
into detail I want to look at a critical
position<00:01:06.479> later<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.530> suffice<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> say

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
position later on but suffice to say

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.740 
position later on but suffice to say
this<00:01:08.960> black<00:01:09.960> bottled<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.299> played<00:01:12.299> Queen

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
this black bottled it and played Queen

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.200 
this black bottled it and played Queen
c6<00:01:13.500> instead<00:01:14.130> wanting<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> head<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.090> an

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
c6 instead wanting to head for an

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.370 
c6 instead wanting to head for an
endgame<00:01:15.450> well<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.960> understand<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:18.380> white

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
endgame well I understand that white

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.570 
endgame well I understand that white
took<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.939> now<00:01:21.119> means<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:22.580> there's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
took and that now means that there's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.330 
took and that now means that there's
another<00:01:24.540> slightly<00:01:25.170> weak<00:01:25.530> pawn<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.070> blacks

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
another slightly weak pawn in blacks

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.310 
another slightly weak pawn in blacks
position<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.570> course<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:27.900> sure<00:01:27.930> black

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
position but of course I'm sure black

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.920 
position but of course I'm sure black
was<00:01:28.590> relieved<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.729> Queen's<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.780> been

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
was relieved that Queen's have been

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.840 
was relieved that Queen's have been
exchanged<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.740> his<00:01:32.070> King<00:01:32.310> shouldn't<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.759> in

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
exchanged so his King shouldn't be in

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.420 
exchanged so his King shouldn't be in
any<00:01:32.939> trouble<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.640> white<00:01:35.640> checked<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:37.280> took<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
any trouble and white checked and took a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.760 
any trouble and white checked and took a
second<00:01:38.939> point<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.240> now<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.659> bishop<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> two

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
second point so now it's bishop and two

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.260 
second point so now it's bishop and two
pawns<00:01:41.070> against<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.850> rook<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> basic

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
pawns against a rook so just on a basic

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.469 
pawns against a rook so just on a basic
material<00:01:45.619> balance<00:01:46.850> then<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> position<00:01:48.360> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
material balance then the position is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.100 
material balance then the position is
actually<00:01:48.689> even<00:01:49.579> but<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:51.540> actually<00:01:51.840> still

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
actually even but it's actually still

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.859 
actually even but it's actually still
very<00:01:52.140> very<00:01:52.710> complicated<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:54.180> positions<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
very very complicated in positions of

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.310 
very very complicated in positions of
this<00:01:55.020> kind<00:01:56.000> well<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.540> depend<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.960> lots<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this kind well it can depend on lots of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.530 
this kind well it can depend on lots of
things<00:01:58.530> who's<00:01:58.710> better<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.729> activity<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
things who's better the activity of the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.050 
things who's better the activity of the
pieces<00:02:01.579> King<00:02:02.579> position<00:02:03.119> pawn<00:02:03.750> structure

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
pieces King position pawn structure

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.050 
pieces King position pawn structure
I<00:02:05.090> think<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.750> one<00:02:05.900> is<00:02:05.930> very<00:02:06.260> finely<00:02:06.530> balanced

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
I think this one is very finely balanced

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.510 
I think this one is very finely balanced
okay<00:02:08.090> route<00:02:08.300> b5<00:02:08.750> was<00:02:08.990> plate<00:02:09.229> route<00:02:10.190> B<00:02:10.340> one

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
okay route b5 was plate route B one

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
okay route b5 was plate route B one
behind<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.150> past<00:02:11.360> pawn<00:02:12.310> now<00:02:13.310> okay<00:02:13.640> -<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:14.150> think

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
behind the past pawn now okay - I think

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.210 
behind the past pawn now okay - I think
there<00:02:14.750> are<00:02:14.840> good<00:02:15.800> sides<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.220> bad<00:02:16.310> sides<00:02:16.459> to

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
there are good sides and bad sides to

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.740 
there are good sides and bad sides to
Black's<00:02:19.220> position<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.790> mean<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.000> bad<00:02:20.420> side<00:02:20.720> is

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
Black's position I mean the bad side is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.300 
Black's position I mean the bad side is
of<00:02:21.020> course<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.500> work<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.040> rather

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
of course that this work is rather

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.390 
of course that this work is rather
passive<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:23.420> b5<00:02:24.050> just<00:02:24.440> blockading<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.130> pawn

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
passive on b5 just blockading this pawn

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.020 
passive on b5 just blockading this pawn
and<00:02:25.610> in<00:02:25.880> fact<00:02:26.060> could<00:02:26.360> be<00:02:26.510> perhaps<00:02:26.959> driven<00:02:27.440> away

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
and in fact could be perhaps driven away

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.670 
and in fact could be perhaps driven away
the<00:02:29.030> plus<00:02:29.330> side<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:29.930> he<00:02:30.200> has<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> very

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the plus side is that he has a very

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.400 
the plus side is that he has a very
active<00:02:30.860> rook<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.640> -<00:02:31.700> perhaps<00:02:32.390> looking<00:02:33.290> to

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
active rook on a - perhaps looking to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.190 
active rook on a - perhaps looking to
attack<00:02:33.709> f2<00:02:34.400> with<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.300> help<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:35.750> night<00:02:35.989> at

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
attack f2 with the help of this night at

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.500 
attack f2 with the help of this night at
some<00:02:36.410> point<00:02:36.680> either<00:02:36.830> from<00:02:37.130> g4<00:02:37.670> or<00:02:38.030> sometimes

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
some point either from g4 or sometimes

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.940 
some point either from g4 or sometimes
from<00:02:38.690> evil<00:02:39.489> so<00:02:40.959> still<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.170> very<00:02:42.470> double-edged

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
from evil so still a very double-edged

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.060 
from evil so still a very double-edged
position

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
position

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.920 
position
here's<00:02:46.070> your<00:02:46.160> Beth<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.489> okay<00:02:46.850> logical<00:02:47.420> drive

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
here's your Beth one okay logical drive

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.070 
here's your Beth one okay logical drive
the<00:02:48.440> rook<00:02:48.620> away<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.989> check<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.580> then<00:02:53.510> b5

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
the rook away and it's check and then b5

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.160 
the rook away and it's check and then b5
so<00:02:54.500> white<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:55.640> slowly<00:02:55.970> advancing<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.900> seems

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
so white is slowly advancing so it seems

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.509 
so white is slowly advancing so it seems
as<00:02:57.319> though<00:02:57.440> white<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.800> make<00:02:58.010> progress

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
as though white is make progress

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.880 
as though white is make progress
