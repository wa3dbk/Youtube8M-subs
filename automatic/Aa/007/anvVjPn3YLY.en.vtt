00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
an angle and then make sure it slides

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.660 
an angle and then make sure it slides
between<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:46.530> back<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.369> bit<00:01:47.640> here

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
between that back bit and this bit here

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.380 
between that back bit and this bit here
so<00:01:48.740> let's<00:01:49.740> come<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.579> take<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
so let's come up and then we take the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
so let's come up and then we take the
new<00:01:51.750> gadget<00:01:52.619> we've<00:01:52.740> got<00:01:52.950> em<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.100> whole

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
new gadget we've got em so the whole

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.060 
new gadget we've got em so the whole
cart<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> back<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:56.850> always<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.180> hole<00:01:57.420> there

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
cart the back then always a hole there

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.690 
cart the back then always a hole there
because<00:01:59.070> there's<00:01:59.189> nothing<00:01:59.250> at<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

hook bit is where it hooks up on the leg
might<00:02:08.580> say<00:02:08.869> say<00:02:09.869> say<00:02:10.170> fit<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.800> slide

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
might say say say fit it just slide

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.940 
might say say say fit it just slide
slide<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.550> in

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
to solder in and bolt on so we can do a

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.110 
to solder in and bolt on so we can do a
video<00:05:51.630> on<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.440> next<00:05:52.530> few<00:05:52.860> days<00:05:53.120> I

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
video on that in the next few days I

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.110 
video on that in the next few days I
will<00:05:54.720> do<00:05:54.810> my<00:05:54.840> new<00:05:55.260> phantom<00:05:55.850> controller<00:05:56.850> which

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
will do my new phantom controller which

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.480 
will do my new phantom controller which
it's<00:05:57.270> got<00:05:57.390> the<00:05:57.540> door<00:05:57.780> side<00:05:58.530> wheel<00:05:59.070> on<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.280> side

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
it's got the door side wheel on the side

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.060 
it's got the door side wheel on the side
which<00:05:59.820> allows<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.480> tilt<00:06:00.900> camera<00:06:01.800> up<00:06:01.890> and

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
which allows you to tilt camera up and

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.960 
which allows you to tilt camera up and
down<00:06:02.190> basically<00:06:03.170> so<00:06:04.170> I<00:06:04.200> would<00:06:04.620> have<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:05.190> video

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
down basically so I would have a video

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.760 
down basically so I would have a video
