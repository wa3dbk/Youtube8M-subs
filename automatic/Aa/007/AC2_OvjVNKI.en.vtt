00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:15.389
 Do you remember the beggar of the game? 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:17.340
 robocop can make the connection between 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.039
 he is one more character of the company 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.140
 rockstar not not see that we 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:37.260
 find out everything about this case the most 1 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:39.450
 breaking - who will be the ball and provided 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.950
 well attention in the four weeks realized 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.110
 that in the mission that we had to deliver 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.840
 the last transmitter the freak of stealing 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 a beggar who lived inside the bus 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.489
 we notice that it is supposedly reduced 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.710
 but was it really that it was 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.340
 abducted will have what it really is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.010
 same 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.199
 You're not understanding. I'll explain when I say. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.180
 he might not be himself I 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.489
 I am referring to the fact that he may already have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.519
 appeared before in some company game 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.740
 rockstar games theft has a fix for 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.560
 ice full of conspiracy theory 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.110
 besides asking for strange things to the team 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.270
 such as tractors to make 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.310
 contacts and extraterrestrials talking about 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.470
 It even seems like we're talking about 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.470
 another character from the same rockstar 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 uai 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.600
 I was just getting carried away here in the vain edition 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.600
 back to the mood of suspense 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.190
 when I say that maybe he looks like another 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.070
 rockstar company character yes I do 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.290
 I refer to the truth the old gta rip 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.270
 san andreas officially steal a 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.100
 war veteran of Korea who was 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.200
 half stopped after seeing all his 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.510
 army died by friendly fire in case 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.910
 traitors were in their platoon and 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.600
 ended up setting an ambush for the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.790
 your example 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.340
 already the truth is a hip that lived 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.030
 crazily sex adventures and troggs 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.860
 tica 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.210
 I do not think that word exists, but 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.630
 there is not I just invented the 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.760
 60's 70 's and 80's missions 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.980
 dance theft are very similar to 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.570
 those of the truth of gta san andreas 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.460
 all involve collecting objects 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.430
 strangers that will serve something 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.150
 great secret but the protagonists 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.640
 of the game 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.160
 in the case of miguel lopes do be this day 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.960
 do gta san andreas do not know what 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.540
 really are those things that they 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.310
 are stealing, for example, the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.980
 green that tutti and asks carlos johnson 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.530
 and the transceivers he stole asks him 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.870
 Another strong point is the fact that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.110
 theft and the truth are very similar 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.790
 physically but something that ends 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.489
 contradicting everything just 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.720
 talking is that in that it was a calm hip 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.480
 calm and serene 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.750
 already the beggar theft was well stressed 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.959
 nervous and very far from being 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.959
 yea 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.640
 something else that runs counter to his theory. 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.100
 It would be the same person because stealing and 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.770
 trudy is almost the same age 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.170
 yes that might even strengthen the theory 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.010
 but it weakens the simple fact 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.400
 san andreas to pass in 1992 and dance 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.440
 supposedly in 2008 then theft would have 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.770
 that being much older than it is 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.170
 but who knows if the truth is so old 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.700
 as he claims to be because after all 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.100
 promotional image of him 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.110
 he seems to be much younger this all 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.970
 opens the door to difficult questions 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.220
 answer will have to steal 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.560
 have any connection with the truth or 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.360
 So will it steal and cheat me? 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.610
 same person or will it be a 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.770
 coincidence and they are only two 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.720
 old - they would both be the same person 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.850
 it's a crazy theory 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.980
 not as much as I have already explained in a 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.900
 previous video when talking about the universe 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.720
 rockstar all company games 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.060
 are connected to each other and often 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.430
 some characters participate in two 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.070
 games totally different from the company 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.410
 not exactly two games appear 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.810
 item in case some characters from a 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.480
 game quoted elements from another game 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.940
 entirely different, such as for example 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.740
 the case of when it goes fifth of gta 5 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.930
 says that if the first robbery was in 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.520
 cilic character which is the city of banfield 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.070
 or when dill 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.230
 gta 4 says he studied in the york band 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.220
 academy which is the college where the 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.370
 bani game 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.320
 yes the rock universe is one and it's alright 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.790
 plausible that there is a link between these 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.800
 two beautiful hands 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.110
 even believing in the theory that they 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.580
 have some kind of connection stays very 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.710
 difficult to prove it 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.230
 after all rockstar games is very 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.360
 meticulous in their games and hardly 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.150
 leaves loose ends announces that he 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.610
 escape and of course your clues and tips are 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.620
 very subtle at a certain moment of san 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.500
 andreas while carlos johnson is still 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.390
 I was on truth adventures to state if 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.490
 since it came to rest on the saints and not 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.790
 know how to understand that leaving the 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.890
 aliens the habit ciram 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.240
 the last appearance of 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.120
 theft in bali 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.430
 we see a strong light coming from the sky 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.410
 supposedly abducting a man of good 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.050
 analyzing the video we have that after the 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.900
 last fight class that robs the adm 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.600
 theft is carried by a strange light and 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.280
 coming from very high and looking at 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.560
 to heaven we can not see 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.570
 exactly where you came from 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.460
 until that moment we did not know 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.930
 exactly what the radios 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.960
 transmitters and vinyl 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.950
 we have some ideas but not certainties 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.690
 we had none 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.850
 apparently the transmitters 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.770
 for theft to make contacts with 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.960
 beings from other planets 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.060
 The curious thing about all this is that the truth 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.850
 lives by stating that he made contacts 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.920
 extraterrestrials and maybe now a green 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.120
 that he so wanted was something that the 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.120
 days did not want the government to 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.250
 analyzed and trudy and clear by 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.530
 consequences were instruments 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.520
 ground forces that served to recover 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.770
 this artifact 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.410
 there are still theories that 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.140
 robbery and the truth are really a 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.180
 alien unites a being who has the power to 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.880
 between the galaxies and also in the 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:25.170
 time he got to be in san 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.900
 andrés in 1992 at band hot academy years 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.550
 later on in its single objective is 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.910
 always bring knowledge to your 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.850
 chosen in the case cardion independence 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.300
 angels and jimmy ropes in guam 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.680
 Finally whoever they are being or not 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.810
 the same person 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.240
 are two iconic characters and 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.820
 mysterious clear an answer 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:53.840
 final concrete concrete action on the 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.840
 they are, let 's say they make it possible 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.920
