have to do is mix some vanilla into the
sugar<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.890> then<00:04:05.160> leave<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.520> sitting<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:05.970> my

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
sugar and then leave it sitting on my

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.550 
sugar and then leave it sitting on my
counter<00:04:06.450> what's<00:04:06.780> really<00:04:07.050> going<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.260> evaporate

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
counter what's really going to evaporate

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.290 
counter what's really going to evaporate
out<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:08.190> may<00:04:08.310> lose<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.580> little<00:04:08.910> bit<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.240> the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
out you may lose a little bit of the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.000 
out you may lose a little bit of the
flavoring<00:04:09.840> but<00:04:09.990> what<00:04:10.590> you're<00:04:10.740> really<00:04:10.770> going

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
flavoring but what you're really going

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.360 
flavoring but what you're really going
to<00:04:11.100> evaporate<00:04:11.370> out<00:04:11.670> is<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.240> alcohol<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.370> if

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
to evaporate out is the alcohol and if

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.710 
to evaporate out is the alcohol and if
you<00:04:14.550> leave<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:14.910> your<00:04:15.090> counter<00:04:15.450> overnight

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
you leave it on your counter overnight

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.630 
you leave it on your counter overnight
it's<00:04:16.080> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.590> dry<00:04:16.830> I<00:04:16.859> would<00:04:17.160> stir<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.580> a

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
it's going to dry I would stir it a

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.070 
it's going to dry I would stir it a
couple<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:17.940> times<00:04:18.210> and<00:04:18.450> leave<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.720> out<00:04:18.810> there

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
couple of times and leave it out there

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.960 
couple of times and leave it out there
and<00:04:19.290> I<00:04:19.710> think<00:04:19.770> I'm<00:04:20.100> gonna<00:04:20.190> try<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.549> I'll<00:04:20.820> let

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
and I think I'm gonna try it I'll let

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.220 
and I think I'm gonna try it I'll let
you<00:04:21.120> know<00:04:21.150> what<00:04:21.390> happens<00:04:21.750> but<00:04:21.900> I'm<00:04:22.020> going<00:04:22.140> to

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.080 
make my own vanilla powder but I'm not
falling<00:04:23.940> for<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:25.010> it's<00:04:26.010> probably<00:04:26.220> handy<00:04:26.910> and

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
falling for this it's probably handy and
