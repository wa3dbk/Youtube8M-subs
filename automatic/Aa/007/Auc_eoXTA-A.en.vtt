00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
by how the leap between those djinns

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.420 
by how the leap between those djinns
it's<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.450> nearly<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.469> big<00:00:44.129> as

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's not going to be nearly as big as

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.720 
it's not going to be nearly as big as
the<00:00:45.180> leap<00:00:45.390> between<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.140> 6th<00:00:46.469> gen<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.399> 7th

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
gen or even any generally before that

gen or even any generally before that
really<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:50.969> how<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.120> saying<00:00:51.360> because

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
really you see how I'm saying because

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.410 
really you see how I'm saying because
there<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.680> been<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.160> huge<00:00:53.520> incremental

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
there have been just huge incremental

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
there have been just huge incremental
leaps<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> previous<00:00:55.829> generations

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
leaps with the previous generations

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.619 
leaps with the previous generations
