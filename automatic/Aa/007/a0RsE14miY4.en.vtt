00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.840 

really<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.750> was<00:00:09.870> prepping<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.320> this

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
really as I was prepping for this

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.370 
really as I was prepping for this
I<00:00:11.150> was<00:00:11.300> thinking<00:00:11.750> about<00:00:11.900> sue

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
I was thinking about sue

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.440 
I was thinking about sue
and<00:00:14.629> realizing<00:00:15.629> why<00:00:16.049> he<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.420> will<00:00:18.420> always

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
and realizing why he is and will always

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.540 
and realizing why he is and will always
be<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.170> best<00:00:19.199> superhero<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.509> I<00:00:21.509> think<00:00:22.020> it's

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
be the best superhero and I think it's

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.800 
be the best superhero and I think it's
essentially<00:00:23.550> his<00:00:24.800> ability<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.009> fly<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.700> mean<00:00:27.689> he

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
essentially his ability to fly I mean he

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.790 
essentially his ability to fly I mean he
can<00:00:27.960> fly<00:00:28.550> without<00:00:29.550> any<00:00:30.060> gimmicks<00:00:30.779> or<00:00:31.170> devices

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
can fly without any gimmicks or devices

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.990 
can fly without any gimmicks or devices
that's<00:00:32.369> such<00:00:32.640> an<00:00:32.759> amazing<00:00:33.510> thing<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.000> I've

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that's such an amazing thing and I've

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.610 
that's such an amazing thing and I've
been<00:00:36.390> developing<00:00:36.629> this<00:00:36.930> theory<00:00:37.170> about<00:00:37.320> that's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
been developing this theory about that's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.540 
been developing this theory about that's
why<00:00:37.800> he's<00:00:38.610> endured<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.449> so<00:00:39.660> long<00:00:39.960> because

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
why he's endured for so long because

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
why he's endured for so long because
human<00:00:41.550> beings<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.449> this<00:00:44.180> innate<00:00:45.260> thing<00:00:46.260> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
human beings have this innate thing it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.119 
human beings have this innate thing it
seems<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.039> dreaming<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:47.940> flight<00:00:48.649> it's<00:00:49.649> it's

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
seems of dreaming about flight it's it's

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.760 
seems of dreaming about flight it's it's
in<00:00:50.280> our<00:00:50.399> DNA<00:00:50.430> somehow<00:00:51.300> even<00:00:52.110> children<00:00:52.530> dream

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
in our DNA somehow even children dream

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.750 
in our DNA somehow even children dream
about<00:00:52.920> flying<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.800> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
about flying and I think that that is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
about flying and I think that that is
just<00:00:57.410> thinking<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> second

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
just thinking about that for a second

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
just thinking about that for a second
and<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.879> all<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> things<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.960> could<00:01:01.170> do

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and and all the things that you could do

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.959 
and and all the things that you could do
with<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> responsibility<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
with that and the responsibility that

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
with that and the responsibility that
you<00:01:03.120> would<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.510> being<00:01:04.350> able<00:01:04.440> to<00:01:04.589> at<00:01:04.739> any

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you would have being able to at any

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
you would have being able to at any
moment<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.610> leave<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.240> environment<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
moment just leave your environment and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.330 
moment just leave your environment and
go<00:01:07.020> someplace<00:01:07.289> else

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
go someplace else

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.660 
go someplace else
