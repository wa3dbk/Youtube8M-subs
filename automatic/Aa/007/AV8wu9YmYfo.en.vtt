00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
a huge level gap from when I was filming

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.490 
a huge level gap from when I was filming
last<00:04:21.380> time<00:04:21.769> but<00:04:22.010> um<00:04:22.930> basically<00:04:23.930> what<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.410> did

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
last time but um basically what I did

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.370 
last time but um basically what I did
was<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.280> took<00:04:25.700> advantage<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.570> two<00:04:27.050> times

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
was I took advantage of two times

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.660 
was I took advantage of two times
because<00:04:27.710> there<00:04:27.830> was<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:27.980> lot<00:04:28.040> of<00:04:28.130> two<00:04:28.370> times

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
because there was a lot of two times

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.810 
because there was a lot of two times
events<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.360> then<00:04:29.690> on<00:04:30.020> top<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.620> there<00:04:31.610> was

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
events and then on top of that there was

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.680 
events and then on top of that there was
he's<00:04:32.030> 1.5<00:04:32.750> times<00:04:33.140> cards<00:04:34.130> coupon<00:04:34.880> things<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:35.450> i

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
he's 1.5 times cards coupon things so i

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.140 
he's 1.5 times cards coupon things so i
was<00:04:36.470> using<00:04:36.620> those<00:04:36.890> so<00:04:37.100> I<00:04:37.160> loved<00:04:37.370> up<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.790> lot

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.840 
honestly not even worth it it just takes
too<00:05:44.480> long<00:05:44.510> to<00:05:44.780> get<00:05:45.260> there<00:05:45.500> and<00:05:45.830> then<00:05:46.610> go<00:05:46.640> back

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
too long to get there and then go back

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.780 
too long to get there and then go back
to<00:05:47.300> where<00:05:47.450> you<00:05:47.570> want<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.870> train<00:05:48.370> so<00:05:49.370> i'll

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
to where you want to train so i'll

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.730 
to where you want to train so i'll
probably<00:05:50.120> just<00:05:50.240> do<00:05:50.480> this<00:05:50.630> later<00:05:50.690> on<00:05:51.290> because<00:05:51.620> i

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
probably just do this later on because i

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.300 
probably just do this later on because i
just<00:05:51.770> really<00:05:52.640> do<00:05:52.970> not<00:05:53.150> feel<00:05:53.210> like<00:05:53.540> doing<00:05:53.780> them

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310
