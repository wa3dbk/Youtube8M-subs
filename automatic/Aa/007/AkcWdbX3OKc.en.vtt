00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:07.760
 Y 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.639
 there are some very good girls there 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.350
 we are in a lot of new news 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.380
 thank you all for being there and in 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.619
 special the net that yesterday helped me 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.860
 to do the videos and it always happened to him 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.410
 same since one rose and during the night 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.800
 he skipped third - party content because 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.570
 uploaded the mafia 3 video and jumped the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.699
 third - party content and copyright 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.410
 that we have had to eliminate it and 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.900
 because he listened to us and people said 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.000
 that methane water was not heard 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.370
 so in the source of the description 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.100
 you will have the trailer of yesterday of mafia 3 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.140
 which is a game that looks spectacular and 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.949
 the news that happens to us attentive 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.790
 guys girls because it 's 2016 is presented 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.000
 with gameplays in gamescom and is that it 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:00.810
 have filtered from the fair itself 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.110
 German attentive because we can see good 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.570
 several gameplays this time two 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.030
 friendly one between brazil and france and 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.410
 another between Juventus and Rome does not 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.850
 I can put the screen logically 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.160
 because they are jobs that have been filtered 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.630
 of the fair means that the solo 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.670
 official but you see in a 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.230
 very high quality I do not know how they do it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.850
 really if you connect in your 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.010
 capturing there or how but it really is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.680
 well it looks very good 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.140
 it gives me that they want to try 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.750
 recover that essence of pes 6 not of 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.910
 where playstation2 and every time what 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.680
 they are getting more and more to me what 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.910
 that I see visually without testing it 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.490
 we will have to logically wait for that day 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.360
 I think it's 13 to see that some and 13 of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.890
 August so for good to try and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.530
 enjoy ourselves by ourselves 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.500
 as if s &amp; p 2016 but the saga from 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.009
 then he intends to return to his roots by 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.130
 at least for what I can observe in 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.539
 the gameplays nord 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.009
 Of course the graphic engine fox engine 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.369
 recreates the action in the field quite 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.470
 reliable and looks good 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.099
 returning many thanks to all 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.440
 I hope you share it thanks and like 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.440
 favorites and then on the next chao
