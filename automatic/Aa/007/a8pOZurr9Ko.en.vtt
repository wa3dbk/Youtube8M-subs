the<00:03:44.080> thing<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.880> just<00:03:46.870> proposed<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.770> do

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
the thing and I just proposed it to do

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.729 
the thing and I just proposed it to do
it<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.190> 300<00:03:49.090> EXC<00:03:49.569> electric<00:03:49.959> start<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.440> figured

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
it on a 300 EXC electric start I figured

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.400 
it on a 300 EXC electric start I figured
that<00:03:50.920> having<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.370> button<00:03:52.330> is<00:03:52.989> going<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.200> make

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
that having the button is going to make

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.780 
that having the button is going to make
all<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.680> difference<00:03:54.040> once<00:03:54.250> again<00:03:54.550> when<00:03:54.760> you

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
all the difference once again when you

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.070 
all the difference once again when you
tie<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:56.790> yeah<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.300> was<00:03:58.690> like<00:03:58.870> six

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080
