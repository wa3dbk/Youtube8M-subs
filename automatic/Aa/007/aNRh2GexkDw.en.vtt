00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.639
 In case you do not affect the company, it has been accumulated in one of 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.200
 the circuits of the main board it is best to use a product 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.710
 specialized for cleaning these chips 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 how is the fuel an electronic circuit and tablet cleaner 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.100
 let's see how this is done 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.380
 first of all to be able to apply it more accurately 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.480
 It would be convenient to put the tube 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.720
 which already includes our 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.080
 let's assume that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.380
 this chip has a lot of accumulated dirt in that case using our tube 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.040
 we aim perfectly the product aceche corresponding we rotate some 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.230
 how many downloads 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 with that we will know perfectly cleaned all the contacts 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.460
 without need to 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.940
 do complex procedures 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.200
 basically this is what we can give preventive maintenance inside 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.040
 from a pc 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.440
 we only need to go back to kobe do not undermine efe 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.540
 ideal maintenance by the external party 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.630
 to give extreme maintenance we have a ticket and these peripherals 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.979
 let's give it a clean 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.820
 with a special product 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.960
 the next 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.799
 It was a cleaning foam designed 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.799
 for impiety the electronic equipment cabinets 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.970
 this foam is applied 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.970
 about our cabinet 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700
 stretches with a cloth 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.960
 we let it rest for a moment 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.970
 and then with a clean cloth 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.500
 we remove it 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 leaving our equipment perfectly clean 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.630
 and brilliant 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.070
 this you can do with confidence that it will not harm and the surfaces 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.190
 metal or plastic surface 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.500
 once we have finished cleaning the top we can also 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.060
 use the same product to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.650
 the front of a single minute however it is possible that something happens to you 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:54.920
 like this 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 the foam reached places that we can hardly pull with a 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.980
 simple flannel 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.060
 in that case 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.170
 we can resort again deals with the project and simply 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.939
 eliminate excess sleep 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.040
 to clean items like the keyboard 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.939
 we can use a couple of the products that we have already seen as in the project 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.479
 and the next 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:22.399
 However, as always, it is better that your keyboard is disconnected 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.279
 when that cleaning process 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:28.199
 and let it rest a long time so that the products reach to dissipate 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.409
 reach evaporate 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.849
 and they can not effect 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.879
 keyboard circuits 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.899
 first with it compressed air 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:37.949
 We talked so that the PSOE 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.449
 her husband is the whole society that has been simulated between the keys 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.359
 once this is done 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.059
 we can apply 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.849
 our as a cleaner 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.779
 to clean surfaces 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:52.920
 both of the keyboard 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.920
 as of the cfe 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.109
 do it with care 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.909
 taking care not to suspend the keys those sites 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.429
 Remove with the flannel as much foam as you can 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.419
 and the excess that I could have left 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.109
 between the keys 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.069
 can be retired again with 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.049
 compressed air 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.119
 let your keyboard rest 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.749
 about 10 15 minutes and after a while you can connect a 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.749
 and will be working a keyboard that this like new 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.480
 for cleaning the monitor 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.599
 we are using two products 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.980
 again we will use 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.469
 cleaning foam 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:52.479
 and with it 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.189
 we will see cleanliness to everything that is the bevel 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.639
 from our monitor 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.629
 On the other hand the screen must be cleaned with a special product 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.149
 the compound 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:04.319
 a liquid 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.309
 because it allows a perfect cleaning 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.159
 and that prevents electrostatic charges has brought back 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.940
 the dust 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.509
 and the screen become dirty quickly 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:16.269
 in this case to apply the cleaning foam more precisely 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.269
 it is better to first place it on a cloth 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.270
 and so explain it 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.270
 about our monitor 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.930
 take care that the foam 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.059
 touch the screen as little as possible 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:32.749
 it does not hurt 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.969
 but the screen will be cleaned 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.969
 with a special liquid 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.620
 once you have finished explaining perfectly what is the dif the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.939
 plastic are not monitor 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:48.599
 the time has come for Brazil 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.110
 prevent the surface of the screen 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.870
 to clean the screen we use 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.669
 the composer 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:56.639
 applies 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.639
 from a distance of about twenty centimeters 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.569
 and with a clean cloth 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.900
 kroto perfectly the entire surface 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.539
 to withdraw all society 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.949
 let sit a few minutes connect your monitor and see the difference 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.419
 the compost atp also serves us 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.240
 to clean interactive whiteboards from those normally used in 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.599
 smart multimedia schools and boards 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.280
 once we have finished 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.559
 with maintenance at jar level by our pc 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.680
 it must work perfectly 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.740
 present a clean appearance glowing foot 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.809
 in upcoming installments of these videos we will see issues such as maintenance 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.069
 software level 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.780
 detection ti correction of some faults 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.830
 from our personal computer 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.020
 use of utilities 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.539
 assembly of personal computers 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.300
 etc 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.370
 well friends we hope this information is useful 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.569
 and we remind you that you can have the videos as support material 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.779
 learn to join a computer 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.860
 the secrets of updating a computer 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.039
 location of computer faults 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.199
 and installation of networks for small businesses 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.210
 and I remind you that you can visit the page 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.800
 computation I do not apply pointed where they can download 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.400
 updated technical information on computer repair as well as 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.869
 of its peripherals 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:35.379
 and it generated for two thank you very much for being with us for those pipelines 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:37.460
 operation and until next time 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.180
 until next time
