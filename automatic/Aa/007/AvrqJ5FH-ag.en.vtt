this<00:00:06.690> episode<00:00:06.990> I'm<00:00:07.649> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.220> talk<00:00:08.580> about

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
this episode I'm going to talk about

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.039 
this episode I'm going to talk about
smart<00:00:09.840> objects<00:00:10.670> this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.910> similar<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.780> using

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
smart objects this is similar to using

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.880 
smart objects this is similar to using
masks<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.400> able<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.790> work<00:00:15.120> completely

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890

example where I show nearly all the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.910 
example where I show nearly all the
advantages<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.439> working<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:23.580> smart<00:00:24.000> objects

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
advantages of working with smart objects

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.460 
advantages of working with smart objects
you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.130> convert<00:00:26.640> any<00:00:26.880> layer<00:00:27.599> into<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> smart

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you can convert any layer into a smart

will see that I can here on the bottom

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.099 
will see that I can here on the bottom
right<00:00:54.840> corner<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.070> thumbnail<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:57.109> will

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
right corner of the thumbnail I will

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.110 
right corner of the thumbnail I will
create<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.500> duplicate<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.579> layer<00:00:59.789> by

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
create a duplicate from this layer by

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.779 
create a duplicate from this layer by
using<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:01.350> move<00:01:01.530> tool<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.010> pressing<00:01:02.640> down

using the move tool and pressing down
the<00:01:02.940> Alt<00:01:03.149> key<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:04.170> there's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.589> duplicate<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the Alt key so there's a duplicate and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.240 
the Alt key so there's a duplicate and
if<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.060> want<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> turn<00:01:06.720> back<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.260> smart<00:01:08.040> object

rasterize layer the only disadvantage of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.450 
rasterize layer the only disadvantage of
a<00:01:17.070> smart<00:01:17.369> object<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.780> can't

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
a smart object is that you can't

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.850 
a smart object is that you can't
directly<00:01:20.460> draw<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.840> layer<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.590> make

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
directly draw on that layer or make

directly draw on that layer or make
changes<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.540> use<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> brush

changes to it so if you use the brush

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.499 
changes to it so if you use the brush
tool<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.520> warning<00:01:26.729> sign<00:01:27.240> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
tool you will get a warning sign that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.140 
tool you will get a warning sign that
you<00:01:27.750> can't<00:01:28.020> draw<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.680> layer<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.909> can

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you can't draw on this layer but you can

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.710 
you can't draw on this layer but you can
draw<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.750> rasterize<00:01:31.560> layer<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.720> of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
draw on a rasterize layer like this of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.020 
draw on a rasterize layer like this of
course<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.140> don't<00:01:34.320> want<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.220> but

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
course I don't want to do that now but

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.109 
course I don't want to do that now but
now<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.250> normal<00:01:38.250> layer<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> right

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
now I have a normal layer on the right

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.170 
now I have a normal layer on the right
and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.200> smart<00:01:40.530> object<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> left<00:01:41.490> now

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and the smart object on the left now

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
and the smart object on the left now
what<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> first<00:01:42.869> big<00:01:43.229> difference<00:01:43.740> between

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
what is the first big difference between

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.899 
what is the first big difference between
the<00:01:44.310> two<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.720> select<00:01:46.140> both<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.439> them<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the two if I select both of them and I

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630 
the two if I select both of them and I
use<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.329> free<00:01:48.600> transform<00:01:48.899> tool<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.399> make

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
use my free transform tool and I make

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
use my free transform tool and I make
them<00:01:50.880> much<00:01:51.149> smaller<00:01:51.920> something<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.159> this

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
them much smaller something like this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120 
them much smaller something like this
little<00:01:54.420> windmills<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> background<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
little windmills in the background and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.850 
little windmills in the background and
then<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.360> change<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:58.049> mind<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.649> would

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
then if I change my mind and I would

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.920 
then if I change my mind and I would
like<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.219> turn<00:01:59.399> them<00:01:59.640> back<00:01:59.820> again<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.719> their

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
like to turn them back again in their

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.990 
like to turn them back again in their
original<00:02:01.170> size<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.399> use<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> free

transform<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:04.200> will<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.820> Left

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
transform you will see that on the Left

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.350 
transform you will see that on the Left
we<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.259> perfect<00:02:08.009> quality<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
we have a perfect quality but on the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.949 
we have a perfect quality but on the
right<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:10.200> lost<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:11.039> quality<00:02:11.629> because<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
right we lost the quality because of the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.910 
right we lost the quality because of the
down<00:02:13.170> sampling

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
down sampling

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.150 
down sampling
the<00:02:14.040> previous<00:02:14.610> step<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.110> accept<00:02:16.980> this

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
the previous step so if I accept this

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.059 
the previous step so if I accept this
you<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.880> see<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.540> smart<00:02:18.870> object<00:02:19.069> can

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
you can see that the smart object can

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.750 
you can see that the smart object can
use<00:02:20.340> always<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.020> original<00:02:22.020> resolution<00:02:22.760> while

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
use always the original resolution while

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.510 
use always the original resolution while
another<00:02:24.209> normal<00:02:25.020> layer<00:02:25.230> will<00:02:25.590> always<00:02:26.069> lose

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
another normal layer will always lose

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.180 
another normal layer will always lose
quality<00:02:27.270> when<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.870> use<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.440> free<00:02:28.680> transform

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
quality when you use the free transform

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.600 
quality when you use the free transform
tool<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.870> very<00:02:31.260> important<00:02:32.100> thing<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
tool this is a very important thing and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.390 
tool this is a very important thing and
one<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.360> main<00:02:33.660> advantages<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.530> working

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
one of the main advantages of working

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.790 
one of the main advantages of working
with<00:02:35.520> Smart<00:02:35.850> Objects<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.050> will<00:02:37.350> now<00:02:37.500> just

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
with Smart Objects so I will now just

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.979 
with Smart Objects so I will now just
delete<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.400> rasterized<00:02:39.150> version<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.780> don't

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
delete this rasterized version I don't

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.580 
delete this rasterized version I don't
need<00:02:40.230> it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
need it

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.130 
need it
I<00:02:40.620> will<00:02:41.040> only<00:02:41.190> use<00:02:41.459> my<00:02:41.700> smart<00:02:42.090> object<00:02:42.630> version

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
I will only use my smart object version

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.530 
I will only use my smart object version
I<00:02:43.349> will<00:02:43.800> put<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.310> windmill<00:02:45.000> here<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.420> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
I will put a windmill here in the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.809 
I will put a windmill here in the
foreground<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.590> will<00:02:46.920> make<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> duplicate

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
foreground but I will make a duplicate

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.000 
foreground but I will make a duplicate
and<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.450> will<00:02:48.630> put<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.830> background

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
and I will put that in the background

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.880 
and I will put that in the background
make<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.819> small<00:02:51.269> version<00:02:51.630> something<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.650> this

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
make a small version something like this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.360 
make a small version something like this
I<00:02:53.220> put<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.150> here<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> background<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.590> I

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
I put that here in the background and I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.059 
I put that here in the background and I
will<00:02:56.640> make<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.850> third<00:02:57.299> version<00:02:57.690> alt<00:02:58.410> click<00:02:58.830> and

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
will make a third version alt click and

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.550 
will make a third version alt click and
drag<00:02:59.459> put<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.269> here<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.780> right<00:03:00.959> make<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.440> a

drag put it here on the right make it a
little<00:03:01.709> bit<00:03:01.890> larger<00:03:02.100> if<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.870> middle

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
little bit larger if this is the middle

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.960 
little bit larger if this is the middle
ground<00:03:04.590> then<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.010> should<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.459> little<00:03:05.790> bit

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
ground then it should be a little bit

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.509 
ground then it should be a little bit
larger<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.170> will<00:03:07.410> use<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.769> free<00:03:08.010> transform

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
larger and I will use the free transform

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.050 
larger and I will use the free transform
tool<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.970> quickly<00:03:09.650> reflect<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.950> layer<00:03:11.280> by

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
tool to quickly reflect this layer by

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.270 
tool to quickly reflect this layer by
pressing<00:03:12.090> down<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.840> Alt<00:03:13.080> key<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.680> clicking

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
pressing down the Alt key and clicking

pressing down the Alt key and clicking
here<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.000> right<00:03:15.620> control<00:03:16.620> point<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.160> can

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
here on the right control point I can

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.949 
here on the right control point I can
easily<00:03:18.750> rotate<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.890> like<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.660> this<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.810> by

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
easily rotate it like this this is by

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.050 
easily rotate it like this this is by
the<00:03:21.989> way<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.440> flip<00:03:22.709> horizontal<00:03:23.459> option<00:03:23.910> that

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the way the flip horizontal option that

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.539 
the way the flip horizontal option that
you<00:03:24.209> also<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> menu<00:03:25.140> edit<00:03:26.010> transform

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
you also have in the menu edit transform

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.920 
you also have in the menu edit transform
and<00:03:27.090> flip<00:03:27.959> horizontal<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.760> now<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.420> three

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and flip horizontal so now I have three

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.750 
and flip horizontal so now I have three
versions<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.769> as<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.190> can<00:03:32.370> see<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.670> the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
versions and as you can see in the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.910 
versions and as you can see in the
layers<00:03:32.940> panel<00:03:33.329> all<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:34.170> them<00:03:34.380> are<00:03:34.560> smart

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
layers panel all of them are smart

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.729 
layers panel all of them are smart
objects<00:03:35.519> now<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.269> advantage<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.380> Smart

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
objects now the advantage of Smart

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.860 
objects now the advantage of Smart
Objects<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.640> if<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.000> duplicate<00:03:39.600> them

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
Objects is that if you duplicate them

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.759 
Objects is that if you duplicate them
they<00:03:40.500> will<00:03:40.739> share<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.640> same<00:03:41.970> source<00:03:42.630> if<00:03:43.260> I

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
they will share the same source if I

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.160 
they will share the same source if I
double<00:03:44.160> click<00:03:44.370> on<00:03:44.519> any<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:45.120> these<00:03:45.420> thumbnails

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
double click on any of these thumbnails

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.300 
double click on any of these thumbnails
I<00:03:46.709> will<00:03:47.489> see<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.299> source<00:03:48.690> image<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.650> saved

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
I will see the source image that I saved

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.840 
I will see the source image that I saved
when<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:50.940> created<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.750> first<00:03:52.049> smart<00:03:52.410> object<00:03:52.890> if

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
when I created the first smart object if

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.690 
when I created the first smart object if
I<00:03:54.150> make<00:03:54.359> changes<00:03:54.390> on<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.799> then<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.310> save

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
I make changes on this and then I save

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.870 
I make changes on this and then I save
this<00:03:57.030> embedded<00:03:57.569> smart<00:03:58.230> object<00:03:58.680> source<00:03:58.980> we

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
this embedded smart object source we

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.270 
this embedded smart object source we
will<00:04:00.090> see<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.540> changes<00:04:01.079> appear<00:04:01.260> on<00:04:01.769> all<00:04:02.040> the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
will see the changes appear on all the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.960 
will see the changes appear on all the
instances<00:04:03.030> at<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.720> same<00:04:03.959> time<00:04:04.319> so<00:04:05.190> let's<00:04:05.459> try

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
instances at the same time so let's try

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.720 
instances at the same time so let's try
this<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.480> will<00:04:06.840> arrange<00:04:07.140> my<00:04:07.410> documents<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.190> see

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
this I will arrange my documents to see

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.930 
this I will arrange my documents to see
both<00:04:09.030> images<00:04:09.630> at<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.870> same<00:04:09.989> time<00:04:10.609> so<00:04:11.609> this<00:04:11.880> is

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
both images at the same time so this is

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.720 
both images at the same time so this is
the<00:04:12.540> image<00:04:12.930> with<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.230> three<00:04:13.620> windmills<00:04:14.459> and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
the image with the three windmills and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
will create an adjustment layer in this

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.610 
will create an adjustment layer in this
case<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.950> will<00:04:23.130> use<00:04:23.539> hue/saturation<00:04:24.539> I<00:04:24.720> turn<00:04:25.590> on

drew over parts of the VIN mail like

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.730 
drew over parts of the VIN mail like
this<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:50.240> add<00:04:50.449> some<00:04:50.780> marks<00:04:51.169> on<00:04:51.350> it

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
this to add some marks on it

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.420 
this to add some marks on it
now<00:04:52.370> there's<00:04:52.880> no<00:04:53.180> change<00:04:53.570> yet<00:04:53.770> here<00:04:54.770> on<00:04:55.010> the

right in the original image I just make

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.680 
right in the original image I just make
this<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.580> little<00:04:58.790> bit<00:04:58.970> larger<00:04:59.510> but<00:05:01.180> if<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.360> come

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
this a little bit larger but if I come

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.170 
this a little bit larger but if I come
back<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.380> source<00:05:03.830> image<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.910> go<00:05:05.120> to

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
back to the source image and I go to

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
all of the three instances will update

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.110 
all of the three instances will update
at<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.960> same<00:05:12.229> time<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.580> great<00:05:13.729> thing

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
at the same time and the great thing

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.240 
at the same time and the great thing
with<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.479> smart<00:05:14.780> object<00:05:14.990> is<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:16.010> can

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
with the smart object is that you can

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.140 
with the smart object is that you can
make<00:05:16.490> another<00:05:17.240> layered<00:05:18.280> document<00:05:19.280> for<00:05:19.970> the

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
make another layered document for the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.300 
make another layered document for the
smart<00:05:20.449> object<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:21.080> save<00:05:21.590> all<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:21.919> those

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
smart object and save all of those

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.170 
smart object and save all of those
layers<00:05:22.550> into<00:05:23.389> that<00:05:23.810> smart<00:05:24.380> object<00:05:25.010> layer<00:05:25.150> so<00:05:26.150> I

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
layers into that smart object layer so I

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.990 
layers into that smart object layer so I
can<00:05:26.660> now<00:05:26.870> close<00:05:27.289> this<00:05:27.620> image<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.340> you<00:05:28.729> see

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
can now close this image and you see

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.990 
can now close this image and you see
that<00:05:29.240> we<00:05:29.690> have<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.650> three<00:05:30.919> instances<00:05:31.520> and

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
that we have the three instances and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.640 
that we have the three instances and
they<00:05:32.780> share<00:05:33.169> the<00:05:33.680> same<00:05:33.710> source<00:05:35.380> so<00:05:36.380> the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
they share the same source so the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.129 
they share the same source so the
adjustment<00:05:37.099> layer<00:05:37.669> is<00:05:38.030> saved<00:05:38.479> into<00:05:38.840> the

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
adjustment layer is saved into the

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.070 
adjustment layer is saved into the
source<00:05:39.650> file<00:05:40.280> which<00:05:40.669> is<00:05:41.389> a<00:05:41.419> file<00:05:41.720> that<00:05:41.750> you

don't see in the same folder it is

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.330 
don't see in the same folder it is

can<00:06:05.000> put<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.449> here<00:06:05.870> and<00:06:06.110> maybe<00:06:06.349> make<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.650> a

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
can put it here and maybe make it a

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.140 
can put it here and maybe make it a
little<00:06:07.460> bit<00:06:07.639> larger<00:06:08.330> my<00:06:08.720> best<00:06:09.580> but<00:06:10.580> now<00:06:10.760> if<00:06:11.000> I

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
little bit larger my best but now if I

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
layer and I turn off the hue/saturation

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.379

this change will only affect this layer

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.460 
this change will only affect this layer
because<00:06:23.840> this<00:06:23.870> has<00:06:24.349> now<00:06:24.770> a<00:06:25.099> separate<00:06:25.880> source

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
because this has now a separate source

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.710 
because this has now a separate source
thanks<00:06:27.470> to<00:06:27.590> that<00:06:27.770> option<00:06:28.099> the<00:06:28.910> new<00:06:29.150> smart

another<00:06:33.860> great<00:06:34.340> feature<00:06:34.669> with<00:06:35.300> smart<00:06:35.690> object

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
another great feature with smart object

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.270 
another great feature with smart object
is<00:06:36.490> using<00:06:37.490> filters<00:06:38.180> if<00:06:38.510> you<00:06:39.110> use<00:06:39.320> filters<00:06:40.070> on<00:06:40.250> a

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
is using filters if you use filters on a

is using filters if you use filters on a
small

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
small

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.260 
small
the<00:06:40.800> object<00:06:41.160> they<00:06:41.639> will<00:06:41.910> be<00:06:42.110> completely<00:06:43.110> added

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
the object they will be completely added

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.850 
the object they will be completely added
non-destructively<00:06:45.270> and<00:06:45.630> they<00:06:46.410> are<00:06:46.590> called

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
non-destructively and they are called

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.719 
non-destructively and they are called
Smart<00:06:47.520> Filters<00:06:47.990> so<00:06:48.990> I<00:06:49.020> will<00:06:49.289> use<00:06:49.500> a<00:06:49.710> filter<00:06:50.250> on

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
Smart Filters so I will use a filter on

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.719 
Smart Filters so I will use a filter on
this<00:06:51.120> layer<00:06:51.360> and<00:06:51.720> I<00:06:52.229> will<00:06:52.410> go<00:06:52.590> to<00:06:52.650> artistic<00:06:53.250> and

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
this layer and I will go to artistic and

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.460 
this layer and I will go to artistic and
I<00:06:54.150> will<00:06:54.449> choose<00:06:54.780> cutout<00:06:55.440> or<00:06:57.139> maybe<00:06:58.139> I<00:06:58.289> should

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
I will choose cutout or maybe I should

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.670 
I will choose cutout or maybe I should
use<00:06:58.949> another<00:06:59.430> filter<00:07:00.030> called<00:07:00.599> watercolor<00:07:01.319> and

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
use another filter called watercolor and

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.700 
use another filter called watercolor and
I<00:07:02.069> click<00:07:02.310> on<00:07:02.460> OK<00:07:02.580> and<00:07:03.120> you<00:07:03.900> see<00:07:04.169> we<00:07:04.319> apply<00:07:04.650> this

I click on OK and you see we apply this

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.520 
I click on OK and you see we apply this
filter<00:07:05.220> but<00:07:05.880> again<00:07:06.330> this<00:07:06.780> filter<00:07:07.289> is

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
filter but again this filter is

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.830 
filter but again this filter is
non-destructive<00:07:08.250> because<00:07:09.240> it's<00:07:09.419> a<00:07:09.509> smart

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
non-destructive because it's a smart

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.290 
non-destructive because it's a smart
filter<00:07:10.080> I<00:07:10.560> can<00:07:11.009> always<00:07:11.160> turn<00:07:11.520> it<00:07:11.729> on<00:07:11.880> and<00:07:12.150> off
