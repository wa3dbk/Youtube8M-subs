seen this first pack the greatest player

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.640 
seen this first pack the greatest player
in<00:00:44.310> this<00:00:44.490> pack<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> vatta<00:00:46.110> i<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.560> i

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
in this pack was as a vatta i think i

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.860 
in this pack was as a vatta i think i
was<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.830> name<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> popped<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.400> anyway<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.880> he

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
was a name that popped up anyway and he

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.390 
was a name that popped up anyway and he
hasn't<00:00:49.290> see<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.890> cold<00:00:50.100> walker

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
hasn't see there it's just cold walker

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.620 
hasn't see there it's just cold walker
so<00:00:51.240> writing<00:00:51.450> a<00:00:51.690> full<00:00:51.870> 11<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.700> some<00:00:53.700> some<00:00:54.390> greek

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
so writing a full 11 and some some greek

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.180 
so writing a full 11 and some some greek
centre-back<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.560> know<00:00:55.680> probably

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
centre-back which you know probably

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.620 
centre-back which you know probably
won't<00:00:56.400> even<00:00:56.490> go<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.940> squad<00:00:57.150> price<00:00:57.360> so

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
won't even go for the squad price so

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.130 
won't even go for the squad price so
that<00:00:58.940> first<00:00:59.940> pack<00:01:00.210> wasn't<00:01:00.540> really<00:01:00.690> good<00:01:00.840> you

that first pack wasn't really good you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
that first pack wasn't really good you
know<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.500> probably<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.250> lot<00:01:02.700> better

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
know you can probably get a lot better

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
know you can probably get a lot better
if<00:01:03.000> he<00:01:03.090> did<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.780> open<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.290> few<00:01:04.619> more

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
if he did it you know open a few more

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.730 
if he did it you know open a few more
packs<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.359> you<00:01:06.359> know<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.509> just<00:01:07.289> discarded

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
packs but you know just just discarded

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.169 
packs but you know just just discarded
that<00:01:07.859> for<00:01:07.979> about<00:01:08.069> five<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.609> just<00:01:08.880> send<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
spent so overall really decent pack and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:50.840 
spent so overall really decent pack and
you<00:01:49.889> know<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.039> wouldn't<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.459> ask<00:01:50.639> for<00:01:50.759> much

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

ivory<00:02:42.390> coast<00:02:42.720> he's<00:02:42.930> actually<00:02:43.230> really<00:02:43.650> didn't

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
ivory coast he's actually really didn't

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.420 
ivory coast he's actually really didn't
get<00:02:44.100> player<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.900> game<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.440> see<00:02:47.220> they're

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
get player in this game and see they're

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.220 
get player in this game and see they're
fairly<00:02:47.820> decent<00:02:48.150> defending<00:02:48.450> status<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.990> paste

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
fairly decent defending status and paste

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.540 
fairly decent defending status and paste
so<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:49.920> he's<00:02:50.040> probably<00:02:50.130> worth<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.520> couple

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
so you know he's probably worth a couple

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.350 
so you know he's probably worth a couple
of<00:02:50.820> k<00:02:50.970> if<00:02:51.960> not<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:53.490> just<00:02:53.670> scored<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.180> rest

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360

of<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.570> for<00:02:54.750> about<00:02:54.860> 4500<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:55.980> move<00:02:56.130> swiftly

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
