get the more things or out of your
control<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.479> very<00:01:48.630> important

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
control and I think it's very important

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.389

that<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:50.789> things<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.770> control

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that the things that they can control

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.300 
that the things that they can control
remain<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.210> their<00:01:54.509> control<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.319> still<00:01:56.159> have

remain in their control they still have
a<00:01:56.340> choice<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.289> think<00:01:58.289> that's<00:01:58.530> important<00:01:59.130> Sienna

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
a choice I think that's important Sienna

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.300 
a choice I think that's important Sienna
sits<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.450> reads<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.990> newspaper<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.920> ER<00:02:01.950> and
