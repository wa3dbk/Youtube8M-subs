liked the idea of having a too small

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.020 
liked the idea of having a too small
little<00:01:29.430> utility<00:01:30.090> tools<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:31.549> this<00:01:32.549> has<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
little utility tools with this has the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.920

want to point out when I when I
purchased<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.860> was<00:03:08.160> sold<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:11.100> blur

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
purchased this it was sold the blur

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.910 
purchased this it was sold the blur
basically<00:03:12.120> said<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.720> has<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> chisel<00:03:13.680> edge

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
basically said that it has a chisel edge

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.480 
basically said that it has a chisel edge
I<00:03:14.720> want<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> make<00:03:15.930> clear<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:16.470> does<00:03:16.950> not<00:03:17.100> come

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
I want to make clear it does not come

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.940 
I want to make clear it does not come
with<00:03:17.520> an<00:03:17.820> edge<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:19.110> doesn't<00:03:19.470> come<00:03:19.709> with<00:03:19.920> a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
with an edge it doesn't come with a

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.190 
with an edge it doesn't come with a
sharp<00:03:20.340> cutting<00:03:20.730> edge<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.630> right<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.840> thought

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
sharp cutting edge all right I thought

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.370 
sharp cutting edge all right I thought
it<00:03:22.320> would<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.620> more<00:03:22.830> like<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> chisel<00:03:23.520> for<00:03:23.730> wood

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
it would be more like a chisel for wood

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.680 
it would be more like a chisel for wood
but<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.530> actually<00:03:26.190> more<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.330> rock

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
but it's actually more like a rock

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.230 
but it's actually more like a rock
chisel<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.380> guess<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.310> wanted<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.090> be

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
chisel I guess but I wanted it to be

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.170 
chisel I guess but I wanted it to be
useful<00:03:30.450> for<00:03:30.930> wood<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.160> actually<00:03:32.700> sharpened

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
useful for wood so I actually sharpened

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.490 
useful for wood so I actually sharpened
that<00:03:33.330> oh<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.570> don't<00:03:33.690> know<00:03:33.870> if<00:03:33.990> we<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.230> hear<00:03:34.470> a

so that it's more you can work wood with

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.910 
so that it's more you can work wood with
it<00:03:57.630> now<00:03:57.750> because<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.020> want<00:03:58.350> more<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.709> like<00:03:58.890> a

it now because I want more of like a
something<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.940> can<00:04:00.120> shape<00:04:00.360> wood<00:04:00.720> with<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.590> I

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
something you can shape wood with so I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.479 
something you can shape wood with so I
actually<00:04:01.860> just<00:04:02.070> put<00:04:02.550> an<00:04:02.820> edge<00:04:03.300> on<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.620> okay

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.830 
actually just put an edge on this okay
this<00:04:05.670> will<00:04:05.790> probably<00:04:06.000> work<00:04:06.180> better<00:04:06.540> since

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
this will probably work better since

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.120 
this will probably work better since
this<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.230> supported<00:04:09.050> there<00:04:10.050> we<00:04:10.170> go<00:04:10.380> yeah<00:04:10.860> see

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
to use it like that but pretty cool

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.600 
to use it like that but pretty cool
pretty<00:04:21.750> cool<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.650> also<00:04:22.800> use<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.400> as<00:04:23.460> a

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
pretty cool you can also use this as a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.990 
pretty cool you can also use this as a
pry<00:04:23.940> bar<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:25.140> can<00:04:25.320> dig<00:04:25.620> with<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.250> really

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
pry bar and you can dig with it I really

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.590 
pry bar and you can dig with it I really
think<00:04:27.240> these

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
think these

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.810 
think these
a<00:04:27.630> great<00:04:27.990> pair<00:04:28.800> because<00:04:29.250> they're<00:04:29.430> around<00:04:29.700> the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
a great pair because they're around the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.380 
a great pair because they're around the
same<00:04:30.060> size<00:04:31.100> this<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.280> actually<00:04:32.730> even<00:04:32.970> lighter

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
same size this is actually even lighter

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.860 
same size this is actually even lighter
and<00:04:34.760> yeah<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.790> mean<00:04:36.000> it's<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.270> digging<00:04:36.510> tool<00:04:36.840> a

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
and yeah I mean it's a digging tool a

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.440 
and yeah I mean it's a digging tool a
prying<00:04:37.410> tool<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.550> hammer<00:04:38.730> tent<00:04:39.120> stakes

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
prying tool you can hammer tent stakes

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.890 
prying tool you can hammer tent stakes
you<00:04:39.690> could<00:04:39.900> breach<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.160> could<00:04:41.630> break<00:04:42.630> some

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
you could breach you could break some

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.260 
you could breach you could break some
rocks<00:04:43.170> or<00:04:43.410> some<00:04:43.590> cinder<00:04:43.980> blocks<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:45.090> can

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
rocks or some cinder blocks you can

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.780 
rocks or some cinder blocks you can
shape<00:04:45.570> wood<00:04:45.840> with<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.200> chisel<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:47.370> just<00:04:47.640> an

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
shape wood with the chisel it's just an

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.140 
shape wood with the chisel it's just an
all-around<00:04:48.320> good<00:04:49.320> tool<00:04:49.680> when<00:04:50.460> paired<00:04:50.790> up<00:04:50.970> with

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
all-around good tool when paired up with

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.830 
all-around good tool when paired up with
this<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:53.340> suppose<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:54.000> does<00:04:54.210> have<00:04:54.450> some

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
this and I suppose it does have some

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.110 
this and I suppose it does have some
improvised<00:04:55.740> weapon<00:04:56.190> potential<00:04:56.790> I<00:04:56.850> mean<00:04:56.970> that

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
improvised weapon potential I mean that

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.300 
improvised weapon potential I mean that
would<00:04:57.360> be<00:04:57.390> pretty<00:04:58.260> nasty<00:04:58.500> on<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.890> skull

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
would be pretty nasty on the skull

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.110 
would be pretty nasty on the skull
either<00:04:59.700> end<00:05:01.190> all<00:05:02.190> right<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.730> has<00:05:02.910> been

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
either end all right and this has been

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.760 
either end all right and this has been
we<00:05:03.390> all<00:05:03.540> juggle<00:05:04.020> knives<00:05:04.460> I'm<00:05:05.460> out
