 news will now be trading again at gta 5 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.170
 I would like to go to the categories 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.670
 I enter the gta videos 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.810
 divided and he goes online 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.750
 goes so goes the business 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.549
 highscore list because I am like that now 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.470
 Found the middle like me each 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.820
 be working on the category until 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.130
 now everyone was down to the name 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.040
 already published all categories the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.020
 Com will be called soon on Monday 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.939
 otherwise follow the business 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.799
 I have the first video already 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.369
 said what it is about there will be like not 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.960
 sliced 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.280
 there is simply shown about mission 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.159
 do the mission but either 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 but would be extremely funny or exciting 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.759
 worth seeing is little cut 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.229
 sometimes one is a mission matthias 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.060
 several comes at the time of the videos 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.200
 then the video was going to be five minutes 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.970
 I probably do not upload 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 but will always be like that 10 to 20 minutes 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.149
 be so she pays it he goes 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.490
 on-line 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.659
 that will be something else like the first one 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.730
 both follow that means if you the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.220
 first two 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.690
 then have a look online 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.560
 the third episode again because 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.270
 this time something different 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.890
 then i would have the categories at the beginning 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.220
 I would already have the first two 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.800
 gta online tend to follow in the category 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.390
 gta wasted gets stuck online 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.010
 now that we have a goal every time 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.320
 We have set ourselves a goal and that 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.640
 we lead through this all better 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.230
 built up so that the audience maybe 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.700
 the overview has what we do 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.720
 actually and I really liked that 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.030
 that he recently had the team meeting 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.620
 had and so what and so it should be 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.150
 go on to follow the gt online 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.770
 means that each time a goal 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.960
 we will do something 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.170
 funny or exciting what knows 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.420
 I 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.190
 in the open book so no mission 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.410
 but something we something 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.300
 set yourself as a goal that is who the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.010
 first two gta online do not follow so 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.720
 It was great that should be the third 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.880
 View made online 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.680
 I can only recommend the worthwhile 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.330
 otherwise I had yes follow dj-set 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.870
 he and fanny moments had said that 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.030
 is he doing stuff like bullshit? 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.260
 last time had been extreme of the metro 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.920
 just have the whole and exhausted 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.080
 has also been extremely fun and 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.700
 that is to say, wood is the mission 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.400
 they will not know then I will come 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.540
 on it to a preparation mission becomes 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.980
 then maybe its a follow up 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.360
 if it lasts long enough maybe 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.250
 also two preparatory missions though 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.840
 a complete hot is likely 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.400
 not in a sequence fit that if 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.010
 you then see or you will then on 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.020
 see monday there comes the first episode 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.020
 and yes , he does not go directly 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.450
 real news except that now the 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.400
 modding scene goes ahead now 's here 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.500
 script print that's what it's called 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.010
 such a trainer where to activate them 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.959
 can 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.470
 who less can I find personally now 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.510
 not so exciting because 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.770
 many things separate from the director 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.750
 mode and well otherwise you something for 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.020
 the singleplayer interested trainers 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.630
 gta 5 is cryptic 1 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.920
 and there you find something and what I do 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.020
 in the last good as news video not 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.060
 said that I am the gta 5 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.560
 categories in different playlist or 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.840
 that means the category has 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.220
 a playlist I was at the very beginning 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.540
 Think about it all in one 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.160
 playlist but I can then on 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.720
 the conclusion that it would be better one 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.970
 categories a separate playlist too 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.070
 give because it then clearer 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.770
 otherwise I would of course like 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.660
 always pleased about feedback about gta 5 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.519
 I know many are still hanging on the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.780
 They also use the daisy 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.190
 it will not come at the moment 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.290
 but now do not change 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.220
 I have a lot of fun with gta 5 and that 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.900
 will probably stay that way for now 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.880
 but of course we over 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.650
 feedback pleased if now is negative 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.200
 or positive would be nice if of course 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.510
 it's more than you know like that 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.130
 So if a bit so this and that 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.600
 was good so bad we did 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.400
 that would be happy that would also 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.570
 really what help otherwise the 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.890
 well - I am through a nice rest 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.240
 from pack would say until the next 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.540
 Just let your skin crack and you are 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.540
 there
