00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
like that kind of map while it may be

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.170 
like that kind of map while it may be
big<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.070> feels<00:02:19.280> kind<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.520> like<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.700> call<00:02:19.940> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
big it feels kind of like a call the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.790 
big it feels kind of like a call the
dead<00:02:20.360> style<00:02:20.720> big<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.080> it's<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.230> really<00:02:21.410> pain<00:02:21.680> in

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
dead style big and it's a really pain in

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.270 
dead style big and it's a really pain in
the<00:02:21.890> ass<00:02:21.980> too

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the ass too

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.550 
the ass too
around<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:23.030> still<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> really<00:02:23.510> fun<00:02:24.080> map<00:02:24.350> I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
around it's still a really fun map I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.740 
around it's still a really fun map I
mean<00:02:24.890> if<00:02:25.010> they<00:02:25.130> could<00:02:25.280> condense<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.180> little

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
mean if they could condense it a little

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.809 
mean if they could condense it a little
bit<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.140> might<00:02:27.319> be<00:02:27.470> better<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:28.160> overall<00:02:28.520> it's

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
bit it might be better but overall it's

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.970 
bit it might be better but overall it's
a<00:02:28.880> really<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.390> fun<00:02:29.540> map<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.260> applaud
