00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and it found 528 errors and it did fix

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
and it found 528 errors and it did fix
all<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> them<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> show<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.040> that

this is the real deal i want to go ahead

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.039 
this is the real deal i want to go ahead
and<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.110> another<00:02:04.229> system<00:02:04.890> scan<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.930> know

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and do another system scan and you know

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.809 
and do another system scan and you know
it<00:02:07.229> used<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.829> these<00:02:08.069> kinds<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.550> software

it used to be these kinds of software

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.780 
it used to be these kinds of software
products<00:02:09.599> they<00:02:09.810> would<00:02:09.929> automatically<00:02:10.790> throw

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
products they would automatically throw

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.700 
products they would automatically throw
a<00:02:11.819> bunch<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.540> these<00:02:12.629> errors<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.260> your

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
a bunch of these errors on your

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800 
a bunch of these errors on your
shooter<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.220> show<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.300> have<00:02:15.630> you

junk<00:02:38.910> file<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.630> 3<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.190> isn't

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
junk file is just 3 and so this isn't

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
one of those tools that's going to throw

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.270 
one of those tools that's going to throw
a<00:02:42.600> bunch<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.960> stuff<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.680> your<00:02:43.830> computer<00:02:44.250> just

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
a bunch of stuff on your computer just

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.160 
a bunch of stuff on your computer just
to<00:02:44.640> say<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.150> messed<00:02:45.390> up<00:02:45.630> when<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.930> not

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
to say that it's messed up when it's not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.980 
to say that it's messed up when it's not
and<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.250> these<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.610> really<00:02:47.820> minor<00:02:48.210> errors<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
and so these are really minor errors and

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.300 
and so these are really minor errors and
I'm<00:02:49.170> not<00:02:49.350> even<00:02:49.380> going<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.680> worry<00:02:49.770> about<00:02:49.950> those

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
I'm not even going to worry about those

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.790 
I'm not even going to worry about those
at<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.610> moment<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:52.050> has<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> restore<00:02:52.770> point

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
at the moment it has a restore point

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.470 
at the moment it has a restore point
where<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.430> restore<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.850> has<00:02:54.000> additional

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
where you can restore it has additional

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.810 
where you can restore it has additional
tools<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.900> process<00:02:55.320> manager<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.430> shows<00:02:56.640> you

tools a process manager it shows you

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.880 
tools a process manager it shows you
your<00:02:56.970> computer<00:02:57.420> performance<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.440> everything

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
your computer performance and everything

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.680 
your computer performance and everything
that's<00:02:58.980> currently<00:02:59.370> running<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.360> has<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
and even remove all the programs that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.920 
and even remove all the programs that
you<00:03:05.040> want<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.490> loads<00:03:06.180> when<00:03:06.390> your<00:03:06.480> computer

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
you want that loads when your computer

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.240 
you want that loads when your computer
loads<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.710> is<00:03:07.860> one<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.100> biggest

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
loads and this is one of the biggest

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.770 
loads and this is one of the biggest
reasons<00:03:08.640> why<00:03:08.790> when<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.060> try<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.270> restart<00:03:09.690> your

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
reasons why when you try to restart your

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.020 
reasons why when you try to restart your
computer<00:03:09.990> or<00:03:10.470> turn<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.770> on<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.550> gets<00:03:11.730> so

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
computer or turn it on and it gets so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.400 
computer or turn it on and it gets so
slow<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.780> takes<00:03:12.990> forever<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:14.220> boot<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.850> because

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
slow it takes forever to boot is because

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.630 
slow it takes forever to boot is because
many<00:03:16.410> times<00:03:16.500> when<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.040> install<00:03:17.370> software

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
many times when you install software

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.240 
many times when you install software
tools<00:03:18.210> and<00:03:18.480> programs<00:03:18.630> they<00:03:19.470> want<00:03:19.740> to<00:03:19.830> run<00:03:20.040> when

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
tools and programs they want to run when

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.680 
tools and programs they want to run when
you<00:03:20.340> start<00:03:20.610> your<00:03:20.730> computer<00:03:21.180> up<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.540> that

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
you start your computer up and that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.690 
you start your computer up and that
causes<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.200> take<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.770> long<00:03:23.070> time<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.460> boot

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
causes it to take a long time to boot

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.280 
causes it to take a long time to boot
your<00:03:23.760> computer<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.570> remove<00:03:25.050> those

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
your computer and you can remove those

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.860 
your computer and you can remove those
from<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.710> tool<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.910> it'll<00:03:27.150> load<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> lot

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
from this tool and so it'll load a lot

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.350 
from this tool and so it'll load a lot
faster<00:03:28.440> there's<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.340> file<00:03:29.640> manager<00:03:29.880> which

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
faster there's a file manager which

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.250 
faster there's a file manager which
allows<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.020> find<00:03:31.530> file<00:03:31.800> extensions<00:03:32.490> for

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
allows you to find file extensions for

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.840 
allows you to find file extensions for
tools<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.710> files<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.400> don't<00:03:35.580> know<00:03:35.700> what

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850
