hello I'm bill Donnelly from sapphire
technology<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.639> today<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.420> want<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.780> talk

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
technology and today I want to talk

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.740 
technology and today I want to talk
about<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.500> new<00:00:13.799> display<00:00:14.250> technology<00:00:14.940> from<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
about a new display technology from the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.640 
about a new display technology from the
ATI<00:00:16.020> division<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.650> AMD<00:00:17.100> called<00:00:17.490> Eyefinity

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
ATI division of AMD called Eyefinity

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.960 
ATI division of AMD called Eyefinity
Eyefinity<00:00:19.650> basically<00:00:20.070> allows<00:00:20.369> us<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.789> run

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
Eyefinity basically allows us to run

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.660 
Eyefinity basically allows us to run
three<00:00:21.689> computer<00:00:22.439> screens<00:00:22.740> simultaneously

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
three computer screens simultaneously

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.269 
three computer screens simultaneously
from<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.090> graphics<00:00:24.510> card<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:25.920> it

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
from one graphics card and to have it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
from one graphics card and to have it
treated<00:00:26.910> as<00:00:27.060> though<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.660> big<00:00:27.960> monitor<00:00:28.410> so

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
treated as though as one big monitor so

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.050 
treated as though as one big monitor so
whether<00:00:29.039> you're<00:00:29.220> running<00:00:29.310> games<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:30.029> other

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
whether you're running games or other

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.269 
whether you're running games or other
applications<00:00:30.840> across<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.710> gives<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
applications across there it gives you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.459 
applications across there it gives you
one<00:00:32.520> really<00:00:33.059> big<00:00:33.300> field<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.870> view<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.230> nice

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
one really big field of view with nice

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.979 
one really big field of view with nice
high<00:00:34.649> resolution<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> gamers<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
high resolution and for the gamers that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
high resolution and for the gamers that
makes<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.590> immersive<00:00:37.860> experience<00:00:38.700> for

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
makes it a very immersive experience for

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630 
makes it a very immersive experience for
using<00:00:39.870> other<00:00:40.020> applications<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.129> behaves<00:00:41.520> like

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
using other applications it behaves like

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
using other applications it behaves like
you've<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.270> really<00:00:42.570> enormous<00:00:42.840> desktop

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
you've got one really enormous desktop

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
you've got one really enormous desktop
so<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.219> could<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.760> example<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
so that you could have for example a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940 
so that you could have for example a
Photoshop<00:00:45.870> application<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.739> all<00:00:46.829> these

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
Photoshop application and all these

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.069 
Photoshop application and all these
menus<00:00:47.399> open<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:48.000> different<00:00:48.600> areas<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
menus open on different areas of the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.170 
menus open on different areas of the
screen<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:50.430> there's<00:00:50.610> been<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> little<00:00:51.000> bit<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
screen but there's been a little bit of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.540 
screen but there's been a little bit of
confusion<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.930> how<00:00:52.469> exactly<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.340> set

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
confusion about how exactly how it's set

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
confusion about how exactly how it's set
up<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.199> what<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.890> make<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
up and what you have to do to make it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
up and what you have to do to make it
work<00:00:56.250> correctly<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.180> we're<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.660> what

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
work correctly so we're this is what

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.840 
work correctly so we're this is what
we're<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> run<00:00:58.320> through<00:00:58.469> today<00:00:58.850> we've

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
we're going to run through today we've

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.130 
we're going to run through today we've

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
use the DisplayPort output now that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.310 
use the DisplayPort output now that
doesn't<00:01:29.970> necessarily<00:01:30.090> mean<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.020> has<00:01:31.170> to

doesn't necessarily mean that it has to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
doesn't necessarily mean that it has to
be<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> DisplayPort<00:01:32.189> compatible<00:01:32.970> monitor

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
be a DisplayPort compatible monitor

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
be a DisplayPort compatible monitor
because<00:01:33.780> there<00:01:33.960> are<00:01:34.079> adapters<00:01:34.710> available<00:01:34.829> but

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
because there are adapters available but

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
because there are adapters available but
they<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.210> an<00:01:36.329> active<00:01:36.780> adapter<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
they have to be an active adapter to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.920 
they have to be an active adapter to
convert<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> signals<00:01:38.610> from<00:01:38.759> DisplayPort<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
convert the signals from DisplayPort to

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.350 
convert the signals from DisplayPort to
either<00:01:40.049> DVI<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.650> VGA<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.939> here's<00:01:42.180> an<00:01:42.270> example

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
either DVI or VGA so here's an example

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.490 
either DVI or VGA so here's an example
of<00:01:42.899> an<00:01:43.020> active<00:01:43.579> DisplayPort<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> DVI<00:01:45.090> adapter

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
of an active DisplayPort to DVI adapter

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
of an active DisplayPort to DVI adapter
the<00:01:46.500> DisplayPort<00:01:47.250> connector<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.790> straight<00:01:48.090> in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the DisplayPort connector go straight in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.749 
the DisplayPort connector go straight in
the<00:01:48.329> back<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> card<00:01:48.960> takes<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.890> female<00:01:50.310> DVI

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the back of the card takes a female DVI

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.090 
the back of the card takes a female DVI
standard<00:01:51.329> cable<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> monitor<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.530> is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
standard cable to the monitor and is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.819 
standard cable to the monitor and is
powered<00:01:53.490> by<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.700> USB<00:01:54.060> connection<00:01:54.799> there<00:01:55.799> are

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
powered by a USB connection there are

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.760 
powered by a USB connection there are
also<00:01:55.979> active<00:01:56.670> DisplayPort<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.780> VGA<00:01:58.200> adapters

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
also active DisplayPort to VGA adapters

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.350 
also active DisplayPort to VGA adapters
so<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> earlier<00:01:59.969> type<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
so if you have the earlier type of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.120 
so if you have the earlier type of
monitor<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.500> use<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.829> type<00:02:02.100> of

of them is enabled which is why we only

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.530

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
have one display lit up at the moment so

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.539 
have one display lit up at the moment so
what<00:02:53.720> I'm<00:02:53.810> going<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.049> do<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.709> first<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:55.220> all<00:02:55.280> I'm

option<00:03:48.889> here<00:03:49.250> under<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.120> display<00:03:50.540> group<00:03:50.780> menu

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
option here under the display group menu

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.460 
option here under the display group menu
to<00:03:52.010> arrange<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.630> what<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:53.900> going<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.290> tell

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
to arrange and what it's going to tell

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.949 
to arrange and what it's going to tell
me<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.739> do<00:03:54.950> is<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.430> click<00:03:55.730> on<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.389> panel<00:03:56.780> which

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
me to do is to click on the panel which

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.259 
me to do is to click on the panel which
it<00:03:57.170> lights<00:03:57.380> up<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.700> will<00:03:58.849> help<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.180> to

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
it lights up and that will help it to

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.780 
it lights up and that will help it to
automatically<00:03:59.870> reorder<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.160> displays<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.760> be

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
automatically reorder the displays to be

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.059 
automatically reorder the displays to be
correct<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:02.540> now<00:04:02.780> we<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.079> can<00:04:03.290> see<00:04:03.530> we<00:04:03.739> have<00:04:03.950> an

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
correct so now we you can see we have an

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.470 
correct so now we you can see we have an
affinity<00:04:04.370> group<00:04:04.849> with<00:04:05.510> our<00:04:05.810> icons<00:04:06.560> for<00:04:07.280> our

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
affinity group with our icons for our

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.000 
affinity group with our icons for our
applications<00:04:08.480> on<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.750> left<00:04:08.930> hand<00:04:09.169> side<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.739> a

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
applications on the left hand side and a

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.800 
applications on the left hand side and a
task<00:04:10.280> bar<00:04:10.639> which<00:04:10.849> extends<00:04:11.359> right<00:04:11.510> across

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
task bar which extends right across

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.170 
task bar which extends right across
three<00:04:12.139> monitors<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:12.980> now<00:04:13.400> we<00:04:13.459> have<00:04:13.909> an

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
three monitors so now we have an

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.779 
three monitors so now we have an
affinity<00:04:14.629> group<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.439> have<00:04:15.680> effectively<00:04:16.459> one

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
affinity group we have effectively one

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.020 
affinity group we have effectively one
very<00:04:17.090> large<00:04:17.299> monitor

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
very large monitor

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.449 
very large monitor
so<00:04:18.390> if<00:04:18.720> we<00:04:18.900> look<00:04:19.079> at<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.320> display<00:04:19.920> properties

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
so if we look at the display properties

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.400 
so if we look at the display properties
we<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.060> see<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.480> we<00:04:21.600> now<00:04:21.780> have<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.049> screen

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
we can see that we now have a screen

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.350 
we can see that we now have a screen
resolution<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:23.100> five<00:04:23.640> thousand<00:04:24.210> seven

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
resolution of five thousand seven

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.310 
resolution of five thousand seven
hundred<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.870> sixty<00:04:25.380> by<00:04:25.980> 1080<00:04:26.970> which<00:04:27.870> is<00:04:28.050> three

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
hundred and sixty by 1080 which is three

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.750 
hundred and sixty by 1080 which is three
times<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.800> resolution<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.430> single<00:04:29.700> monitor

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
times the resolution of a single monitor

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.340 
times the resolution of a single monitor
so<00:04:32.760> let's<00:04:33.000> open<00:04:33.090> up<00:04:33.330> an<00:04:33.450> application<00:04:33.600> in

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
so let's open up an application in

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.100 
so let's open up an application in
eyefinity<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.310> it's<00:04:35.880> given<00:04:36.210> me<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.360> new<00:04:36.450> option

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
eyefinity and it's given me a new option

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.040 
eyefinity and it's given me a new option
in<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.280> menu<00:04:38.580> here<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:38.880> run<00:04:39.390> at<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.840> full

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.010 
resolution of 57 by 10 and as you can
see<00:04:44.070> it's<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.310> really<00:04:44.520> stunning<00:04:45.030> experience<00:04:45.420> to

immersive experience than playing with

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.650 
immersive experience than playing with
just<00:05:33.130> a<00:05:33.280> single<00:05:33.460> monitor<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:37.180> basically<00:05:37.540> I

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
just a single monitor so basically I

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.420 
just a single monitor so basically I
finished<00:05:38.169> he<00:05:38.290> allows<00:05:38.470> us<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.710> install<00:05:39.070> just

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
finished he allows us to install just

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.610 
finished he allows us to install just
one<00:05:39.580> graphics<00:05:40.000> card<00:05:40.240> in<00:05:40.389> the<00:05:40.510> computer<00:05:40.960> but<00:05:41.440> to

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
one graphics card in the computer but to

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.440 
one graphics card in the computer but to
drive<00:05:41.830> three<00:05:42.160> monitors<00:05:42.490> so<00:05:43.120> that<00:05:43.240> we<00:05:43.300> get<00:05:43.389> a

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
drive three monitors so that we get a

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.000 
drive three monitors so that we get a
much<00:05:43.690> more<00:05:43.720> immersive<00:05:44.169> experience<00:05:44.440> when

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
much more immersive experience when

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.890 
much more immersive experience when
we're<00:05:45.130> gaming<00:05:45.520> or<00:05:45.880> much<00:05:46.150> more<00:05:46.360> productivity

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
we're gaming or much more productivity

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.590 
we're gaming or much more productivity
using<00:05:47.470> other<00:05:47.590> kinds<00:05:47.889> of<00:05:47.950> applications<00:05:48.600> I'm

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600
