00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
metal film that's protected by the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
metal film that's protected by the
polycarbonate<00:00:52.260> core<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.430> substrate<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
polycarbonate core and substrate a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.750 
polycarbonate core and substrate a
polycarbonate<00:00:55.680> substrate<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.579> your

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
polycarbonate substrate you get your

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520 
polycarbonate substrate you get your
metal<00:00:57.030> plating<00:00:57.600> inside<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.379> then

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
metal plating inside of it and then

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.810 
metal plating inside of it and then
you've<00:00:58.710> got<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.949> protective<00:00:59.340> layer<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.699> we

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you've got your protective layer that we

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.420 
you've got your protective layer that we
see<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.120> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.420> plastic<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> outside

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
see is kind of a plastic on the outside

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
see is kind of a plastic on the outside
alright<00:01:02.430> there's<00:01:02.730> actually<00:01:03.390> two<00:01:03.840> layers<00:01:04.140> now

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
alright there's actually two layers now

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
alright there's actually two layers now
when<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:04.979> first<00:01:05.220> came<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.180> went<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
when they first came out when it went to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.719 
when they first came out when it went to
the<00:01:06.510> second<00:01:07.049> layer<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.280> stuttered

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the second layer it kind of stuttered

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.039 
the second layer it kind of stuttered
and<00:01:08.909> stopped<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> people<00:01:09.600> thought<00:01:09.750> we're

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and stopped and people thought we're

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.510 
and stopped and people thought we're
worried<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
worried that you know actually it was a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.490 
worried that you know actually it was a
defective<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.570> working<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.049> simply<00:01:13.380> has

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
defective or not working it simply has

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.740 
defective or not working it simply has
to<00:01:13.530> access<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.189> second<00:01:14.549> layer<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.000> lately

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to access that second layer now lately

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.539 
to access that second layer now lately
they<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.259> seamlessly<00:01:16.560> go<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.310> layer<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
they can seamlessly go from layer to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.350 
they can seamlessly go from layer to
layer<00:01:17.759> now<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.659> was<00:01:18.930> able<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.170> jump<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.740> from

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
layer now it was able to jump up from

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.899 
layer now it was able to jump up from
4.7<00:01:21.360> gigs<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> regular<00:01:22.259> standard<00:01:22.619> DVD<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
4.7 gigs on a regular standard DVD up to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
4.7 gigs on a regular standard DVD up to
eight<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.479> change<00:01:24.810> gigs<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> dual<00:01:25.740> layer

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
eight and change gigs on a dual layer

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.249 
eight and change gigs on a dual layer
now<00:01:26.369> there's<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> next<00:01:27.630> generation<00:01:28.080> which<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
now there's the next generation which is

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
now there's the next generation which is
the<00:01:28.500> double-sided<00:01:29.130> dual<00:01:29.549> layer<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.150> can

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the double-sided dual layer which can

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
the double-sided dual layer which can
give<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> fourteen<00:01:31.409> gigabytes<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
give you up to fourteen gigabytes of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
give you up to fourteen gigabytes of
storage<00:01:32.280> which<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.030> pretty<00:01:33.329> significant

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
storage which is a pretty significant

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780
