00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
would work through the summer but I

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.110 
would work through the summer but I
could<00:05:41.530> definitely<00:05:41.650> get<00:05:42.040> a<00:05:42.100> few<00:05:42.340> wears<00:05:42.610> out<00:05:42.910> of

could definitely get a few wears out of
it<00:05:43.950> until<00:05:44.950> then<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:45.400> think<00:05:46.000> it's<00:05:46.180> cute<00:05:46.480> and

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600

comfy<00:05:49.770> this<00:05:50.770> next<00:05:51.070> top<00:05:51.370> that<00:05:51.580> was<00:05:51.700> in<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:51.940> box

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
comfy this next top that was in the box

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.380 
comfy this next top that was in the box
is<00:05:52.420> from<00:05:52.750> Daniel<00:05:53.320> rain<00:05:53.760> when<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.790> pulled<00:05:55.090> it<00:05:55.180> out

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
is from Daniel rain when I pulled it out

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.800 
is from Daniel rain when I pulled it out
of<00:05:55.420> the<00:05:55.690> box<00:05:55.870> I<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:56.700> wasn't<00:05:57.700> obsessed<00:05:57.940> with<00:05:58.510> it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
of the box I I wasn't obsessed with it

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.490 
of the box I I wasn't obsessed with it
um<00:05:59.250> it's<00:06:00.600> not<00:06:01.600> something<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:02.020> would<00:06:02.140> pick<00:06:02.320> out

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
um it's not something I would pick out

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.220 
um it's not something I would pick out
for<00:06:02.710> myself<00:06:02.830> but<00:06:03.430> I<00:06:03.900> do<00:06:04.900> think<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:05.920> nice<00:06:06.550> on

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
for myself but I do think that nice on

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.640 
for myself but I do think that nice on
the<00:06:08.230> Baptist<00:06:08.740> is<00:06:09.360> completely<00:06:10.360> see-through<00:06:10.690> so

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
the Baptist is completely see-through so

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.580 
the Baptist is completely see-through so
I<00:06:11.680> left<00:06:11.920> my<00:06:12.130> white<00:06:12.310> tank<00:06:12.580> on<00:06:12.790> um<00:06:13.780> I<00:06:13.840> think<00:06:14.440> it's

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
I left my white tank on um I think it's

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.020 
I left my white tank on um I think it's
really<00:06:14.770> comfortable<00:06:15.250> I<00:06:15.580> think<00:06:15.820> it<00:06:15.910> will

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
really comfortable I think it will

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.050 
really comfortable I think it will
probably<00:06:16.300> keep<00:06:16.690> this<00:06:16.930> also<00:06:17.230> because<00:06:17.770> it's

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
probably keep this also because it's

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
probably keep this also because it's
versatile<00:06:19.060> i<00:06:19.090> think<00:06:19.510> i<00:06:19.570> could<00:06:19.630> wear<00:06:19.840> with

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
versatile i think i could wear with

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.350 
versatile i think i could wear with
shorts<00:06:20.880> jeans<00:06:21.880> if<00:06:22.300> it's<00:06:22.510> not<00:06:22.930> too<00:06:23.170> hot<00:06:23.380> out<00:06:23.620> and

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
shorts jeans if it's not too hot out and

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.000 
shorts jeans if it's not too hot out and
yeah<00:06:25.360> it'll<00:06:25.780> just<00:06:26.260> be<00:06:26.410> something<00:06:26.620> a<00:06:26.860> little

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
yeah it'll just be something a little

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.530 
yeah it'll just be something a little
different<00:06:27.310> than<00:06:27.670> what<00:06:28.060> I<00:06:28.090> would<00:06:28.390> normally

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
different than what I would normally

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.500 
different than what I would normally
wear<00:06:28.960> every<00:06:29.260> day

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.660
