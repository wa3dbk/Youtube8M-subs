where the oil drain plug is we'll be
replacing<00:01:15.729> that<00:01:15.760> with<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.030> magnetic<00:01:16.540> one

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
replacing that with a magnetic one

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.410 
replacing that with a magnetic one
before<00:01:18.220> we<00:01:18.369> actually<00:01:18.700> start<00:01:18.940> draining<00:01:19.330> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
before we actually start draining the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970

type<00:01:25.450> filter<00:01:25.810> which<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.020> way<00:01:26.500> down<00:01:26.740> in<00:01:26.920> there

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
type filter which is way down in there

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.210 
type filter which is way down in there
we're<00:01:27.880> going<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.410> slide<00:01:29.410> to<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.680> side<00:01:29.920> this

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
we're going to slide to the side this

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.310 
we're going to slide to the side this
air<00:01:30.490> intake<00:01:30.610> belt<00:01:31.030> there<00:01:31.180> so<00:01:31.390> we're<00:01:32.170> going<00:01:32.259> to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
air intake belt there so we're going to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:44.370 
air intake belt there so we're going to
take<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.710> off<00:01:42.119> okay<00:01:43.119> there's<00:01:43.840> actually<00:01:44.020> two

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
take that off okay there's actually two

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.450 
take that off okay there's actually two
screws<00:01:44.740> which<00:01:44.950> hold<00:01:45.009> on<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.700> intake<00:01:46.030> cover<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
screws which hold on the intake cover I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.060 
screws which hold on the intake cover I
think<00:01:48.460> for<00:01:49.119> some<00:01:49.390> of<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.539> forum<00:01:49.869> members<00:01:50.229> the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
think for some of the forum members the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.850 
think for some of the forum members the
idea<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.700> for<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.299> screw<00:01:52.690> when<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.500> take<00:01:53.740> it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
idea is for this screw when you take it

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.609 
idea is for this screw when you take it
out<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.280> slot<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.060> actual<00:01:55.450> cover<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.500> can

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
out to slot the actual cover so you can

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.680 
out to slot the actual cover so you can
just<00:01:56.920> slide<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.340> back<00:01:57.520> up<00:01:57.820> rather<00:01:58.180> than<00:01:58.330> have

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
just slide it back up rather than have

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.719 
just slide it back up rather than have
to<00:01:58.720> fool<00:01:59.049> with<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.350> bolt<00:01:59.650> you<00:02:00.430> can<00:02:00.549> just

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
to fool with this bolt you can just

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.429 
to fool with this bolt you can just
tight<00:02:00.940> loosen<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.630> little<00:02:01.780> bit<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.140> tighten

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
tight loosen it a little bit and tighten

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.780 
tight loosen it a little bit and tighten
it<00:02:02.500> up<00:02:02.650> again<00:02:03.840> okay<00:02:04.840> we're<00:02:05.020> ready<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.760> kind<00:02:06.760> of

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
right there drain the oil into the pan

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.030 
right there drain the oil into the pan
it's<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.270> 17<00:02:43.780> millimeter<00:02:43.959> socket<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.830> takes

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
it's a 17 millimeter socket that takes

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.130 
it's a 17 millimeter socket that takes
off<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.430> oil<00:02:45.520> drain<00:02:45.880> plug<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.780> one<00:02:46.900> thing<00:02:47.050> I

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
off the oil drain plug and one thing I

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.070 
off the oil drain plug and one thing I
noticed<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.590> was<00:02:47.680> really<00:02:47.950> cool<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.870> lower

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
noticed it was really cool the lower

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.800 
noticed it was really cool the lower
radiator<00:02:50.410> hose<00:02:50.739> which<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.459> right<00:02:52.150> here<00:02:52.450> which

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
radiator hose which is right here which

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.750 
radiator hose which is right here which
goes<00:02:53.050> along<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.800> back<00:02:54.040> underneath<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
goes along the back underneath the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.360 
goes along the back underneath the
engine<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.360> back<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.870> block<00:02:56.370> they've

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
engine to the back of the block they've

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.290 
engine to the back of the block they've
actually<00:02:58.239> made<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.050> hard<00:02:59.380> pipe<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.520> it's

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
actually made this a hard pipe that it's

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.910 
actually made this a hard pipe that it's
hidden<00:03:01.510> by<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.750> splash<00:03:02.140> shield<00:03:02.440> but<00:03:02.590> when

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
hidden by the splash shield but when

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.100 
hidden by the splash shield but when
it's<00:03:03.070> on<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:03.519> that's<00:03:04.120> nice<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.660> know<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.959> case

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
it's on but that's nice to know in case

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.540 
it's on but that's nice to know in case
something<00:03:05.140> ever<00:03:05.560> pops<00:03:05.920> through<00:03:06.160> there<00:03:06.400> I

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
something ever pops through there I

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.949 
something ever pops through there I
thought<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.600> was<00:03:07.720> good<00:03:07.930> engineering<00:03:09.959> okay

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
thought that was good engineering okay

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.729 
thought that was good engineering okay
got<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.680> plug<00:03:11.950> off<00:03:12.160> oils<00:03:12.670> dripping<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.930> we're

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
got the plug off oils dripping and we're

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.110 
got the plug off oils dripping and we're
going<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.890> go<00:03:15.040> ahead<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.340> replace<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:15.640> plug

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
going to go ahead and replace that plug

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.080 
going to go ahead and replace that plug
when<00:03:16.330> it's<00:03:16.480> all<00:03:16.630> done<00:03:16.840> with<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.800> magnetic<00:03:18.760> one

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.309 

okay<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:22.360> kind<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.600> see<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> old<00:03:23.019> plug

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
okay you can kind of see the old plug

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.800 
okay you can kind of see the old plug
looks<00:03:24.100> like<00:03:24.340> they<00:03:24.489> probably<00:03:25.450> put<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.750> little

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
looks like they probably put a little

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.840 
looks like they probably put a little
sealant<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.680> old<00:03:26.830> one<00:03:27.069> this<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.819> first

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
sealant on the old one this is the first

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.699 
sealant on the old one this is the first
oil<00:03:28.180> change<00:03:28.300> in<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:28.810> car<00:03:29.050> we're<00:03:29.260> roughly<00:03:29.560> at

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
oil change in this car we're roughly at

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.009 
oil change in this car we're roughly at
about<00:03:29.890> 3,000<00:03:30.519> miles<00:03:31.380> we've<00:03:32.380> got<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.800> new<00:03:33.550> plug

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
about 3,000 miles we've got a new plug

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.750 
about 3,000 miles we've got a new plug
it's<00:03:35.019> got<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.350> make<00:03:35.530> magnet<00:03:36.130> at<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> end<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.640> it

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
it's got to make magnet at the end of it

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.699 
it's got to make magnet at the end of it
which<00:03:37.030> theoretically<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:38.110> supposed<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.560> pick

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
which theoretically is supposed to pick

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.800 
which theoretically is supposed to pick
up<00:03:38.860> any<00:03:39.459> type<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:39.910> metal<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.480> might<00:03:40.660> be

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
up any type of metal that might be

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.350 
up any type of metal that might be
circulating<00:03:41.620> in<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.860> engine<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.220> gets<00:03:42.489> by

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
circulating in the engine that gets by

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.530 
circulating in the engine that gets by
the<00:03:43.420> oil<00:03:43.840> filter<00:03:44.079> or<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:46.120> floating<00:03:46.450> around

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
the oil filter or just floating around

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.090 
the oil filter or just floating around
in<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.870> oil<00:03:47.820> okay<00:03:48.820> we're<00:03:49.000> going<00:03:49.209> ahead<00:03:49.360> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
in the oil okay we're going ahead to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.759 
in the oil okay we're going ahead to
access<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.340> filter<00:03:52.090> curtain<00:03:55.530> okay<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.650> think

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
access the filter curtain okay I think

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.660 
access the filter curtain okay I think
is<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.400> oil<00:03:58.269> filter<00:03:58.540> gets<00:03:58.840> filled<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.670> worked

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
is the oil filter gets filled and worked

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.610 
is the oil filter gets filled and worked
on<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.269> wanted<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.720> come<00:04:01.930> out<00:04:02.049> with<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.380> cap

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
on it wanted to come out with the cap

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.250 
on it wanted to come out with the cap
the<00:04:02.980> cover<00:04:03.519> cap<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.900> little<00:04:05.049> more

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
the cover cap so it a little more

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.710 
the cover cap so it a little more
difficult<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:06.160> get<00:04:06.250> out<00:04:06.370> but<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:07.299> just<00:04:07.480> kind

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
difficult to get out but you just kind

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.229 
difficult to get out but you just kind
of<00:04:07.980> move<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.160> air<00:04:09.370> intake<00:04:09.730> down<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.000> little

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
of move that air intake down a little

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.660 
of move that air intake down a little
bit<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:11.739> should<00:04:11.950> be<00:04:12.070> able<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.310> wiggle<00:04:12.430> it

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
bit and you should be able to wiggle it

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.560 
bit and you should be able to wiggle it
out<00:04:12.760> there<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:14.280> okay<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.579> cart<00:04:15.880> old<00:04:16.120> cartridge

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
out there so okay the cart old cartridge

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.479 
is out or getting ready to put the new
cartridge<00:04:18.489> in<00:04:19.470> most<00:04:20.470> your<00:04:20.680> oil<00:04:20.890> filter<00:04:21.070> kids

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
cartridge in most your oil filter kids

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.130 
cartridge in most your oil filter kids
that's<00:04:21.729> all<00:04:21.970> volvo<00:04:23.130> parts<00:04:24.270> have<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.600> rubber

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
that's all volvo parts have the rubber

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.890 
that's all volvo parts have the rubber
Newell<00:04:26.590> rubber<00:04:26.800> o-ring<00:04:27.250> in<00:04:27.460> with<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.300> filter

Newell rubber o-ring in with the filter

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.880 
Newell rubber o-ring in with the filter
itself<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:30.010> make<00:04:30.310> sure<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.610> replace<00:04:30.789> that

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
itself so make sure you replace that

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.159 
itself so make sure you replace that
okay<00:04:32.890> just<00:04:33.160> tightening<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.789> new<00:04:34.570> filters<00:04:34.990> in

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
tighten the cover up definitely takes a

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.339 
tighten the cover up definitely takes a
little<00:04:38.919> finagling<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.490> get<00:04:39.669> in<00:04:39.820> there<00:04:40.349> but

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
little finagling to get in there but

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.050 
little finagling to get in there but
what<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.890> did<00:04:42.130> was<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.400> dropped<00:04:42.669> in<00:04:42.849> the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
what I did was I dropped in the

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.370
