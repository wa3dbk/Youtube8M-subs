00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
hi my name is Kate and I'm working on

this idea is real this picture is
actually<00:00:11.010> taken<00:00:11.730> from<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.090> NASA<00:00:12.300> website<00:00:12.630> of

what NASA thinks this elevator could
look<00:00:15.509> like<00:00:15.859> the<00:00:16.859> elevator<00:00:17.369> would<00:00:17.580> run<00:00:17.820> from

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
look like the elevator would run from

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the interesting things about nanotubes

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.690 
the interesting things about nanotubes
is<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.390> mend<00:01:30.720> themselves<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:32.549> of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
is that they mend themselves and one of

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
is that they mend themselves and one of
the<00:01:32.759> ways<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.270> mend<00:01:33.570> themselves<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.680> form

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the ways they mend themselves is to form

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
the ways they mend themselves is to form
bonding<00:01:35.460> between<00:01:35.729> nanotubes<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.049> this

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
bonding between nanotubes just like this

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.270 
bonding between nanotubes just like this
one<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:38.390> but<00:01:39.409> just<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
one here but just like if we have a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
one here but just like if we have a
break<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.670> our<00:01:42.180> skin<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> nanotubes

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
break in our skin when the nanotubes

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.710 
break in our skin when the nanotubes
mend<00:01:44.310> themselves<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.299> mend

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
mend themselves they don't mend

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.149 
mend themselves they don't mend
perfectly<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.979> leaves<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.759> scar<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:49.770> trying

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
perfectly it leaves a scar so I'm trying

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
perfectly it leaves a scar so I'm trying
to<00:01:50.250> maximize<00:01:51.060> bonding<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> minimize

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
to maximize bonding and minimize

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.580 
to maximize bonding and minimize
scarring<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.659> by<00:01:54.960> changing<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
scarring and I do this by changing the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.770 
scarring and I do this by changing the
speed<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> electrons<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
speed of the electrons and the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.709 
speed of the electrons and the
temperature<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> nanotubes<00:01:59.570> what<00:02:00.570> I've

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
temperature of the nanotubes what I've

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
temperature of the nanotubes what I've
found<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.799> faster<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> speed<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
found is that the faster the speed of

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.270 
found is that the faster the speed of
the<00:02:03.030> electrons<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.290> more<00:02:04.500> bonds<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:05.159> created

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the electrons the more bonds are created

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.830 
the electrons the more bonds are created
but<00:02:06.270> also<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.990> most<00:02:07.259> scarring<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:09.209> use<00:02:09.599> high

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
but also the most scarring so I use high

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140 
but also the most scarring so I use high
temperatures<00:02:10.560> between<00:02:11.039> five<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.670> eight

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
temperatures between five and eight

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.550 
temperatures between five and eight
hundred<00:02:12.390> degrees<00:02:12.900> Celsius

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
hundred degrees Celsius

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.180 
hundred degrees Celsius
to<00:02:14.190> help<00:02:14.430> mend<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.000> scarring<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.950> best

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
to help mend that scarring the best

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.140 
to help mend that scarring the best
combination<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.239> find<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.290> here

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
combination I can find is this one here

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.040 
combination I can find is this one here
high-speed<00:02:21.150> electrons<00:02:21.750> and
