them and today I'm going to teach you my

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.600 
them and today I'm going to teach you my

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
three favorite ways to do them vast

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.790 
three favorite ways to do them vast
majority<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> us<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:52.050> blackheads<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
majority of us do get blackheads and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.110 
majority of us do get blackheads and
they<00:00:52.860> usually<00:00:53.039> appear<00:00:53.280> within<00:00:53.670> our<00:00:53.820> t-zone

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
they usually appear within our t-zone

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.279 
they usually appear within our t-zone
and<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.899> usually<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and that is because it's usually the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
and that is because it's usually the
area<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.710> produces<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> most<00:00:59.489> oil<00:00:59.789> but

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
area that produces the most oil but

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
area that produces the most oil but
lucky<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.809> us<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.260> companies<00:01:01.649> out
