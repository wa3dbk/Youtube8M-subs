00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
us so with all that being said I expect

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.199 
us so with all that being said I expect
Louisville<00:04:17.849> to<00:04:18.030> win<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.419> game<00:04:19.609> but<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.760> will

Louisville to win this game but I will
not<00:04:21.359> be<00:04:21.599> surprised<00:04:22.109> if<00:04:22.409> they<00:04:22.620> somehow<00:04:23.180> get

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
not be surprised if they somehow get

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.660 
not be surprised if they somehow get
upset

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
upset

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.910 
upset

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
four games we've got coming up all

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
it's going to be a nightmare for us but

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.550 
it's going to be a nightmare for us but
if<00:04:39.980> we<00:04:40.040> could<00:04:40.370> beat<00:04:40.550> Louisville<00:04:41.410> we<00:04:42.410> look

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
if we could beat Louisville we look

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.820 
if we could beat Louisville we look
pretty<00:04:42.590> much<00:04:43.960> diminished<00:04:44.960> what<00:04:45.470> little

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
pretty much diminished what little

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.860 
pretty much diminished what little
chance<00:04:46.160> they<00:04:46.460> have<00:04:46.730> in<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.000> first<00:04:47.240> place<00:04:47.480> of

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
chance they have in the first place of

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.440 
chance they have in the first place of
going<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.410> national<00:04:48.800> championship<00:04:49.450> we

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
going to the national championship we

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.740 
going to the national championship we
will<00:04:50.660> wipe<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.110> out<00:04:51.170> and<00:04:52.060> they<00:04:53.060> will<00:04:53.300> be<00:04:53.330> even

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
will wipe that out and they will be even

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.360 
will wipe that out and they will be even
though<00:04:54.110> they<00:04:54.260> may<00:04:54.440> go<00:04:54.620> undefeated<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.340> rest

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
though they may go undefeated the rest

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.450 
though they may go undefeated the rest
of<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:55.850> year<00:04:56.090> they<00:04:57.050> have<00:04:57.260> no<00:04:57.470> shot<00:04:57.830> of<00:04:57.860> plan

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
of the year they have no shot of plan

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.630 
of the year they have no shot of plan
for<00:04:58.880> national<00:04:59.300> championship<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:01.010> every<00:05:01.400> game

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
for national championship so every game

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.300 
for national championship so every game
pretty<00:05:01.970> much<00:05:02.090> is<00:05:02.660> Louisville<00:05:03.380> season<00:05:03.890> because

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
pretty much is Louisville season because

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.020 
pretty much is Louisville season because
one<00:05:04.880> loss<00:05:06.100> takes<00:05:07.100> away<00:05:07.400> what<00:05:07.580> little<00:05:07.610> chance

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
one loss takes away what little chance

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.710 
one loss takes away what little chance
they<00:05:08.210> would<00:05:08.390> have<00:05:08.600> anyway<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.200> with<00:05:09.380> Kentucky

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
they would have anyway and with Kentucky

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.550 
they would have anyway and with Kentucky
we<00:05:11.720> don't<00:05:11.840> have<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:12.020> worry<00:05:12.140> about<00:05:12.260> that

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
we don't have to worry about that

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.440 
we don't have to worry about that
because<00:05:13.070> we<00:05:13.400> actually<00:05:13.730> play<00:05:13.970> in<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.270> good

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
because we actually play in a good

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.380 
because we actually play in a good
conference<00:05:14.720> if<00:05:15.050> we<00:05:15.200> ever<00:05:15.350> do<00:05:15.590> get<00:05:15.800> good<00:05:16.390> we

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
conference if we ever do get good we

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.970 
conference if we ever do get good we
will<00:05:17.540> automatically<00:05:18.080> be<00:05:18.200> able<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.440> play<00:05:18.530> for<00:05:18.680> a

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
will automatically be able to play for a

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.070 
will automatically be able to play for a
great<00:05:19.460> ballgame<00:05:19.730> or<00:05:20.210> national<00:05:20.600> championship

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
great ballgame or national championship

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.870 
great ballgame or national championship
before<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.620> playoff<00:05:22.040> system<00:05:22.250> by<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.670> time

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
before the playoff system by the time

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.850 
before the playoff system by the time
that<00:05:22.910> happens<00:05:23.390> because<00:05:23.990> we<00:05:24.290> play<00:05:24.500> in<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.680> great

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
that happens because we play in a great
