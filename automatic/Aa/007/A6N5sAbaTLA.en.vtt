00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
and it causes more breakage than this

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.170

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
though I sort of hold it upside down

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.160 
though I sort of hold it upside down
because<00:00:58.559> I'm<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> lefty<00:00:59.660> my<00:01:00.660> hands<00:01:00.960> are<00:01:01.050> big

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
slippery in the first place I might drop

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149

this<00:01:18.840> once<00:01:19.049> or<00:01:19.170> twice<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:19.920> really

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
this once or twice but that's really

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.780 
this once or twice but that's really
only<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.759> couple<00:01:20.850> times<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.630> month<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:23.250> it's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
only a couple times a month so it's it's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.730 
only a couple times a month so it's it's
okay<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.170> sound<00:01:25.320> doesn't<00:01:25.619> really

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
okay for me the sound doesn't really

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.649 
okay for me the sound doesn't really
bother<00:01:25.890> me<00:01:26.070> either<00:01:26.340> after<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.030> use<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.420> for

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

bother me either after you use this for
a<00:01:27.720> couple<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> months<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.530> even<00:01:28.680> really

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
a couple of months you don't even really

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.660 
a couple of months you don't even really
hear<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> anymore

hear it anymore
I<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.509> still<00:01:30.689> tell<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> difference<00:01:31.259> between

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
I can still tell the difference between

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.510 
I can still tell the difference between
the<00:01:32.000> brushing<00:01:33.000> noise<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.590> sound<00:01:35.280> of

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the brushing noise here and the sound of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
the brushing noise here and the sound of
snapping<00:01:36.030> hair<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.990> doesn't<00:01:37.290> really

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
snapping hair so it doesn't really

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
snapping hair so it doesn't really
matter<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.040> does<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.430> cause<00:01:38.670> less<00:01:38.909> damage

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
matter so does this cause less damage

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.330 
matter so does this cause less damage
after<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> use<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.200> regularly<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.100> while

this is not a miracle worker it's not

going to heal the damage that's already

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.749 
going to heal the damage that's already
there<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> cut<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.399> splits<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
there you have to cut off the splits and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.030 
there you have to cut off the splits and
the<00:01:47.880> damage<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.420> start<00:01:48.899> anew<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.920> know

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the damage and start anew when you know

the damage and start anew when you know
with<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:51.030> gentle<00:01:51.540> regime<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.829> noticed

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
with a more gentle regime I have noticed

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.060 
with a more gentle regime I have noticed
since<00:01:53.670> using<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.750> fewer<00:01:55.470> new

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
since using this that I get fewer new

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.510 
since using this that I get fewer new
split<00:01:56.369> ends<00:01:56.670> my<00:01:57.030> hair<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.479> softer<00:01:58.399> however<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
split ends my hair is softer however I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.440 
split ends my hair is softer however I
have<00:01:59.880> also<00:02:00.270> switched<00:02:00.689> over<00:02:00.899> from

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
have also switched over from

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.209 
have also switched over from
sulfate<00:02:01.780> shampoo<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.289> non<00:02:02.500> sulfate<00:02:02.890> shampoo

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
sulfate shampoo to a non sulfate shampoo

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.709 
sulfate shampoo to a non sulfate shampoo
in<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.399> past<00:02:03.610> year<00:02:03.939> so<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:04.479> could<00:02:04.600> be<00:02:04.689> a

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
in the past year so it could be a

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.749 
in the past year so it could be a
combination<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.500> both<00:02:05.560> those<00:02:06.070> factors<00:02:06.579> that

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
combination of both those factors that

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.150 
combination of both those factors that
has<00:02:07.030> made<00:02:07.270> my<00:02:07.450> hair<00:02:07.659> more<00:02:07.810> manageable<00:02:08.160> when

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
has made my hair more manageable when

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.830 
has made my hair more manageable when
I'm<00:02:09.429> brushing<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.030> hadn't<00:02:10.360> even<00:02:10.539> brushed<00:02:10.720> my

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
I'm brushing it I hadn't even brushed my

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.050 
I'm brushing it I hadn't even brushed my
hair<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:11.349> morning<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.830> had<00:02:12.310> slept<00:02:12.610> with<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.910> in

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
hair this morning I had slept with it in

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.600 
hair this morning I had slept with it in
a<00:02:13.209> two<00:02:13.540> strand<00:02:13.810> twist<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.129> led<00:02:15.400> up<00:02:15.519> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
a two strand twist and I just led up the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.369 
a two strand twist and I just led up the
twist<00:02:15.819> but<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.000> hadn't<00:02:16.300> brushed<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.720> today<00:02:16.989> so

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
twist but I hadn't brushed it today so

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.470 
twist but I hadn't brushed it today so
when<00:02:17.739> I'm<00:02:17.890> brushing<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.670> start<00:02:19.209> from<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
when I'm brushing it I start from the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.720 
when I'm brushing it I start from the
bottom<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.890> worked<00:02:21.069> my<00:02:21.220> way<00:02:21.250> up<00:02:21.400> I

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
bottom and I worked my way up I

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.630 
bottom and I worked my way up I
separated<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.450> into<00:02:22.769> two<00:02:23.769> sections<00:02:23.980> usually

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
separated it into two sections usually

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.220 
separated it into two sections usually
because<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.150> bristles<00:02:25.599> here<00:02:25.720> are<00:02:25.930> fairly

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
because the bristles here are fairly

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.759 
because the bristles here are fairly
short<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.800> my<00:02:26.890> hair<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.810> fluffy<00:02:28.810> /<00:02:29.290> thick<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.120> I

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
short and my hair is fluffy / thick so I

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.830 
short and my hair is fluffy / thick so I
find<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:32.950> easier<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.459> work<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:34.060> sections<00:02:34.450> and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
find it easier to work in sections and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.990 
find it easier to work in sections and
it<00:02:34.930> still<00:02:35.230> takes<00:02:35.830> less<00:02:36.099> time<00:02:36.130> than<00:02:36.370> if<00:02:36.849> I'm

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
it still takes less time than if I'm

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820 
it still takes less time than if I'm
brushing<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.690> one<00:02:37.900> section<00:02:38.170> with<00:02:38.470> longer

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
brushing in one section with longer

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.350 
brushing in one section with longer
bristles<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.340> cause<00:02:39.549> more<00:02:39.730> damage<00:02:39.880> anyway

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
bristles that cause more damage anyway

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.569 
bristles that cause more damage anyway
so<00:02:41.079> you'll<00:02:41.230> notice<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.560> I'm<00:02:42.040> starting<00:02:42.459> at

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
so you'll notice that I'm starting at

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.069 
so you'll notice that I'm starting at
the<00:02:42.670> bottom<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.209> I'm<00:02:43.450> working<00:02:43.630> my<00:02:43.810> way<00:02:43.900> up

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
the bottom and I'm working my way up

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.839 
the bottom and I'm working my way up
taking<00:02:44.650> out<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.860> tangles<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.459> little<00:02:45.730> bit

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
taking out the tangles just a little bit

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.809 
taking out the tangles just a little bit
at<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> time<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.630> I'm<00:02:47.530> still<00:02:47.860> using<00:02:48.160> good

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
at a time and I'm still using good

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.479 
at a time and I'm still using good
brushing<00:02:49.540> technique<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.410> know<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.280> says

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
brushing technique I know that it says

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.039 
brushing technique I know that it says
on<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.819> package<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.299> tangle<00:02:52.660> teezer<00:02:52.840> that

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
on the package of the tangle teezer that

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.330 
on the package of the tangle teezer that
you<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.260> be<00:02:53.380> rough<00:02:53.560> with<00:02:53.680> your<00:02:53.799> hair<00:02:54.010> because

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
you can be rough with your hair because

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.550 
you can be rough with your hair because
the<00:02:54.489> brush<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.030> really<00:02:55.420> gentle<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:56.110> can<00:02:56.319> start

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
the brush is really gentle you can start

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.870 
the brush is really gentle you can start
at<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.769> scalp<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.220> brush<00:02:57.400> up<00:02:57.549> all<00:02:57.730> your

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
at the scalp and brush up all your

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.020 
at the scalp and brush up all your
tangles<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.540> one<00:02:59.140> fell<00:02:59.349> swoop<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.920> don't<00:03:00.819> follow

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
tangles in one fell swoop I don't follow

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.520 
tangles in one fell swoop I don't follow
that<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.599> think<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.049> can<00:03:02.200> still<00:03:02.410> get

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
that I think that you can still get

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.130 
that I think that you can still get
damaged<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.130> way<00:03:03.280> no<00:03:03.760> matter<00:03:03.910> what<00:03:04.140> quality

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
damaged that way no matter what quality

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.870 
damaged that way no matter what quality
your<00:03:05.410> brush<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.130> doesn't<00:03:06.400> give<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:06.670> an

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
your brush is it doesn't give you an

your brush is it doesn't give you an
excuse<00:03:07.359> to<00:03:07.600> abuse<00:03:07.720> your<00:03:08.049> hair<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.950> here<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.280> is

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
excuse to abuse your hair so here it is

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.940 
excuse to abuse your hair so here it is
close-up<00:03:09.760> again<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.510> year<00:03:10.720> later<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.290> since<00:03:11.859> I

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
close-up again a year later and since I

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.650 
close-up again a year later and since I
had<00:03:12.100> kept<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.459> in<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.700> box<00:03:12.880> for<00:03:13.209> storing

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
had kept it in the box for storing

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.500 
had kept it in the box for storing
basically<00:03:14.410> until<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.739> box<00:03:14.950> fell<00:03:15.430> apart

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
basically until the box fell apart

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.240 
basically until the box fell apart
I<00:03:16.569> think<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.200> may<00:03:17.440> have<00:03:17.650> helped<00:03:18.069> the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
I think that may have helped the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.460 
I think that may have helped the
bristles<00:03:18.639> remain<00:03:19.060> intact<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:20.079> little<00:03:20.319> bit

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
bristles remain intact a little bit

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.590 
bristles remain intact a little bit
longer<00:03:20.739> than<00:03:21.340> some<00:03:21.400> other<00:03:21.940> people's<00:03:22.269> brushes

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
longer than some other people's brushes

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.780 
longer than some other people's brushes
if<00:03:23.049> they<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.500> kind<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.859> you<00:03:24.069> know<00:03:24.250> stored<00:03:24.670> it

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
if they just kind of you know stored it

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.970 
if they just kind of you know stored it
anywhere<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.359> threw<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.380> into<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> drawer

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
anywhere and threw it into a drawer

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.789 
anywhere and threw it into a drawer
where<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> caught<00:03:27.489> crush<00:03:27.730> or<00:03:27.910> something<00:03:28.799> you

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
where I caught crush or something you

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.400 
where I caught crush or something you
can<00:03:29.980> see<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.519> some<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.420> edge<00:03:31.660> bristles

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
can see in some of the edge bristles

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.470 
can see in some of the edge bristles
that<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.220> starting<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.700> bend<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.150> little<00:03:34.329> bit

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
that it's starting to bend a little bit

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.569 
that it's starting to bend a little bit
like<00:03:34.840> there<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.739> there<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.250> starting<00:03:36.489> to

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
like there and there it's starting to

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.580 
like there and there it's starting to
bend<00:03:36.760> outwards<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.959> is<00:03:38.079> showing<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.440> little

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
bend outwards so it is showing a little

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.289 
bend outwards so it is showing a little
bit<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.799> wear<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:39.910> probably<00:03:40.090> not

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
bit of wear and it's probably not

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.500 
bit of wear and it's probably not
showing<00:03:40.810> up<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.109> camera<00:03:41.670> but<00:03:42.670> some<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.209> these

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
showing up on camera but some of these

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.720 
showing up on camera but some of these
bristles<00:03:44.290> they're<00:03:44.769> starting<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.130> almost<00:03:45.370> like

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
bristles they're starting to almost like

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.030 
bristles they're starting to almost like
fray<00:03:46.569> on<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.019> very<00:03:47.230> very<00:03:47.470> end<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.799> they<00:03:47.920> get

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
fray on the very very end of it they get

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.610 
fray on the very very end of it they get
a<00:03:48.099> little<00:03:48.340> bit<00:03:48.489> split<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.030> fuzzy<00:03:49.450> I've<00:03:50.410> heard

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
a little bit split and fuzzy I've heard

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.360 
a little bit split and fuzzy I've heard
that<00:03:50.769> many<00:03:50.980> people<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:52.410> buy<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.769> new<00:03:53.799> tangle

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
that many people just buy a new tangle

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.569 
that many people just buy a new tangle
teezer<00:03:54.519> after<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:55.000> year<00:03:55.329> or<00:03:55.359> two<00:03:56.130> because<00:03:57.130> it<00:03:57.400> is

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
teezer after a year or two because it is

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.479 
teezer after a year or two because it is
fairly<00:03:58.359> affordable<00:03:58.889> it's<00:03:59.889> theoretically

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
fairly affordable it's theoretically

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.250 
fairly affordable it's theoretically
possible<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:01.150> take<00:04:01.329> heat<00:04:01.599> to<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.930> bristles

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
possible to take heat to the bristles

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.659 
possible to take heat to the bristles
and<00:04:02.349> slightly<00:04:02.739> melt<00:04:02.919> it<00:04:03.040> but<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.190> would<00:04:03.459> not

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
and slightly melt it but I would not

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.430 
and slightly melt it but I would not
recommend<00:04:03.970> that<00:04:04.180> because<00:04:04.419> that<00:04:04.989> might<00:04:05.230> just

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
recommend that because that might just

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.030 
recommend that because that might just
end<00:04:05.590> up<00:04:05.910> making<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.299> bristles<00:04:07.989> uneven<00:04:08.859> and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
end up making the bristles uneven and

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.559 
end up making the bristles uneven and
then

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
then

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.110 
then
catching<00:04:09.959> on<00:04:10.079> your<00:04:10.230> hair<00:04:10.439> afterwards<00:04:11.120> for

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
catching on your hair afterwards for

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.300 
catching on your hair afterwards for
cleaning<00:04:13.079> this<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.439> usually<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:13.889> use<00:04:14.129> like<00:04:14.249> a

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
cleaning this I usually just use like a

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.590 
cleaning this I usually just use like a
pedicure<00:04:15.030> brush<00:04:15.659> like<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.729> I<00:04:17.729> would

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
pedicure brush like that and I would

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.969 
pedicure brush like that and I would
just<00:04:18.810> put<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.169> little<00:04:19.350> bit<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.590> soap<00:04:19.739> on<00:04:19.889> the

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
just put a little bit of soap on the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.770 
just put a little bit of soap on the
brush<00:04:20.009> and<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.699> know<00:04:20.940> put<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.239> through<00:04:21.389> and

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
brush and you know put it through and

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.570 
brush and you know put it through and
take<00:04:22.259> tweezers<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.860> get<00:04:23.009> out<00:04:23.130> all<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.370> hairs

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
take tweezers and get out all the hairs

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.490 
take tweezers and get out all the hairs
I<00:04:23.759> find<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:24.389> easier<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.900> clean<00:04:25.110> than<00:04:25.320> a

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
I find this easier to clean than a

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.270 
I find this easier to clean than a
regular<00:04:25.680> paddle<00:04:26.280> brush<00:04:27.229> because<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.830> padded

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
regular paddle brush because the padded

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.010 
regular paddle brush because the padded
paddle<00:04:29.580> brushes<00:04:29.880> are<00:04:30.030> kind<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.300> porous<00:04:30.780> and

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
paddle brushes are kind of porous and

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.980 
paddle brushes are kind of porous and
the<00:04:31.970> boar<00:04:32.970> bristle<00:04:33.360> brushes<00:04:33.539> you<00:04:33.780> know<00:04:33.870> they

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
the boar bristle brushes you know they

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.300 
the boar bristle brushes you know they
have<00:04:34.110> cuticles<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.770> whereas<00:04:34.979> this<00:04:35.130> one

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
have cuticles on it whereas this one

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.460 
have cuticles on it whereas this one
doesn't<00:04:35.729> so<00:04:35.849> it's<00:04:36.000> really<00:04:36.270> easy<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.870> get<00:04:37.349> the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
doesn't so it's really easy to get the

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.950 
doesn't so it's really easy to get the
oil<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.949> residue<00:04:38.340> off<00:04:38.490> okay<00:04:39.389> so<00:04:39.449> I<00:04:39.599> have

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
oil and the residue off okay so I have

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.050 
oil and the residue off okay so I have
finished<00:04:40.560> brushing<00:04:41.250> my<00:04:41.490> hair<00:04:41.520> with<00:04:42.000> the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
finished brushing my hair with the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.400 
finished brushing my hair with the
tangle<00:04:42.389> teezer<00:04:42.630> it<00:04:42.780> took<00:04:42.930> less<00:04:43.080> than<00:04:43.110> three

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
tangle teezer it took less than three

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.200 
tangle teezer it took less than three
minutes<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:44.070> it<00:04:44.610> probably<00:04:44.789> would<00:04:45.090> have<00:04:45.120> taken

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
minutes and it probably would have taken

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.210 
minutes and it probably would have taken
even<00:04:45.599> less<00:04:45.810> time<00:04:46.050> if<00:04:46.199> I<00:04:46.320> weren't<00:04:46.530> talking

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
even less time if I weren't talking

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.110 
even less time if I weren't talking
while<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.460> was<00:04:47.729> doing<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.530> in<00:04:49.530> conclusion<00:04:49.979> I<00:04:50.370> do

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
while I was doing it in conclusion I do

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.640 
while I was doing it in conclusion I do
think<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.419> is<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:51.599> quite<00:04:51.840> good<00:04:51.870> brush<00:04:52.320> as<00:04:52.530> long

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
think this is a quite good brush as long

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.950 
think this is a quite good brush as long
as<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.889> use<00:04:53.039> it<00:04:53.070> with<00:04:53.310> good<00:04:53.490> technique<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:54.150> I

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
as you use it with good technique and I

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.839 
as you use it with good technique and I
am<00:04:55.680> happy<00:04:56.160> with<00:04:56.220> my<00:04:56.340> purchase<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.820> would

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
am happy with my purchase I would

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.749 
am happy with my purchase I would
purchase<00:04:57.120> this<00:04:57.419> again<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:58.250> don't<00:04:59.250> think<00:04:59.520> this

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
purposes this brush is gentler faster

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.180
