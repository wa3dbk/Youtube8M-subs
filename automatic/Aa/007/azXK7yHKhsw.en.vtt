00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello everyone, not so long ago 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.250
 published a video in which showed three 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.549
 options kumi stoves based horse 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.320
 those somewhere but in the latest ranking 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.730
 I was not so rich 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.460
 what reason but allowed 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.330
 generally scourge and equipped with quality 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.250
 indicator hiss hisses only 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.159
 in one block 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.379
 I'm getting close today to show 

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:26.769
 such a design only matches as 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.710
 these canvas what is complete letters 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.509
 in fact it is a mechanism that allows 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.050
 light the indicator from the stove where we have something 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.660
 getting ready then it was easier 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.540
 orientate let's say we are here 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.790
 we let something melt down and we have here 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.370
 the indicator lights up 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 typical and even when we have a process 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.910
 will end and the stove will go out 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.690
 we will not need to communicate stoves 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.829
 the region that was preparing 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.800
 of course when we're going ready 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680
 material you can press the reset button 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.650
 and the mechanism rushes 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.640
 but now let's move on the buildings 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.700
 For starters, the principle on which it all 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.180
 Many probably built already 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.410
 guess what it is here but for everyone 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.020
 case as they say so if we have 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.510
 a horse would be nice to wear a diagonal 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.120
 video signal before suspension 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.770
 piston radar block days next to it 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.040
 poland and nominated 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.380
 that is, they put it has a baku 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.560
 Here on this principle, all this makes 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.470
 being built let's get down to building 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.689
 but pine zen 4 stove document example 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.690
 and behind the brick in the flock the usual piston 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.770
 further fields polish try the school year 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.040
 for example in sand or gravel 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.710
 i will use heroin then us 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.870
 need a reset button to position it 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.410
 will be right here for god 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.930
 bookmark and reset flock repeat without 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.820
 delays 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.630
 another block of cues red torch 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.030
 how do you understand here at this level we 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.880
 it is necessary to power the blocks so that porsche does not receive 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.380
 us updates from stove year theft china 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.240
 then used a paved path 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.789
 above but adnan this option will not work 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.619
 as we will power the lamps 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.130
 here on top for the record milan we 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.870
 set to repeat 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 we need to somehow power all these 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.580
 blogs 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.210
 before that we have here 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.069
 such a block of money 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.649
 also puts repeaters 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.059
 sent to these blocks 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.839
 and from here we have to give a signal 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.189
 that is, the signal MDG signal signal experience 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.449
 about 100 torches served on all these 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:21.300
 repeaters 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.280
 comma blocks and allows our 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.519
 polish updated 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.410
 let's take an example stove 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.359
 as you can see the fees are shifting 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.429
 so return the subscription back 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.569
 and continue construction 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.259
 we also need to somehow transmit the signal to 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.339
 lamps plan then we will be located 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.159
 here 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.400
 by block 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.240
 that is, one block away 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.840
 stoves and repeaters will be 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.030
 downtrodden factory these blogs followed by 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.340
 lamps for this on these repeat and here it is 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.070
 also signal it is done 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.150
 follows the track as follows 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.219
 Rostov but here above 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.439
 we spend here another line of blocks 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.109
 and the path of acetone lead along this line 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.839
 block bake all these repeaters here 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.859
 as noted the lamp before updated 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.340
 our stoves caught fire 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.400
 on matching in the same way will 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.750
 light up the lamp and above the other nicknames 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.000
 like that and of course when we click 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.399
 reset 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:16.639
 This is reset all updates and all 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.389
 cats comes to original condition 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.489
 all that remains for us of course is zakayev 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.299
 we have only a few with 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.879
 wall mechanism 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.790
 arrange it as you want and it turns out 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.550
 Here is such an automatic 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.850
 bought stove this elisean what 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.060
 complex single 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.620
 disadvantage please circuit it 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.530
 when pressed reset highlighted 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.160
 first by mail because 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.780
 shutdown scheme do not have time to get 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.769
 update 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.040
 if you order oranges you can like that 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.109
 reset button put your hand spot 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.470
 do this wiring let's say like this 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.690
 Of course, too, everything is hidden in such 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.150
 case, these guns do not receive updates and 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.880
 no visual hooks us 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.750
 the mechanism still appears 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.670
 I hope to work this 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.950
 liked the design and 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.930
 it will be useful for today 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.530
 thank you very much for your attention do not forget 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.630
