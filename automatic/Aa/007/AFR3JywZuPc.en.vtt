00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.040
 we would not be surprised if the 8x htc is the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.930
 protagonist of the solution 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.120

 so many changes in the hardware and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.990
 mainly in the design we thought that 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.820
 I would never end up going to the market 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.350

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.130
 will hit the market with android say 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.840
 living as an operating system the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.030
 responsible for giving the news was the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.770
 gamestop store that has already started to 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.230
 receive pre-purchases from users 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.390
 since last Friday I still do not 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.489
 we have an idea of when it will reach the rest 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.600
 of the world but if he does we will have them 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.600
 informed from 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.280
 intel wants to kill the shippers the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.650
 successful manufacturing company 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.630
 processors known as entel just 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.880
 to join with a company called and dt 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.250
 to develop a microchip with 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.720
 integrated receiver and transmitter for 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.250
 that you can recharge the battery 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.460
 different mobile devices 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.050
 wirelessly and you own enough 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.150
 developments in the field of recharging 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.430
 without wires but the alliance with a 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.290
 intel weight company would allow it 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.900
 reach a much bigger goal 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.520
 objective that I would share with intel for 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.240
 that his dream of charging devices 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.860
 wireless laptops come true

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.870
 next year 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.300
 this makes us suppose that we should 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.340
 wait until the end of 2014 to 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.739
