playlist<00:00:41.399> i<00:00:41.640> modified<00:00:42.059> these<00:00:42.329> by<00:00:42.510> myself<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
playlist i modified these by myself and

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.770 
playlist i modified these by myself and
it's<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.850> bit<00:00:44.969> different<00:00:45.300> from<00:00:45.390> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it's a little bit different from you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.180 
it's a little bit different from you
modified<00:00:46.379> ones<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
modified ones that you get on the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
modified ones that you get on the
internet<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.480> hasn't<00:00:48.600> has<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.260> icon

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
internet because it hasn't has an icon

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.880 
internet because it hasn't has an icon
in<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.000> that's<00:00:51.360> why<00:00:51.930> i<00:00:51.960> modified<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
in it so that's why i modified it to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
in it so that's why i modified it to
make<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.190> look<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.489> bit<00:00:53.640> better<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:54.719> they've

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
make it look a bit better so now they've

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.139 
make it look a bit better so now they've
got<00:00:55.230> those<00:00:55.559> two<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:55.980> desktop<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.969> want

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149

ok guys so once we have put those files
in<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.180> quick<00:01:51.420> free<00:01:51.570> spring<00:01:51.810> by

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
in you want to do a quick free spring by

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.830 
in you want to do a quick free spring by
getting<00:01:52.590> sbsettings<00:01:53.040> swiping<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
getting sbsettings swiping on here and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.380 
getting sbsettings swiping on here and
go<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.230> respring<00:01:55.650> right<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.210> we'll

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
go and respring right there so we'll

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.500 
go and respring right there so we'll
just<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.750> three<00:01:58.110> spring<00:01:59.030> give<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.330> two

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
just do three spring give one to two

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.130 
just do three spring give one to two
lungs<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.990> restarting<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> springboard

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
lungs just restarting the springboard

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.460 
lungs just restarting the springboard
could<00:02:04.140> take<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.640> five<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.360> twenty<00:02:07.050> seconds

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
could take up to five to twenty seconds

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.560 
could take up to five to twenty seconds
depending<00:02:07.650> on<00:02:08.040> how<00:02:08.130> much<00:02:08.220> apps<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.640> mine

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
depending on how much apps you have mine

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.890 
depending on how much apps you have mine
usually<00:02:09.810> takes<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.320> five<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:11.720> now<00:02:12.720> they've

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
usually takes about five and now they've

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.870
