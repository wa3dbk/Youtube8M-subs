00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.530
 if three years ago they told me that at 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.820
 my service as well as open days 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.920
 more overall to our services 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.510
 of orientation we would have had as 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.279
 parents who are not the parents 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.170
 interlocutors about whom i 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.880
 services were thought I would have thought 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.190
 it was a joke instead 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.960
 more and more frequently I am 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.730
 shrewd even with the help of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.439
 psychologists who work directly at 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.199
 service that the presence of parents is 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.410
 a growing presence in the various phases 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.930
 of the university choice in 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.489
 particularly since it is both open days 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.930
 that in particular for the services of 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.570
 situations in which people 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.460
 can also be accessed via contacts 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.799
 telephone rather than telematic 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.540
 we have indeed witnessed one 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.760
 function of the parents in some way 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.089
 vicarious towards children, that is 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.280
 parents turn to services for 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.400
 ask for information first and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.000
 perhaps equally in the first place 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.699
 assurances often do so 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.949
 unbeknownst to their children they often do so e 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.840
 this is interesting in the presence of 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.060
 own children who are next to them 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.100
 while parents telephone in some 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.759
 cases do it by telling the children me 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.829
 I take care of the time break from 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.890
 work time and then tonight when 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.689
 I 'll go back and tell you why just like 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.030
 social psychologist I am very interested 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.979
 to understanding behaviors e 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.799
 representations that people have 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.380
 people in my daily life have me 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.539
 I am asked what the reason was 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.929
 of the presence of parents so strong 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.490
 in a substitute function is how to say ha 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.710
 started to think about a dimension 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.700
 very strong that is the fact that in the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.499
 contemporaneity 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.179
 parents no longer have expectations 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:45.469
 compared to the children concerned 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.229
 simply the fact that the children 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.460
 can have a life that will allow 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.170
 then them to be next 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.569
 sustenance for parents as much as 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.100
 rather the fact that one of the 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.479
 typical features he also studies 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.399
 the sociology of ours 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.319
 contemporaneity is the fact that children 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.539
 should have in the expectations of the 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.670
 parents a good life ie one 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.149
 very satisfying life from all 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.660
 psychological material points of view 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.640
 expressive of well-being 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.920
 physical well-being material etc. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.990
 etc. this could very well explain the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.360
 their presence and their interest e 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.070
 could also explain a diversity of 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.480
 parents relationship no longer children 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.070
 strictly characterized by 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.130
 conflictuality typical of other eras 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.440
 historical but more from a sharing in 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.300
 some cases even equal what 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.310
 it happens however that when the parents over 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.100
 to contact the services by telephone 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.350
 they are presented in accompaniment to 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.300
 children in interview situations 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.310
 some things turn out to be more 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.710
 criticisms, that is often some parents 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.930
 accompany only physically await 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.030
 children out of the situations of 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.010
 interview in other parent situations 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.110
 enter dialogue with psychologists 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.730
 of orientation together with children e 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.380
 put a series in that situation 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.510
 of matters that concern more than anything else 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.490
 their situation is not that of their children 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.640
 as such so to the questions often 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.620
 are put in place of the children who in 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.820
 some cases are also silent silent 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.820
 sitting next to it 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.840
 in other cases the parents intervene in 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.100
 further specify how many children 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.320
 have already said in some way 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.810
 claiming that children are not able 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.580
 to do this independently and many 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.190
 other cases the parents actually pose 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.040
 questions concerning their wishes 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.690
 expectations perhaps even frustrations or 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.520
 complexity arising from what is 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.020
 their previous experience has been 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.120
 also true that for those who have been 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.040
 parents change university 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.730
 same who did the university in 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.350
 other ages 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.270
 today they are in difficulty 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.720
 understand what the changes are 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.760
 recently they are interventions for everyone 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.950
 these reasons we have decided that since 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.380
 our recipients continue to be 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.090
 student students and because 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.770
 as a public university our interest 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.200
 main really carry out 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.840
 orientation ie putting children in 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.520
 condition of being able to choose the best 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.800
 what not the right choice 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.660
 objectively but what is good for 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.700
 them because the right choice is only 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.709
 the choice that is good for that person 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.780
 and for that family context that ad 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.760
 example may or may not support it too 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.080
 economically as well as from other points 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.230
 of sight we have decided to organize 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.540
 of specific spaces dedicated to 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.880
 parents so you can say 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.979
 to them in that seat that one the seat 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.900
 in which they can be interlocutors 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.300
 while the rest of the service locations 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.430
 are locations and services for 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.490
 students to female students we also have 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.320
 made available a series will be 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.229
 a series will soon be available on the site 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.610
 of we say frequently asked questions to the 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.320
 which parents can 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.419
 find answers that also concern 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.789
 strictly informative dimensions 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.410
 on the organization the university on 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.180
 what can be the costs up 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.410
 what can be the modalities i 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.900
 access test because ours 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.220
 goal is to make as much as possible 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.770
 obvious that the function of parents 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.380
 often also requested by children how 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.940
 presence is a good function in the 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.400
 moment in which it is a function of 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.400
 accompaniment and not replacement
