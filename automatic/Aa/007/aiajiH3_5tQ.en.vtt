00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.620
 Gunpla Kit Review of Memories Mobile Suit Data Gundam 1/144 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.580
 The Hundred Hundred Formula is an automatic warrior data Gundam and a sequel to the Mobile Suit Gundam Double Zeta 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 To appear 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:20.020
 Hugo is a prototype mobile suits Needless to say char it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.730
 It is the expectation of the quattrovasina unit , but I want to go through considerable modification of settings, so much 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.410
 There is no meaning in the released information Mamoru Nagano as a design of Gundam mark 2 originally 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.190
 Those who had been design 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.590
 As the Char-only expected but as the design of the mark ii did not see the light of day 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.610
 You will see the sun again 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.010
 Naturally, n of model number msm 100 is n of Mr. Nagano 's initials 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.089
 Body and gold of but was applied the name in Chinese characters in 100s 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.199
 The was a color is said to have was a director Tomino originally was the cleanup is 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:53.629
 It is said that Kazuta Fujita was thinking about the Hundred-style of the base also at first . 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:56.600
 Because Tomino handed over Mr. Nagano 's rough by saying that he should use this for cleaning up 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.579
 It is said to have made to the current design 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:07.130
 According to Nagano , the completed design is said to be Fujita-kun, but at that time 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.600
 Set of m Nagano Dr. search of Kadokawa bookstore wanted to weave the Nagano's cartoon publication 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.280
 Because it began to be used 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.750
 It is in this gold that tends to be close up that Mr. Nagano was involved in design 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.590
 There is a lot of interpretation about 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.789
 An explanation book of plastic model at that time 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
 It is described as stick color coating, but with beam resistant coating today 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.909
 Have the function 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.840
 It is supposed to have been with the emulsion 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:33.159
 There was no such direction , so I am not very piny, but a fan of Sunrise Anime 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.939
 It is not interesting to those who are reminiscent of Gaim at the time Nara heard and plastic 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.030
 Is not it 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:41.979
 At that time this golden color was the biggest neck in painting 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.600
 In I think the people that there is an actual painted seen absolutely in order. However bets like the brave figure coarse brush 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.930
 It does not become beautiful gold 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.580
 Just say it's beautiful gold 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.120
 Not the same as too much eye + something of yellow many are the same I do not know the scene in the production of the play 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:57.050
 It seems that there were many people who painted with that circle yellow from the thing 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:01.850
 A person who writes in so-called dual eyes for mobile work of Gundam type 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.920
 Some depictions of the works of many houses are also seen, but at that time with Capt. Quattrovasina 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.720
 Would 's like sunglasses superimposed the image 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.500
 Because there was a so -called 100s = quattro image that interpretation was generally said 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.370
 When vita is going to get on with Double Zeta, it only comes to Captain Quattro 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.550
 I think we were many who thought not you could not use 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.690
 Although pooled had to say things like not changed specifications 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.910
 Dr. Nagano has not changed to the second car that came out to the double zeta and it is tuned 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.560
 Say 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.489
 It seems to be set 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.349
 Surely there was a volume thanks to the binder in those who were well done at the time 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.959
 It was quite a favorite 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:44.160
 Because the cover of one side was quite fragile, only care was necessary when posing it 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.160
 I have a memory that I repaired so much that I hate breaking it over and over again
