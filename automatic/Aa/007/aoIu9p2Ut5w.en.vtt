00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.940 
the angler is gonna have a lot of
options<00:01:37.420> for<00:01:37.479> adjusting<00:01:37.660> his<00:01:38.140> drag<00:01:38.500> during

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
options for adjusting his drag during

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.950 
options for adjusting his drag during
the<00:01:39.280> flight<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.729> fish<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.750> gives

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
the flight of the fish and that gives

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.600 
the flight of the fish and that gives
you<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.080> little<00:01:41.290> extra<00:01:41.530> versatility<00:01:42.190> but<00:01:42.430> those

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
you a little extra versatility but those

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.850 
you a little extra versatility but those
features<00:01:43.000> don't<00:01:43.180> really<00:01:43.390> end<00:01:43.540> there<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.740> it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
features don't really end there so it's

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.050 
features don't really end there so it's
got<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.010> great<00:01:45.250> feature<00:01:45.490> it's<00:01:45.700> got<00:01:45.820> line

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
got a great feature it's got line

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.120 
got a great feature it's got line
capacity<00:01:46.600> rings<00:01:46.840> on<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.650> like<00:01:47.890> that

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
capacity rings on and I like that

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.100 
capacity rings on and I like that
because<00:01:48.280> lets<00:01:48.850> me<00:01:49.030> know<00:01:49.180> exactly<00:01:49.660> how<00:01:49.960> much
