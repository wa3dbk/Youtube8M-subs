00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.629
 no man yes or woman and a hotel you too 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.460
 often comes to Breda 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 usually for a visit to family and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.080
 friends but also for practical matters 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.790
 such as renewing his passport and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.900
 number one innate indeed said 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.970
 I had to honestly extend it and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.949
 renew a game of pool billiards with 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.590
 brother draghi and knox pitch type 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.699
 pelliccia then quickly agreed but 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.199
 everything is dedicated to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 Sunday afternoon 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.680
 now also in service but he plays 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 against his old team mates 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.700
 and against his father who is a trainer of 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.680
 nac that kind for a healthy one 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.350
 rivalry between father and son 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 smiling photo bullying a lot 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 special one 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.140
 both against my father and against nac as 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.690
 against my friends so for that matter 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.579
 it is only beautiful that it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.559
 all together now when i am correct 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.329
 nice to experience in the player 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.039
 own son but not on the side of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.840
 then spend for me is can 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.370
 important but your team is working on it 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 with sewing 10 so what those are just 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.010
 not 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.850
 So though a dog because the three 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.289
 have to get it 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.680
 a little old teammates there I can 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.119
 all necessary text messages up and down and apps 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.799
 And of course that makes sense 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.360
 of course one 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.140
 but i think they want to get a shirt 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.229
 so 9 had a nice game again 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.110
 and certainly against friends and for example 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.100
 buys that will be in midfield 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.000
 become beautiful duels 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.000
 yes it will certainly be fun 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.020
 yes well that is of course also one 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.259
 do not compete duel of it will 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.340
 steps anyway and yes with the idea that you 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.549
 also the lost ones 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.009
 so he wants the parent 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.600
 are games that will always leave us 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.520
 steps yes i can imagine if you 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.869
 also extra or would jump over again 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.399
 to play for the public here 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.500
 because you are always popular 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.200
 and yes that transition that have the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.830
 people only you but I think you can 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.380
 yes I think my transition is correct 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.470
 well appreciated and that is only 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.780
 but beautiful and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.630
 I also have 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.549
 I did a stinking job and because of something 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.860
 beautiful from nac 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.200
 get it and so I can't 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.729
 wait again Sunday in the NAC 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.209
 stadium coming back to the public 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.830
 and what i say i am really looking forward to it 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.260
 whoever wins pity buy that 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.600
 my brother's playing well when i can and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.970
 and my dad own lab 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.190
 going in to have wild weeks 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.290
 your home about this match 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.390
 had a big topic on toria 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.870
 but there is no mercy in football 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.540
 I will put everyone to an almost 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.250
 drag in to get those three points 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.810
 take away when making how 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.209
 wait until need and wait my 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.780
 dad but yes the ridge fans will like it 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.390
 understand 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.920
 Gudelj was popular in Breda as worked 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.860
 a horse and pecked his occasional 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.239
 goal along and it is normal if 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.760
 someone at another club had that score 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.970
 he just is just my feeling 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.700
 again something else and I feel that I am not 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.180
 I have to hunt profusely when I draw 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.810
 old score and further you make it out 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.459
 against az to all matches on shows 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.530
 for a moment they are cooler than you are 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.000
 actually no party with you 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.810
 no, I smile with you as I keep getting better 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.540
 getting so I see 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.400
 developments only he still has 8 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.260
 work to achieve must not forward 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.360
 therefore the difference between az and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.030
 nac 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.380
 yes i would compare it a bit 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.380
 slightly better everyone 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.879
 of your bolivia then a group missed something 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.879
 ah let go through white flat terrain
