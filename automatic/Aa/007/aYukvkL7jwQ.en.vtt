00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.220
 or the expenses today I tell you that I have 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.980
 something in mind and for that I am saving 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.160
 a lot, that's why I made this tree 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.500
 Christmas that is really economical and very 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.840
 beautiful how can it be clear that I could not 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.180
 go unnoticed this date in my 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.560
 house we celebrate that jesus was born and that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 is the most important event 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.350
 for my husband and me, it's that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.869
 stay with me to see it and also cheer up 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.970
 doing it is really fine 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.189
 first I cut many many circles of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.739
 an inch and a half with my punch 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.179
 remember that all these materials I 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.940
 I sell them and that you can also 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:43.019
 subscribe to this channel by clicking here 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.819
 to get many more ideas and because 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.190
 we will also be raising many many 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:49.979
 many Christmas ideas and really you 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.569
 they will love second textures 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:56.760
 in each of the circles that I cut 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:58.679
 I cut approximately 100 and that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.260
 good will depend on the size you want 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.959
 your tree is a bit laborious but in 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.940
 it's really worth it and it 's an idea 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.200
 very 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.439
 And I put 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 these little circles fit 8 each time 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.049
 that textured this I will go through 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.719
 the machine textured now or in two 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.520
 hours and also with this machine also 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.030
 short but manuel talk about that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.789
 today I will explain to you that putting them in 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.840
 this folder and with these acrylics 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.729
 Adapters will give me a texture 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.439
 very nice on paper as my machine 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.569
 which is like a small die milestone already 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:42.509
 I had taught her in some videos how 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:46.740
 this and like this and I'm going to run the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.899
 she with turns pressed and perspective 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.380
 I already stayed now if I'm going to get the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.959
 of this fund that is very beautiful if to you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.360
 you liked these machines do not forget 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.039
 what can you ask me for information 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.380
 about her I had to leave my mail 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.479
 down here in the description box and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.479
 you can also enter facebook 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.060
 also very skill to buy these 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.310
 products 25 well esteban illÃ¡n I put them 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.450
 here all cloaked 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.370
 and that roll a cardboard that good this 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.050
 I bought it in the stationery of my house 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.720
 it's called paper cable and I was doing 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.450
 some tests and I'm going to put everything 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.130
 around these little circles first 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.830
 I'm going to cut it so that I stay very 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.300
 well and can hold the shorts 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.480
 sport very well and I'm going to cut up 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.090
 that can be paid perfectly and not 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.670
 is dancing and we run the risk of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.890
 that it falls and something very chaotic and 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.140
 strange or cure so it's good 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.890
 short of new and we're not very 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.400
 well and sure it's going to be 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.870
 if at some step I did not explain myself very well 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.090
 Well, do not worry, you can leave a 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.860
 comment here below and as fast 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.870
 what you can achieve with clothes is 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.600
 leave me an inbox on facebook that's more 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.790
 likely to answer honestly but 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.459
 well we're here now I'm going to 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.350
 paste with silicon I'm going to paste each one 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.390
 of these little circles around you 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.760
 worry if for example you like me 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.860
 you get out there a little bit there's no 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440
 problem just wait a bit to that 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.500
 since the silicon you start it and already 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.500
 it's perfect so I'm going to hit each one 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.830
 those from the base the top and so every 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.810
 each one are not so delayed the truth 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.650
 is that if you sit down and do it 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.810
 it's probably easy to take grams 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.660
 probably about an hour and a half 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.570
 You will have your most beautiful tree now 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.690
 I'm going to tell you something we already have in 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.100
 many Christmas ideas on video and then 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.690
 well it would be great that 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.610
 subscribe so you were at 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.620
 pending so you do not miss out on 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.420
 none of these terrific things if a 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.940
 you like crafts 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.090
 over if the escape and get out of the ordinary 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.400
 and people say you made me as self 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.700
 well this is the perfect place for you 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.760
 I'm done, I did it, it 's up and well 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.310
 only on the little tip that I put a 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.130
 circle cut as you are seeing 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.560
 color that I did here and last but 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.870
 I not only put him as a captain like that 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.880
 I stuck it very well with silicone and then I 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.000
 it seems that a number was already an idea 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.760
 I've been stamped and sealed, now it's 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.310
 ornamental thing that have the poinsettia 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.860
 and good shining very good Christmas 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.070
 I bought it in a store that I invented 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.680
 the without waves so it's close to where 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.990
 I live and the truth is that it cost me 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.200
 very cheap the equivalent of a dollar or 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.750
 something like that and I 'm not going to hit it here with 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.820
 silicon it seems to me that this is like 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.250
 perfect complement so that it does not help 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.510
 also you if more things finally to 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.300
 cover what I put the little 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.060
 the ornaments I'm going to put a circle that 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.120
 it's a bit wavy so they stick 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.500
 better and worse again with silicon 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.140
 it was amazing now this part of here 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.510
 Well, you see that what is 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.890
 down so I'm not going to cover it up with 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.380
 the same a little bit of the circle that 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.810
 that had cut short and nothing else 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.720
 a bit I put a little silicone 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.670
 and do not hit this is an idea that even 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.680
 so simple can be done with children 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.780
 if you do not have much space then good 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.820
 it is more than appropriate for you so 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.370
 important is that you do not stop celebrating 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.680
 Christmas because it's the most 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.080
 great story jesus was born and came 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.390
 to give him light food forgiveness for everything 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.190
 regale shine from behind I promise to clean it 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.140
 for the next occasion and so good 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.090
 dear characters this is all up 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.040
 today remember to tell me what you like with 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.040
 one hand up bye bye
