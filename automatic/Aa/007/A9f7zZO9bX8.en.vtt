00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.860
 Randomly in my group in contact and in 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.570
 In the end, yes, now is not to be with him 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.070
 play this composition as you remember 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.619
 i may not remember maybe 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.020
 do not know if I lose something 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.750
 I will have to adjust one of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.450
 their legends so here everything is bad on 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.710
 in fact if i win anyone 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.690
 not a quick goal and everything goes 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.360
 great i don't know how to play 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.619
 Andrei and I do not know what composition he is 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.490
 will play but I hope that he will 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.670
 play and so good to beat me 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.410
 even though this compound well, I still own a 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.270
 very guys i'm nervous if 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.310
 honestly despite the fact that everything is there 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.310
 players chic maybe except for 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.750
 defenders except some games from 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.149
 for sure it will be difficult because 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.979
 stress on me what a colossal 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.229
 I'll go led Andrei to play with him 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.910
 match so connect but with less 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.729
 he has a good team called 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.619
 I'm already in anticipation what is there 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.909
 part of the same scheme as mine 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.509
 four one two one two 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.610
 overall rating of 81 but is it really but it 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.909
 ardently but with interesting players and 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.909
 front damn power strength which 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.519
 can deal with me too and nervous 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.959
 even more honestly by the way gamepad 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.549
 and if something changed now the button 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.799
 Acceleration works for me absolutely 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.110
 ok so I have an excuse if 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.110
 that there will be no and here is the first 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.459
 moment at van der sar 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.940
 rushing all days on different begins this 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.610

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.180
 continue to play care for legends and hail on 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.299
 really gorgeous guys even if i 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.920
 despite the fact that I worry the game itself as 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.349
 as if moving without much 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.080
 participation they all do ferlin cross 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.739
 10 or Crespo against defenders 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.630
 or I sang well translates translate 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.340
 what kind of cool type translates 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.739
 connected cool just do it 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.560
 there is no blow 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.810
 or further howl cool kacha kacha kacha 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.410

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:26.290
 I love and crapspah 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.099
 Crespo so so so so not many tricks 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.440
 washed down 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.810
 and moons shot off howard attacking 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.790
 ok so much except him 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.730
 moment at the very beginning of the match like I'm afraid 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.170
 nothing my gate did not arise 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.700
 pretty good run smartly 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.130
 defending I don't know why many of him 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.900
 scolded he invented corrected want 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.360
 himself not particularly tall not particularly strong 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.670
 it seems to be like this 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.590
 very bad this lukaku this Neville a little 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.819
 protect things and the legendary not in 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.470
 okay and you oh oh oh how bad how 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.540
 bad it's all wow 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.130
 cleanly carried that now these bandage 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.350
 head off no rules and who is there lukaku them 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.940
 confusing to be honest before Lukaku were 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.579
 dreadlocks and at least somehow distinguish 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.470
 there was this here this very unpleasant 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.590
 This is very very unpleasant. 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.720
 this benteke this benteke bobby moore 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.359
 coped and neville during so first 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.130
 there are 10 and well then I had moments 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.210
 moments he had such stress 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.560
 the match turns out and live what I like 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.060
 Gary Neville God andreev with him 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.940
 dribble nikakuschy scheduled somehow 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.940
 keep it calm 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.690
 ok what else do we have gari Neville in 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.150
 center good chairs and feinberg feinberg 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.200
 amber hear amber and feinberg not 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.900
 it turned out and the cross for some reason broke through 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:48.550
 how this stock was such what it was for 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.680
 such pastor yet another van der Sar 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.210
 extremely good i like you though 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.639
 he composed for five minutes on laid 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.300
 once but it was just once except 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.940
 He helps Lord so quickly 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.210
 runs to listen to his real andrew ege 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.130
 gives you just catch your breath because 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.220
 pressure he is great and presents 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:14.650
 hall well it would seem okay he graduated 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.750
 this is how I was afraid of Carlos 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.370
 a little while I generally do not press 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.020
 did not click on the selection is not on the tackle 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.570
 it seemed just to do everything there myself 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.300
 this little carlos robert himself 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:29.170
 who pushed benteke well, like u 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.780
 Generally did what you need to cast fear 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.860
 but the veil would have been beaten faster. 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.190
 well took the ball and 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.410
 something thinks something there fnpr Lord 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.700
 as it seems not just the ball translates well, I 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.180
 just can't rejoice at it 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.420
 armchair armchair armchair armchair 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.440
 tiled stronger chair for some reason van 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.320
 der sar outlet van der sar 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.080
 1 normal fire there ricochet white 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.550
 corner last minute corner on 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.650
 last minute but what will i like 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.770
 athletics madrid no I will not be in anders 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.010
 two of the king's watercress seats held 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.169
 ball saw by turning almost by turning 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.060
 fucking empty gates were okay right 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.860
 it was just going over the center line 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.570
 then already beat half stories when you 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.220
 the ball flew into the net last 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.600
 minutes I think I can afford 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.390
 play this corner 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.580
 again filing for roberto carlos 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.730
 who over the penalty area and Carlos 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.060
 much to somebody head off probably 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.750
 now 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.400
 Well, fewer bodies nine 10 I won 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.290
 thanks to Andrei Grigoriev for the game she 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.510
 turned out to be saturated despite the fact that 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.780
 yet only 10 had plenty of moments 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.729
 that I have that and he was in the balance 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.830
 You can say the match turned out 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.350
 interesting to me he personally would be like 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.210
 what to make cutting but the first issue 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.550
 ends behind me get ahead 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.550
 at least 11 more such issues because 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.890
 that i have 11 legends and if i am 11 times 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.680
 they will lose in a row then yes they all 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.210
 fixed but nonetheless I start with 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.520
 victory I hope that I will continue further 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.610
 at least sometimes win in general okay 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.979
