00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.850
 and that 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.800
 four guys come soluble south we're going 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.719
 with pokemon of the week has been 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.100
 touched a sinister water type Pokémon 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.990
 which is that the wedding has induced 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.620
 third generation and in the evolution of 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.990
 cold fish 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.520
 let's see guys fraguan is a good 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.960
 pokemon as physical is very painful that 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.400
 I have to say it and I love it because 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.560
 over is sinister 12 thousand types 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.329
 favorites and I put it like knowing from are 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.399
 your skills we started with the first 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.779
 which is called a shell is a skill 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.430
 pokemon news the third generation 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.320
 that blocks the critical hits that is 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.940
 that you can not make a critical hit 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.590
 attract this is very important because 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.360
 we could many pokemon with 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.610
 periscope with skills that depends 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.830
 much of it is very good critic another 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.960
 thing is the strong cut skill 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.460
 stability in introduced in the third 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.320
 generation that prevents lower the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.420
 attack touch leave with intimidation to him 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.700
 it would not affect him at all that he does not 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.340
 lower the physical attack and skill 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.100
 hidden hidden ability that has ground 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.579
 It is adaptable for a bit mounted 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.230
 strong is this adapt will lead in the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.519
 fourth generation that increases power of 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.280
 attacks with those that are the same 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.880
 type of pokemon that makes it even more 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.189
 did not increase 50% 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.780
 with the attack is like disarming boat like 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.729
 to any game for whatever it is that 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.759
 You get this stick you hit a lot more 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.100
 strong as it becomes very much there is a lot 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.750
 danger in falling for stability like this 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.220
 that now let's see guys their stands 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.380
 but these are important to know if 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.549
 a Pokémon interests you or not in the team 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.929
 depending on who has or who has more 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.759
 or have less follow two courses 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.439
 statisticians the first thing that I have to 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.360
 Danish grau physicist who has kind 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.610
 63 that is to say that those who abound work 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.159
 a lot on pc is not a wild and then a 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.299
 have attack 120 this yes that is 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.520
 important in a wii physic but 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.709
 since 85 this is also important 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.049
 you will need whippet and then speed 55 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.909
 It has little speed but we know 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.349
 then I will say that you have access to a 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.840
 ability that allows you to duplicate that 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:56.330
 speed and then special attack 90 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.439
 eticket crowe dan would not be worth emilse 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.000
 of wii but could ignite attack as 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.830
 ice radio and the courses you have the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.090
 which did not come out of good function but 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.709
 You already know that I 'm not much of mixed 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.439
 I prefer a function if in physics 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.470
 the lizzy physics is the wikipedia pdf 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.880
 web and then special guys have 55 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.130
 careful the rays here can make you 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.450
 much more has been created before I suppose a 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.040
 little like to get out hitting hard 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.790
 endure physical blows pretty well 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.650
 but 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.290
 I can not stand very powerful blows of 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.829
 special attacks and now we're going to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.930
 guys with nature and skills 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.909
 and objects that I would put to micro aura 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.620
 agree first what is first 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.239
 guys I do not use the mixer at all 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.689
 we have said what I would put in athlete 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.609
 firm or cheerful and two objects life sphere 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:41.120
 from writing to the power 30 points 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.379
 the all attacks on this damage and eye 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.810
 that instead of life sphere can 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.939
 put them periscope is this object 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.560
 makes it possible for more critics to come out 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.510
 media is like that as something that does not 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.950
 has a normal Pokémon had a 12 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.859
 I do not know how many or how much 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.970
 would go up twice so let's go now 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.859
 with eps 6 in life 252 in speed 200 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.329
 in attack as you see the eps and what 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.439
 we focus all on attack speed and 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.010
 the six that are left over we put it in 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:09.519
 entity attacks we can put going 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.450
 put two there are some attacks that are more 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.160
 conservatives so to speak and others 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.160
 that are more devastating 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.660
 Avalanche avalanche or air strike 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.250
 to put two avalanche options 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.830
 air strike can put one of the two 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.650
 goal but I think I 'm worth it but it's a lot 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.540
 more effective than avalanche because because 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.970
 you kill those who can kill him 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.300
 crowe give the fight from me and a blow 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.890
 aerial with raised dragon dance that has 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.180
 access to dragon spear would not kill 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.680
 also the matter of the plants of 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.780
 kill the big bugs many years 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.670
 hit I think it's fundamental in 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.170
 crowe give then you have as I said the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.610
 second personal attack of dragon dance 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.770
 yes I have uploaded the attacks and 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.870
 with a speed or sword dance if 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.230
 you want euro for two the attack you have two 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.970
 jumps two kinds of post with crown vale 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.680
 then you have water-type attacks that 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.890
 they receive being have two as said one 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.230
 a quiet hits priority plus one but hits 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.660
 more loose than hammering not both 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.480
 first or one or the other is worth it because we 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.180
 we are not cool like they are not spending two 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.620
 holes in two water attacks not quieted 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.750
 Mark martínez sticks much more 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.220
 strong and hits more critical than quiet 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.540
 but kuyt has loss plus one and hits 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.250
 also the string of Viennese water 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.739
 and as a fourth attack and last we have 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.940
 two options also disarm an attack 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.740
 which is very fashionable now because it removes 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.419
 the object of hit the double damage if you have 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.650
 people equipped over you receive tap and 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.270
 we remove another rival is very very 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.070
 important very good is attack or tac 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.050
 shady have receive is open could 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.630
 of critical blow that means that if 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.060
 you put avalanche dragon dance attacks to 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.669
 quiet and disarm is very very cool but if 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.280
 you put aerial blow dance of some dance 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.289
 sword quieted teachers hammer 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.490
 minus a shine by changing air blow 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.680
 by avalanche is also very good and 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.030
 then the object if you go to critics like 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.710
 artie that cited shady interests more 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.479
 for the periscope but if you go to what 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.099
 better attacks a little looser as a 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.500
 remove and disarm you can put lives 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.599
 out to boost their attacks guys 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.680
 this is caudal is a bit very good and I 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.389
 love this pokemon 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.370
