00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 yes 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.380
 very good to all people how is it 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.110
 tito if you inquire or if I'm in failure 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.189
 today we continue with the sixth episode 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:28.090
 of the series roa two 50 cooperative in 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.910
 the rise and well well a little summary of 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.070
 the other 25 rounds worth we have everything 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.800
 what we absolutely need everything 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.680
 to raise rounds all the advantages the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.629
 necessary weapons and monkeys and good 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.309
 both players we already had everything 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.570
 necessary here you have seen a part 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.670
 with a skull and with the kabul and good 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.739
 have said for the comments that because 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.230
 wore line without the peephole yes 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.230
 had improved several times I forgot 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.030
 say it in the previous episode and if it is 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.730
 true that in the improvement of several times 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.460
 simply this is already taste is worth but to 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.860
 I am quite comfortable enough 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.900
 more comfortable to wear the n 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.810
 Well, without a peephole, I have more vision 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.220
 for my taste it is worth and I do not know anymore customs 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.710
 of each custom in the multiplayer 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.080
 as you see yourself more comfortable worth 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.640
 if you have extra pasta like it was my 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.860
 Well, well, the best of several 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.330
 times until I touched his peephole and the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.920
 it was really good for me 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.229
 well you have seen the amount of 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.110
 clemons that we have with placed by 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.630
 there I also have to say that this is a 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.750
 super-fast map in the sense that 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.570
 in the low rounds we will play a 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.170
 amount of amazing bonuses or 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.380
 be amazing and the truth that is a 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.900
 bargain I do not know why it will be perhaps for the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.330
 speed of the weapon with which we put as 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.780
 in the blender but the truth is that it is 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.500
 one pass and it goes up very fast and good 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.420
 what else I also have to tell you about this 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.970
 same subject of the bonuses that the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.850
 you can control quite a lot 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.340
 easy be clear that you are always going to 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.290
 get a maximum of four bonuses 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.610
 They worth a round is four 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.220
 unifications and always 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.550
 in about 12 where you can touch us 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.470
 another bonus extra but good that 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.540
 it is separately explained in a video that 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.430
 I have about the bonuses that 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.700
 you have for my channel if you want it but 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.550
 well I feel that I would be interested to 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.460
 this time and nothing 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.370
 forgive me you see that there is also a 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.930
 amount of ammunition is amazing 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.549
 simply amazing and nothing 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.890
 The truth is that you do not have to 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.390
 worry a lot about the blender in 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.579
 this round when going down because it's going to 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.090
 need to change it for nothing unless 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.650
 that you give any nonsense and well you see 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.689
 there that all the zombies are left 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.670
 caught right there where he fired this 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.069
 last shot that's the best area to 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.349
 shoot because that 's where we're least going to 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.120
 bother the puddles and good this 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.879
 always talking in the event that 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.819
 let's have the weapon in weapons without patching 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.150
 ok we're still here we go to the 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.950
 round 29 already with the bichejos these that 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.230
 We come this round has left him 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.930
 absolutely whole simply by the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.700
 topic that very fast in the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.230
 previous episode you saw that we took the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.739
 seventh ability simply to 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.329
 demonstrate how it is already demonstrated in many 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.980
 other sites that there is not a section 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.169
 skill and nothing here simply 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.840
 using the blender since they give us 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.280
 ammunition then good to pass the round 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.460
 slightly faster then we shoot 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.280
 a little the era and nothing of 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.950
 as I say leave it whole and going to see 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.110
 that does not have 100% accuracy 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.340
 Logically, they do not give us any type 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.830
 of drink 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.680
 simply in the bonus of the 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.710
 ammunition and we have it so nothing we go 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.250
 to jump already to round 30 last round 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.810
 of this is this episode and nothing starting 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.210
 of round 30 is already growing 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.630
 slightly more the support does not 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.940
 here you see the skull as I say is the 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.380
 host we put on our site that 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.450
 the truth that works quite well 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.210
 as you already know to control these two 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.739
 response while the second player 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.410
 can perfectly control that of the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.110
 box and nothing and killing pretty fast 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.450
 going through the rounds pretty fast and 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.820
 good from more or less on the 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.770
 round 30 35 I think you can already 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.510
 use without problems in blender if 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.580
 you want to go pretty fast maybe not 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.430
 you can make enough chains 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.290
 long here where the hole because not 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.070
 it is fast reformed as is the Chinese 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.240
 but good if you do the 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.100
 trains as they call it in james english 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.230
 what it is to gather zombies if you do 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.150
 pretty good, well, I assure you that 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.880
 you can make quite long chains 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.470
 there you have seen that he has fired in the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.810
 site more or less taking risks as 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.550
 is where more zombies come to us and it's from 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.310
 the best chains are made there beige 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.160
 and nothing like I say more or less about 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.520
 round 30 can be done pretty well and 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.290
 nothing this has been the sixth episode and 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.130
 see you in the next one so nothing 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.130
 until the next people
