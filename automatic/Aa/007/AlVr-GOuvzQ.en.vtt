00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
system is fair I mean it's just when you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.739 
system is fair I mean it's just when you
set<00:01:07.219> the<00:01:07.429> rules<00:01:07.579> and<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.179> stick<00:01:08.569> with

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
set the rules and then you stick with

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.340

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
into the candidate no I think that now

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.129 
into the candidate no I think that now
everyone<00:01:18.829> has<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.159> decent<00:01:19.429> chance<00:01:19.899> this<00:01:20.899> for

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
everyone has a decent chance this for

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:25.359 
everyone has a decent chance this for
sure<00:01:21.319> I<00:01:21.590> mean<00:01:21.829> there<00:01:22.639> are<00:01:22.789> like<00:01:23.649> 18<00:01:24.649> places<00:01:24.979> in

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
sure I mean there are like 18 places in

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.149 
sure I mean there are like 18 places in
the<00:01:25.549> Grand<00:01:25.819> Prix<00:01:26.029> and<00:01:26.270> then<00:01:27.049> ok<00:01:27.859> if<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.100> are

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
the Grand Prix and then ok if you are

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.370 
the Grand Prix and then ok if you are
not<00:01:28.429> there<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.909> can<00:01:29.119> still<00:01:29.389> qualify<00:01:29.599> from<00:01:30.229> the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
not there you can still qualify from the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.410 
not there you can still qualify from the
World<00:01:30.560> Cup<00:01:30.770> there<00:01:30.950> are<00:01:31.099> two<00:01:31.249> places<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:31.909> think

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
World Cup there are two places I think

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.539 
World Cup there are two places I think
before<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:33.049> was<00:01:33.259> much<00:01:33.499> more<00:01:33.770> difficult<00:01:33.829> to

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
before it was much more difficult to

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.940 
before it was much more difficult to
qualify<00:01:35.029> for<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.810> candidates<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.619> the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
qualify for the candidates the the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.649 
qualify for the candidates the the
countries<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.399> are<00:01:37.549> bidding<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.029> host<00:01:38.060> that

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
countries that are bidding to host that

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.690 
countries that are bidding to host that
that<00:01:38.959> might<00:01:39.139> have<00:01:39.349> a<00:01:39.380> wild<00:01:39.979> card<00:01:40.249> do<00:01:40.429> you<00:01:40.520> think

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
that might have a wild card do you think

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.980 
that might have a wild card do you think
that<00:01:40.819> is<00:01:40.939> an<00:01:41.029> advantage<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:41.479> players<00:01:41.810> from

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
that is an advantage to players from

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.219 
that is an advantage to players from
those<00:01:42.200> countries<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:43.490> mean<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.359> the<00:01:44.599> already

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
those countries you mean in the already

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.169 
those countries you mean in the already

they want for one place so for example

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
if Russia hosts they might they might

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.149 
if Russia hosts they might they might
pick<00:01:55.789> you<00:01:55.999> but<00:01:56.659> do<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.899> think<00:01:56.959> it's<00:01:57.259> your<00:01:57.829> if<00:01:58.009> a

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
pick you but do you think it's your if a

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.349 
pick you but do you think it's your if a
player<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.549> from<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> country<00:01:58.999> that<00:01:59.239> isn't

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
player is from a country that isn't

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.969 
player is from a country that isn't
bidding<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.929> hosts<00:02:00.259> do<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.469> think<00:02:00.649> that's<00:02:00.859> a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
bidding the hosts do you think that's a

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.679 
bidding the hosts do you think that's a
disadvantage<00:02:02.679> okay<00:02:03.679> it's<00:02:03.829> probably<00:02:03.979> some

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
disadvantage okay it's probably some

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.990 
disadvantage okay it's probably some
advantage<00:02:05.689> but

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
advantage but

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.660 
advantage but
I<00:02:07.140> don't<00:02:08.140> know<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.229> think<00:02:08.320> it's<00:02:09.009> always<00:02:09.429> been

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
I don't know I think it's always been

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.210 
I don't know I think it's always been
like<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.330> there<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.660> one<00:02:11.230> wild<00:02:11.560> card<00:02:12.010> is

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
like this that there is one wild card is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.720 
like this that there is one wild card is
given<00:02:12.430> for<00:02:12.820> organizers<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.690> think<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:15.520> in

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
given for organizers I think as in

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.180 
given for organizers I think as in
pretty<00:02:16.030> much<00:02:16.180> every<00:02:16.900> time<00:02:17.110> there<00:02:17.350> was<00:02:17.380> some

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
pretty much every time there was some

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.370 
pretty much every time there was some
tournament<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:18.970> there<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.450> one<00:02:19.990> wild

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
tournament like this there is a one wild

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.190 
tournament like this there is a one wild
card<00:02:20.440> but<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.760> don't<00:02:22.270> think<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.810> big<00:02:22.990> deal

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
card but I don't think it's a big deal

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.860 
card but I don't think it's a big deal
and<00:02:23.680> what<00:02:24.520> about<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.850> selection<00:02:25.270> process<00:02:25.480> for

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
and what about the selection process for

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.360 
and what about the selection process for
the<00:02:25.930> Grand<00:02:26.170> Prix<00:02:26.470> are<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.800> happy<00:02:27.100> with<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
the Grand Prix are you happy with the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.740 
the Grand Prix are you happy with the
players<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.730> have<00:02:27.820> been<00:02:28.000> invited<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.660> do

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
players that have been invited and do

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.560 
players that have been invited and do
you<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.380> that's<00:02:29.709> working<00:02:30.010> out

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
you think that that that's working out

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.410 
you think that that that's working out
I'm<00:02:31.570> not<00:02:31.900> sure<00:02:32.140> what<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.850> system<00:02:33.850> actually<00:02:34.390> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
I'm not sure what is system actually I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.540 
I'm not sure what is system actually I
think<00:02:34.540> some<00:02:34.990> players<00:02:35.290> go<00:02:35.530> buy<00:02:35.740> rating<00:02:35.950> some

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
think some players go buy rating some

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.050 
think some players go buy rating some
from<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.150> World<00:02:37.360> Cup<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.130> then<00:02:39.130> I'm<00:02:39.700> not<00:02:39.910> sure

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
from the World Cup and then I'm not sure

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.010 
from the World Cup and then I'm not sure
how<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.330> rest<00:02:40.690> are<00:02:41.290> decided<00:02:41.950> think<00:02:42.489> maybe<00:02:42.700> the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
how the rest are decided think maybe the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.290 
how the rest are decided think maybe the
service<00:02:44.020> there<00:02:44.800> are<00:02:44.830> slightly<00:02:45.160> too<00:02:45.550> many<00:02:45.790> wild

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
service there are slightly too many wild

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.500 
service there are slightly too many wild
cards<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.840> for<00:02:50.590> kids<00:02:50.830> which<00:02:51.610> whatever<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.330> is

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
cards but for kids which whatever it is

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.550 
cards but for kids which whatever it is
I<00:02:53.290> think<00:02:54.100> unfortunately<00:02:54.550> there<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.450> not<00:02:55.630> too

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
I think unfortunately there is not too

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.979 
I think unfortunately there is not too
much<00:02:56.860> interest<00:02:57.760> from<00:02:58.000> organisers<00:02:58.959> to

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
much interest from organisers to

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.850 
much interest from organisers to
organise<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.860> Grand<00:03:00.190> Prix<00:03:00.400> series<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:01.860> sort

now in chess I mean it's like everything
is<00:03:48.730> quite<00:03:49.120> good<00:03:49.420> but<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.560> just<00:03:50.829> finish<00:03:51.549> at

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
is quite good but it can just finish at

money<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.140> think<00:04:38.880> it's<00:04:40.320> not<00:04:41.320> at<00:04:41.530> all<00:04:41.680> out<00:04:41.920> of

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
money so I think it's not at all out of

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.880 
money so I think it's not at all out of
the<00:04:42.520> realm<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:43.090> possibilities<00:04:43.930> but<00:04:44.650> somehow

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
the realm of possibilities but somehow

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.320 
the realm of possibilities but somehow
it<00:04:45.190> doesn't<00:04:45.760> happen<00:04:46.380> for<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.440> long<00:04:47.680> time<00:04:48.300> so<00:04:49.300> I

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
it doesn't happen for a long time so I

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.560 
it doesn't happen for a long time so I
I'm<00:04:50.140> not<00:04:50.380> sure<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.740> will<00:04:50.890> happen<00:04:51.160> but<00:04:52.030> but<00:04:52.540> I

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
I'm not sure it will happen but but I

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.080 
I'm not sure it will happen but but I
think<00:04:52.900> if<00:04:53.050> there<00:04:53.260> is<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.560> real<00:04:53.740> chance<00:04:54.060> well<00:04:55.060> I

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
think if there is a real chance well I

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.970 
think if there is a real chance well I
