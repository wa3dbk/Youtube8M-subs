I'm<00:00:46.680> gonna<00:00:46.800> talk<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.430> innervation<00:00:47.879> for

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I'm gonna talk about the innervation for

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.020 
I'm gonna talk about the innervation for
those<00:00:48.840> muscles<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.800> deep<00:00:50.250> layer<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> the

anterior compartment and then I'm gonna
talk<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.570> three<00:00:55.020> muscles<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
talk about the three muscles in that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
talk about the three muscles in that
deep<00:00:56.820> layer<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.870> anterior<00:00:58.379> compartment

deep layer of the anterior compartment
of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.190> forearm<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> let's<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.680> into

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
of the forearm so let's get right into

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.870 
of the forearm so let's get right into
it<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.850> last<00:01:03.090> video<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:05.220> saw<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.670> we

it in the last video you you saw that we
went<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> didn't<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
went over or if you didn't see you can

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.859 
went over or if you didn't see you can

go and check it out we spoke about the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
go and check it out we spoke about the
superficial<00:01:10.799> muscles<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.150> anterior

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
superficial muscles in the anterior

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570

compartment<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.320> forearm<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.340> we're<00:01:14.460> not

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
compartment of the forearm so we're not

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190 
compartment of the forearm so we're not
gonna<00:01:14.790> pay<00:01:15.000> attention<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.630> those<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.140> I'm

gonna pay attention to those so I'm
gonna<00:01:16.350> start<00:01:16.650> peeling<00:01:16.890> back<00:01:17.310> layers<00:01:17.369> getting

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
gonna start peeling back layers getting

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.080 
gonna start peeling back layers getting
rid<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.840> some<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> those<00:01:19.799> superficial<00:01:20.610> muscles

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
rid of some of those superficial muscles

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
rid of some of those superficial muscles
and<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.750> want<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> really<00:01:22.500> quick<00:01:22.770> before<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
actually get to that deep layer I want

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
actually get to that deep layer I want
to<00:01:25.770> point<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.549> quick<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.180> this

to point out really quick that this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.140 
to point out really quick that this
muscle<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.340> flexor<00:01:30.090> digitorum

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
muscle is the flexor digitorum

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.039 
muscle is the flexor digitorum
superficialis<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.549> looked<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.360> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
superficialis that we looked at in that

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
superficialis that we looked at in that
previous<00:01:34.680> video<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.759> actually<00:01:36.030> gonna

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
previous video and I'm actually gonna

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
previous video and I'm actually gonna
remove<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.770> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.670> show

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
remove that one but I want to just show

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.990 
remove that one but I want to just show
you<00:01:38.909> how<00:01:39.060> broad<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.020> muscle<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
you how broad that muscle is this is the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.730 
you how broad that muscle is this is the
one<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.450> said<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.259> gonna<00:01:43.560> be

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
one that we said that is gonna be

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.429 
one that we said that is gonna be
underneath<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.939> other<00:01:45.270> muscles<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
underneath the other muscles of the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.770 
underneath the other muscles of the
superficial<00:01:47.130> layer<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.149> let's<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.540> rid<00:01:48.720> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
superficial layer so let's get rid of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.010 
superficial layer so let's get rid of
that<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.280> now<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.390> muscles<00:01:51.869> in

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that and now we can see the muscles in

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
that and now we can see the muscles in
the<00:01:52.049> deep<00:01:52.409> layer<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.340> anterior

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the deep layer of that anterior

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.539 
the deep layer of that anterior
compartment<00:01:54.860> now<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.100> terms<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
compartment now in terms of the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.999 
compartment now in terms of the
innervation<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.719> those<00:01:58.140> muscles<00:01:58.740> that's

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
innervation to those muscles that's

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.030 
innervation to those muscles that's
gonna<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.369> done<00:01:59.610> by<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.020> anterior

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
gonna be done by the anterior

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.069 
gonna be done by the anterior
interosseous<00:02:02.040> nerve<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.780> branch

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
interosseous nerve and that's a branch

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.399 
interosseous nerve and that's a branch
of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.590> median<00:02:04.860> nerve<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.329> remember<00:02:06.869> we

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
of the median nerve if you remember we

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.919 
of the median nerve if you remember we
spoke<00:02:07.619> about<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.979> cubital<00:02:08.399> fossa<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.720> had

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
spoke about the cubital fossa and we had

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.229 
spoke about the cubital fossa and we had
the<00:02:10.140> median<00:02:10.679> nerve<00:02:10.950> coming<00:02:11.430> down<00:02:11.670> into<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
the median nerve coming down into that

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.820 
the median nerve coming down into that
cubital<00:02:12.750> fossa<00:02:12.959> it's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
cubital fossa it's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.030 
cubital fossa it's
going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.190> continue<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.330> as<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.380> continues

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
going to continue on but as it continues

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.340 
going to continue on but as it continues
on<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.790> actually<00:02:18.030> gonna<00:02:18.570> give<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:19.080> some

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
on it's actually gonna give up some

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.800 
on it's actually gonna give up some
branches<00:02:19.920> one<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.430> those<00:02:20.610> branches<00:02:20.970> it's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
branches one of those branches it's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.590 
branches one of those branches it's
gonna<00:02:22.080> be<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.440> anterior<00:02:23.430> interosseous<00:02:24.420> nerve

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
gonna be the anterior interosseous nerve

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.110 
gonna be the anterior interosseous nerve
and<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.650> reason<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.070> call<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> anterior

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and the reason we call it the anterior

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540 
and the reason we call it the anterior
interosseous<00:02:27.900> nerve<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.350> because<00:02:28.800> right<00:02:29.100> here

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
interosseous nerve is because right here

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.940 
interosseous nerve is because right here
between<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.150> two<00:02:30.390> bones<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
between the two bones we have the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.670 
between the two bones we have the
interosseous<00:02:32.550> membrane<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.600> since<00:02:34.470> it's

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
interosseous membrane and since it's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.620 
interosseous membrane and since it's
anterior<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.490> membrane<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.300> going<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.510> be

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
anterior to that membrane is going to be

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.230 
anterior to that membrane is going to be
the<00:02:36.780> anterior<00:02:37.500> interosseous<00:02:38.310> nerve<00:02:38.340> which

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
the anterior interosseous nerve which

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.330 
the anterior interosseous nerve which
also<00:02:39.540> tells<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.260> there's<00:02:40.710> also<00:02:40.980> going

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
also tells you that there's also going

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.390 
also tells you that there's also going
to<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.550> posterior<00:02:42.500> interosseous<00:02:43.500> nerve<00:02:43.530> so

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
to be a posterior interosseous nerve so

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.640 
to be a posterior interosseous nerve so
that's<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.970> innervation<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.990> anterior

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that's the innervation the anterior

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.640 
that's the innervation the anterior
interosseous<00:02:47.490> nerve<00:02:47.900> which<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> branch<00:02:49.410> of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
interosseous nerve which is a branch of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.890 
interosseous nerve which is a branch of
the<00:02:49.920> median<00:02:50.430> nerve<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.270> if<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.450> remember<00:02:51.780> we

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
the median nerve and if you remember we

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.140 
the median nerve and if you remember we
said<00:02:51.930> most<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.250> muscles<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.850> anterior

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
said most of the muscles of the anterior

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.900 
said most of the muscles of the anterior
compartment<00:02:54.840> are<00:02:55.740> gonna<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.160> innovated<00:02:56.790> by

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
compartment are gonna be innovated by

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.170 
compartment are gonna be innovated by
this<00:02:56.970> median<00:02:57.600> nerve<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.680> here<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.730> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
this median nerve so here is the the the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.570 
this median nerve so here is the the the
median<00:03:00.600> nerve<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.110> via<00:03:01.430> specifically<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
median nerve but via specifically the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.020 
median nerve but via specifically the
anterior<00:03:03.209> interosseous<00:03:03.930> nerve<00:03:04.010> now<00:03:05.010> there<00:03:05.880> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
anterior interosseous nerve now there is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.430 
anterior interosseous nerve now there is
one<00:03:06.360> exception<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:08.700> our<00:03:09.440> this

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
one exception and that is our this

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.290 
one exception and that is our this
muscle<00:03:10.920> here<00:03:11.190> which<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.550> we're<00:03:11.820> gonna<00:03:11.940> look<00:03:12.150> at

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
muscle here which is we're gonna look at

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.090 
muscle here which is we're gonna look at
in<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.510> little<00:03:12.540> bit<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.050> that's<00:03:13.170> our<00:03:13.440> flexor

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
in a little bit but that's our flexor

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.020 
in a little bit but that's our flexor
digitorum<00:03:14.790> profundus<00:03:16.190> profundus<00:03:17.190> refers<00:03:17.790> to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
digitorum profundus profundus refers to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.870 
digitorum profundus profundus refers to
deep<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.530> deep<00:03:19.880> digitorum

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
deep and this is the deep digitorum

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.870 
deep and this is the deep digitorum
muscle<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.600> guess<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.900> can<00:03:22.050> call<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:23.370> that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
muscle I guess you can call it and that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.080 
muscle I guess you can call it and that
muscle<00:03:24.330> it's<00:03:25.110> gonna<00:03:25.320> be<00:03:25.530> innovated<00:03:26.160> yes<00:03:26.580> by

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
muscle it's gonna be innovated yes by

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.900 
muscle it's gonna be innovated yes by
the<00:03:27.890> anterior<00:03:28.890> interosseous<00:03:29.190> from<00:03:29.760> the

that is gonna be innovated by the
anterior<00:03:44.550> interosseous<00:03:45.209> nerve<00:03:45.239> which<00:03:45.720> makes

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
anterior interosseous nerve which makes

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.900 
anterior interosseous nerve which makes
sense<00:03:46.260> since<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.800> nerve<00:03:47.100> travels<00:03:47.430> right

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
sense since that nerve travels right

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.530 
sense since that nerve travels right
here

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
here

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.240 
here
but<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:50.870> median<00:03:51.870> half<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.650> nerve<00:03:53.010> or<00:03:53.190> the

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.550 
interosseous this one only half of it is
gonna<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.250> by<00:04:14.459> anterior<00:04:15.150> interosseous<00:04:15.600> from

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
gonna be by anterior interosseous from

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.500 
gonna be by anterior interosseous from
the<00:04:16.739> median<00:04:17.130> nerve<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.150> that's<00:04:18.359> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
the median nerve so that's the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.780 
the median nerve so that's the
innervation<00:04:18.810> now<00:04:19.650> let's<00:04:20.130> talk<00:04:20.340> about<00:04:20.400> what

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
innervation now let's talk about what

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.760 
innervation now let's talk about what
the<00:04:20.910> muscles<00:04:21.330> are<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.840> first<00:04:22.109> one<00:04:22.350> we<00:04:22.500> already

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
the muscles are the first one we already

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.610 
the muscles are the first one we already
looked<00:04:23.370> at<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.450> our<00:04:24.690> flexor

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
looked at and that is our flexor

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.629 
looked at and that is our flexor
digitorum<00:04:26.370> profundus

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
digitorum profundus

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.320 
digitorum profundus
this<00:04:28.259> digitorum<00:04:29.610> usually<00:04:30.610> when<00:04:30.909> you<00:04:31.030> see<00:04:31.180> that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
this digitorum usually when you see that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330 
this digitorum usually when you see that
digitorum<00:04:31.840> well<00:04:32.439> whenever<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:33.009> see<00:04:33.159> that

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
digitorum well whenever you see that

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.739 
digitorum well whenever you see that
digitorum<00:04:33.789> when<00:04:34.030> we're<00:04:34.150> talking<00:04:34.300> about<00:04:34.509> these

00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:34.749 
digitorum when we're talking about these

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:37.189 
digitorum when we're talking about these
muscles<00:04:35.289> whether<00:04:35.590> it's<00:04:35.860> superficialis<00:04:36.849> or

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
muscles whether it's superficialis or

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.989 
muscles whether it's superficialis or
profundus<00:04:38.199> you're<00:04:38.650> gonna<00:04:38.830> see<00:04:39.069> this<00:04:39.370> split

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:39.999 
profundus you're gonna see this split

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.869 
profundus you're gonna see this split
tendon<00:04:40.719> so<00:04:40.960> we<00:04:41.080> see<00:04:41.289> these<00:04:41.499> multiple<00:04:42.249> tendons

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
tendon so we see these multiple tendons

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.619 
tendon so we see these multiple tendons
going<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.259> individual<00:04:45.009> digits<00:04:45.729> that<00:04:46.419> is

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
going to the individual digits that is

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.830 
going to the individual digits that is
our<00:04:46.900> flexor<00:04:47.710> digitorum<00:04:48.340> profundus

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
our flexor digitorum profundus

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.450 
our flexor digitorum profundus
then<00:04:50.499> we<00:04:51.340> have<00:04:51.550> our<00:04:51.819> flexor<00:04:52.749> pollicis<00:04:53.529> longus

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
then we have our flexor pollicis longus

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.909 
then we have our flexor pollicis longus
that's<00:04:54.879> this<00:04:55.360> muscle<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.169> you<00:04:56.349> see<00:04:56.620> here

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
that's this muscle that you see here

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.760 
that's this muscle that you see here
pollicis<00:04:57.849> refers<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.360> thumb<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.289> you're

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
pollicis refers to thumb and you're

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.920 
pollicis refers to thumb and you're
gonna<00:04:59.919> see<00:05:00.189> that<00:05:00.310> we<00:05:00.460> have<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:01.240> tendon<00:05:01.900> that

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
gonna see that we have the tendon that

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.219 
gonna see that we have the tendon that
goes<00:05:02.409> over<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.129> then<00:05:03.729> inserts<00:05:04.360> on<00:05:04.569> the<00:05:04.900> thumb

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
goes over and then inserts on the thumb

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.679 
goes over and then inserts on the thumb
specifically<00:05:06.129> the<00:05:06.310> distal<00:05:06.849> phalanx<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.599> the

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:07.689 
specifically the distal phalanx of the

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.159 
specifically the distal phalanx of the
thumb<00:05:09.330> we're<00:05:10.330> not<00:05:10.449> gonna<00:05:10.569> go<00:05:10.750> into<00:05:10.870> all<00:05:10.960> the

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
thumb we're not gonna go into all the

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.350 
thumb we're not gonna go into all the
origins<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:11.800> insertions<00:05:11.919> you<00:05:12.849> can<00:05:13.000> go<00:05:13.180> back

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
origins and insertions you can go back

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.059 
origins and insertions you can go back
to<00:05:13.509> the<00:05:13.689> the<00:05:14.080> website<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.740> I'll<00:05:14.830> talk<00:05:15.039> about

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
to the the website and I'll talk about

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.219 
to the the website and I'll talk about
that<00:05:15.370> at<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.550> end<00:05:15.699> to<00:05:16.150> get<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.719> information

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
that at the end to get that information

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.409 
that at the end to get that information
so<00:05:17.770> those<00:05:17.919> are<00:05:18.099> the<00:05:18.189> first<00:05:18.430> two<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.819> the<00:05:19.180> three

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
so those are the first two of the three

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.179 
so those are the first two of the three
muscles<00:05:19.839> so<00:05:20.139> we<00:05:20.259> only<00:05:20.409> have<00:05:20.589> one<00:05:20.620> where<00:05:20.979> to<00:05:21.039> go

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:21.189 
muscles so we only have one where to go

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.159 
muscles so we only have one where to go
right<00:05:21.219> and<00:05:21.610> in<00:05:22.060> order<00:05:22.360> to<00:05:22.479> see<00:05:22.629> that<00:05:22.659> one<00:05:23.020> we

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
right and in order to see that one we

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.159 
right and in order to see that one we
have<00:05:23.319> to<00:05:23.560> actually<00:05:24.310> dig<00:05:24.639> a<00:05:24.669> little<00:05:24.909> deeper<00:05:25.569> we

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
have to actually dig a little deeper we

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.679 
have to actually dig a little deeper we
remove<00:05:26.620> those<00:05:26.919> layers<00:05:27.279> and<00:05:27.520> then<00:05:28.029> we<00:05:28.210> see<00:05:28.479> we

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:28.689 
remove those layers and then we see we

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:33.450 
remove those layers and then we see we
have<00:05:28.719> our<00:05:30.689> pronator<00:05:31.830> quadratus<00:05:32.830> which<00:05:33.279> is

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
have our pronator quadratus which is

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.600 
have our pronator quadratus which is
this<00:05:34.020> kind<00:05:35.020> of<00:05:35.110> flat<00:05:35.469> muscle<00:05:36.129> that<00:05:36.250> you<00:05:36.400> see

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
this kind of flat muscle that you see

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.779 
this kind of flat muscle that you see
going<00:05:37.000> between<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.770> ulna<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.699> the

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
going between the the ulna and the

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.079 
going between the the ulna and the
radius<00:05:40.089> so<00:05:40.960> it's<00:05:41.110> running<00:05:41.830> down<00:05:42.089> laterally

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.089 
radius so it's running down laterally

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.929 
radius so it's running down laterally
and<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:44.740> little<00:05:44.979> inferiorly

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
and a little inferiorly

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.899 
and a little inferiorly
it's<00:05:46.839> going<00:05:47.349> from<00:05:47.529> the<00:05:47.620> ulna<00:05:48.219> to<00:05:48.399> the<00:05:48.520> radius

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
it's going from the ulna to the radius

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.010 
it's going from the ulna to the radius
and<00:05:49.089> that<00:05:49.419> is<00:05:49.659> your<00:05:50.020> pronator<00:05:51.180> quadratus<00:05:52.180> so

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
and that is your pronator quadratus so

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.809 
and that is your pronator quadratus so
that's<00:05:53.229> pretty<00:05:53.409> much<00:05:53.649> all<00:05:53.889> the<00:05:54.069> content<00:05:54.580> let's

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
that's pretty much all the content let's

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:56.969 
that's pretty much all the content let's
review<00:05:55.240> that<00:05:55.449> really<00:05:55.810> quick<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.500> innervation

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
review that really quick the innervation

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.480 
review that really quick the innervation
for<00:05:57.789> the<00:05:58.210> muscles<00:05:58.810> of<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.169> deep<00:05:59.409> layer<00:05:59.710> or<00:06:00.039> is

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
for the muscles of the deep layer or is

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.300 
for the muscles of the deep layer or is
gonna<00:06:00.849> be<00:06:01.089> mostly<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:02.310> anterior

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
gonna be mostly the anterior

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.999 
gonna be mostly the anterior
interosseous<00:06:04.180> nerve<00:06:04.210> which<00:06:04.930> is<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.229> branch<00:06:05.710> of

that<00:06:14.439> muscle<00:06:14.740> is<00:06:15.099> going<00:06:15.460> to<00:06:15.580> be<00:06:15.669> innervated<00:06:16.330> by

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
that muscle is going to be innervated by

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.980 
that muscle is going to be innervated by
the<00:06:16.629> owner<00:06:17.310> nerve<00:06:18.310> and<00:06:18.669> then<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.479> muscles

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
the owner nerve and then the muscles

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.929 
the owner nerve and then the muscles
that<00:06:20.139> you<00:06:20.289> find<00:06:20.620> in<00:06:20.889> this<00:06:21.129> deep<00:06:21.399> layer<00:06:21.669> would

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:21.939 
that you find in this deep layer would

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.300 
that you find in this deep layer would
be<00:06:22.089> number<00:06:22.479> one<00:06:22.719> we<00:06:22.990> have<00:06:23.020> our<00:06:23.310> flexor

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
be number one we have our flexor

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.749 
be number one we have our flexor
digitorum<00:06:24.819> profundus<00:06:25.349> number<00:06:26.349> two<00:06:26.649> we<00:06:27.430> have
