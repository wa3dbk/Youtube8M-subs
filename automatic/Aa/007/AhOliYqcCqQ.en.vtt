00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.610
 hello to her she kodit riders 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.759
 hi radium and today we are a little bit 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.859
 talk about the new version took 100 of 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.960
 fashion which is known to many 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.570
 which appeared a few years ago still 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.220
 on the beta version of the blade model, please 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.710
 pay attention to the motoblock neva 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.840
 orban yes and then it was ported already 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.640
 on the release version and only recently 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.150
 a few days ago came the long-awaited 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.589
 the port is on the warband 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.049
 what does it represent itself 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.820
 update what we should expect from him 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:52.420
 Well, of course, besides the opportunity to play 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.339
 already on the new version of the top 100 client on 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.129
 In fact , not so much but not 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.909
 less talk about it costs 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.460
 full video review 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.809
 I will not shoot on it with us 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.659
 video review true 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:09.040
 textual but sense of the form of captions on 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.080
 the regular version, and so I too seriously 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.939
 I think since after there is no shoot but here's one 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.030
 discuss changes discuss general 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.690
 trends of course possible and so for you 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.700
 up from the data and narrate about events 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.830
 middle earth 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.620
 books Tolkien Lord of the Rings and of course 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.080
 he is interesting to many fans how little 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.050
 tablets and this universe and therefore 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.500
 It goes without saying that this mod 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.070
 earned the popularity of many players and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.010
 deservedly because he has a mass 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.900
 interesting opportunities it is enough 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.160
 well- researched even said so 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.300
 This mod is one of the few that 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.580
 can really boast that 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.159
 he has almost finished his main 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.960
 parts actually in this lies and 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.880
 main feature is crap its updates 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.940
 because the developers at the moment 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.520
 already created all the scenes and created 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.330
 some boys armor for them and so on then 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.160
 There is basically a mod already ready 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.229
 so we all go out patches go out 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.200
 they are not so often they like 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.630
 rule though I add some 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.420
 elements of the new group for the most part 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.459
 they are, let's say, patches 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.010
 that is, various bugs and so 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.380
 Further for the same reason, in general, the mod 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.150
 could be called up to a certain 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.790
 moment with toning because 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.700
 the developers did not pay special attention 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.010
 for him so out for a discount I can say 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.080
 that he is serious enough of the last 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.769
 change was only a vision so 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.590
 morality in one of 3.2 some kind of patches 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.690
 and the rest is all well, not very strong and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.410
 walked into the process although of course I appear 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.720
 like green settings from mini mods tom 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.549
 number and created by the fans themselves 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.180
 there is a principle development after all was but 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:00.209
 not so significant so those who 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.209
 watched the unification change seriously 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.489
 surely could have noticed that 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.700
 owner in this direction was 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.160
 actually forget the actual patch on 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.140
 warp on the he is also nothing serious 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.900
 large does not wear well except for actually 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.269
 porting questions myself 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.110
 now we can take it on the Arbat of course 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.799
 wonderful 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.730
 nevertheless many probably donâ€™t know 9 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.239
 surprised but nonetheless it is not 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.030
 somewhat unpleasant fact note but in fashion 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.459
 we are greeted by the old yet old 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.870
 Models before the external scenes, that is what 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.060
 there was once a case on 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.220
 Czech she did not change on the one hand 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.290
 seems like a drawback because the graphics have 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.250
 old models 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.530
 weak weak texture 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.599
 generally weak with all its models 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.760
 the other side has it all that is us 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.530
 does not meet and mod on standard 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.510
 some cities and svar gang and so 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.670
 further like the same name plus and minus 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.920
 can be called for the most part patch 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.519
 makes the adaptation the gang cook corrects 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.090
 nick you bugs completes the installation system 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.250
 for a classic motoblock in principle 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.620
 change is still there so i wouldn't 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.489
 He said that everything is useless, but again 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.030
 already what time 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.799
 forever cheers guys warband needless 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.560
 sure that otherwise I would just not 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.870
 became sits on the video is 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.880
 tell us about the parties, well, except for the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.590
 that I have already voiced something old models 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.720
 this is what all the developers did 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.630
 nobody adapt then there is no bring 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.919
 there were a twisted worked out except 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.490
 that graphics all the same 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.610
 see you get in the classics because 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.680
 in arbok do not call and newer 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.450
 relatively new engine i.e. 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.789
 still some new at the gate at him 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.669
 present and so the graphics will be 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.820
 a little better + fixed generic 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.710
 shoals old versions of walker which I 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.200
 I think many have their time 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.330
 strongly enough because 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.450
 even though I could 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.320
 started on a special improved all 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.930
 matt 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.660
 plus specially loader rn launcher 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.120
 and looking at it I asked masses of jambs 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.180
 connected with the fact that even in the old 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.510
 she was a bike who was rescued by a barbarian 90 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.200
 price before this mod was ported 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.810
 they also went the way over say 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.400
 re- version of the bugs which another country 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.930
 can be corrected i.e. it is not 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.000
 critical bike that is not going anywhere 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.039
 go away they can be fixed 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.729
 I think they will be corrected by earnings 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.960
 they already promised a patch these bugs of course 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.849
 bothering but the future they hope now 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.039
 the game can periodically roll 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.990
 in particular when combined with the troops 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.199
 when batak pro is guaranteed to be 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.839
 I ask you to give bohemian capri first 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.020
 the company the first time I sat down to you 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:52.419
 I just lost my head Loch and many 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.270
 veterans and recognize that this is happening 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.309
 when driven by all sorts of mistakes is bad 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.129
 You appear in the process. 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:02.050
 returned errors you disappeared see this 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:04.779
 was associated with some kind of script which 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.969
 then it worked fine the whole is 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.849
 all the same mod which is nice to play and 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:12.219
 the most important thing here is truth over say 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.349
 that many chips that were present 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.839
 in arbo not intentionally blocked 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.179
 he fit the ideas themselves 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:21.219
 game development developers ie 

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:23.619
 here the hand itself, you do not see 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:26.409
 weddings this is not a system of muta but its not 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:28.599
 it was true the classic version that is 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:31.619
 those players who are used to the classic 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:34.209
 gameplay warband they are here 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:36.369
 somewhat lost so immediately 

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:37.089
 confirming that this mod which itself 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.129
 yourself in mind 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:41.079
 but definitely losing it is worth it 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:44.199
 what you haven't done yet on so 

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:45.909
 as they say bend recommend but with 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.839
 you were in the legs thanks for watching 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:48.839
 good luck to everyone
