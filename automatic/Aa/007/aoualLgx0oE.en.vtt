 private actually this is a tournament 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.260
 of 15,000 is only the first stage that 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.780
 it is the most the first thing that you have to 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.740
 start playing to find points 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.360

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.340
 they are playing here playing this tournament 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.780
 It suits them well or wins 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.580
 a match two games the girls that 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.770
 really do not have any kind of 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.780
 ranking this is the opportunity to 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.090
 improve and of course you win the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.110

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.400
 point was not big where 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.979
 none of these girls could access 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.200
 directly not by the good ranking 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.570
 I think it's an even level there, there's 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.479
 Yet there ranking from 240 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.040
 250 that is planted number 1 that for 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.900
 third a tournament of this category is 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.250
 very good is a good opportunity what 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.990
 good is that also in this time 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.030
 there are many tournaments in South America 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.070
 that is perfect for the girls 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.670

 a great opportunity for all and 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.520
 also for coaches because the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.810
 coaches are going to see what they have to 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.620
 make an effort and that they have to work 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.720
 so that the girls improve 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.519
 likewise the winner will take the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.260

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.910

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.080
 our youngest players 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.330
 The main objective is to develop and 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.340
 massify the tennis of Peru and give 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.400

 So for them we do it and for Peru 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.260
 important also the support of the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.120
 private company in this case that's the way it is 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.720
 is the private company has played a role 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.280

 So you need enough support and enough 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.780

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.310
