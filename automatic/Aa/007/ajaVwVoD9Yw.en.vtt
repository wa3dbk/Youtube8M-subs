hair from raising and opening think of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
hair from raising and opening think of
it<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.350> way<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.580> type<00:01:11.820> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it this way if you have some type of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
it this way if you have some type of
venetian<00:01:12.479> blinds<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.320> house<00:01:13.530> either

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
open and close well just think if there

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.460 
open and close well just think if there
was<00:01:19.979> some<00:01:20.310> type<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.880> weight<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.930> something
