that they would limit the content the
bad<00:03:36.459> news<00:03:36.730> especially<00:03:37.030> when<00:03:37.419> it<00:03:37.510> comes<00:03:37.629> to<00:03:37.780> me

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
bad news especially when it comes to me

bad news especially when it comes to me
and<00:03:38.109> this<00:03:38.169> has<00:03:38.349> changed<00:03:38.379> my<00:03:38.889> future<00:03:39.069> plans<00:03:39.370> is

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
and this has changed my future plans is

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.619 
and this has changed my future plans is
that<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.049> in<00:03:41.319> da<00:03:41.739> for<00:03:42.340> whatever<00:03:42.730> reason<00:03:43.239> will

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
that the in da for whatever reason will

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.080 
that the in da for whatever reason will
still<00:03:43.959> be<00:03:44.139> in<00:03:44.290> effect<00:03:44.379> this<00:03:45.129> means<00:03:45.579> that<00:03:45.760> I

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
still be in effect this means that I

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.080 
still be in effect this means that I
cannot<00:03:46.629> record<00:03:47.169> video<00:03:47.919> and<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.340> cannot<00:03:48.730> record

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
audio from the game means I can't stream

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.809 
audio from the game means I can't stream
it<00:03:52.690> either<00:03:52.870> I've<00:03:53.199> tried<00:03:53.889> to<00:03:54.099> seek<00:03:54.310> out<00:03:54.459> to

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
square enix see if I could maybe get

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.530 
square enix see if I could maybe get
some<00:03:56.410> permission<00:03:56.799> but<00:03:56.919> obviously<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.669> am<00:03:58.329> not

continue the stream otherwise i might

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.390 
continue the stream otherwise i might
eventually<00:04:35.260> just<00:04:35.470> turn<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.860> off<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.040> just

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400
