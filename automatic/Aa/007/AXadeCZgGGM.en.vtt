00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.730
 like everyone 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.959
 I take advantage because cyprien is trying 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.730
 to do some shopping you have it 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.030
 surely noticed I went home 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.440
 but I have the keys justin start the 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.740
 videos I just want because his 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.340
 coffee maker makes a lot of noise 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.660
 but yann riou good nothing to see but 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.879
 today we talked about glasses 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 and yes a few months ago I had to 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.839
 have it evaluate not my eyes I had to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.010
 simply buy glasses 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.929
 but it's still more so 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.699
 galley month games I do not need to 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.690
 wear outside so that's okay but 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.370
 for all those who wear them to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.249
 outside you will understand 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.659
 and I raised my personality I noticed 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.640
 pretty fast all I could have 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.039
 very bad nose and it's really 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.999
 unbearable and that's the crazy thing and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.999
 you can not do otherwise 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:01:02.280
 finally yes but it gives results 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:03.839
 pretty weird and zaÃ¼ what's that bah if I 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.420
 think my nose hurts you too 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.970
 break them the pearls such and do 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.300
 fly yellow and many other dangers 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:18.570
 of egg a game link just escaped mm 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.160
 they are broken but what a pity 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.050
 also when you come out of self mastery 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.420
 you give yourself a box but what is it 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.920
 that it is this box its rare in gt1 is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.590
 why break them but it can 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.270
 really be fatal when you how much 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.270
 the box with the music goods 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.900
 oh no me the thing that makes me happy 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 that I do at school and that I have to 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.540

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.760

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.060
 I forgot my glasses 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.130
 it's really bad but there is a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.620
 question to ask teachers and that there 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.250

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:59.260

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.340
