name of Gabby and the inspiration behind
this<00:01:04.760> design<00:01:05.180> are<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.960> vintage<00:01:06.410> amps<00:01:06.860> from

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
this design are the vintage amps from

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.150 
this design are the vintage amps from
the<00:01:07.280> 60s<00:01:07.730> and<00:01:07.880> 18<00:01:08.270> watt<00:01:08.480> marshall<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.200> also<00:01:09.920> a

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
the 60s and 18 watt marshall and also a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.480 
the 60s and 18 watt marshall and also a
vox<00:01:10.550> AC<00:01:10.850> 15<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:12.830> of<00:01:13.010> course<00:01:13.040> is<00:01:13.340> the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
vox AC 15 so this of course is the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.180 
vox AC 15 so this of course is the
bigger<00:01:13.729> brother<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.600> voxer<00:01:15.260> 18<00:01:16.010> which

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
bigger brother to the voxer 18 which

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.400 
bigger brother to the voxer 18 which
gabby<00:01:16.880> also<00:01:17.420> makes<00:01:17.660> so<00:01:17.869> this<00:01:18.020> has<00:01:18.200> got<00:01:18.380> a

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
gabby also makes so this has got a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.490 
gabby also makes so this has got a
little<00:01:18.650> bit<00:01:18.830> of<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.979> robust<00:01:19.430> sounding<00:01:19.940> amp<00:01:20.119> and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
little bit of a robust sounding amp and

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.200 
little bit of a robust sounding amp and
it<00:01:21.500> has<00:01:21.680> two<00:01:21.979> channels<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:22.580> it's<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.820> single

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
it has two channels but it's a single

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.300 
it has two channels but it's a single
channel<00:01:23.540> operation<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.320> can't<00:01:24.590> use<00:01:24.950> you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
channel operation you can't use you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.920 
channel operation you can't use you
can't<00:01:25.550> split<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.970> channels<00:01:26.360> together

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
can't split the channels together

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.170 
can't split the channels together
because<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.560> would<00:01:27.650> be<00:01:27.680> out<00:01:27.890> of<00:01:27.920> phase<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:28.670> you

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
because it would be out of phase so you

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.640 
because it would be out of phase so you
pick<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.479> chin<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.810> want<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.050> work<00:01:30.170> with<00:01:30.200> and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
pick the chin you want to work with and

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.800 
pick the chin you want to work with and
you<00:01:30.680> go<00:01:31.040> from<00:01:31.250> there<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.090> tube<00:01:32.300> complement<00:01:32.780> of

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
you go from there the tube complement of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.710 
you go from there the tube complement of
course<00:01:33.050> isn't<00:01:33.229> for<00:01:33.740> ELA<00:01:34.100> t4s<00:01:34.729> but<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
course isn't for ELA t4s but the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.630 
course isn't for ELA t4s but the
difference<00:01:36.140> between<00:01:36.560> using<00:01:37.010> these<00:01:37.400> two

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
difference between using these two

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.420 
difference between using these two
channels<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.240> preamp<00:01:38.780> tubes<00:01:39.080> now<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:39.860> the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
channels is the preamp tubes now on the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.650 
channels is the preamp tubes now on the
left<00:01:40.610> side<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.119> we're<00:01:41.360> going<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.509> be

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
left side of this we're going to be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.350 
left side of this we're going to be
basically<00:01:41.869> using<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.740> EF<00:01:43.039> 86<00:01:43.729> tube<00:01:43.970> which<00:01:44.179> is

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
basically using the EF 86 tube which is

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.810 
basically using the EF 86 tube which is
very<00:01:44.660> popular<00:01:44.929> in<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.530> early<00:01:45.560> vox<00:01:46.130> amps<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
very popular in the early vox amps and

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.460 
very popular in the early vox amps and
you<00:01:47.179> can<00:01:47.330> get<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.479> lot<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:47.750> character<00:01:48.289> out<00:01:48.440> of

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
you can get a lot of character out of

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.040 
you can get a lot of character out of
that<00:01:48.740> amp<00:01:49.070> over<00:01:49.789> here<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.450> have<00:01:50.570> more<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.899> the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
that amp over here we have more of the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.469 
that amp over here we have more of the
marshall<00:01:51.619> side<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.520> amp<00:01:52.670> which<00:01:52.910> uses<00:01:53.270> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
marshall side of the amp which uses a

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.950 
marshall side of the amp which uses a
12ax7<00:01:54.200> tube<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:55.520> side<00:01:55.759> is<00:01:56.060> more<00:01:56.869> of

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
12ax7 tube so this side is more of

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.650 
12ax7 tube so this side is more of
Marshall<00:01:57.410> this<00:01:57.800> is<00:01:57.950> more<00:01:58.160> Vox<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.880> there's

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
Marshall this is more Vox and there's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.090 
Marshall this is more Vox and there's
some<00:01:59.810> interesting<00:02:00.110> features<00:02:00.470> between<00:02:00.830> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
some interesting features between the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.880 
some interesting features between the
two<00:02:01.220> channels<00:02:01.700> on<00:02:01.940> this<00:02:02.660> box<00:02:02.990> flavor<00:02:03.380> channel

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
two channels on this box flavor channel

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.620 
two channels on this box flavor channel
the<00:02:04.280> controls<00:02:04.789> are<00:02:04.970> very<00:02:05.000> simple<00:02:05.450> you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the controls are very simple you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.570 
the controls are very simple you
basically<00:02:05.899> have<00:02:06.110> your<00:02:06.289> volume<00:02:06.500> your<00:02:07.340> tone

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
basically have your volume your tone

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.200 
basically have your volume your tone
control<00:02:08.060> there's<00:02:08.840> also<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.289> game<00:02:09.830> control<00:02:10.399> over

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
control there's also a game control over

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.240 
control there's also a game control over
here<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.660> there's<00:02:11.990> of<00:02:12.170> course<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.800> master

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
here and there's of course the master

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.340 
here and there's of course the master
cut<00:02:13.490> which<00:02:13.730> works<00:02:13.970> for<00:02:14.150> both<00:02:14.360> channels<00:02:14.750> so

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
cut which works for both channels so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.500 
cut which works for both channels so
what's<00:02:15.530> cool<00:02:15.740> about<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:16.310> channel<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.910> if<00:02:17.420> you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
what's cool about this channel is if you

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.080 
what's cool about this channel is if you
use<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.690> accompanying<00:02:18.290> foot<00:02:18.590> switch<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.940> can

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
use the accompanying foot switch you can

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.120 
use the accompanying foot switch you can
basically<00:02:20.330> set<00:02:20.840> two<00:02:21.140> different<00:02:21.710> types<00:02:21.950> of

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
basically set two different types of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.490 
basically set two different types of
gain<00:02:22.430> levels<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.780> just<00:02:23.960> plug<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.380> into

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
gain levels and you just plug it into

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.610 
gain levels and you just plug it into
the<00:02:24.680> back<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:26.060> disengages<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:27.350> gain

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the back so this it disengages this gain

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.650 
the back so this it disengages this gain
control<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.310> then<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.940> set<00:02:29.150> your<00:02:29.450> one

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
control and then you can set your one

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.450 
control and then you can set your one
getting<00:02:29.960> control<00:02:30.290> for<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.560> clean<00:02:30.860> sound<00:02:31.220> and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
getting control for a clean sound and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.050 
getting control for a clean sound and
then<00:02:31.880> really<00:02:32.420> drive<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.690> EF<00:02:33.200> 86<00:02:33.800> tube<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.910> as

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
then really drive the EF 86 tube so as

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.240 
then really drive the EF 86 tube so as
you<00:02:35.090> heard<00:02:35.330> before<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.810> got<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.110> very<00:02:36.410> jangly

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
you heard before I got a very jangly

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.550 
you heard before I got a very jangly
sound<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.850> then<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.330> kicked<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.930> foot

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560

which<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> 12ax7<00:02:48.230> channel<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.850> just<00:02:50.030> have<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
which is a 12ax7 channel you just have a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.910 
which is a 12ax7 channel you just have a
basic<00:02:50.570> tone

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
basic tone

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.460 
basic tone

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
control and your volume control so of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.930 
control and your volume control so of
course<00:02:53.530> as<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.980> turn<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.280> up<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.459> get<00:02:54.610> more<00:02:54.880> of

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
course as you turn it up you get more of

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.630 
course as you turn it up you get more of
a<00:02:55.480> crunchy<00:02:55.930> sound<00:02:56.140> if<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.500> turn<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.680> down<00:02:56.800> it's

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
a crunchy sound if you turn it down it's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910 
a crunchy sound if you turn it down it's
a<00:02:57.760> little<00:02:57.880> bit<00:02:58.030> more<00:02:58.330> clean<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.290> it's<00:02:59.620> got<00:02:59.890> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
a little bit more clean and it's got a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.610 
a little bit more clean and it's got a
nice<00:03:00.220> clean<00:03:00.670> character<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.440> back

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
nice clean character to it on the back

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.080 
nice clean character to it on the back
of<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.920> amp<00:03:03.069> we<00:03:03.190> have<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.340> contour<00:03:03.849> switch

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
of the amp we have a contour switch

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.390 
of the amp we have a contour switch
which<00:03:04.270> basically<00:03:04.630> rolls<00:03:05.620> off<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:05.950> low

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
which basically rolls off the low

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.250 
which basically rolls off the low
frequency<00:03:07.120> so<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:07.390> can<00:03:07.510> basically<00:03:07.630> down<00:03:08.020> the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
frequency so you can basically down the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.170 
frequency so you can basically down the
amount<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.560> low-end<00:03:09.069> you<00:03:09.250> want<00:03:09.489> from<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:09.970> back

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
amount of low-end you want from the back

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.000 
amount of low-end you want from the back
to<00:03:10.840> set<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.080> about<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.380> middle<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.770> pretty

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
to set it about the middle is a pretty

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.760 
to set it about the middle is a pretty
good<00:03:12.190> ideas<00:03:12.580> which<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.940> what<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.510> done<00:03:13.770> the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
good ideas which is what I have done the

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.130 
good ideas which is what I have done the
212<00:03:15.190> cabinet<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:15.880> really<00:03:16.390> well<00:03:16.569> designed<00:03:16.780> and

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
it also employs two celestion speakers

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.130 
it also employs two celestion speakers
an<00:03:19.600> alnico<00:03:20.349> blue<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.730> celestion<00:03:22.540> greenback

sweetness from the alico and you get the

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.840 
sweetness from the alico and you get the
nice<00:03:30.360> mid-range<00:03:31.360> from<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.260> greenback<00:03:32.850> let's

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
nice mid-range from the greenback let's

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.280 
nice mid-range from the greenback let's
hear<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.120> great<00:03:34.330> amp<00:03:34.540> let's<00:03:34.720> begin<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.140> the

right channel over here which employs a
12ax7<00:03:38.080> tube<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:39.010> got<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.459> dialed<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:40.180> about

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
12ax7 tube I got it dialed in just about

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.140 
12ax7 tube I got it dialed in just about
halfway<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.680> tone<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.010> about<00:03:42.459> halfway<00:03:42.790> as

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
halfway the tone is about halfway as

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.550 
halfway the tone is about halfway as
well<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:44.470> gets<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.769> real<00:03:45.130> nice<00:03:45.430> smooth

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
well and it gets a real nice smooth

00:03:46.560 --> 00:04:08.130 
well and it gets a real nice smooth
overdrive<00:03:47.560> let's<00:03:47.980> take<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.220> listen

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.540 

sticking<00:04:09.140> on<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.320> same<00:04:09.470> channel<00:04:09.830> let's<00:04:10.100> get<00:04:10.340> a

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
sticking on the same channel let's get a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.270 
sticking on the same channel let's get a
very<00:04:10.880> smooth<00:04:11.300> clean<00:04:11.870> sound<00:04:12.350> I'd<00:04:12.620> turn<00:04:13.010> down

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
very smooth clean sound I'd turn down

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.040 
very smooth clean sound I'd turn down
the<00:04:13.460> tone<00:04:13.670> all<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.000> way<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.480> pull<00:04:14.690> back<00:04:14.870> the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
the tone all the way and I pull back the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.110 
the tone all the way and I pull back the
volume<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.770> this<00:04:16.190> gets<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.459> really<00:04:16.910> nice

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
volume and this gets a really nice

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:53.150 
volume and this gets a really nice
texture<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.810> clean<00:04:18.230> here<00:04:18.680> we<00:04:18.769> go

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.740 

now<00:04:54.160> we've<00:04:54.400> moved<00:04:54.460> over<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.330> more<00:04:55.510> of<00:04:55.630> the
