00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
 obsessed with this game for a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.269 
 obsessed with this game for a
while<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.719> didn't<00:00:16.440> personally<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:17.039> much<00:00:17.250> of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
while I didn't personally see much of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.800 
while I didn't personally see much of
the<00:00:17.460> appeal<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.910> played<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.420> once<00:00:18.510> or<00:00:18.690> twice

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the appeal I played it once or twice

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.810 
the appeal I played it once or twice
thought<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.800> vaguely<00:00:20.039> irritating<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
thought it was vaguely irritating and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.880 
thought it was vaguely irritating and
uninstalled<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.660> however<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.320> seems<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.680> take

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
uninstalled it however it seems to take

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.670 
uninstalled it however it seems to take

that again out of interest to myself if

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.380 
that again out of interest to myself if
anybody<00:00:35.070> had<00:00:35.250> taken<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> flappy<00:00:36.210> birds

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
formula and sort of changed it around

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.229 
formula and sort of changed it around
maybe<00:00:38.430> made<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:38.910> bit<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.120> interesting

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
maybe made a little bit more interesting

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.530 
maybe made a little bit more interesting
things<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> first<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:42.390> can

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
things like that so the first one we can

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.750 
things like that so the first one we can
look<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.899> called<00:00:42.989> clumsy<00:00:43.440> bird<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.829> this

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
look at is called clumsy bird and this

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.369 
look at is called clumsy bird and this
is<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.450> little<00:00:45.690> bit<00:00:45.780> different<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.170> actually

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
is a little bit different it's actually

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.529 
is a little bit different it's actually
in<00:00:46.469> landscape<00:00:47.309> orientation<00:00:47.489> rather<00:00:48.210> than<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
in landscape orientation rather than the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.930 
in landscape orientation rather than the
traditional<00:00:48.750> portrait<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.789> got<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
traditional portrait one now it's got a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
traditional portrait one now it's got a
couple<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> fun<00:00:51.390> things<00:00:51.800> looks<00:00:52.800> very<00:00:52.890> much

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
couple of fun things looks very much

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.970 
couple of fun things looks very much
like<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.940> original<00:00:54.510> flappy<00:00:54.780> birds<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
like the original flappy birds and the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.880 
like the original flappy birds and the
premise<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.550> damn<00:00:57.420> near<00:00:57.660> exactly<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> same

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
premise is damn near exactly the same

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.680 
premise is damn near exactly the same
except<00:00:59.309> instead<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.940> ripped<00:01:00.270> off<00:01:00.449> Mary

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
pipes you've got trees and you tap to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
pipes you've got trees and you tap to
fly<00:01:03.780> through<00:01:03.960> obviously<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.369> cool<00:01:05.670> thing

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
fly through obviously now the cool thing

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
fly through obviously now the cool thing
about<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> she<00:01:06.930> has<00:01:07.110> online<00:01:07.290> play

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.000 
bird today we're going to fly this thing
and<00:03:42.769> as<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.489> can<00:03:43.580> see<00:03:44.440> it's<00:03:45.440> pretty<00:03:45.860> much<00:03:45.920> the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
and as you can see it's pretty much the

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.960 
and as you can see it's pretty much the
same<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.340> got<00:03:46.459> rocks<00:03:46.760> instead<00:03:47.510> of

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
same you got rocks instead of

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.330 
same you got rocks instead of
the<00:03:49.360> classic<00:03:49.720> Mario<00:03:49.900> tubes<00:03:50.380> or<00:03:50.680> pipes<00:03:51.010> you've

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
the classic Mario tubes or pipes you've

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.830 
the classic Mario tubes or pipes you've
got<00:03:51.460> load<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.730> coins<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.480> aim<00:03:52.600> is<00:03:52.630> to

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
got load of coins and the aim is to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.910 
got load of coins and the aim is to
collect<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.110> coins<00:03:53.260> it's<00:03:53.590> actually<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.830> little

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
collect the coins it's actually a little

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.550 
collect the coins it's actually a little
bit<00:03:54.100> easier<00:03:54.490> to<00:03:54.610> control<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:55.320> think<00:03:56.320> than<00:03:56.440> the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
bit easier to control I think than the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.440 
bit easier to control I think than the
original<00:03:56.920> although<00:03:57.490> when<00:03:57.670> he<00:03:57.760> nose<00:03:57.970> dive<00:03:58.210> your

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
original although when he nose dive your

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.570 
original although when he nose dive your
cases<00:03:58.870> seem<00:03:58.960> to<00:03:59.110> know<00:03:59.290> dive<00:03:59.590> sort<00:04:00.520> of

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
cases seem to know dive sort of

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.890 
cases seem to know dive sort of
indefinitely<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.360> if<00:04:01.420> you<00:04:01.510> pick<00:04:01.660> up<00:04:01.750> enough

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
indefinitely so if you pick up enough

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.160 
indefinitely so if you pick up enough
speed<00:04:01.930> when<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.470> go<00:04:02.560> down<00:04:02.770> seemingly<00:04:03.460> tapping

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
speed when you go down seemingly tapping

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.330 
speed when you go down seemingly tapping
the<00:04:05.170> flat<00:04:05.380> button<00:04:05.680> does<00:04:05.800> not<00:04:05.890> seem<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.130> do

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
the flat button does not seem to do

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.100 
the flat button does not seem to do
anything<00:04:06.490> but<00:04:06.760> this<00:04:06.880> one's<00:04:07.090> decent<00:04:07.510> enough<00:04:07.840> as

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
anything but this one's decent enough as

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.250 
anything but this one's decent enough as
these<00:04:08.470> clones<00:04:08.830> kind<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.310> come<00:04:09.810> yeah<00:04:10.810> grap<00:04:11.080> it's

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
these clones kind of come yeah grap it's

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.810 
these clones kind of come yeah grap it's
kind<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.440> nice<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.860> like<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.490> fight<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:12.730> can

lock characters though some of them are
ridiculously<00:04:14.800> expensive<00:04:15.359> next<00:04:16.359> one<00:04:16.480> is<00:04:16.630> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
ridiculously expensive next one is the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.520 
ridiculously expensive next one is the
trippy<00:04:18.430> trippy<00:04:19.090> one<00:04:19.450> this<00:04:19.989> is<00:04:20.109> called<00:04:20.260> floppy

trippy trippy one this is called floppy
bird<00:04:20.769> there's<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.190> couple<00:04:21.340> called<00:04:21.670> floppy<00:04:21.880> bird

I'll<00:04:23.050> put<00:04:23.200> links<00:04:23.230> in<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.560> description<00:04:24.010> sort

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
I'll put links in the description sort

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.650 
I'll put links in the description sort
of<00:04:24.250> in<00:04:24.340> chronological<00:04:24.700> order<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.540> know

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
of in chronological order so you know

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.940 
of in chronological order so you know
which<00:04:25.810> is<00:04:25.960> which<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:27.700> one<00:04:28.200> is<00:04:30.150> yeah<00:04:31.950> it's

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
which is which this one is yeah it's

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.270 
which is which this one is yeah it's
more<00:04:34.170> strange<00:04:35.170> than<00:04:35.410> anything<00:04:35.770> else<00:04:35.920> it<00:04:36.130> looks

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
more strange than anything else it looks

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.910 
more strange than anything else it looks
very<00:04:36.490> much<00:04:36.610> like<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.880> original<00:04:37.770> except<00:04:38.770> your

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
very much like the original except your

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.970 
very much like the original except your
pink<00:04:39.220> pipes<00:04:40.169> but<00:04:41.169> I<00:04:41.200> have<00:04:41.320> no<00:04:41.470> idea<00:04:41.620> what<00:04:41.890> the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
pink pipes but I have no idea what the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.110 
pink pipes but I have no idea what the
actual<00:04:42.100> thing<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.760> you're<00:04:42.850> flying

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
actual thing is that you're flying

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.970 
actual thing is that you're flying
around<00:04:43.330> with<00:04:43.540> it<00:04:44.169> most<00:04:44.320> definitely<00:04:44.470> isn't<00:04:44.919> a

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
around with it most definitely isn't a

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.560 
around with it most definitely isn't a
bird<00:04:45.190> I<00:04:45.400> think<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.640> looks<00:04:45.669> more<00:04:45.970> similar<00:04:46.450> to

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
bird I think it looks more similar to

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.470 
bird I think it looks more similar to
the<00:04:46.690> original<00:04:46.750> one<00:04:47.850> but<00:04:48.850> again<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.180> original

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
the original one but again the original

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
the original one but again the original
wouldn't<00:04:49.660> didn't<00:04:49.840> look<00:04:49.870> like<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.110> bird<00:04:50.320> anyway

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
wouldn't didn't look like a bird anyway

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.310 
wouldn't didn't look like a bird anyway
so<00:04:50.710> that<00:04:51.040> didn't<00:04:51.250> really<00:04:51.430> uh<00:04:52.140> didn't<00:04:53.140> really

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
so that didn't really uh didn't really

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.440 
so that didn't really uh didn't really
make<00:04:53.410> anything<00:04:53.680> clearer<00:04:54.070> ok<00:04:54.760> that's<00:04:55.210> floppy

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
make anything clearer ok that's floppy

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.030 
make anything clearer ok that's floppy
bird<00:04:55.690> as<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:56.020> can<00:04:56.140> see<00:04:56.320> basically<00:04:56.680> exactly

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
bird as you can see basically exactly

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.800 
bird as you can see basically exactly
the<00:04:57.220> same<00:04:57.430> as<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.669> original<00:04:57.910> just<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.660> bit

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
the same as the original just a bit

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.930 
the same as the original just a bit
Pinker<00:04:59.230> they<00:05:00.160> would<00:05:00.340> another<00:05:00.550> one<00:05:00.730> called

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
Pinker they would another one called

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.050 
Pinker they would another one called
floppy<00:05:01.210> bird<00:05:01.950> this<00:05:02.950> one<00:05:03.220> again<00:05:03.520> looks<00:05:03.970> very

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
floppy bird this one again looks very

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.990 
floppy bird this one again looks very
very<00:05:04.300> similar<00:05:04.510> to<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:06.310> original<00:05:06.370> has<00:05:06.880> the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
very similar to the original has the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.210 
very similar to the original has the
same<00:05:07.150> source<00:05:07.390> scrolling<00:05:07.810> effect<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.470> you've

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
same source scrolling effect and you've

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.280 
same source scrolling effect and you've
got<00:05:09.280> married<00:05:09.610> pipes<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.150> true<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:10.990> form<00:05:11.050> this

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
got married pipes and true to form this

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.980 
got married pipes and true to form this
one<00:05:11.470> is<00:05:12.100> impossible<00:05:12.810> really<00:05:13.810> hard

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
one is impossible really hard

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.570 
one is impossible really hard
this<00:05:14.140> one<00:05:14.350> anyway<00:05:14.770> max<00:05:14.919> was<00:05:15.100> nothing<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.550> that

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
this one anyway max was nothing and that

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.790 
this one anyway max was nothing and that
took<00:05:15.760> me<00:05:15.850> a<00:05:15.910> while<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.090> get<00:05:16.360> but<00:05:17.110> I'm<00:05:17.260> yep<00:05:17.560> this

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
took me a while to get but I'm yep this

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.770 
took me a while to get but I'm yep this
one<00:05:18.010> is<00:05:18.220> pretty<00:05:18.850> damn<00:05:19.270> close<00:05:19.479> to<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.720> original

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
one is pretty damn close to the original

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.780 
one is pretty damn close to the original
if<00:05:20.200> you<00:05:20.290> want<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.500> frustration<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.220> I<00:05:21.580> think

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
if you want the frustration and I think

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.670 
if you want the frustration and I think
also<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.060> graphics<00:05:22.419> everything<00:05:22.780> look<00:05:23.470> pretty

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
also the graphics everything look pretty

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.040 
also the graphics everything look pretty
similar<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:24.010> that<00:05:24.130> one<00:05:24.360> next<00:05:25.360> one<00:05:25.479> is<00:05:25.660> silly

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
similar to that one next one is silly

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.260 
similar to that one next one is silly
bird<00:05:26.290> which<00:05:27.190> is<00:05:27.220> kind<00:05:27.610> of<00:05:27.669> like<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:27.820> original

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
bird which is kind of like the original

bird which is kind of like the original
except<00:05:28.540> with<00:05:28.630> slightly<00:05:28.840> ramped<00:05:29.169> up<00:05:29.229> graphics

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
except with slightly ramped up graphics

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.580 
except with slightly ramped up graphics
and<00:05:30.390> it's<00:05:31.390> very<00:05:31.660> actually<00:05:31.900> very<00:05:32.110> very<00:05:32.140> smooth

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
and it's very actually very very smooth

I quite like this one Oh although the

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.880 
I quite like this one Oh although the
collision<00:05:37.540> system<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.350> through<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.620> bit<00:05:38.770> off

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
collision system to through a bit off

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.310 
collision system to through a bit off
but<00:05:39.460> this<00:05:39.550> one<00:05:39.790> I'm<00:05:39.940> quite<00:05:40.330> pleasing<00:05:40.600> quite

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
nice to look at compared to some of the

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.200 
nice to look at compared to some of the
others<00:05:43.479> again<00:05:44.350> really<00:05:44.770> really<00:05:45.040> hard<00:05:45.280> we<00:05:46.090> just

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
others again really really hard we just

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.010 
others again really really hard we just
go<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.419> point<00:05:46.630> of<00:05:46.660> these<00:05:46.810> games

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
go to the point of these games

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.870

especially<00:05:48.010> if<00:05:48.310> you're<00:05:48.400> leading<00:05:48.669> over<00:05:48.850> a

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
especially if you're leading over a

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.320 
especially if you're leading over a
camera<00:05:49.979> I'm<00:05:50.979> going<00:05:51.160> at<00:05:51.280> past<00:05:51.490> three<00:05:51.880> just<00:05:52.270> to

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
camera I'm going at past three just to

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.559 
camera I'm going at past three just to
prove<00:05:52.570> that<00:05:52.750> I<00:05:52.840> can

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
production value to it and there's

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.119 
production value to it and there's
actually<00:06:05.839> sort<00:06:06.169> of<00:06:06.349> an<00:06:06.469> assemblage<00:06:06.949> of<00:06:07.039> a

more of an indie game kind of feel to it

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.860

feels<00:07:09.099> much<00:07:09.340> more<00:07:09.580> polished<00:07:09.789> than<00:07:09.970> most<00:07:10.750> of

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
feels much more polished than most of

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.170 
feels much more polished than most of
the<00:07:10.900> others<00:07:11.169> hold<00:07:12.159> minimalist<00:07:12.639> sort<00:07:12.879> of<00:07:12.940> you<00:07:13.120> I

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
the others hold minimalist sort of you I

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.490 
the others hold minimalist sort of you I
kind<00:07:13.569> of<00:07:13.629> thing<00:07:13.810> I<00:07:13.930> like<00:07:14.110> the<00:07:14.139> fact<00:07:14.289> they've

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500 
kind of thing I like the fact they've

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.689 
kind of thing I like the fact they've
adapted<00:07:14.710> it<00:07:15.009> made<00:07:15.190> the<00:07:15.310> whole<00:07:15.400> thing<00:07:15.460> a<00:07:15.669> bit

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
adapted it made the whole thing a bit

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:18.779 
adapted it made the whole thing a bit
darker<00:07:16.650> and<00:07:17.650> if<00:07:17.740> I<00:07:17.800> had<00:07:17.949> to<00:07:18.039> say<00:07:18.190> one<00:07:18.550> was<00:07:18.669> my

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:18.789 
darker and if I had to say one was my

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.420 
darker and if I had to say one was my
favorite<00:07:18.819> it<00:07:19.180> would<00:07:19.270> probably<00:07:19.419> be<00:07:19.599> this<00:07:19.810> one

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
favorite it would probably be this one

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.969 
favorite it would probably be this one
or<00:07:21.430> clumsy<00:07:22.000> bird<00:07:22.240> put<00:07:22.629> the<00:07:23.229> litter<00:07:23.469> first<00:07:23.860> of

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
or clumsy bird put the litter first of

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:25.619 
or clumsy bird put the litter first of
all<00:07:24.069> they<00:07:24.340> are<00:07:24.370> landscape<00:07:25.150> which<00:07:25.360> I<00:07:25.449> think

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:25.629 
all they are landscape which I think

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:27.240 
all they are landscape which I think
just<00:07:25.840> looked<00:07:26.229> a<00:07:26.319> lot<00:07:26.440> nicer<00:07:26.500> with<00:07:26.889> these<00:07:27.009> games
