00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:11.429 
stuff has to stop anyway I just figured

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:12.559 
stuff has to stop anyway I just figured
a<00:07:11.579> lot<00:07:11.729> of<00:07:11.849> people<00:07:12.059> didn't<00:07:12.269> see<00:07:12.449> this

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:12.569 
a lot of people didn't see this

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:14.809 
a lot of people didn't see this
pay-per-view<00:07:12.809> so<00:07:13.379> I<00:07:13.439> figured<00:07:13.769> I'd<00:07:13.949> give<00:07:14.610> it<00:07:14.639> to

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 
pay-per-view so I figured I'd give it to

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.100 
pay-per-view so I figured I'd give it to
the<00:07:14.909> fans<00:07:16.610> otherwise<00:07:17.610> it<00:07:18.360> was<00:07:18.509> a<00:07:18.539> great<00:07:18.869> great

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
the fans otherwise it was a great great

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.509 
the fans otherwise it was a great great
fight<00:07:19.469> and<00:07:19.709> I<00:07:19.769> really<00:07:20.069> hope<00:07:20.219> there's<00:07:20.429> a

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:20.519 
fight and I really hope there's a

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.609 
fight and I really hope there's a
rematch<00:07:20.939> although<00:07:21.389> I'm<00:07:21.539> not<00:07:21.659> quite<00:07:21.929> sure<00:07:21.959> that

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:22.619 
rematch although I'm not quite sure that

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:26.689 
rematch although I'm not quite sure that
that<00:07:22.769> will<00:07:22.889> happen<00:07:23.269> anyway<00:07:25.219> I'll<00:07:26.219> let<00:07:26.459> you<00:07:26.579> two
