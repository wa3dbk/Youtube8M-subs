figured out that having vibrant health
is<00:00:57.829> actually<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.460> easy<00:01:00.199> what's<00:01:01.199> hard<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
is actually really easy what's hard is

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.929 
is actually really easy what's hard is
sorting<00:01:03.329> through<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.250> overwhelming<00:01:05.250> health

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
sorting through the overwhelming health

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.880 
sorting through the overwhelming health
information<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:08.070> how<00:01:08.310> easy<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
information to see how easy it is and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.100 
information to see how easy it is and
what<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> found<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.630> getting

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
what I found is it's all about getting

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.670 
what I found is it's all about getting
back<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> basics<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.140> simple

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
back to the basics and not just a simple

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.550 
back to the basics and not just a simple

understanding of both food and the body
is<00:01:20.009> all<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:21.090> needed<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.689> start

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
is all that's needed to start

how to keep the blood sugar stable it's
obvious<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.740> need<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.189> understanding<00:01:39.090> in

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
keep the blood sugar stable but how do

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.500 
keep the blood sugar stable but how do
you<00:02:31.019> learn<00:02:31.260> how<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.560> do<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.760> information
