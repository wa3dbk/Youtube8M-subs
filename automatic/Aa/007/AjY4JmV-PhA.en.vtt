 barcelona to 180 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.810
 because it is to endure 90 is a thing with a 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.960
 figure archer but when you have to go 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.450
 to 180 if why why is that not us 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.310
 a fair match was dominated the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.350

 that navas says an excellent match 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.460
 it was hero was figure then 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.040
 hardly vain 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.900
 to rescue the tie but eye is 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.760
 football in football everything can happen and 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.860
 talking about what Costa Rica says with 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.080
 the moment when navas with bryan 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.240
 ruiz and bryan oviedo bryan ruiz about 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.040
 all rescuing minutes with the transfer 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.789
 who was with the transfer and oviedo 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.560
 at a level still pardon in the 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.110
 everton eye with costa rica of nursery 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.459
 marketing and to the west lift him complicated 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.020
 Real Madrid's match was won in 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.360
 the last minute is tied in the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.069
 last and you win it in the last post the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.050
 tie to Barcelona now comes this 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.550
 eliminatory by cup that has this 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.209
 good team looks has a coach 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.450
 which is very consistent in what it says today 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.650
 I was listening to statements says that 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.780
 let's wait or let's try some 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.270
 way that this tie is not 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.240
 finish tomorrow 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.760
 that means it's going to go back 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.680
 those that do not fill much goals but play 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.980
 in two games he has gone to Barcelona well 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.080
 is complicated very well concacaf is the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.340
 good time that aitor amazes you 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.480
 it does not surprise me because it has always 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.280
 been a very regular archer but 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.290
 Obviously when you have a match 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.450
 in front of a big one it becomes more scandal 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.980
 keylor navas is a very regular archer 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.360
 apart from costa rica you can not complain 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.190
 has to which the navas have esteban 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.230
 alvarado who play abroad but 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.690
 I am always remembering against the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.580
 great an archer is figure remember 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.900
 of willy caballero with malaga now 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.320
 the story belongs to keylor 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.970
 navas 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.340
 yes indeed gentlemen I speak of 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.230
 selection that never came or is going to 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.510
 get in this process this is what has 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.220
 done the lift at home in this 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.650
 September season November won 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.570
 a game December January won 4 has not 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.340
 lost in the last two months has 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.990
 scored three more goals and the most 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.750
 important has received six fewer goals 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.850
 alexis we returned to madrid so that we 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.900
 talk and let us know more information 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.910
 and more data of what he's doing 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.680
 keylor Navas and this lift and it's 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.960
 inevitable to think that he plays against messi 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.520
 and when there is messi there are some antics 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.530
 over there too 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.930
 well, yes, the truth is that the truth 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.340
 is that while he talked about horse you have 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.630
 to tell you what you happen to see her with 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.300
 gentleman but hey that 's another 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.330
 history that the navas is the is the 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.010
 eighth Costa Rican who plays in the 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.990
 Spanish league and the second goalkeeper before 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.930
 that keylor came here mulberry and 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.480
 quesada years 30 years then kayak to 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.270
 rabbit ronald gomez wanchope and joel 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.770
 campbell who was last year at the 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.870
 Real Betis rabbit is the one that has the 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.810
 record of matches in first division 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.540
 of all of them with 45 keylor navas are 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.610
 in 29 there are 19 games to finish 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.830
 the 18th league mark game is to say 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.020
 everything is played as it seems would end 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.640
 with 47 it will become the Costa Rican 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.280
 with more matches in the history of the 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.750
 Spanish first division where already 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.460
 left its mark at least this 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.600
 season that navas is right now 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.910
 who has the unbeaten record 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.250
 in the league three hundred and fifty-nine 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.050
 minutes was unbeaten between October and 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.430
 November in addition parties 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.920
 spectacular in which he made a 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.270
 lots of stops although that record what 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.580
 You can lose this weekend because 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.030
 diego lopez takes 299 minutes without 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.620
 receive goal is 60 to overcome that mark 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.750
 Keylor Navas and has a game against 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.160
 grenade at home where it is 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.320
 possible to keep again 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.870
 his goal to zero but of drug here in 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.640
 Spain is surprising and much the 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.100
 work of which the navas those that to what 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.830
 We have seen him better in Costa Rica 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.710
 we are surprised less is a porterazo 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.950
 but will have tomorrow ahead in a month 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.080
 and the big month and he's going to meet 400 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.940
 matches with fc barcelona- eleventh 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.680
 player the extra of the barÃ§a that arrives that 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.960
 figure but the first foreigner that is 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.700
 something that surprises and a lot is the only 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.130
 player born outside of Spain- who has 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.170
 reached 400 matches the record already 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.270
 we commented last week has xavi and 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.640
 to establish a comparative xavi 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.670
 reached 400 games with 28 years and 22 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.160
 days tomorrow messi will be 26 years old and 212 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.920
 days that is will reach that figure one year 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.900
 and half younger than Xabi did 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.790
 and in these 400 parties messi has 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.680
 practically all the records 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.050
 scorers having and of having of the fc 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.600
 barcelona except one that the club 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.380
 he gave importance until recently 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.510
 time until messi appeared 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.920
 knocked down several scoring records and 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.930
 this record seems that the barÃ§a has 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.310
 forgotten but is still there the 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.980
 record of being the top scorer 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.660
 adding all the matches say so much 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.400
 official as friendly is the record what 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.470
 Pauline has a player 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.300
 Spanish Filipino nation when 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.620
 philippines to the Spanish colony that 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.960
 scored 369 goals in 357 matches 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.490
 counting friendly counting officers 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.510
 also friendly officers for messi 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.040
 takes 357 in 439 say to be alone 12 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.110
 Pauline goals that probably 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.780
 will get over it this same 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.580
 season and to see in the influence it 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.070
 there are many tables or positions 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.660
 of these of all these years for giving one 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.580
 different to see the influence it has 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.620
 Messi at FC Barcelona 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.250
 of those 399 games he has played 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.160
 to date has marked at 205 and has not 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:50.150

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.060
 those that messi marked the barÃ§a achieved a 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.070
 87% of victories of those 194 those who do not 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.040
 they go in frame the low percentage 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.529
 incredible up to 51 is the influence 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.149
 of messi in the field about him 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:05.669
