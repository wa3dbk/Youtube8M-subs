00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.160 
stuff I'm just in my room and I'll be
honest<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.300> actually<00:00:48.539> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.719> echoey<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
honest it's actually kind of echoey in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
honest it's actually kind of echoey in
my<00:00:49.440> room<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:50.879> serving<00:00:51.120> its

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
my room but it's actually serving its

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
my room but it's actually serving its
purpose<00:00:51.239> very<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
purpose very well and I really like the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.229 
purpose very well and I really like the
sound<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:53.940> better

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
sound of it so if you have better

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
sound of it so if you have better
conditions<00:00:54.660> than<00:00:54.719> me<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.170> would<00:00:55.320> probably

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
conditions than me it would probably

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.459 
conditions than me it would probably
sound<00:00:55.860> even<00:00:56.219> better<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:57.719> unboxing<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.350> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
sound even better the unboxing of this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
sound even better the unboxing of this
product<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> very<00:00:59.550> interesting

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
product was a very interesting

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.750

experience<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.960> comes<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:02.070> protective

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

effect<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.700> actually<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
effect and I actually really like it the

effect and I actually really like it the
shock<00:02:31.530> mount<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.920> pretty<00:02:32.130> standard<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.790> does

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
shock mount is pretty standard it does

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.490 
shock mount is pretty standard it does
this<00:02:33.090> job<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.570> helps<00:02:33.750> reduce<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.020> effect<00:02:34.410> of

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
this job and helps reduce the effect of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500 
this job and helps reduce the effect of
vibrations<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.190> it's<00:02:35.700> also<00:02:35.910> worth<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.420> to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
vibrations and it's also worth it to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.790 
vibrations and it's also worth it to
note<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:36.960> are<00:02:37.080> no<00:02:37.230> physical<00:02:37.440> buttons

the microphone itself the hardware and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.480 
the microphone itself the hardware and
the<00:03:03.330> specifications<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.260> paper<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.770> great<00:03:05.100> but

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
the specifications on paper is great but

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.580 
the specifications on paper is great but
let's<00:03:05.670> see<00:03:05.760> how<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:05.880> actually<00:03:06.450> sounds<00:03:06.900> now

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
let's see how it actually sounds now

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.200 
let's see how it actually sounds now
right<00:03:07.770> now<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:07.980> are<00:03:08.130> listening<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.790> Canon

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
right now you are listening to the Canon

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.780 
right now you are listening to the Canon
t3i<00:03:09.470> built-in<00:03:10.470> microphone<00:03:11.070> I'm<00:03:11.280> doing<00:03:11.730> this

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
t3i built-in microphone I'm doing this

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.890 
t3i built-in microphone I'm doing this
to<00:03:11.910> give<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> point<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.450> reference<00:03:12.660> to

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
to give you a point of reference to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.620 
to give you a point of reference to
compare<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.470> SL<00:03:13.830> 150<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.460> in<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:15.000> few<00:03:15.180> videos<00:03:15.300> or

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
compare the SL 150 to in a few videos or

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.300 
compare the SL 150 to in a few videos or
so<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.780> will<00:03:15.960> do<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.260> comparison<00:03:16.710> between<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.980> SL

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
so I will do a comparison between the SL

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.250 
so I will do a comparison between the SL
150<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.360> blue<00:03:18.510> Yeti<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.959> will<00:03:19.080> put<00:03:19.230> a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
150 and the blue Yeti now I will put a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.990 
150 and the blue Yeti now I will put a
lot<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.560> work<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.070> skeezy<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> best

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
lot of work is that skeezy the best

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.850 
lot of work is that skeezy the best
comparison<00:03:21.270> possible<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.590> should<00:03:22.739> hold

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
comparison possible but this should hold

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.770 
comparison possible but this should hold
you<00:03:22.950> over<00:03:23.190> until<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.330> test<00:03:24.570> I'm

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
you over until then and this test I'm

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.530 
you over until then and this test I'm
going<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.200> test<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.650> SL<00:03:25.950> 154<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.000> voice<00:03:27.180> over

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
going to test the SL 154 in voice over

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.630 
going to test the SL 154 in voice over
for<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.050> voice<00:03:28.170> over<00:03:28.530> with<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> pop<00:03:29.010> filter<00:03:29.250> and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.430 
for you voice over with a pop filter and
then<00:03:30.060> for<00:03:30.330> live<00:03:30.510> recording<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.110> like<00:03:31.290> this

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
then for live recording just like this

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.540 
then for live recording just like this
even<00:03:31.739> though<00:03:31.830> you've<00:03:31.950> already<00:03:32.010> gotten<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.400> good

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
you my personal opinion on the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.740 
you my personal opinion on the
microphone<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.550> how<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.760> sounds<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.270> course

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
microphone and how it sounds of course

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.330 
microphone and how it sounds of course
everyone<00:04:31.200> has<00:04:31.230> different<00:04:31.620> ears<00:04:31.860> everyone<00:04:32.250> has

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
everyone has different ears everyone has

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.040 
everyone has different ears everyone has
different<00:04:32.490> opinions<00:04:32.670> so<00:04:33.420> it<00:04:33.510> may<00:04:33.660> not<00:04:33.690> be<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
different opinions so it may not be the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.420 
different opinions so it may not be the
same<00:04:34.200> as<00:04:34.350> yours<00:04:34.560> but<00:04:34.740> this<00:04:34.890> is<00:04:35.010> at<00:04:35.130> least<00:04:35.160> what

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
same as yours but this is at least what

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.310 
same as yours but this is at least what
I<00:04:35.460> thought<00:04:35.700> after<00:04:35.970> using<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.540> microphone<00:04:36.810> for

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
I thought after using the microphone for

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.320 
I thought after using the microphone for
about<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.500> week<00:04:37.710> or<00:04:37.890> two<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.610> in<00:04:38.880> terms<00:04:39.090> of<00:04:39.240> like

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
about a week or two so in terms of like

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.240 
about a week or two so in terms of like
a<00:04:39.420> soundstage<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.050> how<00:04:40.170> it<00:04:40.290> sounds<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:40.800> really

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
a soundstage and how it sounds I really

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.010 
a soundstage and how it sounds I really
like<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.730> sounds<00:04:41.940> really<00:04:42.090> rich<00:04:42.450> you<00:04:42.870> can

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
like it it sounds really rich you can

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.450 
like it it sounds really rich you can
hear<00:04:43.140> like<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.410> entire<00:04:43.680> soundstage<00:04:44.220> from<00:04:44.370> the

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
hear like the entire soundstage from the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.730 
hear like the entire soundstage from the
deeps<00:04:44.670> of<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.910> highs<00:04:45.030> it's<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.720> full<00:04:46.260> would<00:04:46.620> be

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
deeps of the highs it's a full would be

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.710 
deeps of the highs it's a full would be
a<00:04:46.770> good<00:04:46.920> adjective<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.400> use<00:04:47.610> its<00:04:47.820> full<00:04:48.060> sounds

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
a good adjective to use its full sounds

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.080 
a good adjective to use its full sounds
really<00:04:48.960> thick<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.670> pleasant<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:50.730> listen<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.060> I

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
really thick and pleasant to listen to I

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.240 
really thick and pleasant to listen to I
guess<00:04:51.420> when<00:04:51.990> compared<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.620> Canon<00:04:53.220> t3i

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
guess when compared to the Canon t3i

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.220 
guess when compared to the Canon t3i
audio<00:04:53.910> it<00:04:54.120> blows<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.510> out<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.780> water<00:04:54.960> and

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
audio it blows it out of the water and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.200 
audio it blows it out of the water and
when<00:04:55.830> compared<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.430> blue<00:04:56.580> Yeti<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:56.910> little

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
when compared to the blue Yeti a little

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.610 
when compared to the blue Yeti a little
bit<00:04:57.300> of<00:04:57.360> a<00:04:57.420> spoiler<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:57.960> actually<00:04:58.230> think<00:04:58.470> it

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
bit of a spoiler I actually think it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.140 
bit of a spoiler I actually think it
sounds<00:04:58.890> better<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.280> Yeti<00:04:59.640> sounds<00:04:59.910> a<00:04:59.970> little

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
sounds better the Yeti sounds a little

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.520 
sounds better the Yeti sounds a little
flat<00:05:00.300> but<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.720> will<00:05:00.870> do<00:05:00.960> an<00:05:01.050> entire<00:05:01.320> video

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
flat but I will do an entire video

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.950 
flat but I will do an entire video
dedicated<00:05:01.920> to<00:05:02.520> just<00:05:02.790> that<00:05:02.910> comparison<00:05:03.300> but<00:05:03.840> is

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
dedicated to just that comparison but is

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.020 
dedicated to just that comparison but is
definitely<00:05:04.350> up<00:05:04.920> there<00:05:04.980> with<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.640> blue<00:05:05.790> Yeti

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
definitely up there with the blue Yeti

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.570 
definitely up there with the blue Yeti
in<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.240> audio<00:05:06.840> technica<00:05:07.050> at2020<00:05:07.770> up<00:05:08.340> there

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
in the audio technica at2020 up there

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.340 
in the audio technica at2020 up there
with<00:05:08.700> those<00:05:08.910> so<00:05:09.360> this<00:05:09.510> could<00:05:09.810> very<00:05:10.050> well<00:05:10.110> be<00:05:10.230> a

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
with those so this could very well be a

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.170 
with those so this could very well be a
better<00:05:10.620> choice<00:05:10.950> I<00:05:11.250> will<00:05:11.490> better<00:05:11.730> assess<00:05:12.060> that

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
better choice I will better assess that

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.790 
better choice I will better assess that
in<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.420> later<00:05:12.570> video<00:05:12.720> when<00:05:13.350> I<00:05:13.380> compare<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:13.740> to

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
in a later video when I compare it to

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.160 
in a later video when I compare it to
the<00:05:13.950> Yeti<00:05:14.130> though<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.940> overall<00:05:15.390> if<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:15.840> are<00:05:15.870> in

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
the Yeti though so overall if you are in

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.200 
the Yeti though so overall if you are in
the<00:05:16.350> market<00:05:16.530> for<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.070> studio<00:05:17.520> microphone<00:05:17.790> maybe

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
the market for a studio microphone maybe
