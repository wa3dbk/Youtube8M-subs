00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.840
The shelters are usually in bad conditions.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.680
Animals die of diseases and maltreatment

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.080
or due to overcrowding.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
Some people abandon animals in shelters 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.260
thinking they'll get adopted and receive proper care. 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.319
But they usually end up dying

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.340
 from many diseases and depression.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.960
People still pay a lot of money 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.220
buying animals in pet shops.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.780
But there are many other pets

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.520
that would bring so much love with them

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.820
for all their lives

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.520
and people don't need to spend a cent for it.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.960
Good morning, how are you?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.500
I want to buy the spotted dog.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.300
This one?

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.260
Yeah, this one.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.860
OK. It's for free.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.780
Bullshit!

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100
For free?
Yes.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.000
Really?

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.140
So I can actually take it home for free, right now?
Yes, that's it.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.600
Is it for real?
Yes.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.260
I was just about to ask for a discountâ€¦ Really?
Yes, it's free!

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.060
What do you mean for free?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.940
No cost? Free of charges?
No cost at all!

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.320
You're kidding me!
I'm serious.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.440
Please, honey. Let's take him!

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.220
Oh, I want it!

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.120
I think in the end what really matters

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.900
is the empathy between a person and the animal.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.160
There's no difference

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.000
if a pet is purebred or not.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.220
What really matters is the love that will arise there

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.980
between the person in the pet shop

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.780
and the pet behind the glass.
