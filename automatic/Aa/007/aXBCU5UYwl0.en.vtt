okay<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.050> fundus<00:01:44.470> we<00:01:44.890> are<00:01:45.039> seeing<00:01:45.369> fine<00:01:45.789> and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
okay the fundus we are seeing fine and

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.300 
okay the fundus we are seeing fine and
let<00:01:48.160> me<00:01:48.750> call<00:01:49.750> that<00:01:49.810> you<00:01:50.200> know<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.679> these

let me call that you know that these

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.540 
let me call that you know that these
bubble<00:01:51.910> gases<00:01:52.360> these<00:01:53.259> are<00:01:53.740> power

bubble gases these are power
these<00:01:54.729> are<00:01:55.090> bubbles<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.320> should<00:01:56.740> not<00:01:56.979> be

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
these are bubbles and should not be

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.469 
these are bubbles and should not be
confused<00:01:58.240> with<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:59.610> pathology<00:02:00.610> they<00:02:01.360> are

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
fundus of the Gulf eaters we can see it

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.550 
fundus of the Gulf eaters we can see it
small<00:02:11.470> amount<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:12.630> white<00:02:13.630> within<00:02:14.290> the

record this view and in this view we can

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.809 
record this view and in this view we can

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
see the anterior wall in total so the

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.029 
see the anterior wall in total so the

dispel<00:05:12.360> this<00:05:13.229> is<00:05:13.529> the<00:05:13.709> difference<00:05:14.189> of

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:15.149 
dispel this is the difference of

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:18.889 
dispel this is the difference of
scanning<00:05:15.689> in<00:05:16.559> gives<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.129> plans<00:05:17.550> if<00:05:18.329> they<00:05:18.449> just

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:18.899 
scanning in gives you plans if they just

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:25.659 
scanning in gives you plans if they just
plan<00:05:19.199> in<00:05:19.409> one<00:05:20.449> scan<00:05:21.449> in<00:05:21.689> one<00:05:21.959> plane<00:05:22.969> and<00:05:24.259> decide

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
plan in one scan in one plane and decide

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.769 
plan in one scan in one plane and decide
then<00:05:26.669> you<00:05:27.389> make<00:05:27.779> a<00:05:27.809> mistake<00:05:29.029> so<00:05:30.029> now<00:05:30.209> your<00:05:30.479> rep

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:30.779 
then you make a mistake so now your rep

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.199 
then you make a mistake so now your rep
endings<00:05:31.229> will<00:05:31.499> be<00:05:31.649> different<00:05:32.039> so<00:05:32.759> this<00:05:32.879> is<00:05:33.059> the

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:33.209 
endings will be different so this is the

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:35.779 
endings will be different so this is the
case<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:33.689> now<00:05:34.169> I<00:05:34.559> can<00:05:34.889> say<00:05:35.069> that<00:05:35.279> this<00:05:35.459> is<00:05:35.519> the

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
case of now I can say that this is the

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:42.679 
case of now I can say that this is the
case<00:05:35.999> for<00:05:40.189> chronic<00:05:41.189> cholecystitis<00:05:41.699> which

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:42.689 
case for chronic cholecystitis which

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.800 
case for chronic cholecystitis which
college<00:05:43.110> students<00:05:43.619> is
