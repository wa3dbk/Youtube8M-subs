00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
typical earthquake yes and I guess it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.420 
typical earthquake yes and I guess it
wasn't<00:00:50.400> my<00:00:50.640> best<00:00:50.909> thing<00:00:51.299> to<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:52.280> naina<00:00:53.280> my

wasn't my best thing to do naina my
she's<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.820> funny<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.420> looks<00:00:54.540> like<00:00:54.659> it's

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
she's so funny it looks like it's

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.130 
she's so funny it looks like it's
hitting<00:00:55.170> scratch<00:00:55.619> that<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.400> it's<00:00:56.549> not<00:00:57.140> yeah

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

defense<00:01:03.829> so<00:01:04.829> it<00:01:04.979> goes<00:01:05.159> again<00:01:05.489> using<00:01:06.000> double

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
defense so it goes again using double

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.640 
defense so it goes again using double
team<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> first<00:01:07.799> time<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.390> and

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
team this is the first time actually and

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.580 
team this is the first time actually and
then<00:01:10.650> an<00:01:10.770> encore<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:12.570> Alakazam<00:01:13.110> sure<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
then an encore that Alakazam sure is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.719 
then an encore that Alakazam sure is
smart<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.220> my<00:01:14.460> breasts<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.310> decided<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
smart on my breasts and so I decided to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.710 
smart on my breasts and so I decided to
do<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> smart<00:01:18.270> person<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:18.810> aerial<00:01:19.380> ace<00:01:20.720> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
do the smart person use aerial ace and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
do the smart person use aerial ace and
it's<00:01:22.350> super<00:01:22.710> effective<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.880> know

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it's super effective but you know

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.360 
it's super effective but you know

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
obviously it's still alive and using
