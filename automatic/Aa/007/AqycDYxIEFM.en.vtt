use<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.199> letter<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.770> see<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.369> an<00:00:17.520> example

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.120 

we're<00:00:25.480> first<00:00:25.810> gonna<00:00:26.050> double-click<00:00:26.830> on<00:00:27.010> the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
we're first gonna double-click on the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.690 
we're first gonna double-click on the
layer<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.340> bring<00:00:28.030> up<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.390> layer<00:00:28.570> style<00:00:28.600> and

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
layer to bring up the layer style and

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.360 
layer to bring up the layer style and
check<00:00:30.700> the<00:00:30.850> bevel<00:00:31.180> and<00:00:31.330> boss<00:00:31.690> button<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:33.220> give

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
check the bevel and boss button to give

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.000 
check the bevel and boss button to give
it<00:00:33.490> some<00:00:33.670> depth<00:00:34.260> play<00:00:35.260> around<00:00:35.560> with<00:00:35.800> the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
it some depth play around with the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.290 
it some depth play around with the
shading<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.850> size<00:00:37.380> softn<00:00:38.380> and<00:00:38.560> death<00:00:39.300> ticket

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
shading the size softn and death ticket

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.570 
shading the size softn and death ticket
the<00:00:40.930> approximate<00:00:41.530> size<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:42.010> want<00:00:42.220> if<00:00:42.400> you're

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
the approximate size you want if you're

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.229 
the approximate size you want if you're
not<00:00:42.730> sure<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:44.260> make<00:00:44.590> sure<00:00:45.430> it<00:00:45.670> has<00:00:45.790> some<00:00:45.820> def

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
not sure just make sure it has some def

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.490 
not sure just make sure it has some def
and<00:00:46.450> you<00:00:46.600> can<00:00:46.720> always<00:00:46.960> come<00:00:47.140> back<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.320> change

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
and you can always come back and change

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.580 
and you can always come back and change
it<00:00:47.800> later<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:49.000> we're<00:00:49.360> gonna<00:00:49.510> apply<00:00:49.780> satin

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
it later then we're gonna apply satin

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.440 
it later then we're gonna apply satin
satin<00:00:51.460> we'll<00:00:51.760> give<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:53.129> object<00:00:54.129> of

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
satin we'll give the the object of

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.170 
satin we'll give the the object of
backlighting<00:00:55.450> a<00:00:55.960> resolution<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:57.180> feel

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
backlighting a resolution a feel

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
backlighting a resolution a feel
to<00:00:58.210> it<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:58.860> again<00:00:59.860> play<00:01:00.339> around<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:00.820> setting

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
to it so again play around the setting

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.880 
to it so again play around the setting
make<00:01:03.430> sure<00:01:03.699> you<00:01:04.000> have<00:01:04.239> enough<00:01:05.080> variation<00:01:05.470> in

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
make sure you have enough variation in

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.690 
make sure you have enough variation in
the<00:01:06.070> shadow<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:06.670> light<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.900> if<00:01:08.800> you<00:01:09.040> didn't

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
the shadow and light and if you didn't

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.510 
the shadow and light and if you didn't
give<00:01:09.940> your<00:01:10.659> object<00:01:11.500> color<00:01:11.800> earlier<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.370> can

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
give your object color earlier you can

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.240 
give your object color earlier you can
always<00:01:12.670> check<00:01:13.030> color<00:01:13.360> overlay<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.230> give<00:01:15.040> it<00:01:15.159> a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
always check color overlay and give it a

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.990 
always check color overlay and give it a
color<00:01:15.430> now<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.960> on<00:01:17.200> satin<00:01:17.890> on<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.729> color

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
color now then on satin on the color

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.840 
color now then on satin on the color
choose<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.510> darker<00:01:20.110> color<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:20.710> your<00:01:21.640> color

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
choose a darker color of your color

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.740 
choose a darker color of your color
overlay<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:24.250> exaggerate<00:01:24.909> that<00:01:25.060> backlight

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
overlay and to exaggerate that backlight

glow<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.119> color<00:01:31.390> you<00:01:31.899> do<00:01:32.140> not<00:01:32.259> have<00:01:32.469> to

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
glow for the color you do not have to

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.749 
glow for the color you do not have to
choose<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.340> match<00:01:33.579> the<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.680> color<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.340> the

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
choose it to match the the color of the

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.279 
choose it to match the the color of the
rest<00:01:36.969> of<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.180> color<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.340> then<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.990> once

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
rest of the color and then so once

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.410 
rest of the color and then so once
you're<00:01:41.469> done<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:41.740> go<00:01:42.159> back<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:43.060> all<00:01:43.270> the

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
you're done just go back to all the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.660 
you're done just go back to all the
setting<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.110> play<00:01:44.649> around<00:01:44.829> with<00:01:45.159> that<00:01:45.340> again

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
setting and play around with that again

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.529 
setting and play around with that again
so<00:01:46.060> again<00:01:46.990> make<00:01:47.380> sure<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.670> effect<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
so again make sure the effect of the

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.170 
so again make sure the effect of the
texture<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.170> not<00:01:50.439> smooth<00:01:51.189> make<00:01:51.759> sure<00:01:51.909> there's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
texture is not smooth make sure there's

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.149 
texture is not smooth make sure there's
enough<00:01:52.270> variation<00:01:53.020> between<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.649> dark<00:01:54.039> and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
enough variation between the dark and

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.270 
enough variation between the dark and
the<00:01:54.460> light<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:56.259> will<00:01:56.380> help<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.770> later<00:01:57.009> when

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
the light that will help you later when

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.580 
the light that will help you later when
you<00:01:57.310> create<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.329> chrome<00:01:58.659> effect

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.170 

then<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:05.010> we're<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.580> have<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
then now we're going to have to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.490 
then now we're going to have to
rasterize<00:02:07.550> this<00:02:08.550> layer<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.350> that

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
rasterize this layer you could so that

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.770 
rasterize this layer you could so that
we<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.830> work<00:02:11.130> on<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.459> some<00:02:11.640> more<00:02:11.700> um<00:02:12.180> first

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
we can work on it some more um first

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.320 
we can work on it some more um first
duplicate<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.680> then<00:02:13.890> create<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.850> blank

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
duplicate it and then create a blank

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.580 
duplicate it and then create a blank
layer<00:02:15.860> now<00:02:17.150> select<00:02:18.150> both<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.810> duplicate

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
layer now select both the duplicate

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.210 
layer now select both the duplicate
layer<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:21.510> blank<00:02:22.080> layer<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.620> merge<00:02:22.890> them

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
layer and the blank layer and merge them

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.460 
layer and the blank layer and merge them
both<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:24.510> you'll<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.350> a

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
both and now you'll see it's a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.420 
both and now you'll see it's a
rasterized<00:02:25.709> layer<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:28.320> we're<00:02:28.860> gonna<00:02:28.980> double

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
rasterized layer so we're gonna double

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.390 
rasterized layer so we're gonna double
click<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.940> again<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.709> apply<00:02:31.709> gradient

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
click on it again and apply gradient

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.520 
click on it again and apply gradient
effect

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
effect

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.910 
effect
give<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:35.010> nice<00:02:35.780> reflective<00:02:36.780> color<00:02:37.110> just

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
give it a nice reflective color just

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.720 
give it a nice reflective color just
like<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.340> did<00:02:38.670> with<00:02:38.940> my<00:02:39.239> example<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.730> use

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
like I did with my example and use

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.560 
like I did with my example and use
overlay<00:02:42.450> as<00:02:42.840> blending<00:02:43.440> mode<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:45.060> reason<00:02:45.420> why

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
overlay as blending mode the reason why

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.800 
overlay as blending mode the reason why
we're<00:02:45.780> doing<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.350> again<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.480> look<00:02:48.660> at

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
we're doing this again is if you look at

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.260 
we're doing this again is if you look at
a<00:02:48.840> gradient<00:02:49.170> overlay<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:50.190> located<00:02:50.940> at<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
a gradient overlay it's located at the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.080 
a gradient overlay it's located at the
very<00:02:51.480> bottom<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.350> means<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.640> will<00:02:53.910> be

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
very bottom that means it will be

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.020 
very bottom that means it will be
rendered<00:02:54.360> after<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.890> saddened<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> bevel

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
rendered after the saddened the bevel

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.449 
rendered after the saddened the bevel
the<00:02:57.269> inner<00:02:57.780> glow<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.380> color<00:02:58.680> overlay<00:02:59.070> so

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
the inner glow and the color overlay so

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.060 
the inner glow and the color overlay so
you're<00:02:59.880> not<00:03:00.300> going<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.750> be<00:03:00.870> be<00:03:01.530> able<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.830> see

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
you're not going to be be able to see

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.630 
you're not going to be be able to see
the<00:03:02.250> gradient<00:03:02.820> overlay<00:03:03.950> since<00:03:04.950> it's<00:03:05.160> located

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
the gradient overlay since it's located

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.970 
the gradient overlay since it's located
at<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.850> very<00:03:06.150> bottom<00:03:06.510> end<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.230> don't<00:03:07.350> think

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
at the very bottom end I don't think

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.009 
at the very bottom end I don't think
there's<00:03:08.160> any<00:03:08.340> way<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.580> can<00:03:08.880> drag<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.510> up<00:03:09.570> and

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
there's any way you can drag that up and

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.640 
there's any way you can drag that up and
make<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.410> priority<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:11.760> have<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.650> apply

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
make it a priority so we have to apply

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.880 
make it a priority so we have to apply
the<00:03:13.769> effects<00:03:14.400> separately<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:16.260> now<00:03:16.560> we're

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the effects separately so now we're

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.940 
the effects separately so now we're
going<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.280> rasterize<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.989> layer<00:03:19.290> again<00:03:19.320> by

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
going to rasterize this layer again by

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.580 
going to rasterize this layer again by
doing<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.400> same<00:03:20.610> thing<00:03:20.910> create<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.959> blank

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
doing the same thing create a blank

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.509 
doing the same thing create a blank
layer<00:03:23.660> select<00:03:24.660> them<00:03:24.840> both<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.350> merge<00:03:26.280> it

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
layer select them both and merge it

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.229 
layer select them both and merge it
again<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.890> next<00:03:29.190> we're<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.730> apply<00:03:30.120> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
again the next we're going to apply the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.770 
again the next we're going to apply the
chrome<00:03:30.930> effect<00:03:31.110> by<00:03:32.070> going<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.760> filter<00:03:33.420> and

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
chrome effect by going to filter and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.850 
chrome effect by going to filter and
filter<00:03:34.790> gallery<00:03:35.790> go<00:03:36.750> down<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.170> sketch<00:03:37.530> and

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
filter gallery go down to sketch and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.830 
filter gallery go down to sketch and
chrome<00:03:39.500> give<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.680> some<00:03:40.950> smooth<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.670> detail<00:03:42.090> as

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
chrome give it some smooth and detail as

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.020 
chrome give it some smooth and detail as
much<00:03:43.709> as<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.010> like<00:03:44.900> if<00:03:45.900> earlier<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:47.579> did<00:03:47.850> not

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
much as you like if earlier you did not

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.060 
much as you like if earlier you did not
give<00:03:48.329> it<00:03:48.360> enough<00:03:48.780> shadow<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.560> highlight

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
give it enough shadow and highlight

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.940 
give it enough shadow and highlight
variation<00:03:50.670> you're<00:03:50.820> not<00:03:51.030> gonna<00:03:51.209> get<00:03:51.480> all<00:03:51.660> these

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
variation you're not gonna get all these

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.800 
variation you're not gonna get all these
nice<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.180> reflective<00:03:54.180> chrome<00:03:54.590> look<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.510> if<00:03:57.510> that

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
nice a reflective chrome look so if that

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.390 
nice a reflective chrome look so if that
was<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.170> case<00:03:58.350> you're<00:03:58.650> gonna<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.130> go

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
was the case you're gonna have to go

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.569 
was the case you're gonna have to go
back<00:03:59.640> to<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.480> original<00:04:01.140> file<00:04:01.380> original<00:04:02.370> layer

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
back to the original file original layer

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.580 
back to the original file original layer
and<00:04:02.850> redo<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.540> whole<00:04:03.720> thing<00:04:03.930> again<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.410> make

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
and redo the whole thing again to make

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.699 
and redo the whole thing again to make
sure<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:04.860> have<00:04:05.070> enough<00:04:05.400> um<00:04:06.410> shadow<00:04:07.410> and

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
sure you have enough um shadow and

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.040 
sure you have enough um shadow and
highlight

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
highlight

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.530 
highlight
so<00:04:10.050> now<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.319> we<00:04:11.129> have<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.849> chrome<00:04:12.150> effect

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
so now that we have the chrome effect

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.680 
so now that we have the chrome effect
let's<00:04:13.140> change<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.920> color<00:04:14.489> blend<00:04:14.819> it<00:04:15.000> clean<00:04:15.540> go

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
let's change the color blend it clean go

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.219 
let's change the color blend it clean go
to<00:04:15.959> overlay<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.799> now<00:04:17.040> you'll<00:04:17.310> see<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
to overlay and now you'll see the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.620 
to overlay and now you'll see the
whatever's<00:04:19.229> on<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.500> bottom<00:04:19.729> plus<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:21.329> chrome

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
whatever's on the bottom plus the chrome

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.150 
whatever's on the bottom plus the chrome
effect<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.970> if<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:25.050> if<00:04:25.710> you're<00:04:25.919> not

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
effect and if you like if you're not

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.070 
effect and if you like if you're not
happy<00:04:26.699> with<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:27.030> effect<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.750> chrome

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
happy with the effect of the chrome

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.100 
happy with the effect of the chrome
overlay<00:04:28.889> on<00:04:29.070> top<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.520> your<00:04:29.760> color<00:04:30.330> your

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
overlay on top of your color your

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.370 
overlay on top of your color your
original<00:04:31.760> object<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:33.389> can<00:04:33.570> use<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.110> curve

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
original object you can use the curve

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.770 
original object you can use the curve
and<00:04:35.449> change<00:04:36.449> it<00:04:36.600> around<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:37.139> get<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.250> to

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
and change it around to get it to

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.210 
and change it around to get it to
something<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.169> think<00:04:41.040> would<00:04:41.190> look

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
something that you think would look

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.570 
something that you think would look
better<00:04:42.200> so<00:04:43.460> drag<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.610> curves<00:04:44.880> around<00:04:46.580> and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
better so drag the curves around and

click OK when you're satisfied with the
effect<00:04:52.400> now<00:04:53.400> we're<00:04:53.580> gonna<00:04:53.669> double<00:04:54.000> click<00:04:54.270> both

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
effect now we're gonna double click both

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.370 
effect now we're gonna double click both
layer<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:56.850> merge<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.810> again<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.940> then

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
layer it and merge it again and then

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.340 
layer it and merge it again and then
flip<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.410> over<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:02.580> create<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.360> reflection<00:05:03.960> on

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
flip it over to create a reflection on

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.920 
flip it over to create a reflection on
the<00:05:04.500> foot<00:05:04.710> on<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.889> floor<00:05:05.039> and<00:05:05.690> then<00:05:06.690> we're

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
the foot on the floor and then we're

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.770 
the foot on the floor and then we're
gonna<00:05:07.020> click<00:05:07.590> on<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:08.340> mask<00:05:08.580> it's<00:05:09.180> looking<00:05:09.600> at

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
gonna click on the mask it's looking at

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.100 
gonna click on the mask it's looking at
the<00:05:09.840> bottom<00:05:10.229> of<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.530> layer<00:05:10.740> palette<00:05:11.960> so<00:05:12.960> now

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
the bottom of the layer palette so now

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.710 
the bottom of the layer palette so now
we're<00:05:13.289> gonna<00:05:13.440> apply<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.430> gradient<00:05:14.789> effect

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
we're gonna apply the gradient effect

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.360 
we're gonna apply the gradient effect
give<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:17.010> nice<00:05:17.400> black<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.330> white<00:05:18.570> gradient

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
give it a nice black to white gradient

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.810 
give it a nice black to white gradient
on<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.970> mask<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:22.050> you'll<00:05:22.260> see<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:23.190> result

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
on the mask and you'll see the result

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.279 
on the mask and you'll see the result
reflected<00:05:24.360> on<00:05:24.479> that<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.810> final<00:05:25.110> layer

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
reflected on that the final layer

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.129 
reflected on that the final layer
appearance<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.120> then<00:05:27.120> turn<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.840> opacity

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
appearance and then turn the opacity

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:35.170 
appearance and then turn the opacity
down<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.570> about<00:05:30.570> 50<00:05:31.849> so<00:05:32.849> next<00:05:33.150> we're<00:05:33.930> going<00:05:34.260> to

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
down to about 50 so next we're going to

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.000 
down to about 50 so next we're going to

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
create a icicle turn off everything

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.629 
create a icicle turn off everything
except<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.690> ice<00:05:39.870> itself<00:05:40.440> now<00:05:41.340> we're<00:05:41.490> going<00:05:41.580> to

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
except the ice itself now we're going to

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.080 
except the ice itself now we're going to
create<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.180> icicles<00:05:42.840> go<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.680> select<00:05:44.250> create<00:05:45.030> a

you'll<00:06:16.270> get<00:06:16.479> this<00:06:16.660> wind<00:06:17.470> effect<00:06:17.889> and<00:06:18.810> let's

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
you'll get this wind effect and let's

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.180 
you'll get this wind effect and let's
rotate<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:21.220> back<00:06:21.490> to<00:06:21.820> the<00:06:22.000> original<00:06:22.180> position

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
rotate it back to the original position

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.760 
rotate it back to the original position
turn<00:06:24.190> everything<00:06:24.430> back<00:06:24.790> on<00:06:25.030> in<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.720> line

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
turn everything back on in a line

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.680 
turn everything back on in a line
the<00:06:27.070> Icicle<00:06:28.199> use<00:06:29.199> a<00:06:29.229> median<00:06:29.800> filter<00:06:30.400> to<00:06:30.760> make

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
the Icicle use a median filter to make

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.430 
the Icicle use a median filter to make
it<00:06:31.870> a<00:06:32.020> little<00:06:32.250> rounder<00:06:33.250> and<00:06:33.780> there<00:06:34.780> you<00:06:34.930> have<00:06:35.139> a

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
it a little rounder and there you have a

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.670 
it a little rounder and there you have a
icicle<00:06:36.190> hanging<00:06:36.220> off<00:06:36.669> your<00:06:36.850> ice<00:06:37.060> and<00:06:37.500> you<00:06:38.500> can

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
icicle hanging off your ice and you can

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.280 
icicle hanging off your ice and you can
choose<00:06:39.250> to<00:06:39.580> give<00:06:39.850> it<00:06:39.970> some<00:06:40.090> reflection<00:06:40.780> that

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
choose to give it some reflection that

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.879 
choose to give it some reflection that
on<00:06:41.680> an<00:06:42.160> icicle<00:06:42.699> by<00:06:43.360> using<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.870> same<00:06:44.139> method<00:06:44.169> we

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
on an icicle by using the same method we

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.930 
on an icicle by using the same method we
did<00:06:45.190> with<00:06:45.639> the<00:06:46.419> rest<00:06:46.630> of<00:06:46.780> the<00:06:46.900> object<00:06:47.350> and

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
did with the rest of the object and

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.420 
did with the rest of the object and
that's<00:06:48.940> the<00:06:49.600> end<00:06:49.750> of<00:06:49.990> the<00:06:50.139> tutorials<00:06:50.889> if<00:06:51.220> you
