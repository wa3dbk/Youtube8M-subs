00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.030
 Hello, welcome to balance at 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.940
 game today I bring you the unboxing of the great 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.480
 tourism 6 of playstation3 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.830

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.830
 this edition and includes metal box the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.050
 collector 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.930
 and what I now tell you that they are 1000 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.060
 Create one million credits in the game 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.570
 20 cars with designs and improvements 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.570
 special 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 colors to personalize the cars 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.800
 pilot suit helmet and avatars 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.760
 after about three years or so 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.760
 that left the previous one to tourism 5 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.810
 now in December is ahead some 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.910
 days left on day 6 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.020
 as 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.020
 we have here for now 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.020
 and well the time is from the director 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.020
 kazunori yamauchi 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 director of the saga grand tourism and a 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.020
 great lover of the automotive 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.510
 and his studio polyphony 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.260
 which I think is property 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.260
 of the sonic 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.460
 and well let's find out what it contains and 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.820
 Apart, well, I will comment on what 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.820
 the 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.899
 the game includes 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.549
 12 thousand 196 cars of which 100 36 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.549
 they are new 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.009
 then it will come apart 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.939
 some thirty nine circuits 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.939
 including seven never seen 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.530
 and a goodbye mostly of enough 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.760
 curious to be the one of round 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.720
 thanks spanish 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.720
 the ascari circuit 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.460
 what promises a lot is the circuit 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.989
 let's open 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.160
 look if a plastic sleeve 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.160
 and 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.739
 then it would be the metal box with a tone 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.739
 lane car from top view 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.080
 and the metallic blue color 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.010
 clear that here they have not put anything in 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.200
 what is the song of the game 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.200
 let's open the content again 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.290
 this would be the disk 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.030
 it will be multi-region 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.300
 as the instructions and the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.300
 charges 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.290
 these are the codes 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.750
 to download it that you do not realize 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.750
 how to tell our instructions 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.310
 are the controls 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.490
 information 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.480
 typical of in this instruction in your 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.220
 bills 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.640
 we are not going to the interior design of the box 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.640
 metallic 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.610
 we had one grabbed the throat 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.610
 and part of a car to the front 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.600
 if one thing you the back cover of 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.420
 the box quite always but the design 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.620
 it is enough 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.340
 very front 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.340
 pretty 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.400
 to include a low of has not appeared 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.070
 very well as one is it creates me 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.790
 Other penalties to buy more 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.280
 credits and others 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.350
 it's good that neither is that a bit 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.350
 also to go do business but not 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.390
 it's something that I share 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.140
 as something beneficial for games and not 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.140
 Unlike 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.460
 and then you will have online mode only 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.150
 what 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.150
 it's pretty 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:57.790
 It stings enough that way you put on 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.790
 play with more people and enough time 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.139
 and well this is what unboxing is 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.300
 of the game 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.719
 apart then came the store where it has 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.719
 bought and downloaded 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.610
 of something quite curious 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.689
 but pendrive 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.080
 with bmw logo if it were a 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:21.199
 the keys of the car although with great 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.199
 tourism 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.490
 we 're not going to let the button be the 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.770
 pendrive 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.449
 a good gift for tradition 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.680
 then we have a player who enters here 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:40.440
 of memory is pretty good 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.730
 and once I think I have nothing more to 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.730
 to live on this 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.220
 here we have the chance of a boxing 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.600
 great tourism 6 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.350
 the 1 anniversary edition 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.580
 15 years since the first one came out 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.050
 first game 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.050
 it is up to today 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.650
 this is all guys a greeting and up 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.650
