00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
about our super duper

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.520 
about our super duper
we<00:00:12.210> really<00:00:12.389> know<00:00:12.509> what<00:00:12.599> they<00:00:12.690> call<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.900> yeah

we really know what they call it yeah
actually<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.190> was<00:00:14.340> developed<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.240> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
actually it was developed because of a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.910 
actually it was developed because of a
problem<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.750> had<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.230> past<00:00:16.379> around<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
problem we had in the past around this

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.529 
problem we had in the past around this
time<00:00:17.130> every<00:00:17.160> year<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:18.210> go<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> different

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
time every year we go to different

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.960 
time every year we go to different
schools<00:00:18.779> different<00:00:19.020> public<00:00:19.830> events<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.340> I

schools different public events and I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.670 
schools different public events and I
give<00:00:21.150> FPV<00:00:21.539> demonstrations<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.439> flying

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
give FPV demonstrations and flying

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.870 
give FPV demonstrations and flying
lessons<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.160> things<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.490> that

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
lessons and things like that

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.490 
lessons and things like that
well<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.480> pass<00:00:24.689> around<00:00:24.869> our<00:00:25.109> fat<00:00:25.260> shark

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
well we pass around our fat shark

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.349 
well we pass around our fat shark
goggles<00:00:25.920> well<00:00:26.039> there's<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> problem<00:00:26.580> yeah<00:00:27.210> it's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
goggles well there's a problem yeah it's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.179 
goggles well there's a problem yeah it's
a<00:00:27.420> very<00:00:27.599> singular<00:00:27.960> experience<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.800> basically

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
a very singular experience so basically

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.650 
a very singular experience so basically
when<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:29.730> goggles<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.179> nobody<00:00:30.539> can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
when you have your goggles on nobody can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.609 
when you have your goggles on nobody can
see<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.929> except<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.230> you

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

diversity<00:00:55.590> built-in<00:00:55.920> antenna<00:00:56.219> tracking<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
diversity built-in antenna tracking a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.150 
diversity built-in antenna tracking a
ton<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> amazing<00:00:57.930> features<00:00:58.320> they're<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.890> in

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
ton of amazing features they're all in

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
ton of amazing features they're all in
one<00:00:59.460> system<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.120> yeah<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.719> 100<00:01:01.020> bucks<00:01:01.050> more

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
one system so yeah it's 100 bucks more

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.410 
one system so yeah it's 100 bucks more
but<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.250> two<00:01:02.460> receivers<00:01:02.879> working<00:01:03.210> for

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
but you have two receivers working for

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
but you have two receivers working for
you<00:01:03.510> it'll<00:01:03.750> switch<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.140> whatever<00:01:04.409> gives<00:01:04.619> you

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you it'll switch to whatever gives you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
you it'll switch to whatever gives you
the<00:01:04.920> best<00:01:05.100> signal<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.970> also<00:01:06.119> grow

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the best signal and you can also grow

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.330 
the best signal and you can also grow
into<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> get<00:01:07.290> intended<00:01:07.710> tracking<00:01:08.070> for

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
into that and get intended tracking for

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.160 
into that and get intended tracking for
a<00:01:08.369> long<00:01:08.670> range<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.150> speaking<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.990> which<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
a long range and speaking of which you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.630 
a long range and speaking of which you
have<00:01:10.290> some<00:01:10.439> amazing<00:01:10.619> patch<00:01:11.010> antennas<00:01:11.460> for

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
have some amazing patch antennas for

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.060 
have some amazing patch antennas for
that<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:12.119> actually<00:01:12.299> using<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.110> immersion

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that we're actually using the immersion

the<00:01:17.220> red<00:01:17.340> wires<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.759> most<00:01:17.939> up-to-date<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the red wires it's most up-to-date you

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.700 
the red wires it's most up-to-date you
can<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.900> format<00:01:19.320> which<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.439> fantastic

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
can actually format which is fantastic

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
can actually format which is fantastic
and<00:01:20.460> supposedly<00:01:20.909> defend<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> stays<00:01:21.750> in

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and supposedly defend it it stays in

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.600 
and supposedly defend it it stays in
place<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.409> better<00:01:22.590> quality<00:01:22.740> too<00:01:23.130> but

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
place a little better quality too but

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.920 
place a little better quality too but
beyond<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.360> below<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.780> we

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
beyond that if you see below there we

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
beyond that if you see below there we
have<00:01:25.080> two<00:01:25.259> other<00:01:25.409> receivers<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.880> gives

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
have two other receivers and that gives

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760 
have two other receivers and that gives
us<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> ability<00:01:27.420> attaching<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> any<00:01:28.290> signal

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
us the ability attaching to any signal

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.859 
us the ability attaching to any signal
from<00:01:28.890> 900<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> way<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.150> 5.8<00:01:30.720> which

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
from 900 all the way up to 5.8 which

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.090 
from 900 all the way up to 5.8 which
should<00:01:31.049> brought<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.500> Joe<00:01:31.650> Nall<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.040> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
should brought this to Joe Nall but we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.950 
should brought this to Joe Nall but we
didn't<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> chance<00:01:32.460> music<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.659> all

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
didn't get a chance music because of all

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
didn't get a chance music because of all
the<00:01:34.079> rain<00:01:34.290> yeah<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.829> lot<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.460> other<00:01:35.579> really

flying events especially you know I love

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
flying events especially you know I love
quad<00:01:40.619> racing<00:01:40.979> yes<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.000> split

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
quad racing yes so now we can split

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.819 
quad racing yes so now we can split
those<00:01:42.450> video<00:01:42.689> signals<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.259> people<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.619> see

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
those video signals and people can see

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.440 
those video signals and people can see
the<00:01:44.070> race<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.270> let's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the race and they can see the the let's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
the race and they can see the the let's
flat<00:01:45.659> format<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.200> action<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.430> going

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
flat format in action as it's going

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.679 
flat format in action as it's going
along<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.540> good

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
along this would be a really good

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
along this would be a really good
application<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> lot<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.740> flying<00:01:49.950> clubs

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
application for a lot of flying clubs

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.830 
application for a lot of flying clubs
that<00:01:50.729> are<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.000> getting<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.270> fpv<00:01:51.689> they

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that are just getting into fpv they

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.880 
that are just getting into fpv they
could<00:01:51.990> take<00:01:52.110> one<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.350> these<00:01:52.409> hanging<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.829> in

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
could take one of these hanging up in

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.920 
could take one of these hanging up in
the<00:01:52.950> pavilion<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.790> very<00:01:54.030> economical<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.750> did

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the pavilion it's very economical we did

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
the pavilion it's very economical we did
it<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:56.070> relatively<00:01:56.729> cheap

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it all this for a relatively cheap

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.010 
it all this for a relatively cheap
amount<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.420> list<00:01:57.600> all<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.780> different

it's<00:02:09.920> by<00:02:10.250> no<00:02:10.280> means<00:02:10.460> long<00:02:10.759> range<00:02:11.030> but<00:02:11.240> it's

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's by no means long range but it's

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.990 
it's by no means long range but it's
long<00:02:11.990> enough<00:02:12.020> range<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.740> do<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.190> do<00:02:13.340> basic

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
long enough range to do to do basic

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.700 
long enough range to do to do basic
flying<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.720> one<00:02:14.900> thing<00:02:15.080> that's<00:02:15.260> really<00:02:15.350> handy

actually elevate your antennas up 1520

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.070 
actually elevate your antennas up 1520
feet<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.120> then<00:02:35.270> one<00:02:35.450> more<00:02:35.630> other<00:02:35.780> thing<00:02:35.990> a

while you might be wondering what that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.280 
while you might be wondering what that
chirping<00:02:37.459> noises<00:02:37.760> from<00:02:38.300> behind<00:02:38.480> us<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:39.170> is

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
chirping noises from behind us what is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.990 
chirping noises from behind us what is
it<00:02:39.470> that's<00:02:39.860> actually<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.430> assessing<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
it that's actually it's assessing the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.280 
it that's actually it's assessing the
video<00:02:41.209> signal<00:02:41.420> jumping<00:02:41.900> back<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.080> forth

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
video signal jumping back and forth

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.110 
video signal jumping back and forth
between<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.800> two<00:02:42.950> receivers<00:02:43.430> knows<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.790> or<00:02:43.880> do

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
between the two receivers knows it or do

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880 
between the two receivers knows it or do
the<00:02:44.540> duo<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:44.959> doing<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.380> yeah<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.709> doing

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
the duo is doing that yeah it's doing

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.740 
the duo is doing that yeah it's doing
that<00:02:45.950> incredibly<00:02:46.459> quickly<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.360> see<00:02:47.690> is

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
that incredibly quickly so I see is

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.270 
that incredibly quickly so I see is
flying<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.290> stuff<00:02:48.350> um<00:02:48.620> right<00:02:48.770> now<00:02:48.800> has<00:02:49.070> two

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
flying and stuff um right now has two

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.980 
flying and stuff um right now has two
matched<00:02:49.490> antennas<00:02:49.910> it's<00:02:50.270> not<00:02:50.420> gonna<00:02:50.570> be<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> big

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
matched antennas it's not gonna be a big

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.910 
matched antennas it's not gonna be a big
difference<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:51.410> if<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.560> had<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.680> patch

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
difference but if you had a patch

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.010 
difference but if you had a patch
antenna<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.459> spironet<00:02:52.970> one<00:02:53.570> you're<00:02:53.810> in

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
antenna and a spironet one you're in

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.270 
antenna and a spironet one you're in
line<00:02:54.290> with<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> passion<00:02:54.920> tenant<00:02:55.160> had<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
line with the passion tenant had a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.890 
line with the passion tenant had a
better<00:02:55.459> signal<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> map<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.390> jump<00:02:56.600> over

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
better signal and on a map to jump over

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.140 
better signal and on a map to jump over
and<00:02:57.350> jump<00:02:57.590> back<00:02:57.709> over<00:02:57.950> when<00:02:58.610> say<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.850> flew<00:02:59.090> out

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
and jump back over when say you flew out

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.310 
and jump back over when say you flew out
of<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.480> range<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.870> patch<00:03:00.050> antenna

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
of the range of that patch antenna

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.770 
of the range of that patch antenna
because<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.860> very<00:03:01.100> narrow<00:03:01.430> field<00:03:02.330> on<00:03:02.600> that

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
because it's a very narrow field on that

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.990 
because it's a very narrow field on that
cool<00:03:03.260> booster<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.280> try<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.519> out<00:03:04.640> what<00:03:04.790> about

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
now one thing we haven't talked about

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.160 
now one thing we haven't talked about
beforehand<00:03:36.150> it's<00:03:36.360> very<00:03:36.510> important<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.020> get<00:03:37.110> a

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
beforehand it's very important to get a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.809 
beforehand it's very important to get a
TV<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.620> doesn't<00:03:37.770> go<00:03:37.920> blue<00:03:38.069> screen<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> lot

off<00:03:42.300> which<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.660> fantastic<00:03:42.870> another<00:03:43.709> simple

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
off which is fantastic another simple

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.800 
off which is fantastic another simple
way<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.250> get<00:03:44.790> rid<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.000> blue<00:03:45.209> screen<00:03:45.450> not<00:03:45.630> to

way to get rid of blue screen not to

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.210 
way to get rid of blue screen not to
worry<00:03:45.989> about<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.380> by<00:03:46.560> putting<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.920> simple

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
worry about it is by putting a simple

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.120 
worry about it is by putting a simple
DVR<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.880> line<00:03:48.090> with<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.140> what<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.860> will<00:03:49.980> do<00:03:50.099> is

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
DVR in line with it what this will do is

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.710 
DVR in line with it what this will do is
this<00:03:50.250> will<00:03:50.459> actually<00:03:50.610> take<00:03:50.790> away<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.330> loss<00:03:51.540> of

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
this will actually take away the loss of

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.540 
this will actually take away the loss of
signal<00:03:51.930> from<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.410> TV<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:53.099> know<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:53.430> go

having<00:04:17.010> two<00:04:17.190> screens<00:04:17.549> at<00:04:17.700> once<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:18.030> definitely

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
having two screens at once is definitely

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.099 
having two screens at once is definitely
a<00:04:18.540> good<00:04:18.720> idea

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
a good idea

cuz you can fly with a friend and also

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.480 
cuz you can fly with a friend and also

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
have an audience people around they can

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.219 
have an audience people around they can
watch<00:04:23.700> so<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.330> do<00:04:24.540> get<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.720> little<00:04:24.840> break<00:04:25.080> up

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
watch so you do get a little break up

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.450 
watch so you do get a little break up
like<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.830> little<00:04:25.950> bit<00:04:26.070> more<00:04:26.280> on

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
like this it's a little bit more on

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.890 
like this it's a little bit more on
average<00:04:26.610> because<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.330> wall<00:04:27.540> that<00:04:27.570> works

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
average because of the wall that works

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.750 
average because of the wall that works
for<00:04:28.139> pushing<00:04:28.500> through<00:04:28.740> let's<00:04:29.280> see<00:04:29.430> this

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
for pushing through let's see this

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.520
