I<00:01:58.790> mean<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.149> not<00:01:59.240> responding<00:01:59.869> because<00:02:00.049> almost

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
I mean is not responding because almost

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.870 
I mean is not responding because almost
everybody<00:02:00.680> responds<00:02:01.340> when<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:01.610> give<00:02:01.759> the

everybody responds when we give the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.149 
everybody responds when we give the
treatment<00:02:02.119> but<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.020> relapsing<00:02:03.590> quickly<00:02:03.950> when
