what<00:00:17.260> was<00:00:17.410> it<00:00:17.529> about<00:00:17.619> it<00:00:17.770> it<00:00:18.160> was<00:00:18.310> at<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.490> time

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
what was it about it it was at a time

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.460 
what was it about it it was at a time
when<00:00:19.090> I<00:00:19.119> think<00:00:19.240> that<00:00:19.660> you<00:00:19.930> know<00:00:20.080> people<00:00:20.440> really

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
when I think that you know people really

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.850 
when I think that you know people really
needed<00:00:21.190> that<00:00:21.310> in<00:00:21.550> their<00:00:21.700> lives<00:00:21.910> that<00:00:22.860> whether

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
needed that in their lives that whether

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.710 
needed that in their lives that whether
it<00:00:24.040> was<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.250> economy<00:00:24.700> or<00:00:24.880> just<00:00:25.180> you<00:00:25.690> know

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
it was the economy or just you know

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.190 
it was the economy or just you know
separation<00:00:26.350> and<00:00:26.590> I<00:00:27.520> think<00:00:28.510> they<00:00:28.720> were<00:00:28.840> kind<00:00:29.140> of

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
separation and I think they were kind of

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.310 
separation and I think they were kind of
in<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:29.470> same<00:00:29.680> boat<00:00:29.740> right<00:00:30.190> now<00:00:30.460> so<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.869> it's

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
in the same boat right now so it's it's

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.920 
in the same boat right now so it's it's
know<00:00:32.950> and<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.430> music<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.330> dancing<00:00:34.750> and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
know and the music and the dancing and

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.960 
know and the music and the dancing and
it's<00:00:35.020> so<00:00:35.140> freeing<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.650> uplifting<00:00:36.129> and<00:00:36.309> yeah

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
it's so freeing and uplifting and yeah

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.430 
it's so freeing and uplifting and yeah
there's<00:00:37.210> heart<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:37.900> it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
there's heart to it

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.560 
there's heart to it
and<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.650> had<00:00:38.860> edge<00:00:39.129> to<00:00:39.460> it<00:00:39.610> like<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.210> know<00:00:40.330> I<00:00:40.360> I

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
and it had edge to it like you know I I

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.780 
and it had edge to it like you know I I
didn't<00:00:41.019> see<00:00:41.199> it<00:00:41.290> in<00:00:41.440> theaters<00:00:42.129> but<00:00:42.370> Craig

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
didn't see it in theaters but Craig

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.250 
didn't see it in theaters but Craig
Brewer<00:00:42.940> our<00:00:43.120> director<00:00:43.600> I<00:00:43.629> saw<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.019> when<00:00:44.110> he<00:00:44.199> was

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
Brewer our director I saw it when he was

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.410 
Brewer our director I saw it when he was
13<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:44.949> he<00:00:45.010> was<00:00:45.220> blown<00:00:45.460> away<00:00:45.610> by<00:00:45.909> because<00:00:46.300> it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
13 and he was blown away by because it

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.899 
13 and he was blown away by because it
wasn't<00:00:46.870> light<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:47.769> fluffy<00:00:47.979> there<00:00:48.370> was<00:00:48.489> a<00:00:48.519> you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
wasn't light and fluffy there was a you

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.729 
wasn't light and fluffy there was a you
know<00:00:48.970> kind<00:00:49.330> of<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:49.479> deep<00:00:49.720> story<00:00:50.080> to<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.470> and<00:00:50.620> had

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
know kind of a deep story to it and had

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.380 
know kind of a deep story to it and had
edge<00:00:50.979> along<00:00:51.550> with<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.940> cool<00:00:52.120> performance

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
edge along with the cool performance

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.020 
edge along with the cool performance
part<00:00:52.839> of<00:00:52.989> it<00:00:53.110> but<00:00:53.409> I<00:00:53.620> think<00:00:53.949> that's<00:00:54.190> why<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.879> to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
part of it but I think that's why and to

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.299 
part of it but I think that's why and to
get<00:00:55.150> to<00:00:55.269> revisit<00:00:55.720> all<00:00:55.839> those<00:00:55.989> emotions<00:00:56.470> in<00:00:56.680> our

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
get to revisit all those emotions in our

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.880 
get to revisit all those emotions in our
version<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.970> important<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.110> I<00:00:59.379> think<00:00:59.739> the

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
version is important and I think the

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.630 
version is important and I think the
original<00:01:00.040> fans<00:01:00.790> are<00:01:01.390> getting<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.900> do<00:01:02.049> that<00:01:02.229> so

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
original fans are getting to do that so

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.090 
original fans are getting to do that so
so<00:01:03.640> yeah<00:01:03.820> it's<00:01:04.089> back<00:01:04.299> yeah<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.860> know<00:01:05.979> the
