00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
beginning an artifact that was in a much

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.120 
beginning an artifact that was in a much
better<00:02:37.900> idea<00:02:38.069> but<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.519> other<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:40.620> for<00:02:41.620> visual

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
better idea but the other is for visual

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.009

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
you can see it eat much easier on camera

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.509 
you can see it eat much easier on camera
but<00:02:47.019> I'm<00:02:47.140> gonna<00:02:47.230> put<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.590> back<00:02:47.829> down<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.400> the

and you always tilt this a little don't

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.950 
and you always tilt this a little don't
keep<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.390> straight<00:03:04.750> down<00:03:06.480> if<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.570> tilt<00:03:07.810> it

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
keep it straight down if you tilt it

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.770 
keep it straight down if you tilt it
just<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.260> drop<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.790> get<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> little<00:03:10.150> more<00:03:10.240> action

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
just a drop you get a little more action

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.980 
just a drop you get a little more action
a<00:03:11.050> little<00:03:11.650> much<00:03:11.950> too<00:03:12.400> much<00:03:12.580> tilting<00:03:13.060> it'll<00:03:13.900> be

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
a little much too much tilting it'll be

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:22.410 
a little much too much tilting it'll be
on<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.260> ceiling

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.920 

that's<00:03:23.420> good<00:03:23.630> enough<00:03:25.450> now<00:03:26.450> we'll<00:03:26.570> just<00:03:26.720> take

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that's good enough now we'll just take

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.660 
that's good enough now we'll just take

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.990 
texture right now as you can see we're
going<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.680> let<00:03:57.830> that<00:03:57.950> reduce<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.760> little

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
going to let that reduce just a little

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.900 
going to let that reduce just a little
bit<00:03:59.210> and<00:04:00.070> then<00:04:01.070> we'll<00:04:01.190> put<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.520> through<00:04:01.670> the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
bit and then we'll put it through the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.590 
bit and then we'll put it through the
xinhua<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.810> make<00:04:02.960> it<00:04:03.140> smooth<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.690> delicious

now if the easy pouring I place it back

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.520 
now if the easy pouring I place it back
into<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.960> pot<00:04:12.200> again<00:04:12.530> there's<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.280> xinhua

let's<00:05:32.350> look<00:05:32.530> at<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.770> consistency<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:34.230> still

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
let's look at the consistency of still

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.890 
let's look at the consistency of still
have<00:05:35.380> some<00:05:35.560> more<00:05:35.710> on<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:35.890> outside<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.550> this

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
have some more on the outside of this

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.830 
have some more on the outside of this
scrape<00:05:37.900> it<00:05:38.080> down<00:05:38.110> very<00:05:38.680> nicely<00:05:39.600> see<00:05:40.600> what<00:05:40.750> we

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
scrape it down very nicely see what we

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.560 
scrape it down very nicely see what we
have<00:05:41.020> here<00:05:41.520> how<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:42.580> sauce<00:05:42.940> looks<00:05:43.270> when<00:05:43.450> we

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
have here how the sauce looks when we

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.340 
have here how the sauce looks when we
pour<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:45.130> how<00:05:45.220> much<00:05:45.400> we<00:05:45.580> have

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
pour and how much we have

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.130 
pour and how much we have
now<00:05:47.350> when<00:05:47.500> that<00:05:47.620> chills<00:05:48.720> that's<00:05:49.720> going<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.050> be

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
now when that chills that's going to be

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.510 
now when that chills that's going to be
a<00:05:50.170> drop<00:05:50.470> thicker<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.990> that's<00:05:53.200> good<00:05:53.520> well

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
a drop thicker so that's good well

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.500 
a drop thicker so that's good well
that's<00:05:56.340> if<00:05:57.340> this<00:05:57.490> was<00:05:57.670> full<00:05:57.850> to<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.060> top<00:05:58.150> would

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
that's if this was full to the top would

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.930 
that's if this was full to the top would
be<00:05:58.570> half<00:05:58.720> a<00:05:58.870> quart<00:05:59.140> and<00:05:59.830> this<00:06:00.280> is<00:06:00.430> good<00:06:00.640> if<00:06:00.820> you

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
be half a quart and this is good if you

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.050 
be half a quart and this is good if you
had<00:06:01.170> 12<00:06:02.170> people<00:06:02.590> over<00:06:02.680> for<00:06:03.100> dinner<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.520> you
