00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:18.439
 the story of Hispanic weapons follows their adventures in the field of doors 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.489
 sol calibur broken destiny actress ante st 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.919
 with a by the last installment of the series but with certain shortcomings 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.099
 the little sony console 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.379
 can have its faults but fighting games is well served to titles like 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.219
 the queen and the resurrection visible to fish fantasy oresky panther soaring 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.010
 join them now sol charges 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.200
 the first thing that attracts attention 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.130
 I am extremely similar that looks with respect to the version appeared in 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.220
 Mexico makes 63 6 before taking into account the technical differences between 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.410
 such systems 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.710
 and is that this charge is portable 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.719
 keeps all the characters of the previous delivery except for the 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.250
 star goals characters 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.610
 and the clone fighters designed by mangakas 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.630
 kamsky mussi 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.910
 as a small novelty we have two new additions adding up a total 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.220
 of 28 contenders 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.140
 fran piera a strange and comical character tries to make the enemy what 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.539
 underestimate to catch you unprepared 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.609
 and the guest kratos from voting for 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.880
 Kratos is a very powerful fighter with devastators with you 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.329
 but that is somewhat slow these two characters have their own level in the 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.329
 game being the rest recycled from previous deliveries 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.310
 all the movements of sun calibur 4 have been respected, finding us with a 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.380
 almost exact replica of its playability except for some small change and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.330
 the physical 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.130
 where a more remarkable change is experienced 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.860
 is in the system of critical endings while the desktop version 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.010
 we had to break the soul meter and take advantage of that moment to 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.360
 press all the buttons to the network in broken destiny and it is enough for us that 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.979
 medium is weakened 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.929
 eel cajal a special attack while that state lasts to make an end 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.929
 peaceful we win and one goes away automatically 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:28.039
 if we see that our storage meter too fast and we have 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.480
 what to go 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.209
 rival put an end to the game with this powerful movement we can always 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.950
 destroy ourselves 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.410
 our weapons meter 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.669
 inti gas and 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:40.589
 that can finish them off with a critical end at the cost of losing our 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.249
 clothes and armor 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.609
 not only the playable section is almost traced to the previous release I think 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.049
 that the graph is very similar always keeping the distances with respect to the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.829
 power of a console like psp 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.719
 they are calibur broken destiny is very impressive exploiting butt 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.629
 console there are no slowdowns everything is shown fluid and perfectly animated 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.659
 the melodies and the voices are at a good level 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.619
 that we are used to behind 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.519
 since although it has some new subject almost all the sound section is 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.119
 recycled but although so far everything seems perfect in this game not 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.809
 highlights in a section as important for a fighting game as are the 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.019
 game modes 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.999
 broken destiny and does not have an arcade mode 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.179
 something that is almost a ritual in any fighting game 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:28.410
 for more inri 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.850
 does not have a story like the previous installments, not even with 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.770
 the possibility of playing online everything is relegated to only four cases 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.370
 modes together with the possibility of challenging a friend through a connection 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.419
 wireless and the typical survival 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.540
 we have a mother of the story mode that serves as a tutorial called the 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:52.379
 glove and another denominated fast game being this one to which more played was 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.729
 can you take out 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:57.949
 in the mountain we will advance by several stories based on the world are charges 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:02.399
 each with a more stupid argument than the previous one before starting each 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:03.150
 chapter 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.599
 a simple text accompanied by some image will put us in action happening 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.140
 later to make a number of injured each challenge does not last more than 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.359
 three seconds and consists of dodging the enemy's attack or counteracting it 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.829
 this way we will discover the weak points of all the characters although 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.829
 in the long run it becomes repeated and has occurred 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.460
 the fast split mode although its name indicates and the opposite is the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.270
 most interesting section 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.020
 we have 200 different rivals to face 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.070
 each one with its statistics of won and lost games and a title 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.660
 that we will have to take them 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.630
 being able to choose between the eight that the machine shows us before starting 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.630
 each combat 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.260
 to extend the life of the game 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.130
 we have a very interesting character editor is not as complete as the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.690
 the desktop version is available but taking into account the limitations of 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.690
 the machine is very well worn 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:05.189
 also 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.029
 for fans of achievement this game has a system similar to that of the 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:13.669
 major consoles called successes with various challenges such as touring a 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.569
 total distance to perform a certain number of critical endings 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.279
 2 false 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.170
 the feeling obtained to play soul calibur broken 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.370
 summary is quite improvable this version turns out to be a because it is 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.080
 tuned from the previous version 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.020
 maintaining a high level of traffic 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.240
 but losing motorcycles and various aspects along the way 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.719
 creating a bittersweet feeling for the player 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.319
 a fun that turns out to play it not having that real challenges apart from the 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.020
 incivility 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.330
 the glove or the fast starting make the player can wear very soon 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.870
 of the title above all 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.640
 will like fans of the saga who will find in it the possibility of 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.480
 practice with your favorite characters anywhere 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.840
 being also available at a reduced price
