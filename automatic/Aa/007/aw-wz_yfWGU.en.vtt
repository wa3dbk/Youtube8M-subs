00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.460
 for this video we're going to start with the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.460
 cleaning I will apply thermal water 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.100
 and then the physiological micellar solution 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.860

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.740
 Enough 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:33.500
 you apply it with your fingertips 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:34.700
 they are absorbed very quickly we know that 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.560
 the skin around the eyes 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.020
 requires special care for that 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.820

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.700
 caffeine on the seventh detected

 decongestant that helps you 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.340
 decrease the forces of the eyes applied 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.070

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.470
 A) Yes 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.290
 and then extend from inside towards 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.870
 outside in the face we are going to apply 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.300
 Giraffe intense leggett a treatment

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:30.580
 holds water in the skin for a 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:32.290
 lasting hydration last not 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.090
 you can forget the sun protection that 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.470

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.240
 unify your skin therefore we are not going to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.800

 I feel more hydrated and luminous and 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.000
 It also feels softer to the touch already 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.250
