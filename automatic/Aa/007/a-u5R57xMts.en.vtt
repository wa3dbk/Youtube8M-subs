00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.259
 hello girls so I introduce myself 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.420
 my name is them 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.950
 it's been a while since I thought 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.590
 make videos and on youtube but that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.469
 I had never really started so 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.560
 there after much thought I decided 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.380
 of finally a famous start a chain 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 youtube so I'll start with a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 video that we see a lot 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.560
 a lot right now it's obviously 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.150
 a video of the series back to school 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 so I close you supplies 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.170
 back to school because 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 I love watching this kind of videos and 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.840
 that often we do not really know what 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.059
 to take in the fall we do not know if 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 we must wait to see our teachers or 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.140
 if we do not have to wait for 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.020
 it's been three years since I 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 in high school I redoubled my second so 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.120
 I'll go home when I first 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.320
 should get a terminal by flying a 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.539
 so I'll show you right now 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.690
 but to do so I go back to 1st 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.140
 technological so in a g booth 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.940
 management and management 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.120
 I will make a video on this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.250
 die if it may interest you but 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 I think it's not really very 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.570
 complicated to explain what is a lot 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.299
 on the internet information on this 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.619
 die so that's it short I started 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.890
 right now so I'll start with 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.280
 show you my school bag so my 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.830
 school bag tied like this so it's up to 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.780
 zadig and voltaire I got them for my 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.360
 anniversary 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.070
 for my 17 years so it's a gift that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.619
 I had in advance because I laughed 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.560
 time as September 13 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.500
 so here are the dictator crises he 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.650
 is in mourning he is very very tall I 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 know that it is very very expensive and 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.950
 Besides, I have a lot of luck 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.210
 to have a family qu'israel will be 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.640
 all gathered to see the father this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.820
 gift because I really wanted it 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.180
 so that's really my bag of 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.340
 love I loved the magic so to 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.930
 inside it's like that the same 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.990
 poached 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.340
 by then with food crises and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.719
 inside 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.700
 the screen so then I'll go 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:14.690
 show that my kit so it's a 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:18.870
 head baker she is very flashy pink 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:23.430
 so I bought them last summer in 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 spain in a water without a camera that 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.989
 is called el corte inglÃ¨s and so here 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.519
 I want to show what is an interior 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.640
 very briefly so a glue I have some 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:39.090
 pens so I 'm really sorry 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.940
 but I do not know how to read this 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.040
 so mark his stats the hour I 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.799
 the impression so the veil there are full 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.790
 of colors every year I take the 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.250
 parade of colors I try to change 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.959
 brand every year because I have 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.129
 not really found martine's fashion 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:01.650
 really fit a good one here it is 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:03.269
 there is the relay here are colors a little 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.220
 little funky and normal colors too 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.310
 because I love writing with colors 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.590
 normal then I have a stiff 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.639
 flexible so that's the one I had 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.920
 last year because she is not 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.209
 damaged and that I do not really use 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.049
 graduations ourselves even if they are 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.900
 really erase this serious morning 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.980
 then an eraser a blanco which 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.920
 come from hema a fountain pen 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.639
 for white with a little ax on it 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.500
 I know it's really damn pretty kid 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:41.329
 but then I have criteria g1 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.960
 stabilo and I have a small sign 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.950
 then 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.950
 so I have my agenda so it's a 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.830
 student agenda so I ordered 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.080
 photos for I printed some 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.530
 pictures to see put a picture the of 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.910
 me my fight my group and me and 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.950
 behind I put pictures of my 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.140
 best friend and me i had 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.380
 thanks to the apo boxing I had done 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.890
 about six months ago between like that 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.660
 so here it is pink to basic and 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.250
 I love the interior actually because it 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.840
 purified mastery there was not a 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.860
 big threat change for notes 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.100
 and all that 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:23.940
 so I wait then I did my 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.110
 shopping at monoprix rue de la 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.200
 republic because I live in 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.710
 marseille so because I come back in 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.160
 first 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.640
 I have some less topics like 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.450
 chemistry chemistry leaves summer and I 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.070
 believe that's all in fact 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.690
 the science subjects I like 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.810
 not at all that I was more so 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.160
 better so for one of the topics that goes 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.040
 still be pretty important in my 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.770
 die is maths and I decided 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.510
 to take notebooks to what I 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.120
 find it anyway easier to 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.580
 follow on notebooks so suddenly 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.970
 these are spiral notebooks because 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.730
 I only use the spiral of 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.170
 playmate spiral notebooks then for 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.450
 all other materials ie 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:13.920
 french english spanish 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:18.330
 history-geo civic education and I 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.160
 believe that's all I have an organizer 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.750
 book so I discovered that a year ago 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.880
 and I find it really practical in 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.270
 so does in fact you see before you 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:30.570
 have fed then you have facts 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.370
 that you can spare and then 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.290
 you have tabs for them 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.270
 rows of shrimp it's a sorter 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.980
 improved in radio is obviously 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.240
 behind there is the flap rocket for 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.240
 the postmen control all that 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.090
 then then as I get into a 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.900
 first technological technique 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.160
 I have three more subjects that are the 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.259
 more important for the ferry 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.000
 so there is the management of 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.250
 organizations so I had to buy a 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.840
 kind of room and the drink book in 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.430
 English everyone saw that bin 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:07.039
 it's a kind of world book but I 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.030
 could go with that I took a 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.830
 cardboard sleeve with leaves 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.120
 because I'm going to write my classes 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.930
 this matter only on faults 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.720
 that I would then put in the pocket 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.360
 I obviously have the right make it too cool 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.110
 I can not wait to start with a 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.910
 cover too and then I 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.750
 the economy and the economy all chirac 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.130
 dance in a big fat binders that I 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.610
 will keep at home because the economy 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:41.690
 it's the bigger stuff beyond the 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.909
 stm I have so here I have some 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.530
 cards because I actually rely on 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:46.849
 each end of chapter make 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.919
 chapter cracks to be able to them 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.409
 revise for the tray and all because 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.330
 it's going to be enough as long as not judge this 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.370
 year so here I have to 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.139
 really works a lot and I have not 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.150
 to rest on my laurels we go 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.699
 say so suddenly that's so I took 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.039
 sheets 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:07.159
 then I have my calculator that I 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:10.520
 since the second already it's a 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:11.539
 mathematical calculator because I 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.340
 know it's the one I'm asked to 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:16.250
 high school so suddenly I kept them 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.639
 the blues and walk very well here a 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.979
 first raid crews to change and I 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.560
 have to tell you it's all here 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:27.800
 that's all for my supplies from the 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.310
 back so I think to do the tag back 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.719
 to school 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:34.880
 I think even make a makeup for 

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:36.169
 back to school for high school girls for even 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.729
 pollute college because I'm 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.550
 makeup not really much less 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:42.560
 so here I think I'm doing this video 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.960
 here to videos that interest you 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.159
 a little mans comment it's me 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.660
 would really be happy to make them 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:49.100
 because that's it 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.910
 I think I found a new 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:55.060
 passion with youtube beauty videos 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.810
 the videos tags the halls and all that stuff 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.920
 it's really something that 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.990
 like a lot and I would really like 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.760
 deepen her so says no to 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.040
 comments if you want to see me in 

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.870
 a particular video and I will do it 

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.870
 with great pleasure of the eyes
