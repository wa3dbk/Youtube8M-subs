00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
screens or two projectors that's pretty

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.760 
screens or two projectors that's pretty
much<00:03:02.090> how<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:02.300> hook<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.690> up<00:03:02.840> but<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.380> have<00:03:03.560> one

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
much how you hook it up but you have one

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.230 
much how you hook it up but you have one
to<00:03:03.890> four<00:03:04.070> wires<00:03:04.310> however<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.390> need<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.770> okay

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
to four wires however you need it okay

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.820 
to four wires however you need it okay
this<00:03:08.240> is<00:03:08.330> how<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.510> hook<00:03:08.750> up<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:08.930> set<00:03:09.380> up<00:03:09.530> it's

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
this is how you hook up that set up it's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.970 
this is how you hook up that set up it's
pretty<00:03:10.040> simple<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.810> hdmi<00:03:12.560> output

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
pretty simple I like the hdmi output

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.770 
pretty simple I like the hdmi output
because<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.550> hdmi<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.090> actually<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.630> lot

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
because the hdmi is actually a lot

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.470 
because the hdmi is actually a lot
better<00:03:14.840> connection<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.970> carries<00:03:16.970> both<00:03:17.090> audio

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
better connection I carries both audio

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.360 
better connection I carries both audio
and<00:03:17.540> video<00:03:17.870> connection<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.100> need<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
and video connection we don't need the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.890 
and video connection we don't need the
audio<00:03:19.580> connection<00:03:20.000> when<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.209> mobile<00:03:20.510> djing

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
audio connection when I mobile djing

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.500 
audio connection when I mobile djing
because<00:03:21.200> I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510
