have returned from the clash of clones

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.600 
have returned from the clash of clones
events<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.000> two<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:40.310> 24<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:43.610> no

really<00:03:31.850> we<00:03:32.720> will<00:03:32.900> be<00:03:33.050> getting<00:03:33.230> glass<00:03:33.830> as<00:03:34.160> well

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
really we will be getting glass as well

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.100 
really we will be getting glass as well
you'll<00:03:34.610> notice<00:03:34.790> here<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.450> can<00:03:35.570> see<00:03:35.600> the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
glass we haven't got the glass just yet

glass we haven't got the glass just yet
I'll<00:03:40.190> be<00:03:40.370> getting<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.790> little<00:03:41.120> bit<00:03:41.270> later<00:03:41.420> on

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
I'll be getting it a little bit later on

in this and this act - if I recall but
it's<00:03:46.250> pretty<00:03:46.640> simple<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.270> far<00:03:47.510> there's<00:03:47.750> not

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
it's pretty simple so far there's not

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.010 
it's pretty simple so far there's not
much<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.350> this<00:03:48.530> especially<00:03:48.920> in<00:03:49.220> act<00:03:49.400> 2<00:03:49.610> is

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
much to this especially in act 2 is

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.800 
much to this especially in act 2 is
continuing<00:03:51.020> to<00:03:51.110> do<00:03:51.230> what<00:03:51.350> you're<00:03:51.530> doing<00:03:51.580> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
continuing to do what you're doing the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
continuing to do what you're doing the
blueprints<00:03:53.810> are<00:03:53.959> now<00:03:54.140> going<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.709> be

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
blueprints are now going to be

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.130 
blueprints are now going to be
substituted<00:03:55.220> for<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.270> duct<00:03:56.510> tape<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.110> just

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
substituted for the duct tape and just

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.290 
substituted for the duct tape and just
continue<00:03:57.980> what<00:03:58.070> you're<00:03:58.220> doing<00:03:58.280> pretty<00:03:58.850> simple

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
possums as well with the lamagno station

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.520 
possums as well with the lamagno station
there's<00:04:05.570> one<00:04:05.780> there<00:04:05.959> you'll<00:04:06.110> get<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.350> get<00:04:06.470> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
there's one there you'll get you get the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.740 
there's one there you'll get you get the
same<00:04:06.890> as<00:04:07.190> before<00:04:08.000> with<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.209> blueprints

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
same as before with the blueprints

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.810 
same as before with the blueprints
you'll<00:04:08.959> get<00:04:09.170> 10<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.590> duct<00:04:09.830> tape<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.310> this

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
you'll get 10 of the duct tape and this

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.570 
you'll get 10 of the duct tape and this
is<00:04:10.970> my<00:04:11.120> monomial<00:04:11.660> station<00:04:12.080> at<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.290> moment<00:04:12.680> you

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
is my monomial station at the moment you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.940 
is my monomial station at the moment you
can<00:04:13.730> kind<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.000> see<00:04:14.150> I'm<00:04:14.360> just<00:04:14.560> making<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.620> circle

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
can kind of see I'm just making a circle

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.409 
can kind of see I'm just making a circle
out<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:16.340> don't<00:04:16.549> know<00:04:16.640> exactly<00:04:17.000> where<00:04:17.299> I'm

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
out of it I don't know exactly where I'm

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.539 
out of it I don't know exactly where I'm
gonna<00:04:17.540> put<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.900> yet<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.350> don't<00:04:18.950> know<00:04:19.190> where

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.670 
gonna put this yet I don't know where
it's<00:04:19.730> gonna<00:04:19.910> go<00:04:20.060> in<00:04:20.450> terms<00:04:20.600> up<00:04:20.840> looping<00:04:21.530> and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
it's gonna go in terms up looping and

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.040 
it's gonna go in terms up looping and
stuff<00:04:21.950> but<00:04:22.250> I'll<00:04:23.000> figure<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.419> out<00:04:23.479> later<00:04:23.630> I'm

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
stuff but I'll figure that out later I'm

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.870 
stuff but I'll figure that out later I'm
just<00:04:24.260> putting<00:04:24.919> down<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.160> tracks<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.640> stuff
