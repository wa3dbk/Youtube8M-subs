00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.449
 no disk to appear at the bottom of your screen but we still go 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.390
 to do it is an exit for carlat 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.480
 Warning 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.410
 but I am an animal rescued the prehistoric period my body measures 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.230
 more than 5 meters long covered with scales I already have 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.200

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.860
 as for the jaw it can exert tax pressure the 350 kilos of 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.350

 the popularity of the candidates while mickaÃ«l to the children 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.650
 for this time to discover 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.120
 nearly 500 years archers in a single anderson park of 6500 meters 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.360

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.160
 this park 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.340
 he has a particularity 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.950

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.180
 basin 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.460
 and you hung two or three meters above them 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.700
 on the footbridges and you wander through banana frangipani 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.450

 and then the kids are feasting so you have 90 games to do in the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.000
 trees 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.100

 you can finish act a meter high 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.730
 his villa on average it lasts three hours to make a name integrity 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.290
 the park is very funny you have tired very quickly since 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.110
 the facts two years ago and i still come back no gilles cojan is going 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.430
 and the matter of adequacy with a lesser evil 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.299
 in any case 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.450
 little advice dress light because many of the best players 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.409
 very very hot and then do not do like me that is to say air he had 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.470
 that fish continent still not seen yet 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.840
 passers-by the party on a center passing from alsace by embracing this 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.850
 this is the year of the new horizons with m a loan conveying 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.400
 eu-imf 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.540
 % you claim to push to play more and more in land purpose you 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.609
 are mr j -c 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:11.840
 undertaking sometimes even 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.950
 audacious and unethical you will have to give the means to achieve 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.989
 your purposes 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.239
 me robin leproux has no escape for the year 2005 there are still two 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.059
 months before 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.680
 today to enjoy it 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.019
 thank you very much for being seated to know anyway while women 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.109
 who are working on the asylum application has been halted has the fatigue at 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.900
 students and besides I'll start with you have states 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.790
 she said 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.569
 they were given by the sofres in February 2005 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.819
 firstly almost 50% of teens in% feel on the bench during the 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.629
 day but it's once a week 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.309
 and for the senses of three I suffer 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.289
 of pathological tendency posing in adapted seeds died during 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:49.329
 lessons 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.909
 so why this time 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.889
 outside of sleep it can also be stress because teens 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.759
 to afford a stressed man so already for art is school 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.999
 in a series the simpsons in combined 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.130
 it does not favor woerth in order to value 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.049
 the human element that work for their parents 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.299
 it is also stress because ben there is place the boy 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.000
 to hairs 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.110
 she concluded this opinion it is time that it be done a little bit what 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.099
 be it 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.500
 another factor that has this time and totally biological hormonal is the 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.730
 puberty aya to present himself per cent the body is transformed and that makes 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.930
 illegally teenagers 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.799
 and often adults do not think about it 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.849
 but it's true that m the root cause of all this is the top it's a 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.429
 very bad lifestyle 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.880
 since teenagers go to bed on average 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.590
 ap 11 and a half hours what makes them only it's a sleep myth by 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.540
 the mud it's not so little over in the nine hours actually 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.529
 9am to 9am by record time per se 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.289
 they dance in this year so that every day he accuses a 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.469
 hour and a half late 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.409
 and at the end of the week he said to himself as soon as they catch up with him during the 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.029
 weekend 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.979
 but it's not good either because it shifts the white rum into a 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.199
 term so so not important on the temperature do you think that 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.199
 in the state with socks it promotes sleep 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:58.909
 olmert 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.949
 by his mother personally we 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.199
 the Japanese company so it's true that it's not very suitable is it 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.150
 happiness 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.109
 not surprising 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.869
 it's a year 7 experienced by scientists in space and 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:12.049
 socks promotes for sleep that are actually warming up the little ones 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.539
 blood vessels is found 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.129
 after two feet 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.959
 the kids died a lot ranking 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.449
 much better and it is true that we know it is not at all aesthetic e 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.860
 but hey it's like that in reality the sock in the void and 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.470
 then I even know who sleep and caps at night in the middle of winter
