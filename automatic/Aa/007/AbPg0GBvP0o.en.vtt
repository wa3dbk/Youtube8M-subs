00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
I'm hardcore you do that and you break

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.609 
I'm hardcore you do that and you break
your<00:01:50.130> leg<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.689> mean<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.290> fun

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
your leg so I think that I mean it's fun

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.600 
your leg so I think that I mean it's fun
and<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.600> good<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.520> what<00:01:56.520> do

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and you know it's it's good and what do

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.090 
and you know it's it's good and what do
you<00:01:56.670> say<00:01:56.850> about<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.329> big<00:01:57.689> difference<00:01:58.200> about

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
you say about the big difference about

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490 
you say about the big difference about
playing<00:01:59.430> junior<00:01:59.790> tournaments<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.960> tf2<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
playing junior tournaments and I tf2 and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.630 
playing junior tournaments and I tf2 and
smaller<00:02:02.040> winners

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
smaller winners

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.450 
smaller winners
and<00:02:03.030> coming<00:02:03.330> into<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.720> WTA<00:02:04.260> and<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.130> think<00:02:05.340> it's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and coming into a WTA and I think it's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.270 
and coming into a WTA and I think it's
just<00:02:05.550> different<00:02:05.880> minds<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.510> different<00:02:06.930> girls

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
just different minds at different girls

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.010 
just different minds at different girls
the<00:02:08.280> girls<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.759> haven't<00:02:09.030> matured<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.509> much<00:02:09.539> yet

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the girls we haven't matured as much yet

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.740 
the girls we haven't matured as much yet
and<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.610> mean<00:02:11.970> some<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.660> these

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and I think that I mean some of these

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.510 
and I think that I mean some of these
girls<00:02:12.990> have<00:02:13.110> been<00:02:13.200> planning<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.770> WTA<00:02:14.040> tour

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
girls have been planning on the WTA tour

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.280 
girls have been planning on the WTA tour
for<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.850> really<00:02:15.090> long<00:02:15.120> time<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.990> think

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
for a really long time and I think

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.870 
for a really long time and I think
they're<00:02:16.590> really<00:02:16.890> experienced<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.700> they<00:02:17.760> know

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
they're really experienced and they know

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.940 
they're really experienced and they know
what<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.480> think<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
what to do and I think it's just the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.490 
what to do and I think it's just the
younger<00:02:20.700> girls<00:02:20.940> aren't<00:02:21.420> as<00:02:21.510> experienced<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
younger girls aren't as experienced and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.740 
younger girls aren't as experienced and
they<00:02:22.800> don't<00:02:22.980> really<00:02:23.100> know<00:02:23.640> what<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> do<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.720> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
they don't really know what to do so I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.520 
they don't really know what to do so I
think<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.320> that's<00:02:25.590> one<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> main<00:02:26.550> like

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
think that that's one of the main like

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.960 
think that that's one of the main like
differences<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.920> experience<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.850> know

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
differences the experience and you know

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.910 
differences the experience and you know
knowing<00:02:30.270> what<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.660> out<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.200> yeah

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
knowing what to do out there so yeah

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.810 
knowing what to do out there so yeah
