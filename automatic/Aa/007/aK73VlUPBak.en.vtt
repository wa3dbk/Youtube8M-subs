00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 anything else and I talked to you about it 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.490
 in title we speak of it as one of the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.230
 most spectacular discoveries and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.059
 the most revolutionary in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.710
 medical I want to talk about cells 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.290
 stem is now an activity 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.240
 full-fledged economic in France the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.470
 parliament authorized it mid July under 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.539
 the control of the arrangement of the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.880
 biomedicine and the decision was validated 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.210
 by the constitutional council beginning 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.220
 August 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
 five disease treatment projects 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.029
 cardiac cancer and skin cancer 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.580
 diabetes are going on but so how 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.320
 Cell therapy works before 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.290
 to talk about it with our guest researchers 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 see this report 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.820
 one lab and one factory at a time 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.370
 these biologists manipulates cells 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.910
 intended to repair an organ 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.739
 sick it's the cell therapy 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.989
 practiced here for the first time at 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.760
 industrial scale 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.480
 with this public laboratory of 80 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.940
 millions of euros 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.840
 France goes to conquer the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.180
 medicine of tomorrow 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.260
 the cell therapy market is a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.399
 market in full emergence 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.920
 it's a growth reserve 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.379
 considerable it progresses from 20 to 40% 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.229
 per year the servant the leader tomorrow he 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.700
 must invest in people indeed 500 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 million euros in 2012 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.979
 the cell therapy market 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.100
 is expected to climb to 5 billion in 2015 10 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.610
 billion in 2020 here we are doing on 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.799
 measured 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.060
 the principle is to cure a sick person with 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.640
 his own cells 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.710
 five treatment projects are underway 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.409
 they concern heart disease 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.530
 skin cancer or the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.180
 diabetes 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.760
 we chose to start with 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.040
 diseases always very serious actually 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.990
 rare or very rare so these few 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.440
 hundreds of patients per disease in 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.380
 la France 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.140
 cell therapy patrick cox mother 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.280
 61 years old is one of the first in 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.950
 have benefited 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.420
 he served as guinea pig while he 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.759
 suffered from heart failure 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.320
 strict 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:59.450
 three years ago I would not have walked 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.040
 so far it's almost certain and 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 worse, I will not go back 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.910
 this coast for the little little fake 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.649
 flat kia ca c i lived them and so 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.360
 for me now it's almost back 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.640
 to normal 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.090
 here is his heart in mauve the part 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.120
 damaged 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.970
 following a blocked artery of cells 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.400
 of bone marrow were taken from him 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.340
 then planting is reinjected for 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.410
 repair the sick part to the chu of 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.970
 toulouse ten patients have already 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.640
 benefited from this therapy 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.590
 eight of them are going well a hope 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.250
 for the thousands of insufficient 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.160
 cardiac 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.049
 the older the population the more 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.780
 will have heart failure 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.540
 fragile patients and with techniques 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.980
 and are not so heavy or cushions 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.769
 heavy words of transplantation 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.019
 as we said we can hope to touch 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.180
 a large part of the population 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.920
 cell therapy a market that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.620
 gives some laboratories some ideas 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.049
 private companies already offer to keep your 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.780
 cells to get them rejuvenated and the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.150
 reuse one day maybe a bet that 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.109
 still costs 47 thousand euros to 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.000
 whoever believes in eternal youth 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.340
 christian flag hello you are 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.260
 researcher with a master's degree in 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.410
 neurophysiology with you we go 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.400
 try to demystify what was called 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.950
 stem cells cells 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.239
 most spectacular strains progress 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.799
 scientists of our time 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.680
 can stem cells 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.390
 replace the transplant there are tuna 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.709
 area in which we have the most 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.990
 development today ie 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.090
 to take organs 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.670
 chorus for example v6 different 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.590
 organs to digest everything we have like 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.900
 tissue around his organs and 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.160
 rebuild your own organ to 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.020
 from your own stem cells 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.550
 then actually there are promises 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.200
 really interesting to be able to 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.800
 replace grafts with your own 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.150
 organs 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.520
 then you have discovered a 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.750
 plant that we can use through 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.610
 also stem cells that's it 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.190
 so that's parallel to what this 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.450
 who said in the report 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.740
 when we do cell injections 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.150
 stumps that we actually do what we 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.250
 increases the number of stem cells 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.050
 available to repair the tissues 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.730
 so we have a little bit of a 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.770
 the same as we discovered by chance in 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.210
 student of plants is we use 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.950
 plants that releases your own 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.060
 stem cells from your vote of your 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.800
 own bone marrow 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.570
 so we increase the number of cells 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.610
 strains available to repair the 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.500
 tissues using your own cells 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.340
 strains in a natural way in fact of 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.020
 the way the body does it 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.600
 of course then that's what it wants 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.310
 say that these indexes and injection of 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.050
 stem cells could heal 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.810
 certain pathologies heavy by 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.950
 example quite must see who is 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.150
 tremendous development that has 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.010
 done in the field over the ten 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.050
 last years and different 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.580
 controversies about stem cells 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.530
 embryonic we can wear shade to 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.970
 all this there are several teams in the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.710
 world that already use the cells 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.660
 adult strains for several years 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.830
 with interesting results in term 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.300
 effective date of the myocardium 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.270
 general cardiomyopathy of iag debt 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.290
 and you personally during 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.610
 your study you did some 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.550
 major discoveries and and 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.110
 revolutionary perhaps we said we have 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.250
 discovered different plants like that 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.900
 that they have an effect at the level of 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.430
 stem cells by releasing the 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.860
 stem cells by facilitating their 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.750
 migration to the tissue level and we 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.880
 results comparable to what any 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.890
 team got by injection it's up to 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.350
 to say precisely improvements 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.240
 really marked in case of the example of a 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.740
 overload al misrati for example 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.720
 people who were on lists of 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.310
 heart transplant and then two 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.080
 three months later ends up with 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.700
 lives quite normal but then 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.060
 why the French pharmacopoeia took 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.620
 so much time for 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.390
 to allow just an activity 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.490
 real economic 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.650
 August 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.300
 why so much time is really 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.610
 checked yes it's a question that is 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.380
 quite complex because there is 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.300
 different elements first hand it's 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.100
 an explosion in the world medicine 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.140
 I think we 've never seen 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.670
 similar thing the literature 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.250
 scientist is so prolific 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.420
 in this in this area of research that 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.830
 nobody is really aware of 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.360
 everything they do not care about everything 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.590
 so does several labs at 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.150
 around the world have developed their 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.290
 own protocol and others 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.140
 laboratories are not aware 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.430
 so there was a kind of confusion if 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.650
 I can say scientist dance is a 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.840
 other elements and hands it's 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.590
 an approach that is not I would say 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.110
 of ideas by that the diagnosis was not 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.090
 guided by sunrise parking mayor or 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.920
 Diabetes is guided by a phenomenon 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.570
 physiological role of cells 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.540
 strains in the body so suddenly this 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.250
 do not do well in the design 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.240
 traditional medicine of which there are 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.860
 different elements that have done in 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.600
 so that linger a little to start 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.090
 but it's already a rocket since 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.610
 several organized a conference 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.110
 sunday sunday here in madiana en 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.360
 Martinique and guadeloupe Saturday 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.280
 precisely on all these topics thank you 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.419
 many thanks christian flag i 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.160
 remember that you are a researcher is 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.020
 holds a master's degree in 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.280
 neurophysiology you talked to us 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.060
 stem cells thank you very much 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.060
 It is I who thank you
