00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 and how big is maite esp and our 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.509
 new video on this occasion I bring you the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.309
 presentation of the new god of smile in 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.809
 this occasion it's about hamburg in cap 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.660
 what is this that you see here as you see is 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.549
 in a god shaped like a bee but not 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.619
 it shows too much and as you can see its wings 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.480
 they do not stop fluttering the truth that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 annoys a bit but good is what 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.960
 there are no more significant changes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.609
 before starting as you can see the map has 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 changed now is much bigger the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.109
 minimap I mean and the time now 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.820
 is up, which I think will be 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.410
 difficult to get used to because it's good 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.590
 always consult it next to the minimap 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.420
 but well nothing happens this god like 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.309
 I tell you how you are seeing is a god of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.350
 attack at a distance and attack quite 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.870
 powerful let's see what class it is 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.910
 as you can see is a radiophysical hander and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.120
 Well let's read and its passive that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.770
 eye is very interesting its possible it 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.559
 calls bis and tells us that the enemies 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.079
 affected by bits take damage during 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.710
 every half second for three seconds 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.719
 and they are revealed in the minimap and also 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.300
 the bees that are the bis 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.760
 will attack any close ally of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.490
 the enemies evidently that are not 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.829
 yet 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.720
 for that passive so pretty pretty 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.790
 interesting I have to tell you that good 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.920
 us about the skills and maybe 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.479
 you think it's good that this god does not 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.610
 it's too strong that it will not take 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.500
 many kits but I already tell you that if 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.000
 yesterday I can not do video presentation 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.680
 because I'm doing a job all the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.170
 late but provides a game of 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.000
 practice of sand then conamu cencap and 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.920
 the truth and I tell you that it is going to 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.170
 kill and much much surprised me 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.799
 we pretty much have the first skill it 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.280
 hype call tells us that forgiveness in the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:42.399
 bees appear at the location 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.759
 creating a new nest that gives speed 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.000
 of movement and attack to move in cap 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.299
 it also heals a bit is if it's close 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 nests can only be destroying 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.110
 nests by basic attacks we are going to 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.990
 plant one here and as you can see it gives us 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.209
 a buff or we are activated then down the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.459
 pantallita is so to speak to him the 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.950
 icon and Paul and well we are already having 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.289
 the bufo in this whole area we take 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.420
 the first black and as you see now when 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.670
 let's put the other one here we get 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.480
 all the radius that at 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.209
 affects this content so to speak 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.220
 This honeycomb place that 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.140
 we are healing too and quite 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.450
 interesting because when you put to power 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.950
 positional 8 sorry we will be able to 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.530
 practically fill the entire field of 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.030
 sand of these nests that we remember not 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.739
 can be destroyed with skills like this 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.720
 that very very interesting as well as they see 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.310
 I'm cutting with the second and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.830
 the third skill the second one is called 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.010
 sua tells us that they adduce cap throws a 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.690
 I fly a set of bees that 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.319
 They fly in forward and hurt 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.239
 to all the enemies and apply them vis 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.890
 which is the passive of a mujica remember 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.170
 let's try it here with these children 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.970
 as you see infected and the minions are 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.610
 begin to die war vis what is 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.920
 one pass with the minions we are going to 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.200
 back to the base and we went to read the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.360
 third skill is called hong and we 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.230
 says that both in capone in honey that is 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.690
 hong and in a 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.330
 in a location location forgiveness 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.650
 movable and that will diminish the 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.060
 Movement speed of all 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.280
 enemies in the area the bees that are 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.060
 good close by the nests or by the swan 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.780
 they will fly to defend the ball 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.060
 honey and they will harm and apply bis to 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.560
 all enemies the truth the passive 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.239
 it's very very interesting and I have to 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.280
 finish looking at me we use it here the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.810
 second skill because as I eat you 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.760
 I say it is very very interesting and 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.099
 It also allows us, therefore, not to combine 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.280
 the four skills to create then 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.349
 a really tremendous passive not very very 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.060
 good to see if they come out again 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.910
 enemies we will see already the last one already if 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.859
 we already tried it all the blow is called 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.280
 stinger stinger tells us what they do 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.140
 catch a good giant a sting 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.870
 giant that hurts all the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.590
 enemies in a line and that will be good 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.819
 nail the first enemy that remains 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.310
 applying bis the passive there is a 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.300
 penny remember and making him good 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.129
 Well, damage for three seconds 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.509
 the objective dies 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.879
 after three seconds the sting falls 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.970
 to the ground and during and is there for 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:27.940
 four seconds if you take the iphone the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.069
 culón de de la ultimate is reduced 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.080
 significantly this is very 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.909
 interesting as you see it now because it 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.000
 does lucas well what this does 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:39.639
 stability use here the 2 what it does 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.949
 stability is that practically when 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.860
 we use the ultimate we will be able to 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.930
 will use again in 15 seconds now what 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.060
 you will see it is 15 seconds and we collect the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.129
 stinger that falls to the ground after three 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.599
 seconds or imagine throwing multi 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.569
 that is not very powerful but good is 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.490
 pretty good every 13 or 15 seconds 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.860
 sorry is the really one last saw 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.690
 here that I eat everything and I'm going to use the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.280
 3 this one here is 3 as you can see 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.770
 pretty cool and takes away the moment 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.569
 speed and we're going to use the last one here 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.430
 you have her dies and as you see we have 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.250
 picked up the sting and here we have 15 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.690
 kool seconds of 1617 but 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.550
 practically 15 the truth is a 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.169
 authentic past you are watching 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.449
 that I'm recovering life only 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.150
 to be below nests 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.920
 sorry and we will use here again the 3 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.200
 we infect it again 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.310
 dying again the truth this god has 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.600
 delighted I thought it would not kill 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.820
 too much but in the absence of trying it on 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.650
 the official modes so to speak in 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.110
 I like it a lot and it hydrates me here if it 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.050
 for that I had not seen him to see if what 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.700
 do again 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.280
 my mother poseidón pulls everything 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.290
 let's kill him 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.330
 ok we got here the bad kill 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.100
 way we use here the 3 as you see the 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.110
 train I like a lot for the way 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.350
 that he has to throw we're going to kill him 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.870
 go double kill as you see is very very easy 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.000
 take away salt more let's be 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.070
 practically all the time in good because 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.860
 the healing movement we will be able to 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.970
 do many things with our 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.920
 skills and it's going to be really 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.750
 fun to play with this video or to 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.640
 except that is what what I sense 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.590
 As you can see, it has basic attacks 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.310
 also quite powerful at level 12 of 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.650
 level is getting 123 and in some 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.620
 cases with critics over 300 since 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.170
 it is not at all because little what puts 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.430
 with its basic attacks not so like 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.920
 I tell you a god that I loved 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.630
 It has left very very good taste in the mouth 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.170
 I'll try to upload them to a video if I 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.210
 I throw here the last one or some 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.890
 some gameplays and it really starts to 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.050
 play with him and I get some little thing 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.610
 cool but nothing this is practically 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.650
 everything to see if I can load evil and mir 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.260
 I'm not going to get it, we're going to provide 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.540
 today I forgive you to return to the base and 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.940
 we say goodbye to the video with this god piece 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.860
 which is both in cat that could already have 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.720
 another name because the truth the name 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.600
 it's the only fault I find it at 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.100
 God because it is very difficult to good not 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.310
 to pronounce but it is difficult 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.770
 well remember we will not use here 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.650
 another of this so that we can heal and 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.050
 here we infect it again as you see it is 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.810
 very easy or combining all the 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.700
 skills and elvis which is the passive that 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.320
 obviously I do not know yet how to use it 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.170
 correctly but when we know 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.020
 is going to be this a party he really 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.420
 very easy to kill an enemy not here 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.820
 You see I take the stinger again in 15 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.710
 cool down seconds I'll get this 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.230
 change everything I have I'm going to use now 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.420
 is this and it took me a double kill the 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.340
 truly an authentic past of this 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.560
 God, I hope you like it 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.560
 enjoying this other goodbye
