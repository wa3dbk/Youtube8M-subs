00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.970
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.489
 video this time we will start 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.059
 a new series called inventions and 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.290
 most famous discoveries and for 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.820
 start we'll talk about the wheel 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.860
 we could hardly find in the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.079
 dawn of human inventiveness a 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.479
 artifact that has been so fundamental 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.629
 for the progress of technology as 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:55.030
 it remains the impossible wheel and 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.000
 unnecessary addition would be to enumerate 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 the means of locomotion the machineries 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.859
 artifacts devices and devices 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.649
 in which the wheel plays a role 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.479
 essential still today 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.300
 after some millennia of having 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.909
 been in use the wheels when we 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.800
 stop to consider the millions of 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.220
 vehicles that move in large 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.810
 cities of the industrialized countries 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.830
 we say that we live in a society 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.290
 on wheels however despite the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.360
 omnipresence of the wheel along 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.850
 the whole history of mankind 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.250
 the constant relationship we have with 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.040
 the wheels in our daily lives their 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.310
 origins are unknown you do not know 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.940
 who is neither where or when did they devise and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.550
 they started using the wheel if we know 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.290
 for example that in the new world the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.050
 wheel was unknown to the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.150
 pre-Columbian civilizations at least in 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.700
 its vertical function to facilitate the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.740
 transport of people or loads and this 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.110
 It is noteworthy due to the high degree of 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.890
 development achieved in other branches of 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.320
 know by Mayan and Inca Aztecs 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.870
 on the other hand in the old world has not 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.789
 there was archaeological evidence 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.400
 enough to determine the place and 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.890
 the time of the appearance of the wheel the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.110
 suggestion by some authors that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.819
 this could have had its origin between 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.310
 the first civilizations of the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.870
 Mesopotamia has not been confirmed by 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.380
 historical investigations and 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.480
 Later archaeological works are supposed to 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.930
 the first vehicles or carriages that 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.060
 they rolled they did well on stones 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.700
 rounded with a hole in the center 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.370
 for the rudimentary axle or wheels 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.380
 made with crossed wooden plates 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.910
 so that its ends were 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.590
 approaching the circumference 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.900
 logically like almost all inventions 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.210
 of man must have been the product of 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.040
 a need experienced by groups 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.640
 humans in certain circumstances 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.310
 geographic and social the absence of 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.430
 fluvial or maritime transport and 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.800
 availability of draft beasts can 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.830
 have induced some groups to 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.210
 make land transportation feasible 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.450
 facilitating the movement of large 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.330
 loads or the fastest translation of 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.450
 individuals in both normal activities 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.700
 as in war actions in the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.710
 currently we could not conceive 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.560
 even our technified society 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.020
 without the intervention of wheels of all 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.810
 class and of all sizes and 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.510
 materials in all the artifacts of 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.700
 that we have today from the clock that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.760
 We carry on the wrist to the ships 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.459
 spacers who explore the universe 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.920
 good friends, this has been all for 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.370
 this time I hope you liked it 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.180
 and to follow this series of videos that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.200
 subscribe and comment this video greetings 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.200
 and until next time
