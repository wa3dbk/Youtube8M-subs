00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
got a raised he'll hear it's a really

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
got a raised he'll hear it's a really
really<00:00:47.850> solid<00:00:48.210> piece<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.870> hardwood<00:00:49.350> basically

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
really solid piece of hardwood basically

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.240 
really solid piece of hardwood basically
and<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.410> eliminates<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> squish<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and it eliminates the squish that you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.889 
and it eliminates the squish that you
might<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> lift<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> running

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
might get if you lift in like a running

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
might get if you lift in like a running
shoe<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.610> hard<00:00:56.879> solid

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
shoe so it's a really really hard solid

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.849 
shoe so it's a really really hard solid
piece<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> wood<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.530> between

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
piece of wood right here in between

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
piece of wood right here in between
between<00:00:59.820> where<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.180> foot<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> actual

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
between where my foot is and the actual

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.280 
between where my foot is and the actual
bottom<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.680> shoe<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.140> an

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
bottom of the shoe and it is about an

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
bottom of the shoe and it is about an
inch<00:01:04.409> tall<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> gets<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.909> heel<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> little

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
inch tall so it gets my heel a little

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
inch tall so it gets my heel a little
bit<00:01:06.570> elevated<00:01:06.720> oh<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> allow

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
bit elevated oh and it's going to allow

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.429 
bit elevated oh and it's going to allow
me<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> little<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.299> more<00:01:09.780> straight<00:01:10.409> up

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
me to be a little bit more straight up

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
me to be a little bit more straight up
and<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.850> torso<00:01:11.850> position<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.390> I'm

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
and down a torso position when I'm

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
and down a torso position when I'm
lifting<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.430> advantageous<00:01:14.430> when

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
lifting which is advantageous when

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
lifting which is advantageous when
you're<00:01:15.060> talking<00:01:15.360> about<00:01:15.740> snatches<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.920> cleans

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you're talking about snatches and cleans

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
you're talking about snatches and cleans
and<00:01:17.580> jerks<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.360> especially<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.380> Olympic

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and jerks and especially the Olympic

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.240 
and jerks and especially the Olympic
lifts<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.390> that's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.409> reason<00:01:22.799> why<00:01:23.009> you'd

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
lifts so that's a the reason why you'd

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
lifts so that's a the reason why you'd
want<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.490> wear<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> fish<00:01:24.090> shoe<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
want to wear with a fish shoe put you a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.270 
want to wear with a fish shoe put you a
little<00:01:25.290> bit<00:01:25.380> better<00:01:25.439> position<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> gets

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
little bit better position and it gets

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
little bit better position and it gets
rid<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> squish<00:01:26.880> there's<00:01:27.119> no<00:01:27.210> shock

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
rid of the squish there's no shock

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.170 
rid of the squish there's no shock
absorber<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> push<00:01:29.130> down<00:01:29.430> through<00:01:29.759> my

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
absorber when I push down through my

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
heels push down really really hard

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.830

through the heels you won't have any
squish<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.280> what

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
little bit angle forward but then I'm

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.539 
little bit angle forward but then I'm
going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.590> exaggerate<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.490> a

my heels up on top of a plate a couple
of<00:02:03.540> 25<00:02:03.990> kilo<00:02:04.409> plates<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.159> you'll<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:05.520> how

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
of 25 kilo plates and you'll see how

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
of 25 kilo plates and you'll see how
much<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.270> vertical<00:02:06.780> i<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:07.290> torso<00:02:07.560> so

to be the ticket it's going to it's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.760 
to be the ticket it's going to it's
going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.300> allow<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> upright

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
limited ankle mobility now with that

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.350 
limited ankle mobility now with that
said<00:02:45.860> do<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.980> need<00:02:47.280> weightlifting<00:02:47.760> shoes<00:02:47.820> if

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
said do you need weightlifting shoes if

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.530 
said do you need weightlifting shoes if
you<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.780> limited<00:02:48.959> ankle<00:02:49.920> mobility<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:51.090> think

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
you have limited ankle mobility I think

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.610 
you have limited ankle mobility I think
the<00:02:51.660> answer<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.900> no<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.080> think<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.440> need<00:02:52.590> to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the answer is no I think you need to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.130 
the answer is no I think you need to
develop<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.340> mobility<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:54.690> be<00:02:54.780> able<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.019> get

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
develop that mobility to be able to get

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.570 
develop that mobility to be able to get
into<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.410> good<00:02:55.620> squatting<00:02:56.130> position<00:02:56.220> without

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
into a good squatting position without

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.920 
into a good squatting position without
them<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.690> think<00:02:58.910> general<00:02:59.910> all-around<00:03:00.180> athletes

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
them I think general all-around athletes

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.290 
them I think general all-around athletes
soccer<00:03:01.380> players<00:03:01.709> basketball<00:03:01.980> players<00:03:02.310> should

soccer players basketball players should

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.120 
soccer players basketball players should
be<00:03:03.450> able<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.690> train<00:03:03.900> without<00:03:04.110> them<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.830> still

be able to train without them and still

be able to train without them and still
