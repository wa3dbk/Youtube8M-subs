point<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.510> case<00:00:39.750> though<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.350> point

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.770> road<00:00:41.010> something<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.820> they

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
on the road something I think that they

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
on the road something I think that they
should<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.149> happy<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.230> considering<00:00:43.800> it's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
should be happy with considering it's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.229 
should be happy with considering it's
only<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> second<00:00:44.550> time<00:00:44.640> they've<00:00:44.879> gotten<00:00:45.180> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
only the second time they've gotten a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.660 
only the second time they've gotten a
result<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.840> road<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.559> ends<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.010> 11<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
result on the road it ends up 11 the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.029 
result on the road it ends up 11 the
goal<00:00:47.850> from<00:00:48.120> Camilo<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.680> biggest<00:00:49.860> thing

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
goal from Camilo and the biggest thing

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
goal from Camilo and the biggest thing
here<00:00:50.340> though<00:00:50.520> also<00:00:50.910> might<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.329> Eric<00:00:51.629> asli

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
here though also might be that Eric asli

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.080 
here though also might be that Eric asli
with<00:00:52.170> another<00:00:52.770> red<00:00:53.309> card<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> white<00:00:53.910> cap

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
with another red card to the white cap

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.279 
with another red card to the white cap
so<00:00:54.239> there's<00:00:54.420> another<00:00:54.600> thing<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> doesn't

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
so there's another thing that doesn't

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.630 
so there's another thing that doesn't
change<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.590> his<00:00:55.710> third<00:00:55.980> red<00:00:56.250> card<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
