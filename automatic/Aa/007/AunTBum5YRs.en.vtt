00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.690
 Hey, people, beauty, talking about voting. 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.070
 with another video of black ops 2 and today 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.090
 a slightly different video is not from the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.490
 multiplayer mode 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.710
 Today I'm going to make a video modes on bis of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 mode to be more specific and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.510
 I wanted to bring a quick video there 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.230
 transition mode to four 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.490
 people 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 You're seeing what I have in there. 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.660
 telinha am not on the small screen in the room pec 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 the bridge that is a room that reminds 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.769
 quite that fire map of the black ops 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 ong reminds me a lot of that map I do not know 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.390
 You, too, were in our line. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.340
 the bridge on that map and it 's another 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.440
 very cool strategy because you 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.670
 manages to reach a much larger 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.620
 than if you kept running for 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.660
 that map that was very strange 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.890
 the transit I think is a bit similar 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.570
 it's obviously a giant map, right? 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.329
 so I think four maps together or 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.870
 five are four such cities in the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.550
 on the same map of zombies and I usually 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.079
 use that strategy there you are 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.920
 Seeing when I'm playing with four 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.780
 people 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.610
 It's a pretty cool strategy and it's 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 is to stay in this line of the truck 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.820
 who does not know how to open health 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.290
 that the bridge has several videos 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.000
 explanations and I know you want to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.810
 that explains a little better and then 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.549
 I explain 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.170
 but you already have several videos explaining how 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.299
 I opened this room, right? 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.729
 You gotta put that turbine on you. 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.920
 in the first city ours in the city 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.960
 Where do you turn on the light that you open this? 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 it's just the pickup room before 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.799
 so from the moment you open 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.869
 health so that the bridge is pretty cool is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.630
 It 's up to you guys that you're playing 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.610
 with very good also have a system of 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.650
 communication is you know when you go 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.360
 need to leave the room and leave someone there 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.310
 in as'm doing right now is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.100
 leaves someone in there and picks it up 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.799
 You need to be some box or some 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.720
 It's very interesting if you're grandson. 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.189
 communicate with the staff to not leave the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.140
 room everyone that there is no room will 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.240
 closing deal will have to reopen 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.180
 good the setap of things you need 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.729
 to stay there comfortably is 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.579
 so you do not have to leave that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.159
 room to get the box or whatever is 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.250
 I need pec bridge is often 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.979
 you have 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.509
 minimum two people with water and all 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.210
 world is going to have to have a light machine 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.660
 gun crush or lash that light 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.700
 machine gun that looks more expensive wins 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.710
 more a maxim arrives very good I think 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.500
 which is the best weapon of the shoulders and looks 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.990
 There's a lot of bullet in the comb and it's a 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.490
 kill very fast then the ideal is all 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.340
 world has a great chance at gum 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.070
 2 congregate at least seek water if 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.810
 stay in the hall and stay in the hall 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.430
 main is the corridor in which they have access 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.680
 the stairs and you are seeing in 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.110
 moment where I was now I was there with the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.790
 My gender upgrade is not a very 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.470
 good is the weapon you recommend 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.360
 definitely for the shoulders and for 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.230
 stay in this room always in the head 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.630
 a tip and love productive for you or 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.010
 I know it in the head because it gives more damage and 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.370
 you get more points when you kill one 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.320
 Headshot zombie, so do not 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.180
 mind picks up everyone there with a light 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.000
 machine gun sock on the head 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.110
 It's too much trouble, you use water. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.450
 if you need to leave the room to 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.100
 any reason they leave crawler and go there 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.450
 and leave someone in the room while the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.360
 staff who are in need of 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.090
 Supplies what you need, right? 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.340
 the pec also the speedy glue that is well 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.890
 and the only problem with football is that 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.930
 He is far from this room so it 's a 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.120
 thing so it's kind of hard to 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.040
 when you die there once or 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.540
 fall down once 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.790
 another cool thing to get you 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.739
 6 pet that also has tutorial and 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.320
 Youtube, I do not know if you know how to do it. 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.760
 but it's cool and I hope to stay in this room 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320
 but I find it a little more complicated I think 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.519
 A little more organization 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.200
 to do this 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.590
 good hope you've enjoyed that 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.260
 the end of my fall and in the 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.670
 time that people die on the 24th 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.670
 from normal but I think it went well 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.190
 interesting and 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.500
 and I gave you a lot of shot you can see it 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.810
 one is very cool for you to give 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.510
 pretty headshot in this place you pick up 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.390
 these more than 50% of the shares of the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.980
 headshot because you just finished in 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.730
 Sumbe head I think it's pretty easy 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.709
 do that 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.300
 Good, that's it. Do not forget to deposit the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.180
 Your money in the bank is every time. 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.520
 that you have money left over and it is 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.320
 what you've been tanned from Michigan and 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.239
 if you enjoy this strategy if you already 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.560
 they wanted to treat you use in men 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.299
 with four people 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.520
 Look at the number of final action I think 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.870
 632 for me and few people right? 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.210
 then that's it did not fail to leave 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.630
 Your evaluation is worth until the next and 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.630
 peace
