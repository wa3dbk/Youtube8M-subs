00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.830
 hello how about youtube friends resist 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.460
 of the best and good we are in a 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.009
 minecraft server that no premium 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.679
 call pro with the many of you will know and 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.679
 now they dream of hurting because they also 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.100
 and well, we are going 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:37.330
 we hide there is a hunter who does not 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:43.050
 knows who we are and is in a little room 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:46.430
 I think 20 seconds comes out here 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.100
 and in chat I did and now these causes 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:55.260
 camouflaged late 5 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.220
 I took five seconds in álava gear 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.000
 André or 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.699
 and there are also 20 servers with each being that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.130
 It has different maps and we will go up 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:13.390
 20 maps books with which both sides 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.820
 says three hunters 4 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.690
 and there are points and there is time 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.690
 there is a certain time 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.000
 west 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.000
 we approach 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.100
 a cobweb 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.370
 now you are with fixed 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.390
 and there are the hunters 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.900
 that comes face a month 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.900
 in front 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.500
 and also the canceled ones can hit 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.450
 to the des 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:02.579
 most illustrious 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 1 4 3 2 1 down the right hand says 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.120
 how much time remaining but of course 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.860
 we will see 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.640
 They killed me and now I am 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:18.490
 I am a house I am a hunter and we are going to look for 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.490
 the camouflaged ones that are only 9 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.930
 and they have iron armor and you do not 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.410
 and they have the diamond power of your 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:35.650
 way so it does not suit you to give them 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.420
 it's not to run the south always 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.840
 you realize because it sounds like 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.890
 blows when you hit him and for what 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.769
 they serve the points then for I think 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.080
 that was to give strength agility and I do not know what 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.540
 more is increasing that yes 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:58.020
 and not please and everything is going to the quota 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.020
 I tell them a magazine in front of me 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.800
 wants 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.650
 it takes so 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.910
 here a whale can be a spider's web 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.910
 a melon and that more a fence 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.930
 and a block of wood 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.810
 It is fine to not be 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.640
 the pig 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.640
 also although it can also be 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.380
 they are hitting up 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.900
 where is jon araña 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.739
 where they were and when they win 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.909
 hunters had a point when they win 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:07.959
 those who are going to win on this front and 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.959
 is facing 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.860
 the worse with your hair 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.470

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.250

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.090

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.289
