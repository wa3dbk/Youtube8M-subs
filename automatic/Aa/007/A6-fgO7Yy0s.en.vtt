00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the height of the enlarger so you can

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.050 
the height of the enlarger so you can

used to affect our image okay here we

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.730 
used to affect our image okay here we
are<00:02:55.160> getting<00:02:56.160> dark<00:02:57.170> at<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.290> point<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.650> to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
are getting dark at this point going to

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.130 
are getting dark at this point going to
talk<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.130> lot<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.400> time<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.990> we're<00:03:00.990> going<00:03:01.110> to

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
talk to a lot of time and we're going to

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.290 
talk to a lot of time and we're going to
use<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> dials<00:03:01.740> up<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:02.070> showing<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.340> how<00:03:03.270> to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
use the dials up just showing you how to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.630 
use the dials up just showing you how to
focus<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.680> we'll<00:03:04.800> use<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.980> back<00:03:05.130> one<00:03:05.340> and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
focus it so we'll use the back one and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.210 
focus it so we'll use the back one and
we'll<00:03:06.060> wine<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:06.420> into<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> place<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.770> we<00:03:07.860> can<00:03:07.920> use

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
we'll wine it into a place so we can use

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.570 
we'll wine it into a place so we can use
the<00:03:08.880> amount<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.240> an<00:03:09.360> X<00:03:09.510> equal<00:03:09.780> one<00:03:10.370> that's<00:03:11.370> set

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
the amount of an X equal one that's set

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.250 
the amount of an X equal one that's set
the<00:03:11.670> right<00:03:11.790> size<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> want<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.390> use<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.170> then

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
the right size I want to use and then

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.900 
the right size I want to use and then
use<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> forward<00:03:13.860> dial<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:15.120> control<00:03:16.790> how<00:03:17.790> your

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
use a forward dial to control how your

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.720 
use a forward dial to control how your
focus<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.360> get<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.830> think<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:20.580> my

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
focus and get and I think that for my

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.500 
focus and get and I think that for my
image<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.600> stopped<00:03:21.810> working<00:03:22.140> phones<00:03:23.510> at

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
image they stopped working phones at

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.120 
image they stopped working phones at
this<00:03:24.690> point<00:03:24.959> I'll<00:03:25.110> take<00:03:25.350> my<00:03:25.440> brain<00:03:25.650> find<00:03:25.950> out

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
this point I'll take my brain find out

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.420 
this point I'll take my brain find out
and<00:03:26.910> we<00:03:27.000> open<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.360> up<00:03:27.830> replace<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:28.980> somewhere

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
and we open it up replace that somewhere

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.550 
and we open it up replace that somewhere
on<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.790> negative<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:31.140> we're<00:03:31.260> going<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.410> want

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
on the negative and we're going to want

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:42.910 
on the negative and we're going to want
to<00:03:31.590> look<00:03:31.709> through

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.860 

so<00:03:43.920> we<00:03:44.400> do<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.580> grand<00:03:44.880> final<00:03:45.210> you<00:03:45.420> place<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.780> on

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
so we do the grand final you place it on

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.780 
so we do the grand final you place it on
the<00:03:45.900> negative<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.860> we're<00:03:47.010> turning<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.700> what

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the negative and we're turning and what

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.430 
the negative and we're turning and what
we're<00:03:47.910> looking<00:03:48.120> forward<00:03:48.300> sunblock<00:03:48.930> texture

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
we're looking forward sunblock texture

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.170 
we're looking forward sunblock texture
to<00:03:49.560> appear<00:03:49.890> well<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.670> see<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:51.030> got

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
to appear well you see that all got

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.000 
to appear well you see that all got

paper exploded with had 15 seconds of

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.949 
paper exploded with had 15 seconds of
exposure<00:06:22.709> and<00:06:23.249> the<00:06:24.120> Blitz<00:06:24.479> they're<00:06:24.659> blocked

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:24.959 
exposure and the Blitz they're blocked

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:26.719 
exposure and the Blitz they're blocked
of<00:06:25.349> anybody<00:06:25.680> follow<00:06:26.009> you<00:06:26.069> and<00:06:26.339> your<00:06:26.550> 10

of anybody follow you and your 10
seconds<00:06:27.120> of<00:06:27.180> experience<00:06:27.629> and<00:06:28.490> then<00:06:29.490> we'll<00:06:29.669> do

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
seconds of experience and then we'll do

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.820 
seconds of experience and then we'll do
using<00:06:29.939> it<00:06:29.999> with<00:06:30.120> one<00:06:30.270> final<00:06:30.479> time<00:06:30.779> or<00:06:31.499> set<00:06:31.709> it

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
using it with one final time or set it

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:38.149 
using it with one final time or set it
back<00:06:31.889> again<00:06:36.169> and<00:06:37.169> if<00:06:37.379> you<00:06:37.469> complete<00:06:37.770> and<00:06:38.009> at

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
back again and if you complete and at

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.469 
back again and if you complete and at
this<00:06:38.249> point<00:06:38.490> we<00:06:38.729> have<00:06:38.879> ourselves<00:06:38.969> a<00:06:39.270> test

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
this point we have ourselves a test

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.089 
this point we have ourselves a test
strip<00:06:39.569> that's<00:06:40.439> ready<00:06:40.680> to<00:06:40.740> go<00:06:40.919> and<00:06:40.979> be

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
strip that's ready to go and be

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.529 
strip that's ready to go and be
developed<00:06:41.490> in<00:06:41.810> 5<00:06:42.810> 10<00:06:43.560> 15<00:06:44.399> and<00:06:44.550> 20<00:06:44.819> seconds<00:06:45.330> and

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
developed in 5 10 15 and 20 seconds and

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.600 
developed in 5 10 15 and 20 seconds and
this<00:06:45.779> will<00:06:45.870> show<00:06:46.110> us<00:06:46.259> the<00:06:46.289> correct<00:06:46.800> exposure<00:06:47.189> a

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
this will show us the correct exposure a

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.969 
this will show us the correct exposure a
lot<00:06:48.240> of<00:06:48.300> these<00:06:48.389> timings<00:06:48.870> that<00:06:49.529> we<00:06:49.620> could<00:06:49.770> use

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
lot of these timings that we could use

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.449 
lot of these timings that we could use
to<00:06:50.490> create<00:06:51.120> a<00:06:51.209> final<00:06:51.569> print<00:06:51.810> from<00:06:51.930> I<00:06:52.199> was<00:06:53.189> going

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:53.459 
to create a final print from I was going

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.820 
to create a final print from I was going
to<00:06:53.520> sort<00:06:53.669> out<00:06:53.789> for<00:06:54.029> you<00:06:54.149> and<00:06:54.499> I'll<00:06:55.499> see<00:06:55.740> you

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
to sort out for you and I'll see you

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:23.910 
to sort out for you and I'll see you
again<00:06:55.949> in<00:06:56.249> another<00:06:56.550> tutorial<00:06:56.819> you<00:06:57.270> thank<00:06:57.899> you

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:23.920
