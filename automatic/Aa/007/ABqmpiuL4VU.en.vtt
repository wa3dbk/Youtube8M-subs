00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.240
 I come to do what would be a 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.580
 question but before you start with the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.890
 video I want to tell you the cock that 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.869
 They gave Brazil the truth as I am 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.240
 recording this after 10 minutes that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.830
 This one who finished the match and at the same time 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.170
 they were put back I'll summarize 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.019
 all with just telling them that in the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.150
 first 34 minutes they got five 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.949
 goals to brazil at once can be searched 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.899

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.579
 videos and all that about the welcome that you 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.230
 They gave Brazil but good the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.719
 going back to the subject as you could see 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.690
 in the title we are in what would be a 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.820
 Wish list for online gta for the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.010
 next update or the next dlc 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.300
 that will bring to the game that a list of 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.520
 wishes after more or less what 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.170
 we want you to target not us 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.149
 we think that they will put in the next 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.410
 update is not nothing confirmed 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.539
 we 're going to invent all this 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.039
 our head and I want you to leave me here 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.259
 down in the comments that what they 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.210
 would like you to get into the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.770
 next dlc can not occur in 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.820
 anything or to bank robberies 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.370
 you have to leave them 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.600
 we do not know that they are not going to put pus and 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.370
 they are going to put it up to be 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.590
 next consoles the next generation 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.090
 so who knows, I do not know if the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.280
 really from the next or even the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.660
 last so I want to know what 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.800
 is what they would like you to 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.190
 put in the next update 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.110
 they ask for crazy ideas, ok, I do not know what 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.420
 I made a dlc of aliens where you 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.280
 let's put on an astronaut suit 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.290
 alien mask where he arrived on a ship 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.850
 UFO you have to make an interest already such 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.650
 time so you can grab the jetpack not 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.060
 one of pirates can be one of rockers 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.710
 as well as they put the one of the hitters then 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.500

 cited nataniel do not forget about that but 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.610
 I do not have anything against the gays obviously 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.470
 true but it can be and file no 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.880
 I would be cool and you can also see 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.090
 that something other than another could be 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.640
 get in 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.319

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.629
 mexican revolution do that account 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.670
 they can have pancho villa there no longer 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.410
 I know if after the revolution but 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.090
 you can have characters here 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.920

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.040

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.819

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.349
 that puts a comment here below 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.879
 what is your crazy idea for the next 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.430
 I want what do you think is the next 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.280
 dlc specific the good do not do not put anything 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.459
 more put chuchito has committed such a thing 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.680
 one of lcd ale do not put anything else 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.019
 crazy what they say crazy ideas to 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.060
 beginning because they sound very crazy ok 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.500
 so very good it's practically a 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.239
 quick video to tell you that that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.799
 I know because I want to see that 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.480
 Sometimes they could put in future 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.099
 updates since then if we are 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.290
 many and we all have an idea 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.670
 different maybe one will hit upon ok well 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.470
 that well, that would practically be 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.660
 everything and also I want to remind you that 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.250
 I saw that they liked the previous video the 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.440
 of the commercial one of the pumps here 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.120
 terrorists and all that is a crazy idea 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.530
 that comes to mind like that out of nowhere because 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.780
 it was a very simple tutorial that just 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.150
 was to paste pictures on the back of a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.920
 eye nothing else you can in the back and not 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.330
 it has to be in passive mode before 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.190
 that is put passive mode has to be 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.990
 normal they are stuck and now you can 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.970
 put passive mode is not a little trick 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.620
 to troll something that they added no 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.030
 I know if in this update then something 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.470
 that nobody had noticed but 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.420
 well it's something different I wanted to do 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.280
 as a commercial infogram type here with 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.959
 the terrorists and all that and then 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.030
 practically it would not be everything it's not the 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.100
 first video that reaches 100 likes 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.870
 before the 200 water reproductions 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.610
 almost all the videos that I have come to 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.800
 the 100 likes to peppers 600 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.720
 reproductions so I hope that 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.790
 They liked already know that if they liked 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.040
 this video can leave its tremendous lay 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.190
 that helps me too seriously gave me 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.930
 too remember to share what 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.610
 what would this video be with his best friend 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.500
 with your machete with whomever you want 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.050
 so that I also give them as a type 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.850
 opinion of the s would like and therefore 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.920
 also remember to subscribe no and then 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.840
 practically that would be all see you 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.840
 in the next video bye bye 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.419
 the epal of fish that I do not know where I'm going 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.290
 tonight
