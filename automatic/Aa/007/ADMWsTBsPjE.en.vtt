00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
the webcam to take a photo it's really

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.950 
the webcam to take a photo it's really
just<00:00:19.310> one<00:00:19.519> or<00:00:19.609> two<00:00:19.640> lines<00:00:19.910> of<00:00:20.060> code<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.750> only

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
just one or two lines of code the only

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.599 
just one or two lines of code the only
real<00:00:21.109> complexity<00:00:21.650> is<00:00:22.010> where<00:00:22.279> you're<00:00:22.430> going<00:00:22.519> to

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
real complexity is where you're going to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.460 
real complexity is where you're going to
save<00:00:22.910> it<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.180> display<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:23.630> or<00:00:23.930> in<00:00:24.320> our<00:00:24.439> case

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
save it and display it or in our case

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.230 
save it and display it or in our case
how<00:00:24.920> you're<00:00:25.130> going<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.310> actually<00:00:25.519> share<00:00:26.029> it

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
how you're going to actually share it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.029 
how you're going to actually share it
since<00:00:26.810> we've<00:00:27.019> done<00:00:27.050> that<00:00:27.230> before<00:00:27.679> it<00:00:27.830> should

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
since we've done that before it should

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.880 
since we've done that before it should
should<00:00:28.550> make<00:00:28.730> some<00:00:28.910> sense<00:00:29.119> but<00:00:29.960> let's<00:00:30.740> go

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
should make some sense but let's go

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.320 
should make some sense but let's go
ahead<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.099> get<00:00:31.429> started<00:00:31.550> we're<00:00:32.000> in<00:00:32.090> lap

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
ahead and get started we're in lap

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.110 
ahead and get started we're in lap
number<00:00:32.630> four<00:00:33.320> at<00:00:33.650> bars<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.280> media<00:00:34.490> capture<00:00:34.730> in

number four at bars and media capture in
exercise<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.989> add<00:00:36.290> photo<00:00:36.770> capture<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.780> so<00:00:38.780> as

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
exercise to add photo capture and so as

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.049 
exercise to add photo capture and so as
you<00:00:39.260> can<00:00:39.379> see<00:00:39.649> we're<00:00:40.430> going<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.610> modify<00:00:40.910> the

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
you can see we're going to modify the

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.029 
you can see we're going to modify the
code<00:00:41.360> to<00:00:41.750> allow<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.020> user<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.410> take<00:00:42.680> a<00:00:42.710> photo

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
code to allow the user to take a photo

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.639 
code to allow the user to take a photo
and<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:44.329> begin<00:00:44.450> we're<00:00:44.870> going<00:00:45.110> to<00:00:45.200> import<00:00:45.559> some

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
and to begin we're going to import some

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.889 
and to begin we're going to import some
namespaces<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.489> we<00:00:46.610> need<00:00:46.850> windows<00:00:47.300> media<00:00:47.660> to

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
namespaces that we need windows media to

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.260 
namespaces that we need windows media to
capture<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:48.620> windows<00:00:49.070> storage<00:00:49.670> makes<00:00:50.059> sense

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
capture and windows storage makes sense

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.229 
capture and windows storage makes sense
we're<00:00:50.420> going<00:00:50.539> to<00:00:50.600> capture<00:00:51.460> an<00:00:52.460> image<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.120> then

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
we're going to capture an image and then

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.360 
we're going to capture an image and then
store<00:00:53.539> it<00:00:53.570> somewhere<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:54.559> would<00:00:55.070> expect

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
store it somewhere so I would expect

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.610 
store it somewhere so I would expect
classes<00:00:55.989> that<00:00:56.989> are<00:00:57.109> used<00:00:57.289> for<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.590> purpose

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
classes that are used for that purpose

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.290 
classes that are used for that purpose
to<00:00:57.980> be<00:00:58.250> in<00:00:58.399> those<00:00:58.870> namespaces<00:01:00.820> all<00:01:01.820> right<00:01:02.059> next

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
to be in those namespaces all right next

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.810 
to be in those namespaces all right next
up<00:01:02.600> we're<00:01:03.289> going<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.769> add<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.580> following

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
up we're going to add the following

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.010 
up we're going to add the following
field<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.590> items<00:01:07.220> detail<00:01:07.880> page<00:01:08.270> alright

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
field to the items detail page alright

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.560 
field to the items detail page alright
so<00:01:09.230> we're<00:01:09.350> going<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.530> create<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:10.570> private

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
so we're going to create a private

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.750 
so we're going to create a private
member<00:01:12.140> called<00:01:12.470> underscore<00:01:13.130> photo<00:01:15.250> up<00:01:16.250> type

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
member called underscore photo up type

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.740 
member called underscore photo up type
storage<00:01:17.360> file<00:01:18.970> which<00:01:19.970> is<00:01:20.120> in<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.360> windows

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
storage file which is in the windows

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.710 
storage file which is in the windows
storage<00:01:21.410> storage<00:01:21.980> file<00:01:22.330> represents<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.390> file

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
storage storage file represents a file

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.560 
storage storage file represents a file
okay<00:01:24.470> great<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.970> can<00:01:26.090> see<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:26.540> has

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
okay great and you can see that it has

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.690 
okay great and you can see that it has
associated<00:01:27.230> capabilities<00:01:27.950> pictures<00:01:28.490> library

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700

library<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.160> I'll<00:01:31.220> be<00:01:31.310> interesting<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.790> see

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
library so I'll be interesting to see

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.260 
library so I'll be interesting to see
how<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:32.660> plays<00:01:33.110> into<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.820> alright<00:01:34.820> then<00:01:35.060> what

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
how this plays into it alright then what

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.330 
how this plays into it alright then what
we<00:01:35.390> want<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.630> do<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.110> find<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.470> on<00:01:36.620> capture

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
we want to do is find the on capture

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.680 
we want to do is find the on capture
photo<00:01:37.580> method<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.120> you<00:01:38.270> add<00:01:38.450> in<00:01:38.630> the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
photo method that you add in the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.420 
photo method that you add in the
previous<00:01:38.930> exercise<00:01:39.440> got<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.190> know<00:01:40.310> where

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
previous exercise got it we know where

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.280 
previous exercise got it we know where
that's<00:01:40.580> at<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:41.060> then<00:01:41.600> what<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:41.840> want<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.080> do<00:01:42.170> is

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
that's at and then what we want to do is

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.020 
that's at and then what we want to do is
modify<00:01:42.620> that<00:01:42.860> method<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.280> look<00:01:43.460> like<00:01:43.610> this<00:01:43.820> be

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
modify that method to look like this be

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.820 
modify that method to look like this be
sure<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.360> add<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.630> async<00:01:45.140> keyword<00:01:45.530> remember

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
sure to add the async keyword remember

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.470 
sure to add the async keyword remember
because<00:01:45.980> we<00:01:46.010> talked<00:01:46.310> about<00:01:46.430> if<00:01:46.970> you're<00:01:47.150> going

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
because we talked about if you're going

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.540 
because we talked about if you're going
to<00:01:47.600> have<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.140> away<00:01:48.440> keyword<00:01:48.920> we<00:01:49.130> have<00:01:49.340> to

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
to have the away keyword we have to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.000 
to have the away keyword we have to
decorate<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.840> method<00:01:51.170> with<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.440> async

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
decorate the method with the async

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.550 
decorate the method with the async
modifier<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.690> let's<00:01:53.870> go<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:54.170> capture

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
modifier so let's go and just capture

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.750 
modifier so let's go and just capture

we're sharing a photo that we're taking
of<00:03:01.579> a<00:03:01.760> recipe<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:02.870> we're<00:03:03.019> going<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.200> just<00:03:03.260> go

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
of a recipe so we're going to just go

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.960 
of a recipe so we're going to just go
ahead<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.680> blow<00:03:04.010> away<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.400> on<00:03:04.549> data

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
ahead and blow away that on data

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.039 
ahead and blow away that on data
requested<00:03:05.540> work<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.900> we've<00:03:06.019> done

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
requested work that we've done

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.020 
requested work that we've done
previously<00:03:07.629> here<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.739> we're<00:03:10.609> going<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.760> paste

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
previously here and we're going to paste

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.629 
previously here and we're going to paste
in<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.299> new<00:03:11.629> version<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.129> can<00:03:13.340> see

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
in the new version and so you can see

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:19.930 
in the new version and so you can see
that<00:03:13.879> check<00:03:14.599> if<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:16.129> photo<00:03:18.639> that<00:03:19.639> we've<00:03:19.790> added

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
that check if the photo that we've added

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.530 
that check if the photo that we've added
here<00:03:21.160> after<00:03:22.160> it's<00:03:22.220> been<00:03:22.400> taken<00:03:22.849> is<00:03:23.000> not<00:03:23.239> know

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
here after it's been taken is not know

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.140 
here after it's been taken is not know
then<00:03:24.109> we're<00:03:24.290> going<00:03:24.379> to<00:03:24.470> go<00:03:24.590> ahead<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:25.150> we're

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
then we're going to go ahead and we're

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.119 
then we're going to go ahead and we're
going<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.480> add<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.590> share<00:03:27.859> you<00:03:28.099> I

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
going to add that to the share you I

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.720 
going to add that to the share you I
otherwise<00:03:28.849> we<00:03:29.720> will<00:03:30.010> perform<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.340> code<00:03:31.549> that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
otherwise we will perform the code that

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.819 
otherwise we will perform the code that
we<00:03:31.819> already<00:03:32.359> had<00:03:32.629> in<00:03:32.840> from<00:03:33.109> a<00:03:33.199> previous<00:03:33.590> lab

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
we already had in from a previous lab

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.369 
we already had in from a previous lab
which<00:03:34.549> gives<00:03:35.239> us<00:03:35.449> the<00:03:35.599> ingredients<00:03:36.260> the

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
which gives us the ingredients the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.349 
which gives us the ingredients the
directions<00:03:36.919> and<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.910> photo<00:03:38.209> from<00:03:38.780> our<00:03:40.359> from

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
directions and the photo from our from

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.390 
directions and the photo from our from
our<00:03:41.449> project<00:03:42.019> from<00:03:42.680> our<00:03:42.859> app<00:03:43.010> okay<00:03:44.500> all<00:03:45.500> right

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
our project from our app okay all right

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.780 
our project from our app okay all right
let's<00:03:46.579> see<00:03:46.730> what<00:03:46.760> else<00:03:46.940> we<00:03:47.120> need<00:03:47.269> here<00:03:48.730> okay<00:03:49.730> so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
let's see what else we need here okay so

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.360 
let's see what else we need here okay so
the<00:03:50.060> next<00:03:50.090> step<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.780> run<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.230> app<00:03:51.379> but<00:03:52.190> this

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
the next step is to run the app but this

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.069 
the next step is to run the app but this
is<00:03:52.519> merely<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:53.060> show<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.629> won't<00:03:53.870> work

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
is merely to show that it won't work

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.460 
is merely to show that it won't work
until<00:03:54.470> we<00:03:55.129> set<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.489> package<00:03:56.030> apex<00:03:56.840> manifest

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
until we set the package apex manifest

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.460 
until we set the package apex manifest
capabilities<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.609> request<00:03:59.030> permission<00:03:59.690> for

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
use of the users web cam so let's go

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.890 
use of the users web cam so let's go
ahead<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:04.010> open<00:04:04.190> up<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.489> package<00:04:04.909> apex

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
ahead and open up the package apex

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.460 
ahead and open up the package apex
manifest<00:04:06.500> designer<00:04:07.629> now<00:04:08.629> we'll<00:04:08.870> flip<00:04:09.109> over<00:04:09.440> to

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
manifest designer now we'll flip over to

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.240 
manifest designer now we'll flip over to
the<00:04:09.739> capabilities<00:04:10.370> tab<00:04:10.669> and<00:04:11.229> modify<00:04:12.250> the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
the capabilities tab and modify the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.369 
the capabilities tab and modify the
capabilities<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.269> our<00:04:14.479> app<00:04:14.690> will<00:04:15.049> ask

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
capabilities so that our app will ask

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.890 
capabilities so that our app will ask
