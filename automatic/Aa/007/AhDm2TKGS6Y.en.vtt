positions<00:00:51.360> let's<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.750> how<00:00:51.899> far<00:00:54.410> really<00:00:55.410> so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
positions let's see how far really so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.260 
positions let's see how far really so
that's<00:00:55.920> high<00:00:56.100> bar<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.059> kind

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that's high bar and then just just kind

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.900 
that's high bar and then just just kind
of<00:00:57.390> roll<00:00:57.570> down<00:00:57.780> slide<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.910> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
of roll down slide it down and that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.910 
of roll down slide it down and that
would<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.120> more<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> low<00:01:00.600> bar<00:01:00.809> position<00:01:01.289> for

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
would be more of a low bar position for

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.049 
would be more of a low bar position for
some<00:01:02.070> people<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.399> might<00:01:02.579> even<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059

to make that lever arm a little bit

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609 
to make that lever arm a little bit
shorter<00:01:21.119> your<00:01:21.689> leverage<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.140> better<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
shorter your leverage is better and you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
shorter your leverage is better and you
can<00:01:22.740> lift<00:01:22.920> more<00:01:23.130> weight<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.689> Olympic

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
can lift more weight so for Olympic

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
here on c7 kind of a the most prominent

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.359 
here on c7 kind of a the most prominent
spinal<00:01:39.840> process<00:01:40.229> right<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:40.860> then

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
spinal process right there then then

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.370 
spinal process right there then then
it's<00:01:41.490> probably<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.299> bit<00:01:42.450> too<00:01:42.930> high<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it's probably a little bit too high it

should be right below that bone and it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
should be right below that bone and it
should<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.290> resting<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.710> only<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.729> muscle<00:01:48.090> on

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
should be resting on only the muscle on

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
should be resting on only the muscle on
the<00:01:48.420> meat<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.829> bone<00:01:50.040> yeah<00:01:50.579> I'd

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the meat and not on the bone yeah I'd

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.660 
the meat and not on the bone yeah I'd
like<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> add<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.140> ways<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.439> avoid

bone<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.380> lot<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.619> times<00:01:58.829> people

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
bone is I think a lot of times people

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.550 
bone is I think a lot of times people
when<00:02:00.299> they<00:02:00.420> when<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:00.719> say<00:02:00.899> hey<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.229> hurts<00:02:01.409> my

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
neck view high bar it's not only because

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.330 
neck view high bar it's not only because
it<00:02:03.990> might<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.320> too<00:02:04.500> high<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.159> they're

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it might be too high but because they're

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
it might be too high but because they're
being<00:02:05.490> too<00:02:05.670> lazy<00:02:05.909> or<00:02:06.210> they're<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.960> they're

elevate slightly you're gonna create a

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.460 
elevate slightly you're gonna create a
shelf<00:02:54.650> there<00:02:54.860> with<00:02:54.980> those<00:02:55.100> muscles<00:02:55.340> alright
