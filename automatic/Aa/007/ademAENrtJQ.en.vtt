00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.050 
but I think if you take good care of
them<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.370> you're<00:04:24.490> sort<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.700> careful<00:04:24.970> with

them and you're sort of careful with
that<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.330> don't<00:04:25.510> think<00:04:25.630> you

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
that I don't think you

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.770 
that I don't think you
be<00:04:25.949> they'll<00:04:26.699> have<00:04:26.909> any<00:04:27.090> issues<00:04:29.569> that's<00:04:30.569> about

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
basically all the shoes I wear there's a

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.629 
basically all the shoes I wear there's a
look<00:06:31.020> sometimes<00:06:31.440> I'd<00:06:31.529> you<00:06:31.590> have<00:06:31.680> to<00:06:31.770> 11<00:06:32.490> and<00:06:32.580> a

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.490 
look sometimes I'd you have to 11 and a
half<00:06:32.669> if<00:06:33.029> it's<00:06:33.180> a<00:06:33.330> kind<00:06:33.659> of<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.779> weird<00:06:33.990> brand<00:06:34.259> but

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
half if it's a kind of a weird brand but

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.829 
half if it's a kind of a weird brand but
these<00:06:35.039> sized<00:06:35.339> perfectly<00:06:35.669> I'm<00:06:36.149> normally<00:06:36.570> 12

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:36.839 
these sized perfectly I'm normally 12

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.200

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
these are 12 they fit perfectly so you

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.159 
these are 12 they fit perfectly so you
