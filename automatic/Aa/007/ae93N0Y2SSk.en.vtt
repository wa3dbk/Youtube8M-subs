the<00:02:57.590> class<00:02:57.860> almost<00:02:58.760> takes<00:02:59.000> my<00:02:59.210> breath<00:02:59.270> away

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
the class almost takes my breath away

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.920 
the class almost takes my breath away
and<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.590> Catalan<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.310> feel<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.330> engaged<00:03:02.720> with

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.750 
and I Catalan and feel so engaged with
them<00:03:03.170> all<00:03:03.320> part<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.130> very<00:03:04.370> special

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
them all part of a very special

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.460 
them all part of a very special
community<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.750> think<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.260> most

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
community but I think is the most

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.470 
community but I think is the most
important<00:03:06.980> feature<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.430> Mia<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.210> that<00:03:08.390> it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
important feature of Mia is that it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.840 
important feature of Mia is that it
creates<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.990> community<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:10.340> where<00:03:10.610> people

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
creates a community it's where people

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.090 
creates a community it's where people
feel<00:03:11.240> very<00:03:11.420> supported<00:03:11.750> by<00:03:12.590> each<00:03:12.830> other

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
feel very supported by each other

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.010 
feel very supported by each other
they're<00:03:13.430> not<00:03:13.460> judged<00:03:14.030> there's<00:03:14.840> no

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
they're not judged there's no

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.620 
they're not judged there's no
competition<00:03:15.440> they're<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:16.670> loving<00:03:17.240> being

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
competition they're just loving being

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.740 
competition they're just loving being
together<00:03:18.170> because<00:03:19.010> people<00:03:19.400> truly<00:03:20.120> are<00:03:20.420> good

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
together because people truly are good

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.440 
together because people truly are good
they<00:03:21.080> are<00:03:21.290> kind<00:03:21.620> they're<00:03:21.950> very<00:03:22.220> good<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.300> each

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.720 
other they don't want to be competitive
and<00:03:26.210> so<00:03:26.990> that<00:03:27.170> feeling<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.130> sensed<00:03:28.580> in

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
and so that feeling that you sensed in

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.000 
and so that feeling that you sensed in
the<00:03:28.850> room<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:30.020> people<00:03:30.350> are<00:03:30.470> happy<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.890> be

the room is that people are happy to be

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.580 
the room is that people are happy to be
together<00:03:31.160> as<00:03:31.910> well<00:03:32.150> how<00:03:32.600> does<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.840> overflow

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
together as well how does that overflow

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.010 
together as well how does that overflow
then<00:03:33.830> into<00:03:34.220> creating<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.790> sense<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.180> balance<00:03:35.600> in

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
then into creating a sense of balance in

then into creating a sense of balance in
your<00:03:36.080> life<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:37.040> realized<00:03:37.820> that<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.420> got<00:03:39.110> off

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
balance that brings back the balance

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.470 
balance that brings back the balance
instead<00:04:19.160> of<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.520> thinking<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.060> have<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.270> do

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
instead of you thinking you have to do

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.510 
instead of you thinking you have to do
it<00:04:20.600> all<00:04:20.720> by<00:04:20.930> yourself<00:04:20.960> and<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:21.860> a<00:04:21.950> true<00:04:22.220> sense

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
it all by yourself and in a true sense

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.360 
it all by yourself and in a true sense
of<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.760> word<00:04:22.850> balance<00:04:23.330> this<00:04:24.320> is<00:04:24.500> not<00:04:24.680> only<00:04:24.920> for

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
of the word balance this is not only for

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.060 
of the word balance this is not only for
the<00:04:25.460> girls<00:04:25.670> I<00:04:26.000> think<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.320> men<00:04:27.500> who<00:04:27.650> come<00:04:27.860> to

the girls I think the men who come to

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.770 
the girls I think the men who come to
near<00:04:28.280> are<00:04:28.580> super<00:04:29.480> special

they are very well-balanced they are
very<00:04:33.180> authentic<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.110> they<00:04:34.230> can<00:04:34.380> actually<00:04:34.530> be

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
very authentic so they can actually be

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.580

improves their cycling improves

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.010 
improves their cycling improves
everything<00:04:59.669> because<00:05:00.120> we're<00:05:00.270> addressing<00:05:00.660> the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
everything because we're addressing the

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.590 
everything because we're addressing the
energies<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.800> body<00:05:01.830> which<00:05:02.280> is<00:05:02.600> grounding

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
energies of the body which is grounding

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.650 
energies of the body which is grounding
but<00:05:04.020> ultimately<00:05:04.590> with<00:05:05.190> Nia<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:06.000> all<00:05:06.240> boils

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
but ultimately with Nia it all boils

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.140 
but ultimately with Nia it all boils
down<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.930> touching<00:05:07.650> people<00:05:08.070> in<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.580> realms<00:05:09.000> of

down to touching people in the realms of

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.080 
down to touching people in the realms of
body<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.750> mind<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.260> spirit<00:05:10.470> and
