i<00:04:55.150> was<00:04:55.330> using<00:04:55.539> this<00:04:55.779> an<00:04:56.020> awful<00:04:56.259> lot<00:04:56.650> there's

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
i was using this an awful lot there's

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.269 
i was using this an awful lot there's
different<00:04:57.999> tabs<00:04:58.240> for<00:04:58.629> videos<00:04:59.289> on<00:04:59.650> youtube<00:05:00.099> to

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:00.279 
different tabs for videos on youtube to

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:04.049 
different tabs for videos on youtube to
do<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.719> shopping<00:05:01.719> list<00:05:01.949> it's<00:05:02.949> just<00:05:03.550> basically

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:04.059 
do a shopping list it's just basically

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.600 
do a shopping list it's just basically
all<00:05:04.449> sorts<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.080> things<00:05:05.229> random<00:05:05.830> boat<00:05:06.009> jobs<00:05:06.339> i

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
all sorts of things random boat jobs i

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.869 
all sorts of things random boat jobs i
think<00:05:07.180> i<00:05:07.300> might<00:05:07.479> use<00:05:07.870> that<00:05:07.899> one<00:05:08.409> back<00:05:09.159> in<00:05:09.490> here

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879 
think i might use that one back in here

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.879 
think i might use that one back in here
instead<00:05:10.479> of<00:05:10.539> the<00:05:10.899> months<00:05:11.259> to<00:05:11.439> view<00:05:11.649> diary

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
instead of the months to view diary

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.559 
instead of the months to view diary
because<00:05:12.490> i<00:05:12.699> don't<00:05:12.909> really<00:05:13.089> need<00:05:13.360> this

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
because i don't really need this

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.409 
because i don't really need this
information<00:05:13.870> with<00:05:14.439> me<00:05:14.469> at<00:05:14.800> any<00:05:14.979> given<00:05:15.370> moment

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
information with me at any given moment

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.089 
information with me at any given moment
but<00:05:16.419> obviously<00:05:16.960> having<00:05:17.319> these<00:05:17.620> months<00:05:18.009> of
