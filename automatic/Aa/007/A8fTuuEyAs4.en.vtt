this<00:00:53.210> plant<00:00:53.600> is<00:00:53.809> probably<00:00:54.710> now<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.280> way<00:00:55.729> time

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
this plant is probably now the way time

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.119 
this plant is probably now the way time
goes<00:00:56.180> by<00:00:56.210> around<00:00:56.750> five<00:00:57.140> years<00:00:57.379> old

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
goes by around five years old

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.149 
goes by around five years old
it<00:00:58.670> takes<00:00:58.970> up<00:00:59.150> quite<00:00:59.330> a<00:00:59.420> lot<00:00:59.659> of<00:00:59.809> real<00:01:00.019> estate

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
it takes up quite a lot of real estate

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.040 
it takes up quite a lot of real estate
because<00:01:01.159> it's<00:01:01.370> very<00:01:01.670> wide<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.150> didn't<00:01:02.659> go<00:01:02.750> tall

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
because it's very wide I didn't go tall

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.259 
because it's very wide I didn't go tall
with<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:03.379> plant<00:01:03.650> but<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:03.890> went<00:01:04.190> wide<00:01:04.460> it's

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
with this plant but I went wide it's

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.850 
with this plant but I went wide it's
supported<00:01:06.050> by<00:01:07.060> steel<00:01:08.060> hoops<00:01:08.659> that<00:01:09.229> I<00:01:09.260> made<00:01:09.590> at

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
supported by steel hoops that I made at

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.640 
supported by steel hoops that I made at
a<00:01:10.900> campaign<00:01:13.270> placard<00:01:14.270> wire<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.170> find<00:01:15.440> on

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
people's lawns in things so I bent them

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.410 
people's lawns in things so I bent them
into<00:01:18.799> hoops<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.399> that's<00:01:19.579> what<00:01:19.729> supports<00:01:20.270> this

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
into hoops and that's what supports this
