different<00:01:37.560> types<00:01:37.790> ectomorph<00:01:38.790> mesomorph

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
different types ectomorph mesomorph

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.080 
different types ectomorph mesomorph
and<00:01:40.369> endomorph<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.520> might<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and endomorph you might be like what the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.990 
and endomorph you might be like what the
heck<00:01:42.299> does<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.450> mean<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.520> based<00:01:44.790> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
heck does that mean it all is based on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.440 
heck does that mean it all is based on

ectomorph<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> type<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> people<00:02:01.530> that

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
ectomorph it's the type of people that

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.649 
ectomorph it's the type of people that
it's<00:02:01.860> hard<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.130> us<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.460> build<00:02:02.610> muscle<00:02:03.000> where

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it's hard for us to build muscle where

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.660 
it's hard for us to build muscle where
it's<00:02:04.020> easy<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.439> us<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.649> burn<00:02:04.890> fat<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.520> it's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it's easy for us to burn fat but it's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.180 
it's easy for us to burn fat but it's
hard<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.000> build<00:02:06.329> muscle<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.710> flip<00:02:07.920> side<00:02:07.950> of

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
hard to build muscle on the flip side of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.940 
hard to build muscle on the flip side of
that<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> endomorph<00:02:09.539> their<00:02:10.229> deal

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that you have the endomorph their deal

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.809 
that you have the endomorph their deal
is<00:02:11.129> they<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.459> build<00:02:11.700> muscle<00:02:11.819> very<00:02:12.090> fast

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
is they can build muscle very fast

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.509 
is they can build muscle very fast
they<00:02:12.939> don't<00:02:13.269> lose<00:02:13.540> fat<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.379> fast<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.249> they<00:02:15.370> want

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
they don't lose fat as fast as they want

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.699 
they don't lose fat as fast as they want
to<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:15.969> build<00:02:16.390> muscle<00:02:16.689> fast<00:02:16.719> can't<00:02:17.290> lose<00:02:17.439> fat

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
to so build muscle fast can't lose fat

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.770 
to so build muscle fast can't lose fat
and<00:02:18.010> then<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.519> got<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> mesomorph<00:02:19.329> this<00:02:19.540> is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
and then you got the mesomorph this is

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.929 
and then you got the mesomorph this is
the<00:02:19.930> type<00:02:20.109> of<00:02:20.139> people<00:02:20.439> that<00:02:20.650> everybody<00:02:21.370> thinks

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
the type of people that everybody thinks

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.300 
the type of people that everybody thinks
is<00:02:22.090> genetically<00:02:22.780> gifted<00:02:22.810> because<00:02:23.739> they<00:02:24.099> can

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
is genetically gifted because they can

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.459 
is genetically gifted because they can
burn<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.879> fat<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.569> can<00:02:25.749> build<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.109> muscle

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
burn the fat they can build the muscle

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:27.479 
burn the fat they can build the muscle
and<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.680> seems<00:02:26.889> like<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.129> an<00:02:27.219> overnight

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and it seems like it's an overnight

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.940 
and it seems like it's an overnight
thing<00:02:27.760> but<00:02:28.569> look<00:02:28.719> we<00:02:28.989> can<00:02:29.109> all<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.560> we<00:02:29.709> can

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
thing but look we can all do this we can

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.589 
thing but look we can all do this we can
all<00:02:30.159> get<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.370> results<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:30.879> deserve<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:31.540> you

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
all get the results we deserve but you

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.089 
all get the results we deserve but you
need<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.840> think<00:02:32.049> about<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.409> for<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.620> second<00:02:32.980> is

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
need to think about that for a second is

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.399 
need to think about that for a second is
what<00:02:33.370> type<00:02:33.579> of<00:02:33.609> body<00:02:33.879> build<00:02:34.599> am<00:02:34.900> i<00:02:35.049> what<00:02:35.230> type

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
what type of body build am i what type

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.670 
what type of body build am i what type
of<00:02:35.530> composition<00:02:35.859> am<00:02:36.280> i<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.730> use<00:02:37.599> that<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.500> your

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
of composition am i and use that to your

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.770 
of composition am i and use that to your
advantage<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.489> getting<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.329> results<00:02:40.750> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
advantage and getting the results that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.339 
advantage and getting the results that
you<00:02:40.930> want

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
you want

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.050 
you want

tip number two is you need to eat a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.330 
tip number two is you need to eat a
little<00:02:43.329> bit<00:02:43.480> more<00:02:43.629> now<00:02:44.109> look<00:02:44.319> you<00:02:44.889> need<00:02:45.010> fuel

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
little bit more now look you need fuel

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.069 
little bit more now look you need fuel
in<00:02:45.489> your<00:02:45.519> car<00:02:45.669> you<00:02:46.299> don't<00:02:46.480> want<00:02:46.689> to<00:02:46.750> sit<00:02:46.930> there

worth of fuel you need to fuel yourself

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.569 
worth of fuel you need to fuel yourself
up<00:02:52.510> make<00:02:53.319> sure<00:02:53.530> you're<00:02:53.680> eating<00:02:53.980> enough<00:02:54.280> foods

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
so that you can gain muscle if you're

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.339 
so that you can gain muscle if you're
not<00:02:57.370> you're<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:57.879> a<00:02:57.969> fat-burning<00:02:58.569> mode<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:59.109> lot

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
not you're in a fat-burning mode a lot

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.869 
not you're in a fat-burning mode a lot
of<00:02:59.439> times<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.709> might<00:02:59.829> hear<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.250> bulking<00:03:00.699> and

of times you might hear of bulking and

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.879 
of times you might hear of bulking and
cutting<00:03:00.969> and<00:03:01.480> things<00:03:01.689> like<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.680> same

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
should be a weight that by the last

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.220 
should be a weight that by the last
couple<00:05:01.250> of<00:05:01.310> apps<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.850> hurts<00:05:02.240> it's<00:05:02.720> it's<00:05:03.110> a

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
couple of apps it hurts it's it's a

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.360 
couple of apps it hurts it's it's a
little<00:05:03.500> bit<00:05:03.590> of<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.770> struggle<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.190> get<00:05:04.310> up

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
little bit of a struggle to get up

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.490 
little bit of a struggle to get up
especially<00:05:05.240> in<00:05:05.540> eccentric<00:05:05.990> because<00:05:06.350> you're

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
especially in eccentric because you're

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.220 
especially in eccentric because you're
doing<00:05:06.770> six<00:05:07.070> seconds<00:05:07.520> up<00:05:07.669> six<00:05:08.570> seconds<00:05:09.020> down

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
doing six seconds up six seconds down

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.340 
doing six seconds up six seconds down
which<00:05:09.919> is<00:05:10.070> one<00:05:10.220> of<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.400> best<00:05:10.790> known<00:05:11.540> ways<00:05:11.990> to

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
which is one of the best known ways to

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.219 
which is one of the best known ways to
grow<00:05:12.620> strength<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:13.520> grow<00:05:14.180> size<00:05:14.540> in<00:05:14.960> your

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
muscles so taking your bicep as an

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.450 
muscles so taking your bicep as an
example<00:05:17.450> one<00:05:18.140> thing<00:05:18.350> personally<00:05:19.100> for<00:05:19.280> me

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
example one thing personally for me

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.550 
example one thing personally for me
again<00:05:20.090> this<00:05:20.240> is<00:05:20.419> different<00:05:20.630> for<00:05:20.930> everybody<00:05:21.200> an

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
again this is different for everybody an

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.580 
again this is different for everybody an
8<00:05:22.040> pound<00:05:22.310> weight<00:05:22.840> would<00:05:23.840> not<00:05:24.020> really<00:05:24.290> do<00:05:24.440> too

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
8 pound weight would not really do too

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.380 
8 pound weight would not really do too
much<00:05:24.740> for<00:05:25.010> me<00:05:25.100> quite<00:05:25.700> honestly<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.210> just

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
much for me quite honestly that just

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.870 
much for me quite honestly that just
doesn't<00:05:26.960> do<00:05:27.200> much<00:05:27.350> for<00:05:27.410> me<00:05:27.710> even<00:05:28.280> like<00:05:28.669> let's

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
doesn't do much for me even like let's

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.719 
doesn't do much for me even like let's
say<00:05:29.030> I<00:05:29.060> was<00:05:29.270> doing<00:05:29.390> 12<00:05:29.750> reps<00:05:30.020> at<00:05:30.530> 6<00:05:31.220> seconds<00:05:31.580> up

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
say I was doing 12 reps at 6 seconds up

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.520 
say I was doing 12 reps at 6 seconds up
6<00:05:32.090> seconds<00:05:32.450> down<00:05:32.570> that's<00:05:32.990> not<00:05:33.050> doing<00:05:33.350> much<00:05:33.470> for

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
6 seconds down that's not doing much for

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.719 
6 seconds down that's not doing much for
me<00:05:33.710> so<00:05:35.200> on<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:36.320> flip<00:05:36.560> side<00:05:36.590> of<00:05:36.830> that<00:05:36.979> I<00:05:37.340> don't

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
me so on the flip side of that I don't

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.250 
me so on the flip side of that I don't
want<00:05:37.910> to<00:05:37.970> say<00:05:38.150> okay<00:05:38.300> great<00:05:38.690> let<00:05:38.900> me<00:05:38.990> grab<00:05:39.080> the
