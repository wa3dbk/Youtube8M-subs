00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and around this place heading towards

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.490 
and around this place heading towards
upstate<00:00:58.829> New<00:00:59.070> York<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.879> Poughkeepsie<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.510> so

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
upstate New York to Poughkeepsie and so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.709 
upstate New York to Poughkeepsie and so
on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> amtrak<00:01:01.949> trains<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> similar

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
on the amtrak trains go on a similar

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.020 
on the amtrak trains go on a similar
path<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.170> well<00:01:04.350> what's<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.700> interesting

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
path as well what's really interesting

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
path as well what's really interesting
here<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.290> place<00:01:07.530> where<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.890> train

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
here is that the place where this train

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.910 
here is that the place where this train
derailed<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.510> seems<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.170> similar<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
derailed it seems so similar to the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.370 
derailed it seems so similar to the
scenario<00:01:11.460> happened<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.030> Spain<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> high

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
scenario happened in Spain with a high

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
scenario happened in Spain with a high
speed<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.010> wasn't<00:01:14.310> high<00:01:14.430> speed<00:01:14.670> train<00:01:14.880> yet

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
speed this wasn't high speed train yet

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.300 
speed this wasn't high speed train yet
as<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> regular<00:01:15.570> train<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.560> high-speed<00:01:17.009> train

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
as a regular train the high-speed train

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
as a regular train the high-speed train
they<00:01:18.000> showed<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> video<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.869> was

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
they showed the video and it was

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.380 
they showed the video and it was
actually<00:01:19.170> hitting<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.220> curve<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:21.210> an

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
actually hitting the curve at an

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
actually hitting the curve at an
incredible<00:01:22.080> speed<00:01:22.140> there<00:01:22.920> was<00:01:23.009> no<00:01:23.250> way<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
incredible speed there was no way that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
incredible speed there was no way that
could<00:01:23.700> stay<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> tracks<00:01:24.540> we're<00:01:25.170> looking

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
could stay on the tracks we're looking

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.990 
could stay on the tracks we're looking
at<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> aerial<00:01:26.070> photographs<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.820> what

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
happened in the Bronx yesterday it seems

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.179 
happened in the Bronx yesterday it seems
the<00:01:29.430> same<00:01:29.460> scenario<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:30.270> happened<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.189> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the same scenario has happened the the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.370 
the same scenario has happened the the
train<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.450> curb<00:01:33.720> now<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> very

tight<00:01:34.680> curve<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.280> spot<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.210> used

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
tight curve at that spot because I used

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.910 
tight curve at that spot because I used
to<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.509> walking<00:01:36.840> along<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.740> it's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.760 
to go walking along there and it's
actually<00:01:38.700> quite<00:01:38.820> beautiful<00:01:39.540> place<00:01:40.049> but

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
massive speed this is something that

speed the only way it could break

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.940 
speed the only way it could break
through<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.110> they<00:02:52.230> could<00:02:52.290> have<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> massive

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
that he hit the accelerator very very

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.750

i'm<00:03:04.830> not<00:03:04.980> saying<00:03:05.100> he<00:03:05.250> did<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:06.270> not

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
i'm not saying he did that we just not

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.000 
i'm not saying he did that we just not
