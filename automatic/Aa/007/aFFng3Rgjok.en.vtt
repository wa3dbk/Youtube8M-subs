boat's going to be distributed rather
not<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> ball<00:01:00.440> calculator<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.420> haven't<00:01:03.420> quite

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019

okay so notice I've read the cards from

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.570 
okay so notice I've read the cards from
the<00:01:32.510> board<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:33.050> I<00:01:33.140> get<00:01:33.350> output<00:01:33.620> based<00:01:34.190> upon

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
the board and I get output based upon

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.690 
the board and I get output based upon
the<00:01:34.760> percentage<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.690> wins<00:01:36.490> chance<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.670> I

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the percentage of wins chance that I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.390 
the percentage of wins chance that I
have<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.940> win<00:01:38.110> frankly<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.010> I'm<00:01:40.070> going<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.280> call

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
have to win frankly so I'm going to call

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.870 
have to win frankly so I'm going to call
do<00:01:41.330> one<00:01:41.450> for<00:01:41.570> something

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.990 

now<00:01:48.600> notice<00:01:48.900> it<00:01:49.560> goes<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.159> because<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
now notice it goes up because I have a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.380 
now notice it goes up because I have a
sigh<00:01:51.150> or<00:01:51.479> rather<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> pair

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.160 

and<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.530> have<00:01:59.770> three<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.390> as<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:01.990> can<00:02:02.110> guess

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
and now I have three so as you can guess

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.430 
and now I have three so as you can guess
it's<00:02:02.650> going<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.950> be<00:02:03.100> increasing<00:02:03.550> so<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:05.080> have<00:02:05.410> a

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
it's going to be increasing so I have a

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.230 
it's going to be increasing so I have a
95%<00:02:05.980> chance<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.550> win<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:06.880> I'm<00:02:06.970> going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.120> go

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
95% chance to win so I'm going to go

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:15.270 
95% chance to win so I'm going to go

percent<00:02:48.150> dividend<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.050> I'm<00:02:49.200> thinking<00:02:49.740> a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
percent dividend and I'm thinking a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.250 
percent dividend and I'm thinking a
while<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.270> really<00:02:51.510> make<00:02:51.780> some<00:02:51.840> money<00:02:52.110> off
