00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 the work is so good in the first 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.929
 of the year and not second of the year good in 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.960
 this video I'm going to show you a glitch 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 a technique I do not know if it's crisis has 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.440
 considered clip but good is a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 technique so that you do not suffer damage to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
 to fall is not good from two kilometers and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.330
 also behind the moon or maybe from 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.029
 Urano not know of any planet you islands 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.039
 plane and by some mistake this one you fall or 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 are you walking up a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.690
 building and also you fall down then no 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 you have to die obviously this 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.309
 method is one hundred percent proven of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.860
 that you will never die again in a fall 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.780
 if you do it right it's very easy and right now 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
 I'm going to teach you what to do good what 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.390
 first what you should do to get you 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.149
 come out this method is to practice it not 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.350
 get some helicopter an airplane 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.539
 up or some building a high place 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.190
 any place that is high you can 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.770
 use it to practice it for when 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.930
 be at the hour hours the blows already 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.039
 have well practiced and mastered and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.600
 good as you see we are already here in a 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.859
 high place so good now I'm going 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.110
 to teach the method so that they see that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.189
 it works and it's good since we 're here in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.930
 the high place we are not going to hold on 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.880
 parachute because we do not need it 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.890
 we are immortal we put ourselves in position 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 ready to make the jump jumped 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.550
 so with the is inscribed in causes and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.140
 our destiny and good when they are 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.970
 falling the simple glitches the only thing 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.680
 what they have to do before they fall is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.120
 open the thing to change characters the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.040
 network quickly select a character 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.240
 and they give it to you and it's basically everything 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.500
 what they have to do is very simple 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.630
 but well now I'll explain 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 in a more detailed way chicken should 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.080
 be in thousandths of a second when they go 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.160
 falling down they simply open things up for 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.690
 change characters select 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.570
 characters with the come out to give you give 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.580
 go and it's just that's not much 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.500
 good science after surviving 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.170
 besides that they almost hit me 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.030
 it feels good to know this method no longer 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.500
 that you will never die for a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.119
 fall in the big test so much less than 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.759
 update and do some of those things 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.890
 that Rockstar usually Yes 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.800
 It is half as strange but good will 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.020
 it happened all by stiglitz for this trick 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.580
 for this technique so that nothing else 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.320
 that would be all I hope there was 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.950
 liked stoneware for this video and up 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.950
 then
