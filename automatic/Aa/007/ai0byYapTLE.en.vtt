00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
your tumbler now you may want to watch

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.080 
your tumbler now you may want to watch
this<00:02:37.530> because<00:02:37.740> there<00:02:38.100> is<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> chance<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.820> this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
this because there is a chance that this

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 
this because there is a chance that this
can<00:02:39.420> start<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.900> overflow<00:02:40.200> depending<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.070> how

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
can start to overflow depending on how

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.610 
can start to overflow depending on how
much<00:02:41.490> ice<00:02:41.760> you've<00:02:42.090> used<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.050> in<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.410> case<00:02:43.590> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
much ice you've used so in the case that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.560 
much ice you've used so in the case that
you<00:02:43.890> start<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.250> get<00:02:44.400> too<00:02:44.670> close<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.300> top

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
you start to get too close to the top

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.780 
you start to get too close to the top
and<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.930> automated<00:02:46.410> brew<00:02:46.830> cycle<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.430> still

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
and the automated brew cycle is still

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.290 
and the automated brew cycle is still
running

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
running

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.480 
running
you<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.900> press<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.560> brewed<00:02:49.920> button<00:02:50.280> one

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
you can press that brewed button one

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.130 
you can press that brewed button one
more<00:02:50.520> time<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.210> will<00:02:51.420> stop<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> cycle

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
more time and that will stop the cycle

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.750 
more time and that will stop the cycle
so<00:02:52.770> I'm<00:02:52.860> actually<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.340> give<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.610> just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
so I'm actually going to give this just

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.130 
so I'm actually going to give this just
a<00:02:53.910> little<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.210> more<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.570> see<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:55.020> get

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
a little bit more and see if I can get

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.640 
a little bit more and see if I can get
to<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.380> very<00:02:55.560> very<00:02:55.800> top<00:02:56.070> here<00:02:57.170> again<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.500> can

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
to the very very top here again you can

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.170 
to the very very top here again you can
adjust<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.070> based<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.640> strength<00:03:00.000> of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
adjust this based on the strength of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.690 
adjust this based on the strength of
your<00:03:00.480> drink<00:03:00.870> how<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.140> like<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.710> be<00:03:01.740> because

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
again I can stop the brew cycle at any

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.430 
again I can stop the brew cycle at any
time<00:03:05.070> by<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.430> simply<00:03:05.670> pressing<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.270> button
