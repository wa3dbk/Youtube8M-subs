you'll have some choices to make you can
now<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.579> put<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> blanket<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.930> refracts

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
now just put the blanket on and refracts

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.429 
now just put the blanket on and refracts
over<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> top<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:33.119> done<00:01:33.439> but

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
over the top of it and you're done but

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.590 
over the top of it and you're done but
we<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.799> from<00:01:35.009> research<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.090> oven<00:01:36.420> will

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
we know from research that the oven will

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.990 
we know from research that the oven will
be<00:01:36.720> much<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.350> efficient<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.490> stay<00:01:38.729> hot

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
be much more efficient and will stay hot

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060 
be much more efficient and will stay hot
longer<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:40.110> keep<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> heat<00:01:40.770> from

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
longer if we keep the heat from

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.940 
longer if we keep the heat from
dissipating<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.570> chose<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.200> refracts<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
dissipating so we chose to refracts the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.940 
dissipating so we chose to refracts the
entire<00:01:44.549> dome<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.720> make<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> oven<00:01:46.409> much<00:01:46.680> more

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
entire dome to make the oven much more

refracts mortar in the thermal blanket

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.020 
refracts mortar in the thermal blanket
were<00:01:58.500> included<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> kit<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.850> was

were included in the kit that was

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.899 
were included in the kit that was

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
shipped to me the thermal blanket then

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
shipped to me the thermal blanket then
is<00:02:03.119> wrapped<00:02:03.420> completely<00:02:03.719> around<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.040> dome

then<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.100> can<00:02:13.250> refracts<00:02:13.850> over<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.540> top<00:02:14.840> of

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
then you can refracts over the top of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.740 
then you can refracts over the top of
the<00:02:15.230> blanket<00:02:15.650> again<00:02:15.980> if<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:17.240> an<00:02:17.360> exterior

eight to ten inches again make this dry
sand<00:03:09.610> moisture<00:03:10.610> will<00:03:10.820> evaporate<00:03:11.090> out<00:03:11.420> but

synthetic product that is a great
insulation<00:03:37.010> product<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.820> you'll<00:03:38.420> top<00:03:38.660> up<00:03:38.840> the

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959

then<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.420> my<00:03:44.780> installation<00:03:45.260> we<00:03:45.890> could<00:03:46.070> go

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
then in my installation we could go

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.729 
then in my installation we could go
ahead<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.700> finish<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.510> roof<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.989> get<00:03:48.530> rid<00:03:48.709> of

ahead and finish the roof and get rid of

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.470 
ahead and finish the roof and get rid of
the<00:03:48.920> tarp<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.280> kept<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.820> rain<00:03:50.000> out<00:03:50.239> and

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
the tarp that kept the rain out and

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.380 
the tarp that kept the rain out and
finished<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.290> structure<00:03:51.739> it<00:03:51.920> now<00:03:52.790> looks<00:03:53.090> like

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
finished the structure it now looks like

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.420 
finished the structure it now looks like
part<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.930> house<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.440> it's<00:03:55.220> certainly

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
part of the house and it's certainly
