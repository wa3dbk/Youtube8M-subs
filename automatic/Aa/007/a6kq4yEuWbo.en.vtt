00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 with time I notice how simple 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.140
 but let's not stay with this, ok, I do not know 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.040

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.960
 a rude man she is a shy woman 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.929
 who clearly sees in him as a savior 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.150
 he is the coolest guy in school 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.449
 however, she is already offering 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.460
 a fidelity on rainy days 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.890
 offers an umbrella and some man will 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.689
 he says you do not have to suffer I know that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 you hold on a lot but I'm 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.340
 with you play with you and let us grow 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.100
 street that has all the best zest she 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.870
 it says ok we got married the beginning to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.120
 work she also has a job 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.969
 humble the two of them and she has already started 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.949
 tell you let's buy this watch that goes to 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.650
 mark the passage of time of our 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.010
 amorous progress 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.790
 she gets pregnant and the stage goes from 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.350
 be a rude guy to someone much more 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.940
 candid but the problem is that the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.070
 problems come over him 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.970
 of work after having a daughter 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.620
 begins the recession and unemployment 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.480
 He begins to return the tough guy and 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.910
 they are much older they give themselves 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.580
 account and he has become a 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.950
 bad person even for her this law 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.630
 unfaithful begins to have problem in the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.510
 Work begins to look at other women 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.880
 comes to hit the woman who promised 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.600
 love forever falls into alcohol 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.660
 let's say and looking for someone else's love but she 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.479
 with a patience that only she could 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.910
 encompass his hate finally he 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.740
 sick and he comes back again to be new 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.979
 a person gets all the floor of 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.210
 over he cares for her and is again a good 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.299
 father a good husband works without 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.049
 stronger than ever with all the encouragement 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.020
 but time is already requesting that 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.240
 she has to abandon looks she did 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.159
 from him a better person turns him to 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.840
 put a flight as a girlfriend who came here 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.330
 what's nice because they have a clock 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.970
 that marked the passage the time commented 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.160
 difficult and here is when he tells you 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.500
 please I want the time to be 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.230
 stop is my wife is taking 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.870
 the one that was the anchor on the compass 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.019
 of my life 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.180
 he does not support us he has one more act of anger 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.360
 for wanting things not to go to 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.220
 natural rhythm but she that everything is 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.180
 It is wonderful because he's says 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.629
 well we live a full life I already have 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.299
 to leave, let me know that I will be 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.470
 waiting as always I did without another 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.370
 peace 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.069
 rejuvenates 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.290
 simply by the advice of them be 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.650
 the moment he dies they turn to 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.959
 point and your love goes between cabbage the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.260
 time he said because they are again so 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.770
 happy as always 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.720
 notice 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.940
 what this court talks about is one thing 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.140
 wonderful is like saying that time 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.260
 it is a test for all 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.520
 one changes because different things happen 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.950
 one is known in certain circumstances 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.390
 but the circumstances change that to 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.360
 Sometimes they find themselves changing to 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.330
 people but if only one of them does not 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.900
 changes despite what's around and it 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.180
 adamant time APEC 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.400
 time will happen to us for it I said 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.720
 you can back it up because what I did 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.870
 this short is that if someone loves you 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.600
 always someone will always be 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.630
 waiting 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.110
 it is a wonder 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.450
 that is, that has to happen to the 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.820
 first problem may loosen and one in 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.350
 the first thing that comes to mind 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.360
 but in choosing it is that in the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.310
 first moment when he met him as a 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.200
 rough guy who was someone who was 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.530
 brought his idea and he says I offer you 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.990
 for water I offer you a breakfast myself 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.110
 I offer you my whole person to be 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.720
 couple he says ok and he starts the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.480
 talking but when things are not 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.970
 dan begins to return the irate guy 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.650
 but since he is so frustrated because 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.530
 things have not happened like him 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.150
 would like because he thinks that by making 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.000
 case of her that has one more way 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.550
 kindly to see the situation says no to 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.440
 I was doing better when I was heavy 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.020
 when he was a guy like he did not 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.860
 bullets entered and falls into the alcohol falls 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.590
 in women let's say of bad life 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.840
 but she always waits for him not 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.400
 there was a clock that the pendulum marked a 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.699
 just minute of happiness to all the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.520
 time and it's like she gets sick and she 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.740
 is but still and he manages to return to 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.050
 chemically change back to being the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.960
 good person returns to the same job 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.419
 it's worth to say his life did not change but he 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.610
 change inside your environment improved 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.370
 because I saw him with better eyes in what 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.169
 that he finally touched after 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.659
 we see that he manages to make the call when 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.969
 she falls ill he begins to live a 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.830
 second marriage that is the best since 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.680
 with all the accumulated experience and 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.870
 When time tells you it's time for 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.449
 that she leaves someone from above 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:17.270
 is asking he comes a second 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.270
 rage that is me I was wrong 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:26.820
 I lost time all the time so for 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.470
 the pendulum 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.780
 I had to take advantage of all the time 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.840
 had with it in fact some time already 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.760
 it goes away and already in the accompaniment look at it and what 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.890
 is waiting as much as it is but 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:45.240
 There are the times that he made a mistake as 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.240
 I already talked with him
