that way if the same planet is also
ruling<00:03:10.370> one<00:03:10.520> of<00:03:10.610> these<00:03:10.850> horses<00:03:11.060> then<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:12.320> will

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
ruling one of these horses then it will

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.199 
ruling one of these horses then it will
be<00:03:12.620> predominantly<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.460> effect<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.910> the

despite<00:04:53.550> being<00:04:53.819> the<00:04:54.000> lord<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.389> sixth<00:04:54.780> he

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
despite being the lord of the sixth he

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.869 
despite being the lord of the sixth he
is<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.500> good<00:04:55.710> planet<00:04:55.979> and<00:04:56.280> that's<00:04:56.490> why<00:04:56.610> we<00:04:56.759> have

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
is a good planet and that's why we have

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.670 
is a good planet and that's why we have
listed<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.300> as<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.509> number<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:58.110> put<00:04:58.289> planet

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
listed it as the number to put planet

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.170 
listed it as the number to put planet
but<00:04:59.419> what<00:05:00.419> happens<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:02.000> logic<00:05:03.000> of<00:05:03.120> the

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
but what happens to the logic of the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.659 
but what happens to the logic of the
sixth<00:05:03.629> is<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:03.960> completely<00:05:04.349> gone<00:05:04.740> because<00:05:05.370> if

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
sixth is it completely gone because if

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.850 
sixth is it completely gone because if
there<00:05:05.940> are<00:05:05.969> lot<00:05:06.479> of<00:05:06.509> the<00:05:06.719> nine<00:05:06.900> folks<00:05:07.199> this

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
there are lot of the nine folks this

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.670 
there are lot of the nine folks this
house<00:05:08.069> is<00:05:08.599> about<00:05:09.599> obstacles<00:05:10.440> and

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
house is about obstacles and

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.420 
house is about obstacles and
difficulties<00:05:11.539> so<00:05:12.620> even<00:05:13.620> during<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:14.039> dash<00:05:14.219> of

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
difficulties so even during the dash of

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.309 
difficulties so even during the dash of
Jupiter<00:05:15.030> during<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.539> planetary<00:05:15.960> period<00:05:16.229> of

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
Jupiter during the planetary period of

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.969 
Jupiter during the planetary period of
Jupiter<00:05:16.800> this<00:05:17.669> person<00:05:18.240> was<00:05:18.599> born<00:05:18.840> in<00:05:19.169> the

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
Jupiter this person was born in the

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.879 
Jupiter this person was born in the
cancer<00:05:20.400> ascendant<00:05:20.840> will<00:05:21.840> get<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.650> good

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
cancer ascendant will get the good

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.850 
cancer ascendant will get the good
effects<00:05:23.279> of<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:24.120> ninth<00:05:24.330> house<00:05:24.599> but<00:05:25.500> not<00:05:25.680> that

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
effects of the ninth house but not that

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.379 
effects of the ninth house but not that
easily<00:05:26.159> because<00:05:26.729> there<00:05:26.849> will<00:05:26.969> still<00:05:27.150> be<00:05:27.210> some

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
easily because there will still be some

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.080 
easily because there will still be some
obstacles<00:05:28.110> because<00:05:28.349> she<00:05:29.130> didn't<00:05:29.400> own<00:05:29.610> so<00:05:29.819> six

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
obstacles because she didn't own so six

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.499 
obstacles because she didn't own so six
but<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.779> can<00:05:30.960> say<00:05:31.199> that<00:05:31.500> 90%<00:05:32.279> of<00:05:32.909> Jupiter<00:05:33.360> is

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
but you can say that 90% of Jupiter is

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.180 
but you can say that 90% of Jupiter is
fruitful<00:05:34.020> intent<00:05:34.500> because<00:05:34.650> it<00:05:34.830> is<00:05:34.949> bad

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
fruitful intent because it is bad

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.430 
fruitful intent because it is bad
because<00:05:35.880> as<00:05:36.210> actually<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.719> beginning<00:05:37.020> that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
because as actually the beginning that

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.100 
because as actually the beginning that
Jupiter<00:05:37.919> is<00:05:38.360> naturally<00:05:39.360> inclined<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:39.930> do

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
Jupiter is naturally inclined to do

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.170 
Jupiter is naturally inclined to do
these<00:05:40.349> activities<00:05:40.710> more<00:05:41.460> than<00:05:41.520> this

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
these activities more than this

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.519 
these activities more than this
the<00:05:42.659> third<00:05:42.870> beneficial<00:05:43.529> raha<00:05:43.979> is<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:45.240> moon

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
the third beneficial raha is the moon

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.040 
the third beneficial raha is the moon
because<00:05:46.529> this<00:05:47.250> house<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:48.270> first<00:05:48.509> house<00:05:48.750> is

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
because this house the first house is

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.619 
because this house the first house is
owned<00:05:49.770> by<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.310> moon<00:05:50.699> so<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.479> reason

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
owned by the moon so that is the reason

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.369 
owned by the moon so that is the reason
why<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:53.009> moon<00:05:53.250> is<00:05:53.400> listed<00:05:53.729> as<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:53.879> third<00:05:54.379> best

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:55.379 
why the moon is listed as the third best

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.010 
why the moon is listed as the third best
planet<00:05:55.860> but<00:05:56.819> it<00:05:57.060> is<00:05:57.120> always<00:05:57.389> in<00:05:57.509> this<00:05:57.659> order

surely<00:07:05.999> a<00:07:06.029> very<00:07:06.389> powerful<00:07:06.959> Muraki<00:07:07.859> planet<00:07:08.399> for

00:07:09.049 --> 00:07:09.059 
surely a very powerful Muraki planet for

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:11.959 
surely a very powerful Muraki planet for
those<00:07:09.569> who<00:07:09.749> are<00:07:09.839> born<00:07:10.049> in<00:07:10.289> the<00:07:10.439> cancer<00:07:10.949> so<00:07:11.789> the

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:11.969 
those who are born in the cancer so the

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.209 
those who are born in the cancer so the
Sun<00:07:12.239> is<00:07:12.479> a<00:07:12.569> lot<00:07:12.839> of<00:07:12.959> the<00:07:13.049> second<00:07:13.439> and<00:07:13.649> it<00:07:14.099> is

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:14.219 
Sun is a lot of the second and it is

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:16.819 
Sun is a lot of the second and it is
similar<00:07:14.459> to<00:07:14.639> the<00:07:15.509> same<00:07:15.719> thing<00:07:15.929> as<00:07:16.049> Saturn<00:07:16.469> it's

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:16.829 
similar to the same thing as Saturn it's

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:18.379 
similar to the same thing as Saturn it's
very<00:07:17.039> strange<00:07:17.339> that<00:07:17.459> these<00:07:17.759> two<00:07:17.909> are<00:07:17.999> enemies

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
very strange that these two are enemies

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.689 
very strange that these two are enemies
but<00:07:19.079> for<00:07:19.319> this<00:07:19.469> Lebanon<00:07:19.919> these<00:07:20.159> two<00:07:20.399> planets

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 
but for this Lebanon these two planets

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.569 
but for this Lebanon these two planets
have<00:07:20.879> become<00:07:21.179> the<00:07:21.679> Monica<00:07:22.679> planet<00:07:23.039> so<00:07:23.249> even

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:23.579 
have become the Monica planet so even

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:27.489 
have become the Monica planet so even
Sun<00:07:24.419> is<00:07:24.659> also<00:07:24.869> a<00:07:25.049> maraca<00:07:25.559> planet<00:07:26.459> but<00:07:26.999> remember

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:27.499 
Sun is also a maraca planet but remember

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:30.409 
Sun is also a maraca planet but remember
if<00:07:28.499> these<00:07:28.829> two<00:07:29.039> planets<00:07:29.279> are<00:07:29.610> really<00:07:29.759> bad<00:07:30.149> they

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 
if these two planets are really bad they

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:31.850 
if these two planets are really bad they
should<00:07:30.449> have<00:07:30.689> been<00:07:30.809> included<00:07:31.049> here<00:07:31.529> the

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 
should have been included here the

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.799 
should have been included here the
reason<00:07:32.039> why<00:07:32.339> Marcia<00:07:32.669> pressures<00:07:33.149> not<00:07:33.329> included

00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:33.809 
reason why Marcia pressures not included

00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:36.409 
reason why Marcia pressures not included
is<00:07:33.959> at<00:07:34.169> many<00:07:34.709> times<00:07:35.039> this<00:07:35.699> planet<00:07:36.119> can<00:07:36.269> also

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 
is at many times this planet can also

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:39.350 
is at many times this planet can also
contribute<00:07:36.959> to<00:07:37.199> wealth<00:07:37.559> and<00:07:37.829> this<00:07:38.360> planet

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 
contribute to wealth and this planet

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.209 
contribute to wealth and this planet
which<00:07:39.659> is<00:07:39.689> saddened<00:07:40.259> and<00:07:40.499> contribute<00:07:40.979> to<00:07:41.009> so

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:41.219 
which is saddened and contribute to so

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:43.519 
which is saddened and contribute to so
many<00:07:41.399> other<00:07:41.519> good<00:07:41.759> things<00:07:42.029> but<00:07:42.629> at<00:07:42.779> times<00:07:43.049> they

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:43.529 
many other good things but at times they

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:47.569 
many other good things but at times they
can<00:07:43.559> cause<00:07:44.009> this<00:07:44.399> problem<00:07:44.969> of<00:07:46.279> great<00:07:47.279> danger

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:47.579 
can cause this problem of great danger

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:49.849 
can cause this problem of great danger
to<00:07:47.609> the<00:07:47.789> physical<00:07:48.119> body<00:07:48.179> and<00:07:48.629> that's<00:07:49.349> the<00:07:49.499> only

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:49.859 
to the physical body and that's the only

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:52.489 
to the physical body and that's the only
reason<00:07:50.729> why<00:07:50.879> they<00:07:51.119> have<00:07:51.239> been<00:07:51.389> classified<00:07:52.019> as

00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:52.499 
reason why they have been classified as

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:55.249 
reason why they have been classified as
America<00:07:53.279> planet<00:07:53.669> so<00:07:54.359> we<00:07:54.569> have<00:07:54.749> come<00:07:54.959> to<00:07:54.989> the
