00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
preferred if anything the roles would be

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
preferred if anything the roles would be
reversed<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.409> got<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> cognitive<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
Leone and whatnot instead of that so my

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.109 
Leone and whatnot instead of that so my
personal<00:01:32.280> opinion<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.820> why<00:01:32.970> he

that<00:03:24.090> definitely<00:03:24.480> Massimo<00:03:24.900> must<00:03:25.200> have

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
that definitely Massimo must have

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.740 
that definitely Massimo must have
something<00:03:25.799> awesome<00:03:25.980> plan<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:26.639> I<00:03:26.849> can't

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
something awesome plan but I can't

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.879 
something awesome plan but I can't
really<00:03:27.930> come<00:03:28.109> up<00:03:28.230> with<00:03:28.349> too<00:03:28.470> many<00:03:28.560> predictions

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
really come up with too many predictions

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.099 
really come up with too many predictions
other<00:03:29.160> than<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.400> fact<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:29.700> maybe<00:03:30.269> they<00:03:30.540> have

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
other than the fact that maybe they have

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.199 
other than the fact that maybe they have
to<00:03:31.319> defeat<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.889> certain<00:03:32.459> dragon<00:03:32.910> your<00:03:33.030> order

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
to defeat a certain dragon your order

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.000 
to defeat a certain dragon your order
for<00:03:33.359> them<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.510> escape<00:03:34.079> from<00:03:34.349> where<00:03:34.590> they're<00:03:34.859> at

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
for them to escape from where they're at

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.309 
for them to escape from where they're at
because<00:03:35.340> they're<00:03:35.639> like<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:37.019> dream

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
because they're like it's just a dream

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.229 
because they're like it's just a dream
can<00:03:37.650> one<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.280> Dragon<00:03:38.819> Slayer<00:03:38.849> it's<00:03:39.150> like

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
can one of the Dragon Slayer it's like

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.020 
can one of the Dragon Slayer it's like
maybe<00:03:39.720> they<00:03:39.959> knew<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.709> whatever<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.819> happens

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
maybe they knew that whatever it happens

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.759 
maybe they knew that whatever it happens
to<00:03:42.269> them<00:03:42.480> was<00:03:42.660> going<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.959> happen<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.500> that's

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
to them was going to happen and that's

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.259 
to them was going to happen and that's
why<00:03:43.919> they<00:03:44.040> were<00:03:44.130> training<00:03:44.430> all<00:03:44.669> these<00:03:44.849> humans

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
why they were training all these humans

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.150 
why they were training all these humans
to<00:03:45.389> be<00:03:45.510> dragons<00:03:45.959> laters<00:03:46.260> maybe<00:03:46.709> that's<00:03:46.980> what

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
to be dragons laters maybe that's what

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.240 
to be dragons laters maybe that's what
it<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.400> maybe<00:03:47.730> they<00:03:48.510> got<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.750> defeat<00:03:49.250> something

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
it is maybe they got a defeat something

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.150 
it is maybe they got a defeat something
or<00:03:50.430> somebody<00:03:50.700> in<00:03:50.970> order<00:03:51.329> for<00:03:51.480> them<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:51.630> return

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
or somebody in order for them to return

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.740 
or somebody in order for them to return
big<00:03:53.160> possibility<00:03:53.400> either<00:03:54.209> way<00:03:54.450> it's<00:03:54.569> going<00:03:54.660> to

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
big possibility either way it's going to

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.629 
big possibility either way it's going to
be<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> big<00:03:55.200> dragon<00:03:55.739> slayer<00:03:55.950> showdown<00:03:56.459> and

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
be a big dragon slayer showdown and

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.800 
be a big dragon slayer showdown and
that's<00:03:56.790> something<00:03:57.000> I'm<00:03:57.209> really<00:03:57.239> excited<00:03:57.629> for

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
that's something I'm really excited for

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.979 
that's something I'm really excited for
this<00:03:58.590> chapter<00:03:58.919> particularly<00:03:59.669> um<00:03:59.879> art<00:04:00.780> was

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
this chapter particularly um art was

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.930 
this chapter particularly um art was
okay<00:04:01.530> whatever<00:04:01.859> is<00:04:02.040> not<00:04:02.280> nothing<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.730> complain

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
okay whatever is not nothing to complain

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.750 
okay whatever is not nothing to complain
there<00:04:03.470> again<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.560> rather<00:04:04.769> have<00:04:05.010> seen<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.340> eto

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
there again I rather have seen the eto

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.699 
there again I rather have seen the eto
fight<00:04:06.060> had<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.480> we<00:04:06.840> seen<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.169> cognitive<00:04:07.560> fight

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
fight had it we seen the cognitive fight

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.170 
fight had it we seen the cognitive fight
and<00:04:07.859> it<00:04:07.919> would<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.129> been<00:04:08.190> like<00:04:08.310> epic<00:04:08.730> as<00:04:08.879> I

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and it would have been like epic as I

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.780 
and it would have been like epic as I
pretty<00:04:09.989> much<00:04:10.109> believe<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:11.069> was<00:04:11.280> because<00:04:11.669> you

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
pretty much believe it was because you

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.550 
pretty much believe it was because you
know<00:04:11.879> skipped<00:04:12.329> over<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.049> think<00:04:13.379> it<00:04:13.470> would

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
know skipped over but I think it would

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.869 
know skipped over but I think it would
have<00:04:13.650> been<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.769> better<00:04:13.889> chapter<00:04:14.370> because<00:04:14.489> it

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
have been a better chapter because it

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.640 
have been a better chapter because it
was<00:04:15.000> funny<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.419> eg<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.720> fight<00:04:15.959> but<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.349> would

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
was funny in the eg a fight but I would

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.900 
was funny in the eg a fight but I would
prefer<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.949> see<00:04:17.070> some<00:04:17.340> more<00:04:17.370> bad<00:04:17.669> assness

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
prefer to see some more bad assness

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.960 
prefer to see some more bad assness
that's<00:04:18.599> just<00:04:18.870> me<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.400> getting<00:04:20.400> hype<00:04:20.609> for<00:04:20.849> not

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
that's just me and getting hype for not

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.719 
that's just me and getting hype for not
suing<00:04:21.209> gajeel<00:04:21.900> vs<00:04:22.320> roll<00:04:22.530> good<00:04:22.740> sting<00:04:23.010> can't

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
suing gajeel vs roll good sting can't

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.250 
suing gajeel vs roll good sting can't
wait<00:04:23.880> for<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.419> then<00:04:24.780> at<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.900> end<00:04:25.020> of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
wait for that and then at the end of

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.360 
wait for that and then at the end of
