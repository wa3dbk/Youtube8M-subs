of seasoning that is so delicious

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.110

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
because it's very hard to be able to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.840 
because it's very hard to be able to
season<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.780> after<00:03:38.290> some<00:03:38.800> people<00:03:38.980> say<00:03:39.340> well<00:03:39.520> all
