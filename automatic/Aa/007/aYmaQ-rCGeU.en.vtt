lighter and we're about to discover

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.630 
lighter and we're about to discover
something<00:03:43.960> else<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.500> course<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:45.190> faster

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
something else of course that is faster

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.400 
something else of course that is faster
but<00:03:46.120> again<00:03:46.390> we<00:03:46.480> have<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.630> front<00:03:46.840> facing<00:03:46.870> camera

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
but again we have a front facing camera

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.900 
but again we have a front facing camera
here<00:03:48.150> all<00:03:49.150> right<00:03:49.390> now<00:03:49.570> let's<00:03:49.780> do<00:03:49.960> a<00:03:49.990> few

here all right now let's do a few
general<00:03:51.910> speed<00:03:52.270> tests<00:03:52.720> here<00:03:52.960> we're<00:03:53.740> going<00:03:53.890> to

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
general speed tests here we're going to

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.070 
general speed tests here we're going to
go<00:03:54.070> into<00:03:54.220> both<00:03:54.550> of<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.990> devices<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:58.120> let<00:03:59.020> me

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.710 
accelerometers in them arm and ambient
light<00:07:00.009> sensors<00:07:00.460> but<00:07:01.030> what's<00:07:01.240> different<00:07:01.419> with

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
light sensors but what's different with

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.230 
light sensors but what's different with
the<00:07:01.840> ipad<00:07:02.169> 2<00:07:02.410> is<00:07:02.620> it<00:07:02.650> has<00:07:02.979> a<00:07:03.009> 3-axis<00:07:03.940> gyroscope

the ipad 2 is it has a 3-axis gyroscope
and<00:07:04.780> that<00:07:05.349> kind<00:07:05.560> of<00:07:05.620> helps<00:07:05.860> with<00:07:05.979> gaming<00:07:06.370> and

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
and that kind of helps with gaming and

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
only main differences is that the ipad 2

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.680 
only main differences is that the ipad 2
is<00:07:28.599> faster<00:07:29.169> it's<00:07:29.949> thinner<00:07:30.280> and<00:07:30.550> it<00:07:31.090> has<00:07:31.300> two

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.779 
haven't had a chance to play around with
it<00:07:39.840> but<00:07:40.840> um<00:07:41.050> it's<00:07:41.770> it's<00:07:41.979> rumored<00:07:42.370> to<00:07:42.460> not<00:07:42.610> be

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:42.789 
it but um it's it's rumored to not be

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.480 
it but um it's it's rumored to not be
the<00:07:43.090> best<00:07:43.300> camera<00:07:43.750> that<00:07:43.870> you'll<00:07:44.289> ever<00:07:44.409> use<00:07:44.740> but

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.490 
the best camera that you'll ever use but

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.129 
the best camera that you'll ever use but
again<00:07:45.669> what<00:07:45.820> can<00:07:45.940> you<00:07:46.000> expect<00:07:46.120> from<00:07:46.360> a<00:07:46.539> 9.7

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:47.139 
again what can you expect from a 9.7

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:50.969 
again what can you expect from a 9.7
inch<00:07:47.199> screen<00:07:47.639> so<00:07:48.639> overall<00:07:49.240> um<00:07:49.509> the<00:07:50.169> Aqua<00:07:50.409> to<00:07:50.680> is

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:50.979 
inch screen so overall um the Aqua to is

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:52.230 
inch screen so overall um the Aqua to is
definitely<00:07:51.340> gonna<00:07:51.430> be<00:07:51.550> the<00:07:51.639> better<00:07:51.759> by<00:07:51.970> if

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240
