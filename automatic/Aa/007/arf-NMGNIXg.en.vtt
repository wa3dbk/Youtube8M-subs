00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.980
 come out and all that is worth that apart from 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.570
 the videos of gta 5 and the tricks of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.440
 money and the infinite pp is worth as 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.970
 forever 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.829
 then kids you know if you want 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.540
 more videos like this leave a law that does not 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.519
 it costs nothing and we're going to go with the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.370
 information in this case I come to 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.350
 talk about maps and game modes worth 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.509
 this information as you will always have 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.490
 the link to read it in the description 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.220
 It is valid in English but to translate and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.780
 it's good here says a map will be 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.649
 based on the Chernobyl reactor in 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.750
 ukraine the truth can be handsome 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.670
 I suppose the area will be there 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.280
 disaster and all that is worth 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.560
 and then it will be pretty cool to be 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.860
 mobile in ukraine a map based on that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.700
 good apart from that other map will be 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 based on tel aviv in israel vale is going 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.680
 bid because I guess it will be a story 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.730
 israel but good in israel after 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.560
 a nuclear explosion with which 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.350
 I guess the soldiers will not be 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.450
 normal soldiers because after a 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.940
 good nuclear bending looks good 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.980
 this map is worth it even if the latter is 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.320
 map that you put here is a map in a 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.840
 mining platform that looks like it's going 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.590
 going down during the game and you end up down 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.600
 of everything is worth 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.420
 I ended up under the earth 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.670
 underground good that's the news 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.010
 as far as maps are concerned and all the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.119
 maps puts here that are dynamic where 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.250
 the environment and its surroundings 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.960
 can be changed to that time and everything 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.730
 that will change let's talk about the modes 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.040
 Game I'll say quickly because 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.440
 I do not want to roll up either. 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.820
 of white stress good game modes the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.770
 most game modes for I guess 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.560
 that will be as white everything safeguarded and 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.050
 all this but here is a rumor that 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.200
 it may be that the référé is 20 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.990
 against 20 kids imagine that could 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.420
 be a pass, I want that 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.090
 try it even kids is that the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.460
 maps that I have told you the game modes 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.250
 that there may be a terrestrial loss 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.850
 20 against 20 everything I have told you 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.860
 today rumors are news that have come out 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.110
 the page to leave in description but 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.180
 I'm not kids from my point of 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.250
 I like everything I 've said like that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.200
 that if it came out would be a pass because 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.670
 I'm going to buy clearly and nothing 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.440
 active is to ask and you know if you want more 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.180
