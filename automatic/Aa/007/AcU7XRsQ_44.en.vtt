maybe the UM the Marshall was possible I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.940 
maybe the UM the Marshall was possible I
played<00:00:46.500> h3<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.219> prevent<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.890> now<00:00:49.890> we

played h3 to prevent it and now we

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.369 
played h3 to prevent it and now we

one of the very main lines of this
opening<00:01:01.100> it's<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.629> very<00:01:03.629> playable<00:01:04.549> line

maybe one of the absolute main lines of

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.830 
maybe one of the absolute main lines of
this<00:01:38.100> opening<00:01:38.550> I<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> main<00:01:39.630> line

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this opening I know that the main line

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.010 
this opening I know that the main line
is<00:01:40.050> looking<00:01:41.720> somewhat<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:43.260> this<00:01:44.750> maybe<00:01:45.750> not

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
is looking somewhat like this maybe not

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.270 
is looking somewhat like this maybe not
exactly<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.370> but<00:01:49.280> various

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
exactly like this but various

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:14.070 
exactly like this but various
similarities

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.410 

yeah<00:02:15.250> h5<00:02:16.250> hmm<00:02:16.850> yep<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.960> this<00:02:18.260> some<00:02:19.210> in<00:02:20.210> this

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
yeah h5 hmm yep this this some in this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.010 
yeah h5 hmm yep this this some in this
kind<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.460> position<00:02:22.460> there<00:02:22.850> are<00:02:22.970> many<00:02:23.210> many

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
kind of position there are many many

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.020 
kind of position there are many many
ideas<00:02:24.970> f4<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.240> one<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.870> them<00:02:27.190> or<00:02:28.190> play<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.000> a

ideas f4 is one of them or play on the a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.890 
ideas f4 is one of them or play on the a
file<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.630> course<00:02:30.760> played<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.940> first<00:02:32.390> maybe

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
file of course played this first maybe

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.880 
file of course played this first maybe
intending<00:02:33.680> who<00:02:33.800> gate<00:02:34.040> okay<00:02:34.820> she<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.890> broke

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
intending who gate okay she just broke

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.300

yeah I want to prepare a form besides f4
I<00:03:12.340> don't<00:03:12.640> really<00:03:13.800> know<00:03:14.800> one<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.459> we're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
I don't really know one and we're

I don't really know one and we're
playing<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.330> position

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.390 

oh<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:24.930> interesting<00:03:25.350> tactic<00:03:26.040> for

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
oh this is so interesting tactic for

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.390 
oh this is so interesting tactic for
take<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.820> age<00:03:27.000> 4<00:03:27.860> she's<00:03:28.860> going<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.190> take<00:03:29.460> on<00:03:29.640> e4

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
take on age 4 she's going to take on e4

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.260 
take on age 4 she's going to take on e4
wait<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.360> really<00:03:33.720> working<00:03:35.000> there's<00:03:36.000> also

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
wait is this really working there's also

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:46.190 
wait is this really working there's also
d6<00:03:36.930> hanging<00:03:43.070> maybe<00:03:44.070> 95<00:03:44.520> but<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.510> was<00:03:45.720> not<00:03:45.990> so

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
d6 hanging maybe 95 but this was not so

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.730

which<00:04:22.890> is<00:04:23.130> not<00:04:23.370> bad<00:04:23.930> well<00:04:24.930> not<00:04:25.140> bad<00:04:25.350> as<00:04:25.590> an

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
which is not bad well not bad as an

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.500 
which is not bad well not bad as an
understatement<00:04:26.220> that's<00:04:26.580> probably<00:04:27.000> very<00:04:27.090> good

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
understatement that's probably very good

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.160 
understatement that's probably very good
for<00:04:27.690> white<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.880> can<00:04:30.120> also<00:04:30.300> consider<00:04:30.870> taking

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
for white and I can also consider taking

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.670 
for white and I can also consider taking
on<00:04:31.440> d5<00:04:32.060> bishop<00:04:33.060> age<00:04:33.270> four<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.720> then<00:04:34.110> some<00:04:34.530> move

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
on d5 bishop age four and then some move

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.390 
on d5 bishop age four and then some move
