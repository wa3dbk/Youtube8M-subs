00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
really don't know just because of the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.109 
really don't know just because of the
fact<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.450> arm<00:01:34.070> because<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.369> we're<00:01:36.000> not

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
