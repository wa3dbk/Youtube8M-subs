00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
understandable but the thing is is like

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.430 
understandable but the thing is is like
even<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:46.000> original<00:02:46.480> story<00:02:46.690> had<00:02:46.870> some<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.319> it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
even the original story had some to it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.470 
even the original story had some to it
like<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:47.890> was<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.400> an<00:02:48.549> actual<00:02:48.849> plot<00:02:49.209> line

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
