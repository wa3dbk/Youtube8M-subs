00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
with a k-12 still so that's why I have

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.330 
with a k-12 still so that's why I have
on<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.960> hair<00:01:17.170> trigger<00:01:17.410> where<00:01:17.650> you<00:01:17.680> know<00:01:17.830> I<00:01:17.980> do

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
on the hair trigger where you know I do

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.760 
on the hair trigger where you know I do
lose<00:01:18.550> in<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:19.210> know<00:01:19.300> accuracy<00:01:19.870> but<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.590> fire

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
lose in you know accuracy but the fire

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.220 
lose in you know accuracy but the fire
rate<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.040> up<00:01:21.190> more<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:21.700> I<00:01:21.970> kind<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.870> like<00:01:22.990> then<00:01:23.110> I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
rate is up more so I kind of like then I

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.530 
rate is up more so I kind of like then I
have<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.440> stock<00:01:23.850> extended<00:01:24.850> max<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.180> South<00:01:25.210> sir

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
have the stock extended max in South sir

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.880 
have the stock extended max in South sir
you<00:01:25.780> always<00:01:26.080> need<00:01:26.230> a<00:01:26.260> silence<00:01:26.560> around<00:01:26.680> this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
you always need a silence around this

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.610 
you always need a silence around this
gun<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.400> I'll<00:01:28.390> also<00:01:28.570> recommend<00:01:29.080> having<00:01:29.200> stock

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
gun and I'll also recommend having stock

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.720 
gun and I'll also recommend having stock
just<00:01:29.890> because<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.280> know<00:01:30.370> when<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.550> turn<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
just because you know when you turn the

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.480 
just because you know when you turn the
corner<00:01:31.090> Adi<00:01:31.450> seems<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:31.960> much<00:01:32.050> easier<00:01:32.490> holding

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
corner Adi seems so much easier holding

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.860 
corner Adi seems so much easier holding
out<00:01:33.610> would<00:01:33.940> switch<00:01:34.180> out<00:01:34.360> would<00:01:34.659> be<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
out would switch out would be the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.870 
out would switch out would be the
extended<00:01:35.170> mags<00:01:35.320> for<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.680> foregrip<00:01:36.130> and

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
extended mags for the foregrip and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.770 
extended mags for the foregrip and
that's<00:01:37.060> only<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.300> thing<00:01:37.540> I<00:01:37.600> recommend

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
that's only the thing I recommend

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.600 
that's only the thing I recommend
recommend<00:01:38.620> putting<00:01:38.830> on<00:01:39.010> if<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.280> save<00:01:39.580> that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
recommend putting on if you save that

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
in the game and for the square shrieks I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.680 
in the game and for the square shrieks I
have<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> lot<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.430> stuff<00:02:16.730> loaded<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.210> this<00:02:17.420> gun

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
as you see I have extra time enemy

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.030 
as you see I have extra time enemy
direction<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.930> threat<00:02:21.200> detection<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.800> this

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
direction and threat detection so this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.610 
direction and threat detection so this
thing<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.580> p<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.510> know<00:02:23.660> it's<00:02:23.810> up<00:02:23.930> longer<00:02:24.410> I

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
thing is so p you know it's up longer I

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.740 
thing is so p you know it's up longer I
can<00:02:25.310> see<00:02:25.670> where<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.000> goings<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.420> like<00:02:26.540> almost

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
can see where the goings is like almost

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.900 
can see where the goings is like almost
like<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.020> normal<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.350> be<00:02:27.440> set<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.070> i<00:02:28.520> also<00:02:28.760> have

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
like a normal to be set and i also have

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.960 
like a normal to be set and i also have
drug<00:02:29.300> detection<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.780> well<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.650> a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
drug detection on well so it's like a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.020 
drug detection on well so it's like a
also<00:02:31.970> like<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.240> Oracle<00:02:32.600> from<00:02:33.290> cod<00:02:33.890> ghosts<00:02:34.730> so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
also like the Oracle from cod ghosts so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.580 
also like the Oracle from cod ghosts so
it's<00:02:35.240> only<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.510> thousand<00:02:36.020> points<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.470> plus

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it's only a thousand points and plus

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.080 
it's only a thousand points and plus
it's<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:36.830> thousand<00:02:37.250> one<00:02:37.520> hundred<00:02:37.550> points<00:02:37.850> per

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
it's a thousand one hundred points per

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.450 
it's a thousand one hundred points per
kill<00:02:38.270> 200<00:02:38.570> per<00:02:38.870> cap<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:40.010> almost<00:02:40.160> easier

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
kill 200 per cap so it's almost easier

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.000 
kill 200 per cap so it's almost easier
to<00:02:40.550> get<00:02:40.670> then<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.120> one<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.750> was<00:02:41.990> you<00:02:42.440> know<00:02:42.530> 50<00:02:42.860> /

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
to get then and one it was you know 50 /

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.650 
to get then and one it was you know 50 /
kill<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.370> only<00:02:43.550> had<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.210> seven<00:02:44.420> hundred

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
kill and I only had like a seven hundred

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.750 
kill and I only had like a seven hundred
score<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.920> that's<00:02:46.040> why<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.160> stack<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.700> up

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
score on it so that's why I stack it up

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.160 
score on it so that's why I stack it up
because<00:02:46.970> they're<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:47.450> much<00:02:47.510> easier<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.990> get

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
because they're so much easier to get

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.400 
because they're so much easier to get
and<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.040> system<00:02:49.400> back<00:02:49.520> here<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:50.360> lets<00:02:51.260> the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
and the system back here I have lets the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.380 
and the system back here I have lets the
