of these flood plains and in this setup
I<00:02:07.220> will<00:02:08.220> probably<00:02:08.640> move<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.629> hammer<00:02:10.020> tile

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
I will probably move the to hammer tile

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.700 
I will probably move the to hammer tile
to<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> right<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.599> still<00:02:12.780> get<00:02:12.900> my<00:02:13.020> food

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
to the right so I can still get my food

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.740 
to the right so I can still get my food
so<00:02:13.950> I'm<00:02:14.010> going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:16.250> which<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.550> ok<00:02:18.360> but

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
so I'm going to go here which is ok but

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.980 
so I'm going to go here which is ok but
I'm<00:02:18.990> going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> plant<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:21.780> want

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
I'm going to plant it and you just want

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.270 
I'm going to plant it and you just want
to<00:02:22.020> go<00:02:22.140> ahead<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.500> make<00:02:22.650> sure<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.890> scout<00:02:23.130> your

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
to go ahead and make sure you scout your

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.250 
to go ahead and make sure you scout your
scout<00:02:23.670> first<00:02:24.060> or<00:02:24.330> your<00:02:24.390> warrior<00:02:24.690> first<00:02:24.960> then

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
scout first or your warrior first then

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.300 
scout first or your warrior first then
always<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:26.010> your<00:02:26.190> city<00:02:26.490> settings<00:02:27.210> second<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
always do your city settings second the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.610 
always do your city settings second the
next<00:02:29.520> thing<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.850> want<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> do<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.630> since

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
next thing that you want to do is since

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.470 
next thing that you want to do is since
i'm<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.130> him<00:02:32.340> or<00:02:32.430> tile<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.000> probably<00:02:33.240> want

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
i'm on a to him or tile I probably want

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.770 
i'm on a to him or tile I probably want
to<00:02:33.570> go<00:02:33.690> worker<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.230> first<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:36.480> means

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
to go worker for first and that means

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.260 
to go worker for first and that means
that<00:02:37.170> I'll<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.500> able<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.740> work<00:02:38.040> whatever<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.970> get

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
that I'll be able to work whatever I get

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.850 
that I'll be able to work whatever I get
to<00:02:39.360> work<00:02:39.510> her<00:02:39.630> out<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.960> time<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> won't<00:02:40.710> need

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
to work her out in time so I won't need

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.920 
to work her out in time so I won't need
to<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.070> bronze<00:02:41.370> working<00:02:41.790> first<00:02:42.060> I'll<00:02:42.330> need<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
to go bronze working first I'll need to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.920 
to go bronze working first I'll need to
probably<00:02:43.140> get<00:02:43.500> agriculture<00:02:44.310> or<00:02:44.580> pottery<00:02:45.120> so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
probably get agriculture or pottery so

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.770 
probably get agriculture or pottery so
I'll<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.410> into<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.740> tech<00:02:46.920> tree<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.690> when<00:02:48.690> I'm

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
I'll go into the tech tree and when I'm

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.260 
I'll go into the tech tree and when I'm
in<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.080> tech<00:02:49.290> tree<00:02:49.530> i'll<00:02:49.920> pick<00:02:50.550> out<00:02:50.670> my<00:02:50.850> text

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
in the tech tree i'll pick out my text

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.820 
in the tech tree i'll pick out my text
and<00:02:51.450> not<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> first<00:02:52.140> tech<00:02:52.350> but<00:02:52.560> i<00:02:52.650> want

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
and not just the first tech but i want

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.950 
and not just the first tech but i want
to<00:02:52.890> do<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> series<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.700> text<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.660> i<00:02:54.840> can

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
to do the series of text so that i can

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.550 
to do the series of text so that i can
spend<00:02:55.920> more<00:02:56.160> time<00:02:56.310> focusing<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.210> game

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
spend more time focusing on the game

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.080 
spend more time focusing on the game
rather<00:02:58.560> than<00:02:58.710> selecting<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.340> tech<00:02:59.550> every<00:02:59.910> time

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
rather than selecting a tech every time

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.420 
rather than selecting a tech every time
it<00:03:00.270> runs<00:03:00.390> out<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.350> I'll<00:03:01.470> fault<00:03:01.710> probably<00:03:02.070> want

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it runs out so I'll fault probably want

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.730 
it runs out so I'll fault probably want
to<00:03:02.460> start<00:03:02.670> off<00:03:02.880> with<00:03:03.240> agriculture<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.230> then

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
to start off with agriculture and then

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.830 
to start off with agriculture and then
I'll<00:03:04.860> hold<00:03:05.160> down<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.640> shift<00:03:05.670> button<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
I'll hold down the shift button on the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.250 
I'll hold down the shift button on the
keyboard<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.560> I'll<00:03:08.130> select<00:03:08.430> my<00:03:08.610> next<00:03:08.940> text<00:03:09.260> in

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
keyboard and I'll select my next text in

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.200 
keyboard and I'll select my next text in
this<00:03:10.500> instance<00:03:10.890> since<00:03:11.070> i<00:03:11.220> already<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.910> wheel

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
this instance since i already have wheel

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.640 
this instance since i already have wheel
as<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.480> starting<00:03:12.810> tech<00:03:13.020> i'm<00:03:13.230> going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.500> go<00:03:13.620> ahead

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
as a starting tech i'm going to go ahead

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.200 
as a starting tech i'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:13.860> pick<00:03:14.100> up<00:03:14.220> pottery<00:03:14.460> so<00:03:14.820> i<00:03:14.850> can<00:03:14.970> get<00:03:15.060> that

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
and pick up pottery so i can get that

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.390 
and pick up pottery so i can get that
early<00:03:15.630> tech<00:03:16.170> boost<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.770> beginning<00:03:17.190> and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
early tech boost in the beginning and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.700 
early tech boost in the beginning and
then<00:03:18.240> i'm<00:03:18.360> probably<00:03:18.630> going<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.960> want<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.110> get

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
then i'm probably going to want to get

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.620 
then i'm probably going to want to get
straight<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.550> bronze<00:03:20.790> working<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.510> i<00:03:21.540> can

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
straight to bronze working so that i can

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.180 
straight to bronze working so that i can
start<00:03:21.930> chopping<00:03:22.350> those<00:03:22.470> forests<00:03:23.070> into

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
start chopping those forests into

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.670 
start chopping those forests into
additional<00:03:23.520> settlers<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.330> workers<00:03:24.690> after

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
additional settlers and workers after

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.130 
additional settlers and workers after
that<00:03:26.160> i'll<00:03:26.550> probably<00:03:27.030> pick<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.750> animal

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
that i'll probably pick up animal

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.470 
that i'll probably pick up animal
husbandry<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:29.910> forth<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.300> just

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
husbandry so on and so forth you just

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.000 
husbandry so on and so forth you just
let<00:03:30.570> go<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.840> shift<00:03:31.050> button<00:03:31.200> then<00:03:31.860> i<00:03:31.890> can

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
let go the shift button then i can

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.730 
let go the shift button then i can
always<00:03:32.130> pick<00:03:32.430> more<00:03:32.700> later<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:34.350> next<00:03:34.590> thing

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
always pick more later the next thing

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.950 
always pick more later the next thing
that<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.980> want<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.280> do<00:03:35.460> is<00:03:35.760> just<00:03:36.090> continue<00:03:36.600> to

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
that you want to do is just continue to

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.980 
that you want to do is just continue to
play<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.800> game<00:03:38.010> scout<00:03:38.790> around<00:03:38.940> if<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.840> do

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
play the game scout around if you do

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.470 
play the game scout around if you do
have<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> scout<00:03:40.560> you'll<00:03:40.920> want<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.340> scout<00:03:42.210> around

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
have a scout you'll want to scout around

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.710 
have a scout you'll want to scout around
your<00:03:43.260> base<00:03:43.550> not<00:03:44.550> just<00:03:44.850> directly<00:03:45.240> towards<00:03:45.630> your

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
your base not just directly towards your

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.720 
your base not just directly towards your
opponent<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:46.620> gives<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> lay<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.700> the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
opponent this gives you a lay of the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.210 
opponent this gives you a lay of the
land<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.690> know<00:03:48.900> where<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.710> settle

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
land so that you know where to settle

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.930 
land so that you know where to settle
your<00:03:50.340> cities<00:03:51.020> once<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.190> do<00:03:53.190> scout<00:03:53.580> all<00:03:53.820> of

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
your cities once you do scout all of

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.340 
your cities once you do scout all of
your<00:03:54.090> lands<00:03:54.450> you'll<00:03:54.630> want<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.900> mark<00:03:55.200> your

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
your lands you'll want to mark your

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.150 
your lands you'll want to mark your
cities<00:03:55.710> so<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.640> have<00:03:57.000> them

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
cities so that you can have them

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.800 
cities so that you can have them
pre-constructed<00:03:59.160> in<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.730> way<00:03:59.910> planned<00:04:00.600> out

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
pre-constructed in a way planned out

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.900 
pre-constructed in a way planned out
mapped<00:04:01.110> out<00:04:01.350> what<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.430> want<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.640> do<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.880> you

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
mapped out what you want to do is you

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.290 
mapped out what you want to do is you
want<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.210> hold<00:04:03.600> down<00:04:03.840> alt<00:04:04.050> +<00:04:05.010> s<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.700> then

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
want to hold down alt + s and then

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.900 
want to hold down alt + s and then
you'll<00:04:06.450> want<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.690> pick<00:04:06.960> on<00:04:07.170> your<00:04:07.320> city<00:04:07.530> spots

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
you'll want to pick on your city spots

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.250 
you'll want to pick on your city spots
so<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.060> instance<00:04:09.120> perhaps<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.140> know

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
so in this instance perhaps you know

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.170 
so in this instance perhaps you know
maybe<00:04:10.440> here<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:10.950> an<00:04:11.070> okay<00:04:11.340> study<00:04:11.610> spot<00:04:11.940> I

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
maybe here is an okay study spot I

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.330 
maybe here is an okay study spot I
haven't<00:04:12.360> found<00:04:12.510> any<00:04:12.750> additional<00:04:13.230> food<00:04:13.500> may<00:04:14.280> be

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
haven't found any additional food may be

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.060 
haven't found any additional food may be
here<00:04:14.970> just<00:04:15.420> for<00:04:15.600> demonstration<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.950> just

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
here just for demonstration and you just

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.340 
here just for demonstration and you just
can<00:04:17.190> put<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> little<00:04:17.489> X<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.060> then<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.780> way<00:04:18.989> you

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
can put a little X and then that way you

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.070 
can put a little X and then that way you
know<00:04:19.680> where<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.160> build<00:04:20.280> your<00:04:20.460> cities<00:04:20.960> if<00:04:21.960> you

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
know where to build your cities if you

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.210 
know where to build your cities if you
wanna<00:04:22.200> get<00:04:22.290> rid<00:04:22.350> of<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.590> signs<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.980> just<00:04:23.130> do

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.670 
wanna get rid of the signs you just do
alt<00:04:23.430> s<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:24.030> click<00:04:24.570> on<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.840> X<00:04:24.990> again<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.560> it

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
alt s and click on the X again and it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.060 
alt s and click on the X again and it
will<00:04:25.770> get<00:04:25.980> rid<00:04:26.160> of

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
will get rid of

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.820 
will get rid of
that<00:04:27.610> for<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:28.030> as<00:04:28.240> far<00:04:28.960> as<00:04:29.110> build<00:04:29.500> is

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
that for you as far as build is

concerned one of the things that you
want<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.660> do<00:04:31.810> is<00:04:32.020> probably<00:04:32.320> go<00:04:32.680> worker<00:04:33.010> worker
