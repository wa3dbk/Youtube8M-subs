00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello friends goal as you see we leave aside the flights and the news of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 technology to offer you a new computer tutorial video in concrete 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.410
 let's teach how to create a copy of the operating system windows 7 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.130
 something that is still going to come 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.030
 in case it sells you format it to avoid the 3rd in the first place 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.930
 boston duck four personal documents and for another place also avoids having 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.090
 that all applications are installed 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.530
 the programs and go back to set up the whole cooperative system is very 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.650
 pending that tutorial because I assure you its migrant herbiers tricks 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.510
 good as and then saying that we are going to teach them 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.470
 to create a copy 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.990
 of exists more 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.170
 or the hard drive and its entire structure of both the operating system windows 7 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 as of all files and applications that includes 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.690
 so that in case you have to format it either because of a virus or 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.350
 simply by the torture of the hard drive 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.630
 we do not have to reinstall 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.570
 all these applications 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.140
 Obviously do not lose personal personal ross fisher ducks to that 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.610
 we have installed in him 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.060
 good for it we are going to go alstom in a start 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.320
 let's click on the control panel 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.000
 and now we are going to locate the tool make a backup of the computer 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.210
 that is in the systematize escape tab 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.820
 we click and enter that window 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.560
 inside the window we go to the left panel and see what add an option 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.760
 which says create a system image 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.320
 vie we click on it 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.930
 and now, as you can see, the tool offers us a window 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.680
 that asks us where we want to save the copy of the system with the copy of 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.670
 security 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.750
 right now what it does 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.369
 do 1 analysis of available devices to form dinner 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.480
 said copy 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.500
 inside this window this tool allows us to be selected as a unit of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.229
 storage of the system copy 3 type of devices 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.719
 the first of them 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:17.839
 refers to any external or internal hard drive that does not 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.829
 it can be the same hard drive where we have the system 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.929
 we can also store this copy 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.250
 in a series of dvd is because 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.279
 opencel once 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:32.390
 you can also select a path to store this copy 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.719
 through st 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.259
 once we decide 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.639
 and we select in its size where we will store it 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.649
 we click on next 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.500
 we select the units with the spa structure if you 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.520
 that we want to store inside our system copy 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.069
 in this case 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.209
 would make the system copy of the faith unit that is where I have windows installed 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.399
 7 and all applications 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.099
 once I have I will select this 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.239
 This application 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.930
 costs arie tic windows in next kioto magically 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.189
 the program with the tool begin to create our backup 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.370
 done this we simply save our hard drive with our dvd etc 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.669
 so that in case we have to format 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.459
 we can recover 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.209
 that system copy 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.810
 i get 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.919
 without having to shoot anything else apart 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.459
 the same files in the same structures 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.539
 of files that we have at the time we make the copy 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.640
 If we have to 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.380
 recover said copy 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.150
 It can be done in several ways 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.839
 first of all if we have access 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:48.059
 leaving the cooperative system and the control panel would go back to the panel 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:52.539
 control and by we knew about recovering the system configuration was the 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:53.789
 team 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.270
 inside this window 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.550
 we would click on advanced recovery methods 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.620
 here as you see 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.090
 we already have the option that allows us to use a system image will create 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.649
 previously to recover the equipment 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:09.589
 simply 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.059
 we insert the first dvd 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:16.090
 of our system copy and another magically system will not go asking 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.239
 the following dance 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.200
 or we connect the hard disk or an external internal 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.290
 and we click and we follow a simple assistants 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.240
 another way in case we can not access our system that 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.389
 will be most of the time 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.729
 this without giving up the team 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.139
 insert the disk installation of windows 7 into it the reader 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.410
 d once inside this window 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.850
 we select the language logically 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.909
 and we click on next 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.300
 now is where we have to be more careful 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.680
 yes we simply want to make our nation clean 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.220
 that is, format the hard drive and leave the operating system 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.949
 in its initial state 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.809
 we click and link installed 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:04.709
 what are we going to do this in recovering the copy of the system that we have 

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:06.409
 created previously 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.599
 this way we click on prepare teams 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.919
 inside the face to the team does not leave a window 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.050
 in which allows us cobián 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.470
 use some recovery tool that offers the device account cd of the 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.930
 fund 7 to repair the system 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.500
 or directly restore the computer with system margin 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.990
 the image that we created at the time we do have storable on a hard drive 

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:33.849
 it was in a series of dvds 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.020
 we will select this option 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.539
 i will use about following 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:39.450
 now 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.370
 the system 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.020
 look for this one 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.259
 system copy 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.190
 or through a hard drive 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.970
 if you have stored it on a hard drive 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.669
 orengo inserting the dvd the first of the dvds 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.820
 of the arch of that subject in this case 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.230
 I'm not going to do it because in doing this, what I would do is 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.490
 everything that I currently have 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.129
 but hey it would just be 15 accept it and click on the rent okey 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:12.650
 done this we will click on the next section we would do the most current image 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.009
 and finally 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.009
 we would finish our assistants 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.949
 well this is all we have prepared for today I remind you that 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.820
 set up this dot com 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.850
 is one of the most important and timely IT portals in the world 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.710
 at the Spanish speaking level 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.610
 within our website today even here on our youtube channel podés 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.169
 find hundreds of their authorship while they in turn serve to solve 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:43.930
 infinite deformed more that may arise other equipment so not always 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.020
 I have more we inaugurate in a following program a greeting
