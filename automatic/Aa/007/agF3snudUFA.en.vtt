their seventies p90s in the 70s so I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.579 
their seventies p90s in the 70s so I
mean<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.519> this<00:00:53.839> question<00:00:54.839> is<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.110> women<00:00:55.470> that

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
mean it's this question is is women that

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.640 
mean it's this question is is women that
whether<00:00:55.769> they're<00:00:56.040> whether<00:00:56.220> they<00:00:56.519> are<00:00:56.790> some

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
whether they're whether they are some

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.299 
whether they're whether they are some
factory<00:00:58.650> or<00:00:58.799> not

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
factory or not

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.570 
factory or not
I<00:00:59.339> mean<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.900> bit<00:01:01.199> arbitrary<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:05.250> sounds

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
I mean it's bit arbitrary it sounds

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:15.600 
I mean it's bit arbitrary it sounds
freaking<00:01:06.000> great

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.359 

you<00:01:16.610> know<00:01:16.700> it's<00:01:17.090> 70<00:01:17.840> Gibson<00:01:18.770> have<00:01:18.920> not<00:01:19.159> clean

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
you know it's 70 Gibson have not clean

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.270 
you know it's 70 Gibson have not clean
eyes<00:01:19.810> but<00:01:20.810> I<00:01:20.840> mean<00:01:21.079> essentially<00:01:21.469> they're<00:01:22.189> the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
eyes but I mean essentially they're the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.179 
eyes but I mean essentially they're the
same<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.939> same<00:01:23.210> size<00:01:23.479> as<00:01:23.689> what<00:01:24.679> many<00:01:24.860> come

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
same the same size as what many come

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.560 
same the same size as what many come
back<00:01:25.369> this<00:01:25.490> would<00:01:25.640> be<00:01:25.759> anyway<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:26.149> there's<00:01:26.420> no

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
back this would be anyway so there's no

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.510 
back this would be anyway so there's no
routing<00:01:27.200> or<00:01:27.289> anything<00:01:27.409> like<00:01:27.619> that<00:01:27.679> they

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
routing or anything like that they

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.100 
routing or anything like that they
appear<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:28.969> be<00:01:29.270> like<00:01:29.899> they<00:01:30.649> should<00:01:30.890> be<00:01:30.920> there

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
appear to be like they should be there

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.419 
appear to be like they should be there
