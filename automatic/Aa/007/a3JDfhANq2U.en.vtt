00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
fact is that these properties usually

construction<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:08.250> skyscrapers<00:03:09.090> involves

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
construction of skyscrapers involves

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.020 
construction of skyscrapers involves
substantially<00:03:10.799> higher<00:03:11.010> cost<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
substantially higher cost so the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.970 
substantially higher cost so the
question<00:03:12.450> arises<00:03:12.569> whether<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.530> end-user

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
question arises whether the end-user

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.130 
question arises whether the end-user
should<00:03:14.609> expect<00:03:15.060> higher<00:03:15.450> returns<00:03:15.870> while

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140

should expect higher returns while
investing<00:03:16.769> in<00:03:16.920> skyscrapers<00:03:17.700> overall<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.629> think

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
investing in skyscrapers overall I think

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.809 
investing in skyscrapers overall I think
the<00:03:19.230> safety<00:03:19.440> aspect<00:03:20.159> is<00:03:20.310> something<00:03:20.430> which<00:03:20.790> is

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
the safety aspect is something which is

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.550 
the safety aspect is something which is
going<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.209> be<00:03:21.299> critical<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.019> if<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
going to be critical so if the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.789 
going to be critical so if the
developers<00:03:23.159> are<00:03:23.989> going<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.290> sort<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.769> know

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
developers are going to sort of you know

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.300 
developers are going to sort of you know
take<00:03:26.129> necessary<00:03:27.030> steps<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:28.109> kind<00:03:29.069> of

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
take necessary steps to kind of

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.640 
take necessary steps to kind of
articulate<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.420> safety<00:03:30.840> aspects<00:03:31.319> from<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
articulate the safety aspects from a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.369 
articulate the safety aspects from a
consumers<00:03:32.220> point<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.640> view<00:03:32.849> then<00:03:33.629> I<00:03:33.780> think<00:03:34.079> the

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
consumers point of view then I think the

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.339 
consumers point of view then I think the
overall<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.859> package<00:03:35.340> should<00:03:35.489> be<00:03:35.640> attractive

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
overall the package should be attractive

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.559 
overall the package should be attractive
so<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.379> verdict<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:37.980> clear<00:03:38.220> going<00:03:39.120> vertical

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
so the verdict is clear going vertical

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.180 
so the verdict is clear going vertical
might<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.049> solution<00:03:40.590> for<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.859> soaring

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
might be a solution for the soaring

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.069 
might be a solution for the soaring
