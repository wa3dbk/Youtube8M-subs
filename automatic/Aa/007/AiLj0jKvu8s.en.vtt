00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
them that's kinda none of my bid to them
and<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.939> reason<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.270> want<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.720> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and the reason you want to do this is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.990 
and the reason you want to do this is
because<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.310> logic<00:01:23.610> players<00:01:23.820> I'm

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
because I'm the logic players I'm

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
because I'm the logic players I'm
obviously<00:01:24.240> people<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.930> over<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.439> bit<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.950> them

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
obviously people to over a bit on them

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.440 
obviously people to over a bit on them
and<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.580> they<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> profit

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and then they can have a make a profit

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
and then they can have a make a profit
on<00:01:27.659> them<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.740> cheaper

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
on them or they can get them cheaper

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.990 
on them or they can get them cheaper
than<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.310> would<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.490> rather<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.909> them

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
than they would have rather get them

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390 
than they would have rather get them
before<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> obviously<00:01:31.829> means<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
before so that obviously means that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.890 
before so that obviously means that
you'll<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.909> able<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> puff<00:01:33.509> own<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you'll be able to make a puff own if you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.690 
you'll be able to make a puff own if you

120<00:02:00.390> over<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:00.840> obviously<00:02:01.110> i<00:02:01.320> don't

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
120 over that because obviously i don't

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.100 
120 over that because obviously i don't
know<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> price<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.340> um<00:02:02.579> i<00:02:02.850> will<00:02:03.479> try<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> win

them<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:04.979> there's<00:02:05.100> any<00:02:05.189> more<00:02:05.430> here<00:02:05.640> or<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
them as if there's any more here or that

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.100 
them as if there's any more here or that
sums<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.719> can't<00:02:06.899> bid<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.489> nope<00:02:08.489> okay<00:02:09.330> so

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
sums up you can't bid on nope okay so

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.710 
sums up you can't bid on nope okay so
let's<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.619> how<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.920> pans<00:02:11.610> out<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.150> for
