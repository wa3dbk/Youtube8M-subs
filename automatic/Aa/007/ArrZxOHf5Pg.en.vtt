Internet<00:00:00.840> I<00:00:00.870> know<00:00:01.140> I<00:00:01.319> say<00:00:01.530> all<00:00:01.740> my<00:00:01.920> videos<00:00:02.280> are

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
Internet I know I say all my videos are

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.460 
Internet I know I say all my videos are
pretty<00:00:02.580> damn<00:00:02.879> important<00:00:03.510> but<00:00:03.689> seriously<00:00:03.959> this

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
pretty damn important but seriously this

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.990 
pretty damn important but seriously this
is<00:00:04.650> probably<00:00:04.950> one<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.160> my<00:00:05.279> most<00:00:05.490> important

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
is probably one of my most important

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.059 
is probably one of my most important
videos<00:00:06.299> I'm<00:00:06.569> covering<00:00:07.350> some<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.830> most

videos I'm covering some of the most

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.890 
videos I'm covering some of the most
fundamental<00:00:08.790> questions<00:00:08.910> when<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.570> comes<00:00:09.780> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
fundamental questions when it comes to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.080 
fundamental questions when it comes to
training<00:00:10.110> how<00:00:10.500> many<00:00:10.679> reps<00:00:10.920> sets<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.700> what

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
training how many reps sets and what

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.789 
training how many reps sets and what
loads<00:00:12.480> should<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.900> do<00:00:13.110> when<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.559> comes<00:00:13.710> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
loads should you do when it comes to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.890 
loads should you do when it comes to
strength<00:00:14.099> or<00:00:14.400> trying<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.730> build<00:00:14.940> size<00:00:15.210> let's

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.870 
strength or trying to build size let's
take<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> look<00:00:16.470> at<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> big<00:00:16.890> board<00:00:17.160> who<00:00:17.550> wants

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
take a look at the big board who wants

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.950 
take a look at the big board who wants
to<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.150> stronger

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
to get stronger

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.960 
to get stronger
isn't<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.289> what<00:00:19.529> machines<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.699> pic

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
isn't that what machines are for the pic

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I'm going to make the argument that you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
I'm going to make the argument that you
can<00:00:49.289> build<00:00:49.500> size<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.370> fast<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.969> also

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
can build size just as fast if you also

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
can build size just as fast if you also
pursue<00:00:51.750> strength<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> same<00:00:52.649> time<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
pursue strength at the same time if you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
pursue strength at the same time if you
understand<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.390> you'll<00:00:54.750> understand<00:00:55.289> more

on<00:01:53.430> strength<00:01:53.909> let's<00:01:54.180> say<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.420> training

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
on strength let's say your training

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.749 
on strength let's say your training
deadlifts<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.409> your<00:01:55.560> demos<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.399> do

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
deadlifts and be your demos so you do

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
deadlifts and be your demos so you do

system recover when it comes to strength

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.660 
system recover when it comes to strength
you'd<00:02:10.349> want<00:02:10.619> less<00:02:10.830> than<00:02:11.039> 10<00:02:11.370> total<00:02:11.700> sets<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.180> a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
you'd want less than 10 total sets of a

you'd want less than 10 total sets of a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
of 85 percent or greater meaning that

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.160 
of 85 percent or greater meaning that
maybe<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.460> like<00:02:15.610> two<00:02:16.030> exercises<00:02:16.660> in<00:02:16.990> the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
maybe it's like two exercises in the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.360 
maybe it's like two exercises in the
strength<00:02:17.440> zone<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.950> know<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.130> do<00:02:18.340> a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
strength zone so you know you do a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.670 
strength zone so you know you do a
deadlift<00:02:18.790> maybe<00:02:19.180> three<00:02:19.540> reps<00:02:19.780> three<00:02:20.230> sets<00:02:20.260> and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
deadlift maybe three reps three sets and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.710 
deadlift maybe three reps three sets and
then<00:02:20.920> maybe<00:02:21.160> let's<00:02:21.520> say<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> front<00:02:21.970> squat<00:02:22.060> five

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
then maybe let's say a front squat five

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.690 
then maybe let's say a front squat five
reps<00:02:22.960> five<00:02:23.350> sets<00:02:23.620> that'd<00:02:23.800> be<00:02:23.980> eight<00:02:24.160> sets<00:02:24.580> in

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
reps five sets that'd be eight sets in

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.810 
reps five sets that'd be eight sets in
total<00:02:25.030> at<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.210> load<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.110> over<00:02:26.380> 85%<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.670> be

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
total at a load of over 85% and that be

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.280 
total at a load of over 85% and that be
sufficient<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.690> help<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.960> increase<00:02:29.170> your

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
sufficient to help you increase your

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.690 
sufficient to help you increase your
strength<00:02:29.650> from<00:02:30.040> there<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.460> can<00:02:30.610> do

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
strength from there you can do

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.310 
strength from there you can do
assistance<00:02:31.150> work<00:02:31.360> where<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.840> know<00:02:31.960> you<00:02:32.020> get

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
assistance work where you know you get

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.170 
assistance work where you know you get
more<00:02:32.500> than<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.680> hypertrophy<00:02:33.250> range<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:33.760> maybe

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
more than a hypertrophy range so maybe

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.090 
more than a hypertrophy range so maybe
ten<00:02:34.570> reps<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:35.020> whatever<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.530> may<00:02:35.680> have<00:02:35.950> to

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
ten reps of whatever you may have to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.040 
ten reps of whatever you may have to
work<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.490> blue<00:02:36.730> hand<00:02:36.970> race<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.600> focus

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
work on a blue hand race but you focus

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.900 
work on a blue hand race but you focus
on<00:02:38.320> doing<00:02:38.530> approximately<00:02:39.280> less<00:02:39.400> than<00:02:39.580> ten

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
to five minutes one of my friends try to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.100 
to five minutes one of my friends try to
become<00:02:50.620> stronger<00:02:51.040> yeah<00:02:51.730> no<00:02:51.970> yes<00:02:52.180> yes<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.959> he

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
become stronger yeah no yes yes and he

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.670 
become stronger yeah no yes yes and he
got<00:02:53.290> hepatitis<00:02:53.620> C<00:02:54.340> was<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.030> D<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.930> your<00:02:56.200> pure

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
got hepatitis C was it D if your pure

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.070 
got hepatitis C was it D if your pure
goal<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.280> hypertrophy<00:02:58.150> or<00:02:58.270> just<00:02:58.540> building

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
goal is hypertrophy or just building

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.870 
goal is hypertrophy or just building
size<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.040> slightly<00:03:00.280> different<00:03:00.670> than

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
size that is slightly different than

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.670 
size that is slightly different than
strength<00:03:01.180> as<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.600> can<00:03:01.750> see<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.320> force

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
strength as you can see the force

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.010 
strength as you can see the force
spectrum<00:03:03.340> curve<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.820> slightly<00:03:04.270> shifts<00:03:04.780> down

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
spectrum curve it slightly shifts down

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.130 
spectrum curve it slightly shifts down
so<00:03:05.440> 67<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.220> 85%<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:07.150> your<00:03:07.270> one<00:03:07.480> rep<00:03:07.660> max<00:03:07.720> should

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
so 67 to 85% of your one rep max should

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.020 
so 67 to 85% of your one rep max should
be<00:03:08.230> your<00:03:08.350> Lord<00:03:08.500> remember<00:03:09.070> it's<00:03:09.280> not<00:03:09.520> necessary

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
be your Lord remember it's not necessary

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.370 
be your Lord remember it's not necessary
to<00:03:10.150> calculate<00:03:10.360> your<00:03:10.660> load<00:03:10.870> because<00:03:11.230> as<00:03:11.350> a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
to calculate your load because as a

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.020 
to calculate your load because as a
beginner<00:03:11.739> that's<00:03:11.980> quite<00:03:12.220> hard<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.489> do<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.970> I

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
beginner that's quite hard to do and I

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.460 
beginner that's quite hard to do and I
don't<00:03:13.090> recommend<00:03:13.630> trying<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.110> rep<00:03:14.320> max

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
don't recommend trying to one rep max

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.930 
don't recommend trying to one rep max
because<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:14.830> don't<00:03:14.980> want<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.250> snap<00:03:15.550> or

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
because I don't want you to snap or

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.090 
because I don't want you to snap or
up<00:03:16.090> your<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:16.900> we<00:03:17.290> look<00:03:17.440> at<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.650> reps<00:03:17.890> here

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
up your so we look at the reps here

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.820 
up your so we look at the reps here
and<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.549> see<00:03:18.730> for<00:03:18.970> size<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.600> general<00:03:20.260> it

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
and you see for size in general it

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.530 
and you see for size in general it
depends<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:21.549> many<00:03:21.610> factors<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.299> this<00:03:22.390> is<00:03:22.510> a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
depends on so many factors and this is a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.870 
depends on so many factors and this is a
basic<00:03:22.840> diagram<00:03:23.470> it'd<00:03:23.860> be<00:03:24.010> six<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.580> twelve

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
basic diagram it'd be six to twelve

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.000 
basic diagram it'd be six to twelve
repetitions<00:03:25.299> for<00:03:26.049> pure<00:03:26.290> size<00:03:26.530> with<00:03:26.860> no

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
repetitions for pure size with no

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.949 
repetitions for pure size with no
strength<00:03:27.340> gains<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.850> from<00:03:28.420> there<00:03:28.600> each

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
strength gains and from there each

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.800 
strength gains and from there each
movement<00:03:29.470> would<00:03:29.950> be<00:03:30.100> three<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:31.060> six<00:03:31.330> sets

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
movement would be three to six sets

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.259 
movement would be three to six sets
that's<00:03:32.350> why<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.980> normal<00:03:33.400> typical

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
that's why the normal typical

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.360 
that's why the normal typical
of<00:03:34.420> June<00:03:34.750> three<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.530> know<00:03:35.650> sets<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.190> 10

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
of June three you know sets of 10

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.039 
of June three you know sets of 10
repetitions<00:03:36.580> actually<00:03:37.360> works<00:03:37.540> because<00:03:37.810> you

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
repetitions actually works because you

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.690 
repetitions actually works because you
can<00:03:38.170> look<00:03:38.320> it<00:03:38.440> fits<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.860> range<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.220> 6<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.459> 12

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
can look it fits in the range of 6 to 12

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.729 
can look it fits in the range of 6 to 12
so<00:03:39.910> 10<00:03:40.269> reps<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.930> total<00:03:41.290> number<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.560> sets

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
so 10 reps and the total number of sets

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.759 
so 10 reps and the total number of sets
for<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:41.980> movement<00:03:42.190> 3<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.700> 6<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.180> works<00:03:43.420> 3<00:03:44.049> sets

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
for that movement 3 to 6 it works 3 sets

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.740 
for that movement 3 to 6 it works 3 sets
now<00:03:44.950> rest<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.370> very<00:03:45.580> individual<00:03:46.239> but<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.480> good

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
now rest is very individual but a good

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.479 
now rest is very individual but a good
basic<00:03:47.170> guideline<00:03:47.560> would<00:03:47.739> be<00:03:47.860> between<00:03:48.190> 30

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
basic guideline would be between 30

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.130 
basic guideline would be between 30
seconds<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.090> 2<00:03:49.269> minutes<00:03:49.299> you<00:03:49.900> would<00:03:50.019> select

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
seconds to 2 minutes you would select

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.780 
seconds to 2 minutes you would select
between<00:03:50.440> four<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:50.980> six<00:03:51.100> different<00:03:51.549> exercises

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
between four to six different exercises

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.120 
between four to six different exercises
if<00:03:52.450> your<00:03:52.600> goal<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.780> pure<00:03:53.140> size<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.980> do

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
if your goal is pure size and you do

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.880 
if your goal is pure size and you do
total<00:03:54.549> sets<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.940> less<00:03:55.420> than<00:03:55.450> 20<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.650> know

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
total sets of less than 20 so you know

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.009 
total sets of less than 20 so you know
you<00:03:56.950> picked<00:03:57.280> let's<00:03:57.519> say<00:03:57.640> five<00:03:57.910> exercises<00:03:58.269> each

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
you picked let's say five exercises each

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.870 
you picked let's say five exercises each
you<00:03:59.380> might<00:03:59.560> do<00:03:59.709> one<00:03:59.950> that's<00:04:00.070> five<00:04:00.430> sets<00:04:00.730> one

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
you might do one that's five sets one

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.220 
you might do one that's five sets one
that's<00:04:01.060> four<00:04:01.239> sets<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.600> couple<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:01.989> three

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
that's four sets a couple that three

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.949 
that's four sets a couple that three
sets<00:04:02.440> in<00:04:02.590> total<00:04:03.220> it'd<00:04:03.340> be<00:04:03.549> less<00:04:03.850> than<00:04:04.090> 20<00:04:04.690> sets

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
sets in total it'd be less than 20 sets

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.380 
sets in total it'd be less than 20 sets
it<00:04:05.260> all<00:04:05.650> would<00:04:05.860> abate<00:04:06.130> this<00:04:06.760> rep<00:04:07.090> range

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
it all would abate this rep range

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.970 
it all would abate this rep range
because<00:04:07.900> most<00:04:08.140> guys<00:04:08.290> want<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.620> build<00:04:08.739> muscle

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
because most guys want to build muscle

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.770 
because most guys want to build muscle
get<00:04:09.340> stronger<00:04:09.670> or<00:04:09.940> lose<00:04:10.090> fat<00:04:10.269> we're<00:04:10.660> not

favorite topic which is the hybrid of

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.650 
favorite topic which is the hybrid of
building<00:04:17.829> both<00:04:17.950> size<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.760> strength<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.450> this

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
building both size and strength and this

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.420 
building both size and strength and this
is<00:04:19.780> what<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:19.959> really<00:04:20.380> want<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.770> to<00:04:20.799> understand

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
is what I really want you to understand

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.580 
is what I really want you to understand
today<00:04:21.609> is<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.570> could<00:04:22.750> pursue<00:04:22.930> strength

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
today is that you could pursue strength

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.010 
today is that you could pursue strength
and<00:04:23.800> size<00:04:24.310> at<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.849> same<00:04:25.090> time<00:04:25.390> how<00:04:25.690> would<00:04:25.900> you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
and size at the same time how would you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.460 
and size at the same time how would you
do<00:04:26.169> this

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
do this

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.140 
do this
by<00:04:26.560> combining<00:04:27.040> both<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.370> them<00:04:27.640> in<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.910> same

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
by combining both of them in the same

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150 
by combining both of them in the same
training<00:04:28.510> program<00:04:28.900> how<00:04:29.110> you<00:04:29.170> set<00:04:29.650> this<00:04:29.770> up<00:04:29.980> as

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
training program how you set this up as

neroli<00:04:39.010> draining<00:04:39.550> you'd<00:04:40.000> want<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.390> do<00:04:40.570> the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
neroli draining you'd want to do the

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.120 
neroli draining you'd want to do the
strength<00:04:41.050> first<00:04:41.380> so<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.560> select<00:04:41.740> let's<00:04:42.070> say

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
strength first so you select let's say

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.460 
strength first so you select let's say
two<00:04:42.220> exercises<00:04:43.090> it's<00:04:43.240> like<00:04:43.450> day<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:44.050> do<00:04:44.230> once

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
two exercises it's like day you do once

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.650 
two exercises it's like day you do once
again<00:04:44.560> deadlifts<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:45.490> front<00:04:45.910> squats<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:46.600> you

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
again deadlifts and front squats so you

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.060 
again deadlifts and front squats so you
do<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.140> know<00:04:47.260> you're<00:04:47.470> three<00:04:47.770> reps<00:04:47.980> because

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
do you know you're three reps because

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.890 
do you know you're three reps because
has<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.400> be<00:04:48.490> less<00:04:48.670> than<00:04:48.700> six<00:04:49.090> reps<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:49.720> do

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
has to be less than six reps and you do

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.470 
has to be less than six reps and you do
three<00:04:50.290> sets<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:50.920> got<00:04:51.100> your<00:04:51.250> tennis<00:04:51.550> then<00:04:52.150> you

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
three sets you got your tennis then you

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.510 
three sets you got your tennis then you
do<00:04:52.720> your<00:04:52.990> front<00:04:53.350> squats<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:53.950> do<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.400> know

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
do your front squats you do you know

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.510 
do your front squats you do you know
five<00:04:54.910> sets<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.390> let's<00:04:55.690> say<00:04:55.810> five<00:04:56.200> repetitions

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
five sets of let's say five repetitions

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.190 
five sets of let's say five repetitions
already<00:04:57.520> by<00:04:57.670> shifting<00:04:58.090> your<00:04:58.150> sets<00:04:58.540> reps<00:04:58.960> and

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
already by shifting your sets reps and

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.440 
already by shifting your sets reps and

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
movements are focusing on strength from

movements are focusing on strength from
there<00:05:03.610> however<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:04.270> can<00:05:04.600> move<00:05:04.780> upwards<00:05:05.350> in

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
there however you can move upwards in

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.070 
there however you can move upwards in
the<00:05:05.590> fourth<00:05:05.980> spectrum<00:05:06.520> on<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:07.450> hypertrophy

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
the fourth spectrum on to hypertrophy

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.260 
the fourth spectrum on to hypertrophy
building<00:05:08.650> size<00:05:08.890> you<00:05:09.220> keep<00:05:09.520> your<00:05:09.670> total<00:05:10.090> volume

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
building size you keep your total volume

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.820 
building size you keep your total volume
in<00:05:10.600> that<00:05:10.630> workout<00:05:11.050> once<00:05:11.290> again<00:05:11.560> less<00:05:11.800> than

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
in that workout once again less than

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.640 
in that workout once again less than
approximately<00:05:12.280> 20<00:05:13.120> sets<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.570> you<00:05:13.930> do<00:05:14.140> more<00:05:14.440> in

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
approximately 20 sets and you do more in

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.680 
approximately 20 sets and you do more in
the<00:05:14.830> hypertrophy<00:05:15.370> range<00:05:15.610> so<00:05:16.060> maybe<00:05:16.300> you<00:05:16.480> want

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
the hypertrophy range so maybe you want

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.630 
the hypertrophy range so maybe you want
to<00:05:16.750> work<00:05:16.870> on<00:05:17.050> your<00:05:17.230> quads<00:05:17.500> so<00:05:17.950> you<00:05:18.010> do<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.310> leg

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
to work on your quads so you do a leg

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.550 
to work on your quads so you do a leg
press<00:05:18.970> will<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.300> really<00:05:19.600> emphasize<00:05:20.260> you<00:05:20.440> know

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
press will you really emphasize you know

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.320 
press will you really emphasize you know
high<00:05:20.740> rep<00:05:20.980> so<00:05:21.130> let's<00:05:21.280> say<00:05:21.370> maybe<00:05:21.580> 10<00:05:21.940> to<00:05:22.090> 12

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
high rep so let's say maybe 10 to 12

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330 
high rep so let's say maybe 10 to 12
repetitions<00:05:22.510> feet<00:05:23.290> close<00:05:23.560> together<00:05:23.770> get

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
repetitions feet close together get

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.700 
repetitions feet close together get
those<00:05:24.490> quads<00:05:24.790> going<00:05:25.150> on<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.419> you<00:05:25.690> do<00:05:25.870> maybe<00:05:26.080> 3

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
those quads going on and you do maybe 3

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.770 
those quads going on and you do maybe 3
sets<00:05:27.010> if<00:05:27.280> you<00:05:27.370> wanted<00:05:27.640> to<00:05:27.760> grow<00:05:27.940> some<00:05:28.150> ass<00:05:28.330> and

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
sets if you wanted to grow some ass and

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.260 
sets if you wanted to grow some ass and
maybe<00:05:28.900> some<00:05:29.140> quads<00:05:29.500> you<00:05:30.130> do<00:05:30.400> Bulgarian<00:05:31.090> split

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
maybe some quads you do Bulgarian split

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.150 
maybe some quads you do Bulgarian split
squats<00:05:31.570> in<00:05:31.750> an<00:05:31.870> example<00:05:32.350> and<00:05:32.530> you<00:05:32.620> do<00:05:32.830> 8<00:05:33.100> reps

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
squats in an example and you do 8 reps

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.760 
squats in an example and you do 8 reps
per<00:05:33.700> side<00:05:33.880> and<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.300> can<00:05:34.450> do<00:05:34.570> 3<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.050> 4<00:05:35.290> sets<00:05:35.590> in

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
per side and you can do 3 to 4 sets in

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.190 
per side and you can do 3 to 4 sets in
total<00:05:36.490> when<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:36.700> add<00:05:36.880> up<00:05:37.060> all<00:05:37.180> your<00:05:37.300> sets<00:05:37.990> for

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
total when you add up all your sets for

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200 
total when you add up all your sets for
all<00:05:38.350> your<00:05:38.590> exercises<00:05:38.890> like<00:05:39.580> I<00:05:39.730> said<00:05:39.910> if<00:05:40.060> your

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
all your exercises like I said if your

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.969 
all your exercises like I said if your
goal<00:05:40.450> is<00:05:40.480> size<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.320> strength<00:05:41.530> it<00:05:41.740> should<00:05:41.919> be

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
goal is size and strength it should be

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.890 
goal is size and strength it should be
less<00:05:42.220> than<00:05:42.370> 20<00:05:42.729> you<00:05:43.120> do<00:05:43.270> your<00:05:43.450> strength

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
less than 20 you do your strength

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.780 
less than 20 you do your strength
lifting<00:05:44.290> first<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:44.680> your<00:05:44.860> two<00:05:45.220> movements<00:05:45.490> and

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
lifting first so your two movements and

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.760 
lifting first so your two movements and
then<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.210> move<00:05:46.360> on<00:05:46.570> to<00:05:46.720> your<00:05:46.750> 2<00:05:47.020> 3<00:05:47.350> maybe<00:05:47.590> 4

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
then you move on to your 2 3 maybe 4

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.030 
then you move on to your 2 3 maybe 4
hypertrophy<00:05:48.760> exercises<00:05:49.419> my<00:05:49.840> goal<00:05:50.140> is<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.800> get

hypertrophy exercises my goal is to get
a<00:05:51.100> goal<00:05:51.460> in<00:05:51.700> that<00:05:52.060> extremely<00:05:52.780> simple<00:05:53.530> way<00:05:53.710> you

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
a goal in that extremely simple way you

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.890 
a goal in that extremely simple way you
could<00:05:54.280> build<00:05:54.460> both<00:05:54.729> size<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.090> strength<00:05:55.690> in

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
could build both size and strength in

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.990 
could build both size and strength in
your<00:05:56.020> bill<00:05:56.200> size<00:05:56.440> just<00:05:57.100> as<00:05:57.250> fast<00:05:57.490> an<00:05:57.669> hour<00:05:57.880> to

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
your bill size just as fast an hour to

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.909 
your bill size just as fast an hour to
argue<00:05:58.240> for<00:05:58.390> beginners<00:05:58.780> faster<00:05:59.440> than<00:05:59.710> if<00:05:59.830> you

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
argue for beginners faster than if you

range<00:06:02.680> there's<00:06:03.190> a<00:06:03.280> transference<00:06:03.820> of

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
range there's a transference of

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.090 
range there's a transference of
performance<00:06:04.510> from<00:06:04.720> strength<00:06:05.140> to<00:06:05.530> hypertrophy

performance from strength to hypertrophy

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.400 
performance from strength to hypertrophy
more<00:06:06.550> than<00:06:06.970> there<00:06:07.120> is<00:06:07.150> from<00:06:07.540> hypertrophy<00:06:08.200> to

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
more than there is from hypertrophy to

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.110 
more than there is from hypertrophy to
strength<00:06:08.680> when<00:06:09.010> you<00:06:09.040> break<00:06:09.430> it<00:06:09.610> down<00:06:09.850> like

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
strength when you break it down like

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.790 
strength when you break it down like
this<00:06:10.240> you<00:06:10.419> could<00:06:10.690> really<00:06:10.990> see<00:06:11.320> how<00:06:11.560> there's

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
this you could really see how there's

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.620
