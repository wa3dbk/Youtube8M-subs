00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.440
 opportunity let's make some rich 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.540
 choco texas stuffed with delicacy and pecans 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.510
 the ingredients that we are going to use 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.510
 they are the delicacy the pecans 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.560
 chocolate coating and a brush 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.420
 a small pot and a bowl to be able 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.050
 melt this chocolate coating 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.119
 in bathroom marÃ­a 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.340
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.500
 melt two bars of chocolate bath 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.570
 Maria who dreams of Maria we will serve or 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.059
 in a pot and we put a small goal 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.050
 over for the chocolate 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 it melts 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.150
 we put the chocolate bars and 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.150
 we hope it melts 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.410
 with a ladle we are going to move the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.140
 chocolate to melt faster 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.450
 does not have to drop a drop of water 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.909
 so that the chocolate is not cut 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.380
 once it's well melted we're going to 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.380
 proceed to cast in the molds 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.090
 the mold that we are going to use is this 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.450
 we have this flower and this one 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.700
 hearts if they want 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.860
 with the brush we are going to talk 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.299
 to cast our mold as if 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.299
 we were painting 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.830
 try to throw 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.830
 more or less 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.440
 chocolate art so they can cover 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.440
 all the holes 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.540
 once finished painting all the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.549
 mold has to stay this way 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.430
 right away what are we going to proceed to 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.150
 do so that chocolate I know we're going 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.819
 to put it in the fridge 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.400
 let's put it in the fridge so that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.910
 dry the first layer 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.230
 [Music] 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.200
 approximately two thousand one time 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.210
 finished the first layer we proceed to 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.370

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.370
 to put the frizz for two minutes 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:56.110
 after two minutes we removed the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.110
 mold with the second layer 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.140

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.450

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.050

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.939

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.750

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.280

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.880
 it does not have to be 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.390
 and a 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.460
 Huecco does not have to have any holes 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.460
 so he hit her teak 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.020
 leave without any problem of the mold 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.110
