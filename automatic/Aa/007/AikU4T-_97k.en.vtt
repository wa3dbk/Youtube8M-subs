00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.070

 but also bag sachet though 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.509
 however they are customized by me 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.299
 see the link my my title of 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.900
 blog that you will also find on the site page 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.700
 facebook I recommend follow me 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.759
 there too in so many we proceed with 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.090
 now I show you my style shoes 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.090
 hogan 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.500
 look how fantastic they are 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.920
 what do you think I'm not really 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.520
 fantastic made of cotton like vi 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.489
 I said before and with a color like 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.319
 you can see very natural in neutral 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.160
 so that it can achieve the can 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.380
 wear both a child and a child e 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.840
 then it is a very generic color and then 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.819
 even summer as we are in 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.739
 spring 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.100
 so this this color let's say that 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.670
 okay on any outfit that 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.319
 both jeans and colored pants not 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.890
 it matters because this is a color 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.870
 neutral and therefore easy to combine though 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.640
 the peculiarity of that shoe is 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.140
 I have just realized that it is 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.799
 surrounded as expected in the minimum 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:53.650
 details the perfected it cured him 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.680
 also notice the tip that practically e 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.180
 it is not simply round but it is 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:08.769
 slightly tapered and slightly 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:12.519
 tapered caramel colored sole e 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:16.600
 which has a rise as practically as 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:20.320
 the kind the real say of course 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.570
 these are made by me and worked 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.810
 crochet 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.910
 now I show you what you need for 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.850
 realize them that I used to 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.620
 realize for the realization 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.790
 so since they are all laughs a 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.190
 cotton strokes 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:46.510
 so either the sole and then the part 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.269
 caramel and the rubber then the rise 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.269
 let's say that of the eraser 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.989
 however always made of cotton or 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:04:02.980
 used the skein matched the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:06.600
 skein number 5 caramel color 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.390
 here it is obviously for 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.730
 the rubber parts do not practice 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.760
 rubber is practically rubber though 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.700
 here that theoretically should be 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.090
 be the one with the laces them 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.770
 life of white cotton cole 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:29.100
 obviously always number 5 the shoe 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.090
 the badge the shoe the badge la 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.590
 I made the shoe with the ball 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.270
 page 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:43.280
 obviously all number 5 all these 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:52.110
 balls number 5 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:05:03.740
 ok then everything i worked with with 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:06.300
 cotton crochet hook number 1.515 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.830
 the crochet hook will obviously serve you 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.650
 classic embroidery scissors and a needle 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.220
 akr a large 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.220
 here it is 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.700
 what do you think are not fantastic 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:27.090
 really a new idea that usually 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:31.590
 yes I also made other shoes 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:35.100
 type converse adidas nike but this one 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.560
 scarpina was really designed that way 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.380
 by chance because I wanted to achieve 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.000
 some a different kind of shoe 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.430
 that in any case was not strictly 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.920
 let's say sporty sporty style then 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.480
 these shoes looked right to me 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.410
 it seems to me to make these shoes 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.510
 right 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.750
 let's say 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:00.890
 idea is a really totally idea 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:05.780
 different from the usual indeed or you will notice 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.630
 as we say the difference also of the 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.450
 tip I wanted to show you the trips 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:15.350
 of the adidas 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.810
 and this tip look at the difference 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.900
 there is this is round 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:24.920
 instead this is more tapered this is 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.790
 the difference between the sports shoe and 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:32.210
 the shoe we say classic of for 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:35.000
 we say to put even with jeans yes 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.130
 but let's say a different idea 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.630
 here's a really cool idea 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:46.310
 innovative what you think of as an idea 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:48.910
 fantastic gift true to the next video 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.910
 bye Bye
