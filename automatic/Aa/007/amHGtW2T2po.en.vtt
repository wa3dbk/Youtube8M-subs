so today we are going to read something

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:28.390 
so today we are going to read something
on<00:00:20.060> capacitors<00:00:26.650> especially<00:00:27.650> I'm<00:00:27.919> not<00:00:28.160> going

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
on capacitors especially I'm not going

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.330 
on capacitors especially I'm not going
to<00:00:28.520> keep<00:00:28.759> some<00:00:29.029> huge<00:00:29.419> tricks<00:00:29.779> on<00:00:29.960> Alberta<00:00:30.800> but

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
to keep some huge tricks on Alberta but

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.880 
to keep some huge tricks on Alberta but
exactly<00:00:31.880> some<00:00:32.300> basic<00:00:32.750> thing<00:00:32.990> I<00:00:33.200> am<00:00:33.320> going<00:00:33.740> to

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
exactly some basic thing I am going to

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.030 
exactly some basic thing I am going to
tell<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:34.130> today<00:00:35.079> many<00:00:36.079> a<00:00:36.200> times<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:36.620> see<00:00:36.829> some

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
tell you today many a times you see some

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.770 
tell you today many a times you see some
question<00:00:37.579> sort<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:37.970> like<00:00:38.180> this<00:00:40.390> there<00:00:41.390> are<00:00:41.420> the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
question sort of like this there are the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.500 
question sort of like this there are the
points<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:45.489> there<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:46.609> something<00:00:46.969> like<00:00:47.149> this

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
points so a there is something like this

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.069 
points so a there is something like this
and<00:00:50.769> another<00:00:51.769> thing<00:00:52.250> like<00:00:52.280> this<00:00:52.910> goes<00:00:53.870> to

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
and another thing like this goes to

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.709 
and another thing like this goes to
point<00:00:54.350> B<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.429> asks<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.059> equivalent

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
point B and it asks the equivalent

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:05.470 
point B and it asks the equivalent
capacitance<00:01:01.269> okay<00:01:02.269> so<00:01:02.780> actually<00:01:04.210> how<00:01:05.210> can<00:01:05.390> you

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
capacitance okay so actually how can you

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.590 
capacitance okay so actually how can you
solve<00:01:05.630> these<00:01:05.810> things<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.610> easiest<00:01:08.060> method

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
solve these things so the easiest method

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.140 
solve these things so the easiest method
to<00:01:08.630> solve<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.170> thing<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.560> what<00:01:09.770> give<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:10.790> plus

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
to solve this thing is what give a plus

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150 
to solve this thing is what give a plus
charge<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:11.900> side<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.290> plate<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:12.740> they

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
charge to this side of plate and they

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.480 
charge to this side of plate and they
give<00:01:13.430> minus<00:01:14.150> charge<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.600> decide<00:01:15.100> now<00:01:16.100> the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
give minus charge to decide now the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.399 
give minus charge to decide now the
connected<00:01:16.970> place<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.600> one<00:01:17.840> gives<00:01:18.290> the

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
connected place to this one gives the

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.190 
connected place to this one gives the
positive<00:01:18.829> sign<00:01:19.180> positive<00:01:20.180> charge<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.049> these

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
positive sign positive charge so these

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.859 
positive sign positive charge so these
are<00:01:21.380> all<00:01:21.470> positive<00:01:21.680> charge<00:01:22.130> things<00:01:22.340> and

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
are all positive charge things and

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.300 
are all positive charge things and
attached<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.229> negative<00:01:24.470> charge<00:01:24.710> gives

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
attached to this negative charge gives

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.580 
attached to this negative charge gives
the<00:01:25.490> negative<00:01:25.850> charge<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:29.350> negative<00:01:30.350> charge

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
the negative charge so negative charge

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.929 
the negative charge so negative charge
now<00:01:30.799> this<00:01:30.829> plate<00:01:31.220> is<00:01:31.340> attached<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.670> the

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
now this plate is attached to the

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.350 
now this plate is attached to the
positive<00:01:32.329> charge<00:01:33.579> give<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.700> positive<00:01:34.909> charge

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
positive charge give the positive charge

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.719 
positive charge give the positive charge
okay<00:01:35.840> fine

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
okay fine

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.899 
okay fine
now<00:01:37.899> it<00:01:38.899> becomes<00:01:39.200> easy<00:01:39.439> to<00:01:39.649> analyze<00:01:39.860> just<00:01:40.670> see

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
now it becomes easy to analyze just see

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.340 
now it becomes easy to analyze just see
this<00:01:41.750> is<00:01:41.930> one<00:01:42.170> capacitor<00:01:43.149> this<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.420> another

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
this is one capacitor this is another

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.850 
this is one capacitor this is another
capacitor<00:01:46.360> okay<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.290> equivalent

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
capacitor okay so the equivalent

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.590 
capacitor okay so the equivalent
resistance<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.640> sorry<00:01:50.149> equivalent

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
resistance a sorry equivalent

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.240 
resistance a sorry equivalent
capacitance<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.469> whole<00:01:51.710> thing<00:01:51.740> comes

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
capacitance of this whole thing comes

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.649 
capacitance of this whole thing comes
out<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.610> be<00:01:52.640> 2<00:01:53.450> epsilon<00:01:54.020> not<00:01:54.049> ay<00:01:54.380> by<00:01:54.710> B<00:01:55.659> means

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
out to be 2 epsilon not ay by B means

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.510 
out to be 2 epsilon not ay by B means
for<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:56.960> one<00:01:57.140> capacitance<00:01:57.649> is<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.950> capacitor

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
for the one capacitance is a capacitor

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.389 
for the one capacitance is a capacitor
is<00:01:58.700> always<00:01:59.119> epsilon<00:01:59.630> not<00:01:59.810> ay<00:01:59.960> by<00:02:00.140> D<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:01.009> here

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
is always epsilon not ay by D so here

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.789 
is always epsilon not ay by D so here
acts<00:02:01.909> like<00:02:02.119> two<00:02:02.299> capacitors<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:03.079> is<00:02:03.200> 2<00:02:03.380> epsilon

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
acts like two capacitors it is 2 epsilon

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:03.940 
acts like two capacitors it is 2 epsilon
not

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
not

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.870 
not
e<00:02:04.070> by<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.640> 2<00:02:04.909> epsilon<00:02:05.479> not<00:02:05.509> ay<00:02:05.810> by<00:02:06.020> D<00:02:06.609> because<00:02:07.609> you

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
e by a 2 epsilon not ay by D because you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.029 
e by a 2 epsilon not ay by D because you
all<00:02:08.060> know<00:02:08.270> one<00:02:08.600> capacitor<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.380> represented<00:02:10.009> by

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
all know one capacitor is represented by

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.460 
all know one capacitor is represented by
this<00:02:10.220> thing<00:02:10.840> plus<00:02:11.840> plus<00:02:12.380> plus<00:02:12.710> plus<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.470> minus
