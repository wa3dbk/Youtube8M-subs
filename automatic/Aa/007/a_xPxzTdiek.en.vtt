00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
orbs that I was talking about I think

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390

file as you can see the stamina does
drain<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.310> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.549> easy<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.939> tell<00:01:18.119> how

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
there it has a small little thing where

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.210 
there it has a small little thing where
it<00:01:29.939> moves<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.329> mini-map<00:01:30.780> over<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.590> open<00:01:32.130> up

it moves the mini-map over to open up

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
it moves the mini-map over to open up
your<00:01:32.340> main<00:01:32.520> map<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.210> pretty<00:01:33.600> much<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
your main map but that's pretty much it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.340 
your main map but that's pretty much it
now<00:01:34.799> let's<00:01:34.950> look<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> different<00:01:35.909> style<00:01:36.350> okay

good<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.560> jump<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.040> drains<00:01:47.369> that's

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
good so if you jump it drains that's

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.510 
good so if you jump it drains that's
good<00:01:48.259> it<00:01:49.259> also<00:01:49.409> has<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.829> Skyrim<00:01:50.250> style

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
good it also has the Skyrim style

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.569 
good it also has the Skyrim style
compass<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.630> something<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
compass and this is something that I

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.060 
compass and this is something that I
extremely<00:01:53.579> prefer<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.659> Oblivion's<00:01:55.439> compass

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
extremely prefer to Oblivion's compass

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.789 
extremely prefer to Oblivion's compass
I<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> minimalist<00:01:57.630> style<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.259> Skyrim's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
I like the minimalist style of Skyrim's

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
I like the minimalist style of Skyrim's
heads-up<00:01:59.189> display<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.329> kind<00:02:00.509> of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
heads-up display and this is kind of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
heads-up display and this is kind of
cool<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.079> able<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.920> oblivion

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
cool to be able to have that in oblivion

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.209 
cool to be able to have that in oblivion
especially<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> compass<00:02:04.049> which<00:02:04.290> works<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.740> lot

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
especially the compass which works a lot

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.810 
especially the compass which works a lot
better<00:02:05.520> in

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
better in

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.999 
better in
like<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.330> as<00:02:07.750> opposed<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.500> very<00:02:08.530> strange

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
like this as opposed to the very strange

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.070 
like this as opposed to the very strange
one<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.429> they<00:02:09.550> had<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.820> Oblivion<00:02:10.119> but

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
one that they had in Oblivion but

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.570 
one that they had in Oblivion but
remember<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.650> can<00:02:11.800> actually<00:02:11.950> configure

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
remember that you can actually configure

after that you select your compass and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.140 
after that you select your compass and
just<00:02:44.440> like<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> Skyrim<00:02:45.190> style<00:02:45.459> compass<00:02:45.910> and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
just like the Skyrim style compass and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.400 
just like the Skyrim style compass and
then<00:02:46.300> it's<00:02:46.450> gonna<00:02:46.540> ask<00:02:46.630> if<00:02:46.930> you'd<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.200> to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.470 
then it's gonna ask if you'd like to
extract<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.980> documentation<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.000> would

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
extract the documentation I would

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.000 
extract the documentation I would
recommend<00:02:49.900> hitting<00:02:50.020> yes<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.650> because

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
recommend hitting yes for this because

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.080 
recommend hitting yes for this because
the<00:02:51.130> documentation<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.820> going<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.000> be

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
the documentation is going to be

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.170 
the documentation is going to be
important<00:02:52.540> for<00:02:52.600> configuring<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.380> mod<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.790> if

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
important for configuring the mod so if

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.729 
important for configuring the mod so if
we<00:02:55.390> come<00:02:55.570> into<00:02:55.900> our<00:02:55.930> data<00:02:56.260> folder<00:02:56.590> for

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
we come into our data folder for

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.820 
we come into our data folder for
oblivion<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.269> go<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.450> Docs<00:02:58.750> there<00:02:59.590> is

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
oblivion and we go to Docs there is

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.949 
oblivion and we go to Docs there is
actually<00:03:00.130> gonna<00:03:00.220> be<00:03:00.310> some<00:03:00.760> guides<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.930> show

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
actually gonna be some guides to show

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.960 
actually gonna be some guides to show
you<00:03:02.170> how<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.440> customize<00:03:02.739> this<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:03.850> I'd

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
you how to customize this so I'd

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.280 
you how to customize this so I'd
recommend<00:03:04.120> reading<00:03:04.750> through<00:03:04.989> those<00:03:05.140> because

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
recommend reading through those because

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.680 
recommend reading through those because
I<00:03:05.500> am<00:03:05.590> NOT<00:03:05.860> going<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.190> go<00:03:06.310> very<00:03:06.459> in-depth<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.630> I

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
I am NOT going to go very in-depth but I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.180 
I am NOT going to go very in-depth but I
am<00:03:07.930> gonna<00:03:08.050> inform<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.650> these<00:03:08.920> are<00:03:08.980> the

am gonna inform you that these are the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.220 
am gonna inform you that these are the
two<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.640> ease<00:03:09.790> here<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.300> in<00:03:10.480> e<00:03:10.600> folder<00:03:11.019> if

two in ease here in the in e folder if

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.250 
two in ease here in the in e folder if
we<00:03:11.860> open<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.370> up<00:03:12.450> probably<00:03:13.450> using<00:03:14.019> something

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
we open this up probably using something

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.830 
we open this up probably using something
more<00:03:14.410> like<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:15.010> notepad<00:03:15.250> plus<00:03:16.000> plus<00:03:16.030> an

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
more like a notepad plus plus an

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.840 
more like a notepad plus plus an
optional<00:03:17.230> program<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.830> can<00:03:18.010> get<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.519> makes

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
optional program you can get that makes

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.080 
optional program you can get that makes
editing<00:03:19.150> these<00:03:19.510> files<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:20.049> bit<00:03:20.290> easier<00:03:20.820> then<00:03:21.820> we

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
editing these files a bit easier then we

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.880 
editing these files a bit easier then we
will<00:03:22.269> be<00:03:22.420> able<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.630> change<00:03:22.900> some<00:03:23.110> things<00:03:23.140> so

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
will be able to change some things so

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.090 
will be able to change some things so
for<00:03:24.459> example<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.570> space<00:03:25.900> one<00:03:26.170> here<00:03:26.500> we<00:03:26.769> can

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
for example in the space one here we can

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.699 
for example in the space one here we can
select<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:28.060> vertical<00:03:28.450> gap<00:03:28.840> between<00:03:29.079> each<00:03:29.320> HUD

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
select the vertical gap between each HUD

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.080 
select the vertical gap between each HUD
bar<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:32.579> exactly<00:03:33.579> what<00:03:33.820> it<00:03:33.910> sounds

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
bar so this is exactly what it sounds

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.880 
bar so this is exactly what it sounds
like<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.510> vertical<00:03:34.930> gap<00:03:35.110> between<00:03:35.290> HUD<00:03:35.650> bars

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
like the vertical gap between HUD bars

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.979 
like the vertical gap between HUD bars
you<00:03:36.820> can<00:03:36.940> also<00:03:37.060> change<00:03:37.329> other<00:03:37.570> things<00:03:37.810> like

would really recommend reading the
documentation<00:04:04.860> but<00:04:05.580> this<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.270> very<00:04:06.510> good<00:04:06.600> to

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
documentation but this is very good to

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.620 
documentation but this is very good to
know<00:04:06.960> for<00:04:07.140> example<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.710> can<00:04:07.890> change<00:04:08.130> the

fatigue bar to whatever you want and

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.890

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
there so you don't have to have it as
