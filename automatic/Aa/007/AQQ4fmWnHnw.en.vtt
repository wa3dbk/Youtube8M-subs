00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:10.120
 Cormorant let alone everyone started p main it is a beautiful stone 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:15.280
 I do not know the right or left in the video first post, but thank you in advance 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:20.270
 Well good over over gave the main after Masu I think I'll have to slowly this time play-by-play 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:24.530
 It is possible to do it, but it's really a slow dream 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:28.280
 Reimu immediately, but I'm thinking about getting it live ok 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:33.120
 By the way, what 's the real craft of minecraft 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:38.120
 So I will leave the conditions and constraints 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 Oh, so thank you. 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.829
 For now Marisa prevention 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:56.530
 So whether so'm Wakenan that I it's very 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:01:00.010
 After all Marisa is so good, but when I was troubled, I do n't care much about it 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.280
 Well I can help you without saying that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.380
 What do you do after all about the conditions and restraints? 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 I have introduced the industrial mod and the batch destruction mod 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:19.170
 Well, if you can't do it with vanilla, you can start industrial 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.650
 I'm not thinking about tying it in particular I won't be industrial until I defeat the Ender Dragon 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.690
 Well I 'm pretty good loose but after 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.170
 The difficulty Soka Well then soon properly'm the basic hard fixed or trying to play-by-play 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.170
 That 's right 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.320
 After all, first, what are you doing Yea everyone first in addition to turning off the do's Do eh wood cut wood is roughly 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.299
 I Naa'm doing 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.299
 First of all you will make a tree tool 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.609
 Reimu Something is not so bad I guess 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.689
 It will be difficult if you don't set up a temporary base as soon as possible 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:59.929
 If the stupid is to say eh? Marisa what not it delicious that 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:02.580
 If it is not in time for making a temporary base, preparation is done and it is pushed around and dead and respawn 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.850
 It is attacked by zombies and is ideal even if it tries to return 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.520
 It will be a semi-infinite loop over the night 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:16.200
 In the process, the creeper opponent is exploded and a hole is made in the land 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:21.810
 It is visible that it will be possible to repair the hole even after the sun rises 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.740
 Really because it is understood that Marisa still does not create a temporary base 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 I hope you understood 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.880
 There's no cave there right away 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.230
 Survive because their branch mining not very fond 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.430
 Smell trouble do not you feel you are wondering why there is I hate you explore 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.430
 I do not even do not know Well 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.180
 I keep cutting the tree for a while from here, so I cut it 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.180
 U 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.409
 Hey there's a cave on the left 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.409
 a much 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.180
 Yeah 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.390
 For example I just want to take the No little stone you are going to enter Why 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.390
 I wish I had taken in a different Toko 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.840
 Is it enough with only three 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:23.530
 I wonder why you've been freaked out or something Bibibi 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.970
 I wonder if it was a bit freaking, so what do you say 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.970
 I said there was no bibi 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:37.790
 I think it's going to be super fun, but I think it will be quite delicious in terms of animation 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.180
 Yabe tension max but I'm back-I can go home 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.480
 I think not bad Let's Arise based in Neenee Acre 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.260
 It's a going to be a base in only make a little if that form wall 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.930
 Son is good and after lie do such mon industrial bugs anxious 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.769
 Why consciousness 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.430
 If you make a wall at that place, it's not a vessel but it's a stop. 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.430
 But it is 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.430
 Still 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.670
 7 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.990
 Let's go early- I can't wait for a little kid or kid 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.990
 I did not want to be told only to Reimu 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:25.340
 Why do you make stone tools 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.960
 This time I am not cautious about Reimukai or as usual I would like to make stone tools as soon as possible 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.370
 I from 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:36.470
 Naa I 'm not going to make it or not fight now 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.990
 It will be in Tsu not when probably an emergency and to postpone the make doing so need good only after 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.800
 I'm okay okay 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.470
 It will be somehow 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.030
 I also set this extra flag 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.030
 boo 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.030
 Hmm 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.670
 goo 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:59.200
 I knew it was good or bad 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:02.270
 First of all, if you don't fix the perfume bug, you have to figure out the terrain 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.770
 Well what kind of terrain is it? 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.120
 You can make coal with Matsuaki 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:14.320
 This is fine at night too 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.320
 Settan Uma or a Lima something that looked pretty cavity of do's Do So 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.130
 Chopsticks What a of these guys 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.130

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.110
 God still voice that 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.699
 Run away Run away Run away Run away Run away Run away 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.520
 What kind of fish I am really serious and why is it so hot from the daytime to move 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.349
 Tenno 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:45.169
 I will leave once 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:45.169
