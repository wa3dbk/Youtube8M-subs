breathing<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:41.959> on<00:01:42.959> the<00:01:43.380> power<00:01:43.590> fades<00:01:44.599> it<00:01:45.599> all

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
breathing out on the power fades it all

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.819 
breathing out on the power fades it all
the<00:01:45.959> way<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.319> out<00:01:47.929> in<00:01:48.929> out<00:01:50.419> and<00:01:51.529> in<00:01:52.529> this

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the way down out in out and in this

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.550 
the way down out in out and in this
regulates<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.060> speed<00:01:54.749> of<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.929> movement<00:01:55.139> as

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
regulates the speed of the movement as

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.599 
regulates the speed of the movement as
well<00:01:56.389> it's<00:01:57.740> getting<00:01:59.240> oxygen<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.109> body

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
well it's getting oxygen into the body

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.839 
well it's getting oxygen into the body
so<00:02:02.609> a<00:02:02.639> super<00:02:03.090> set<00:02:03.299> comprises<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> two

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
so a super set comprises of two

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.270 
so a super set comprises of two
different<00:02:05.849> exercises<00:02:06.679> can<00:02:07.679> be<00:02:07.739> the<00:02:08.039> same

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
different exercises can be the same

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.240 
different exercises can be the same
muscle<00:02:08.640> group<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:10.080> opposing<00:02:10.979> muscle

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
muscle group can do opposing muscle

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.480 
muscle group can do opposing muscle
groups<00:02:11.780> what<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.200> now<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.710> doing

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
groups what going to now is doing

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.120 
groups what going to now is doing
different<00:02:14.970> set<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.480> exercises<00:02:15.860> then<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.100> I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
different set of exercises then what I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.210 
different set of exercises then what I
would<00:02:17.400> do

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
would do

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.840 
would do
do<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.610> set<00:02:18.940> called<00:02:19.270> three<00:02:20.080> times<00:02:20.850> then

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
do that set called three times then

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.480 
do that set called three times then
change<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.230> next<00:02:23.560> sense<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.040> exercise

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
change it to the next sense of exercise

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.720 
change it to the next sense of exercise
so<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:24.850> time<00:02:25.440> exactly<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.500> same<00:02:26.680> kit<00:02:26.980> but

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
so this time exactly the same kit but

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.670 
so this time exactly the same kit but

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
forearms of mash I've done the double

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.060 
forearms of mash I've done the double
superset<00:05:30.780> i'll<00:05:31.470> do<00:05:31.680> another<00:05:32.690> bicep<00:05:33.690> curl

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
superset i'll do another bicep curl

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.160 
superset i'll do another bicep curl
followed<00:05:35.070> by<00:05:35.250> dog<00:05:36.240> lover<00:05:36.480> twisting<00:05:36.930> curls

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
followed by dog lover twisting curls

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.280 
followed by dog lover twisting curls
I've<00:05:37.920> done<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.160> whiner<00:05:38.930> bicep<00:05:39.930> curl<00:05:40.140> so

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
I've done a whiner bicep curl so

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.320 
I've done a whiner bicep curl so
definite<00:05:40.710> it's<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.250> diff<00:05:41.460> pop<00:05:41.730> of<00:05:41.880> muscle<00:05:42.180> and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
definite it's a diff pop of muscle and

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.270 
definite it's a diff pop of muscle and
then<00:05:42.810> I'm<00:05:42.900> gonna<00:05:43.020> have<00:05:43.260> a<00:05:43.290> chaos<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:43.919> then<00:05:44.250> I

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
then I'm gonna have a chaos and then I

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.810 
then I'm gonna have a chaos and then I
finished<00:05:44.640> it<00:05:44.730> off<00:05:44.940> with<00:05:45.410> forearm<00:05:46.410> kills<00:05:46.820> the
