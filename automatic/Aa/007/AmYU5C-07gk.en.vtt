00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:04.740
 whoever we are today I still make a video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.320
 special 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.379
 so it's also signed waters on rock is called so 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.559
 it is true that it was at the time 2007 so it is for missed centers 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.779
 as for the order of the phoenix 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.730
 so I think the collective ideals like that so 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.739
 an example 6 when I will have because I already have on exercise with surrounded 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.019
 bins 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.029
 here is a video on his keys his two princesses forgotten the merit 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.339
 amply 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.100
 e otherwise to color the tournament the three wizards the word attacked and the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.450
 falling prices 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.390
 for the cup of fire all that 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.580
 so here I already have all the comics that are needed for sand so 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.180
 it is also its release in 2007 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.160
 so I look at a low price 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.969
 without any goal 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.260
 of no 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.780
 that is here 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.820
 large chopsticks 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.200
 that of 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.580
 the dam 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.840
 place a small comic 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.340
 and that of ubs 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 bellatrix leaves him alone 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.650
 so here's 3 of the rod a little storm and you want to compare we're going 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.750
 put aside 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.810
 and I eat first in the eure 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.010
 other details 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.120
 so that is basic 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
 bigger and smaller 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 you suspect that the largest section 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.990
 that's a little further 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.580
 then it's bellatrix which is quite normal boxster say 35 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.890
 centimeters and some 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.970
 and we brew that is very small 27 cents 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.280
 so here you go 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.470
 if we compare the colors then but the creek it can not lie the three 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.120
 same colors that I will find stib and m 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.320
 yesterday it's really mixed 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.710
 it's bacon or black light brown leather all that is very pretty 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.130
 grip 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.860
 the 'yes' or else there is bellatrix prey she like that to wat like that 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.180
 the normal for me I take it like that after a report unhealthy little 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.570
 close like that 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.860
 here it is 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.880
 so 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.309
 grip 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.429
 then for fights rage 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.389
 you do not work in hand he must put himself really well in there 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.449
 freezes 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.719
 extraordinary manga 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.719
 lp for sanction 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.349
 here are two options for the colors of which to prepare psion is in works 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.899
 because the burst but a little at the level of color even if it's not 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.729
 of paris plan 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.509
 you see well done 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.509
 the world alas the red bordeaux 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.569
 alas balla bèye and red bordeaux tecteo and he says he is black like that 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.289
 dassault it is rather because of these small and medium for interviews 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.659
 therefore the same color 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.789
 if they also have a lot more brown 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.809
 and we're going to get + red so when we talk about size because that's when 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.809
 even large chopsticks 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:03.619
 the docu for these two teams 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.889
 so the proof for me to get my thing was in 2007 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:09.719
 already enough 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.719
 politics the heroes this 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.189
 here it is 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.469
 so on bellatrix 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.369

 slender and writes there mean than on the drop of baguette site prices at the same 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.929
 place but that's it 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.039
 to vote during my preferences 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.069
