what I've got here you may not have seen
before<00:00:11.850> is<00:00:12.420> my<00:00:12.930> long<00:00:13.320> ez<00:00:13.850> IRF<00:00:15.110> unlike<00:00:16.110> all<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
before is my long ez IRF unlike all the

before is my long ez IRF unlike all the
other<00:00:16.830> long<00:00:17.040> ez<00:00:17.250> IRF<00:00:17.700> so<00:00:17.820> I've<00:00:17.910> seen<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.210> one

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
other long ez IRF so I've seen this one

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.060 
other long ez IRF so I've seen this one
is<00:00:18.660> powered<00:00:18.960> by<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.349> pulse<00:00:19.680> jet

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
back for this one this is an 8 pound

back for this one this is an 8 pound
thrust<00:00:24.240> pulse<00:00:24.539> jet<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.869> I've<00:00:24.990> built<00:00:25.170> and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
thrust pulse jet that I've built and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.180 
thrust pulse jet that I've built and
thoroughly<00:00:26.970> tested<00:00:27.480> runs<00:00:27.660> very<00:00:27.810> nicely<00:00:28.190> it

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
thoroughly tested runs very nicely it

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.410 
thoroughly tested runs very nicely it
should<00:00:29.369> push<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.699> thing<00:00:29.880> along<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.300> an

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
should push this thing along at an

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
should push this thing along at an
extremely<00:00:30.869> good<00:00:31.470> rate<00:00:31.680> of<00:00:31.710> speed<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.309> haven't

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
extremely good rate of speed I haven't

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.920 
extremely good rate of speed I haven't
flown<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.790> yet<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.540> weather<00:00:33.750> here

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
flown it yet because the weather here

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.420 
flown it yet because the weather here
has<00:00:33.960> been<00:00:34.140> absolutely<00:00:34.500> awful<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.250> last

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
has been absolutely awful for the last

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.920 
has been absolutely awful for the last
two<00:00:35.640> weeks<00:00:35.879> and<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.180> dying<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.809> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
two weeks and I'm dying to get this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
two weeks and I'm dying to get this
thing<00:00:37.080> into<00:00:37.199> the<00:00:37.260> air<00:00:37.470> but<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:38.160> yet<00:00:38.340> hopefully

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
thing into the air but not yet hopefully

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.700 
thing into the air but not yet hopefully
in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.449> next<00:00:39.540> few<00:00:39.870> days<00:00:40.019> the<00:00:40.379> weather<00:00:40.530> will

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
in the next few days the weather will

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.170 
in the next few days the weather will
clear<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:41.370> worst

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
clear at worst

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.939 
clear at worst
there's<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.720> model<00:00:43.019> jet<00:00:43.170> meeting<00:00:43.470> here<00:00:43.650> next

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
there's a model jet meeting here next

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.160 
there's a model jet meeting here next
weekend<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.820> I'll<00:00:45.180> probably<00:00:45.540> throw<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.080> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
weekend so I'll probably throw it in the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.649 
weekend so I'll probably throw it in the
air<00:00:46.199> in<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:47.040> any<00:00:47.519> way<00:00:47.729> because<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.420> has<00:00:48.540> to

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
air in just any way because it has to

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.840 
air in just any way because it has to
fly<00:00:48.839> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> bit<00:00:49.860> impatient<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.760> as

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
fly and I get a bit impatient but as

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.100 
fly and I get a bit impatient but as
you've<00:00:50.940> seen<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.269> you<00:00:51.330> watch<00:00:51.479> my<00:00:51.629> other<00:00:51.690> videos

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you've seen if you watch my other videos

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.350 
you've seen if you watch my other videos
I<00:00:52.379> don't<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.100> things<00:00:53.250> by<00:00:53.610> half-measures<00:00:54.180> I'm<00:00:54.330> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
I don't do things by half-measures I'm a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.759 
I don't do things by half-measures I'm a
bit<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.659> an<00:00:54.750> all-out<00:00:54.870> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> person

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
bit of an all-out kind of a person

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.950 
bit of an all-out kind of a person
so<00:00:56.159> the<00:00:56.940> first<00:00:57.150> flight<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.690> very

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so the first flight will be very

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.649 
so the first flight will be very
interesting<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:58.920> say<00:00:59.159> the<00:00:59.190> least<00:00:59.540> for<00:01:00.540> those

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
interesting to say the least for those

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.030 
interesting to say the least for those
that<00:01:00.900> are<00:01:00.989> wondering<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.710> thing's

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
that are wondering how this thing's

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.680 
that are wondering how this thing's
built<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.460> what's<00:01:02.640> gone<00:01:02.909> into<00:01:03.119> it<00:01:03.239> I'll<00:01:03.540> give

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
built and what's gone into it I'll give

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600 
built and what's gone into it I'll give
you<00:01:03.720> a<00:01:03.809> quick<00:01:03.989> rundown<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.890> pulse<00:01:05.129> jet<00:01:05.309> engine

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you a quick rundown the pulse jet engine

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.070 
you a quick rundown the pulse jet engine
which<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.030> haven't<00:01:06.180> bolted<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> can

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
which I haven't bolted on here so I can

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.130 
which I haven't bolted on here so I can
take<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.530> show<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.460> there

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
take it off and show you that's it there

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.480 
take it off and show you that's it there
this<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.560> an<00:01:10.680> engine<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.010> typically<00:01:11.340> would

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
this is an engine that typically would

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.219 
this is an engine that typically would
cost<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.759> about<00:01:11.820> $300<00:01:12.570> u.s.<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> wanted

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
cost you about $300 u.s. if you wanted

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.990 
cost you about $300 u.s. if you wanted
to<00:01:13.320> buy<00:01:13.469> one<00:01:13.649> produces<00:01:14.340> 8<00:01:14.490> pounds<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> thrust

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to buy one produces 8 pounds of thrust

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.810 
to buy one produces 8 pounds of thrust
and<00:01:15.450> consumes<00:01:16.350> an<00:01:16.500> enormous<00:01:17.100> amount<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.520> fuel

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and consumes an enormous amount of fuel

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
and consumes an enormous amount of fuel
but<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.149> very<00:01:18.329> simple<00:01:19.070> surprisingly

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
but it's very simple surprisingly

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.690 
but it's very simple surprisingly
reliable<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.219> cheaper<00:01:23.399> than<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
reliable and it's a lot cheaper than a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880 
reliable and it's a lot cheaper than a
turbine<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.750> wanted<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> buy<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.679> small

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
turbine if you wanted to buy the small

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
turbine if you wanted to buy the small
turbines<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.000> average<00:01:27.179> small<00:01:27.630> turbine

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
turbines or the average small turbine

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.099 
turbines or the average small turbine
that<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> buy<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:29.159> least<00:01:29.539> $1,000<00:01:30.539> us<00:01:30.810> next

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
that you buy is at least $1,000 us next

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.270 
that you buy is at least $1,000 us next
for<00:01:31.289> a<00:01:31.320> cheap<00:01:31.500> Chinese<00:01:31.530> might<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.130> want<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
for a cheap Chinese might you want a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.599 
for a cheap Chinese might you want a
good<00:01:32.399> one

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
good one

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.510 
good one
you're<00:01:33.000> looking<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.299> closer<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.659> $2,000<00:01:34.649> 300

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you're looking at closer to $2,000 300

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.950 
you're looking at closer to $2,000 300
bucks<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.359> lot<00:01:36.570> cheaper

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
bucks it's a lot cheaper

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
bucks it's a lot cheaper
hopefully<00:01:37.710> it'll<00:01:37.829> enable<00:01:38.070> more<00:01:38.310> people<00:01:38.369> to

there<00:01:54.539> was<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> turtle<00:01:54.929> deck<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
there was a turtle deck back here and a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
there was a turtle deck back here and a
lovely<00:01:55.979> bubble<00:01:56.399> canopy<00:01:56.700> well<00:01:56.999> they<00:01:57.149> had<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.390> go

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
lovely bubble canopy well they had to go

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.819 
lovely bubble canopy well they had to go
because<00:01:57.929> that's<00:01:58.079> where<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.380> engine<00:01:58.619> sitting

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
because that's where the engine sitting

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.520 
because that's where the engine sitting
I<00:01:59.069> made<00:01:59.819> up<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.060> aluminium<00:02:00.990> heat<00:02:01.170> shield

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I made up this aluminium heat shield

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.469 
I made up this aluminium heat shield
which<00:02:02.069> basically<00:02:02.429> sits<00:02:02.819> across<00:02:03.090> where<00:02:03.359> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
which basically sits across where the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.940 
which basically sits across where the
turtle<00:02:03.749> deck<00:02:03.869> was<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.409> pretty<00:02:04.590> important<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
turtle deck was it's pretty important to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.709 
turtle deck was it's pretty important to
have<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> heat<00:02:05.460> shield<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:05.999> these<00:02:06.149> post

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
have a heat shield because these post

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960 
have a heat shield because these post
divisions<00:02:07.109> run<00:02:07.289> real<00:02:07.619> hot<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:08.850> them

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
divisions run real hot and you see them

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.370 
divisions run real hot and you see them
going<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.390> they're<00:02:09.539> sitting<00:02:09.690> static<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.200> run

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
going if they're sitting static they run

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.200 
going if they're sitting static they run
so<00:02:10.619> hot<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.039> they'd<00:02:11.460> basically<00:02:11.670> destroy

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
so hot that they'd basically destroy

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.520 
so hot that they'd basically destroy
themselves<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.870> relatively<00:02:13.260> short<00:02:13.440> space

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
griping about it is that they have a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.610 
griping about it is that they have a
really<00:02:53.940> odd<00:02:54.270> flying<00:02:54.780> characteristics<00:02:55.350> you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
really odd flying characteristics you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.110 
really odd flying characteristics you
see<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> lot<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:55.980> videos<00:02:56.130> where<00:02:56.490> they're<00:02:57.000> flying

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
see a lot of videos where they're flying

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.660

along runway pull on up elevator they

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.979 
along runway pull on up elevator they
leap<00:02:59.820> up<00:02:59.970> into<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.270> air<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.510> then<00:03:00.660> basically

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
leap up into the air and then basically

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.260 
leap up into the air and then basically
fall<00:03:01.230> out<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> sky<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.940> reason<00:03:03.239> for

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
fall out the sky I think the reason for

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.400 
fall out the sky I think the reason for
that<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.810> when<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.020> looked<00:03:04.200> at<00:03:04.320> this

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
that is that when I looked at this

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.949 
that is that when I looked at this

obviously<00:03:07.410> didn't<00:03:07.680> know<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.770> lot<00:03:07.920> about

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
obviously didn't know a lot about

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.760 
obviously didn't know a lot about
aerodynamics<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:09.510> full<00:03:10.050> plane<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.470> actually

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
aerodynamics this full plane is actually

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.290 
aerodynamics this full plane is actually
at<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.890> negative<00:03:11.340> angle<00:03:11.489> compared<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.150> main

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
at a negative angle compared to the main

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.390 
at a negative angle compared to the main
wing<00:03:12.480> which<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.840> stupid<00:03:13.050> because<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:14.220> way<00:03:14.370> a

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
wing which is stupid because the way a

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.610 
wing which is stupid because the way a
canard<00:03:14.910> gets<00:03:15.030> its<00:03:15.480> stability<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:16.230> by<00:03:16.470> having

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
canard gets its stability is by having

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.860 
canard gets its stability is by having
the<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:17.670> fall<00:03:17.940> plane<00:03:18.150> at<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.390> higher<00:03:18.660> angle

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the the fall plane at a higher angle

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.440 
the the fall plane at a higher angle
than<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.770> main<00:03:20.070> wing<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.940> idea<00:03:21.150> behind<00:03:21.270> that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
than the main wing the idea behind that

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.800 
than the main wing the idea behind that
is<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.690> as<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.650> aircraft<00:03:22.800> rotates<00:03:23.430> upwards

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
is that as the aircraft rotates upwards

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.750 
is that as the aircraft rotates upwards
this<00:03:24.810> fall<00:03:25.320> plane<00:03:25.560> will<00:03:25.739> stall<00:03:25.769> first<00:03:26.370> and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
this fall plane will stall first and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.699 
this fall plane will stall first and
therefore<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.810> nose<00:03:27.959> will<00:03:28.170> descend<00:03:28.470> against

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
therefore the nose will descend against

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.960 
therefore the nose will descend against
it<00:03:28.799> makes<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.040> stable<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.519> can't<00:03:29.700> actually

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
it makes it stable you can't actually

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.910 
it makes it stable you can't actually
stall<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.450> it'll<00:03:30.870> simply<00:03:31.110> go<00:03:31.260> into<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.680> mush

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
stall it it'll simply go into a mush

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.949 
stall it it'll simply go into a mush
where<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.489> four<00:03:32.700> plane<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
where the four plane is just on the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.380 
where the four plane is just on the
stall<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.440> it'll<00:03:34.709> fly<00:03:35.040> slower<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.640> descend

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
stall and it'll fly slower and descend

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.960 
stall and it'll fly slower and descend
now<00:03:36.870> by<00:03:37.860> putting<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.340> four<00:03:38.549> plane<00:03:38.760> at<00:03:38.940> a

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
now by putting the four plane at a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.789 
now by putting the four plane at a
negative<00:03:39.450> angle<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:40.290> can<00:03:40.440> get<00:03:40.590> something

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
negative angle you can get something

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.199 
negative angle you can get something
called<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.100> deep<00:03:41.310> stall<00:03:41.640> that's<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:41.910> very<00:03:42.060> bad

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
called a deep stall that's a very bad

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.240 
called a deep stall that's a very bad
thing<00:03:42.239> what<00:03:42.900> happens<00:03:43.140> is<00:03:43.260> when<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> nose

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
thing what happens is when the nose

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.789 
thing what happens is when the nose
comes<00:03:44.519> up<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.239> real<00:03:45.510> wing<00:03:45.750> stalls<00:03:46.049> first<00:03:46.410> and

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
comes up the real wing stalls first and

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.979 
comes up the real wing stalls first and
when<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.310> happens<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:48.390> plane<00:03:48.600> just<00:03:48.780> does

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
when that happens the plane just does

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.390 
when that happens the plane just does
that<00:03:49.170> because<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> front<00:03:49.950> wing<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.220> still

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
that because the front wing is still

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.490 
that because the front wing is still
lifting<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.970> effect<00:03:51.480> it'll<00:03:51.900> pop<00:03:52.110> up<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.380> its

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
lifting in effect it'll pop up on its

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.340 
lifting in effect it'll pop up on its
tail<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:52.980> then<00:03:53.850> fall<00:03:54.030> out<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.330> sky<00:03:54.540> now<00:03:54.780> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
tail and then fall out of the sky now a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.660 
tail and then fall out of the sky now a
lot<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> videos<00:03:55.950> I've<00:03:56.130> seen<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.370> lot<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.549> the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
lot of the videos I've seen a lot of the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.190 
lot of the videos I've seen a lot of the
first-hand<00:03:57.299> reports<00:03:57.690> I've<00:03:57.780> heard<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.019> these

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
first-hand reports I've heard of these

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.660 
first-hand reports I've heard of these
things<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.650> that's<00:03:58.860> exactly<00:03:59.310> what<00:03:59.459> they<00:03:59.610> do

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
things is that's exactly what they do

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.880 
things is that's exactly what they do
people<00:04:00.540> find<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.140> takeoff<00:04:01.470> they<00:04:01.680> just

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
people find it on takeoff they just

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.830 
people find it on takeoff they just
crash<00:04:02.190> or<00:04:02.430> they're<00:04:02.850> coming<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.299> land<00:04:03.450> and

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
crash or they're coming in to land and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.840 
crash or they're coming in to land and
pets<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.739> nose<00:04:04.920> they<00:04:05.100> touched<00:04:05.340> first<00:04:05.640> it

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
pets the nose they touched first it

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.430 
pets the nose they touched first it
bounces<00:04:06.180> up<00:04:06.299> in<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.480> air<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:07.049> real<00:04:07.260> wing

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
bounces up in the air the real wing

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.530 
bounces up in the air the real wing
stalls<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.950> falls<00:04:08.130> out<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.430> sky<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:08.880> as

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
stalls and it falls out of the sky so as

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.660 
stalls and it falls out of the sky so as
they<00:04:09.930> come<00:04:10.110> out<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.380> box<00:04:10.560> they<00:04:10.739> do<00:04:10.799> fly<00:04:11.070> but

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
they come out of the box they do fly but

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.009 
they come out of the box they do fly but
they're<00:04:11.790> actually<00:04:11.940> rigged<00:04:12.330> to<00:04:12.480> fly<00:04:12.690> more<00:04:12.870> like

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
they're actually rigged to fly more like

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.570 
they're actually rigged to fly more like
a<00:04:13.049> flying<00:04:13.320> wing<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:13.830> just<00:04:14.100> basically<00:04:14.280> comes

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
a flying wing this just basically comes

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.890 
a flying wing this just basically comes
along<00:04:14.760> for<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.970> ride<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.330> abroad<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.720> bit<00:04:15.810> of

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
along for the ride and abroad a bit of

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.409 
along for the ride and abroad a bit of
pitch<00:04:16.410> control<00:04:16.799> service<00:04:17.669> I've<00:04:17.820> altered<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.269> so

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
pitch control service I've altered it so

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.819 
pitch control service I've altered it so
it's<00:04:18.570> now<00:04:18.690> like<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.900> standard<00:04:19.320> canard

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
it's now like a standard canard

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.860 
it's now like a standard canard
and<00:04:19.979> therefore<00:04:20.519> hopefully<00:04:20.729> it'll<00:04:21.510> be<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> lot

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
and therefore hopefully it'll be a lot

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.840 
and therefore hopefully it'll be a lot
more<00:04:22.019> stable<00:04:22.410> in<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.560> air<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.340> guess<00:04:23.669> we

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
more stable in the air but I guess we

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.510 
more stable in the air but I guess we
won't<00:04:24.030> know<00:04:24.150> until<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.419> try<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:26.280> winds

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
won't know until I try it the winds

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.040 
won't know until I try it the winds
blowing<00:04:26.669> a<00:04:26.790> gale<00:04:26.910> outside<00:04:27.390> has<00:04:27.660> been<00:04:27.870> for<00:04:28.020> a

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
blowing a gale outside has been for a

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.540 
blowing a gale outside has been for a
couple<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.350> weeks<00:04:28.470> as<00:04:28.950> soon<00:04:29.099> as<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.310> stops

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
couple of weeks as soon as it stops

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.610 
couple of weeks as soon as it stops
blowing<00:04:29.910> I'll<00:04:30.090> get<00:04:30.510> into<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.710> if<00:04:32.010> you're

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
blowing I'll get into it so if you're

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.990 
blowing I'll get into it so if you're
