 Hello dear masters with you 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.049
 Olga Ivanova 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.589
 Today I will show how to make gum with 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.589
 roses 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.290
 so we will need lace width 4 cm 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.360
 and 30 cm long 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.540
 sew on the machine the edges of our segment and 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.330
 Vai in collecting at the bottom of take more 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.740
 circle of felt with a diameter of 4 centimeters and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.210
 glue it our laces 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.930
 on top of the lace we glue 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.930
 roses 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.239
 to see how to make twisted 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.930
 rose click on the link and go to 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.930
 master class 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.739
 to glue the roses use hot 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.739
 glue 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.090
 Next, take a satin ribbon with a width of two 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.050
 half a centimeter and cut lucky 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.150
 in half 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.610
 if you have a satin ribbon width 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.180
 12 millimeters it will be perfect 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.690
 option 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 after cutting our ribbon 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.000
 updateable edge 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.690
 now we form a loop from our ribbon 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.120
 and I connect her upper corners 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.730
 I cut and update our sheet 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.650
 notice that beautiful 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.490
 the edge of the tape must not be melted 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.490
 be on top 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.240
 and how we need three leaves 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.240
 which we glue between the roses 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.729
 Next, take a garland of beads and cut 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.549
 into pieces add up to 8 centimeters 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.549
 in half and glue between the roses 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.580
 glue and fasten 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.580
 a piece of felt 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.130
