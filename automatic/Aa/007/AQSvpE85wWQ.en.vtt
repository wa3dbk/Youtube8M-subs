work<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.269> Mac<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.900> would<00:02:48.019> work<00:02:48.230> on<00:02:48.440> Windows<00:02:49.129> it

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
work on Mac it would work on Windows it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.949 
work on Mac it would work on Windows it
would<00:02:49.400> work<00:02:49.579> on<00:02:49.760> Android<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.420> would<00:02:50.540> work<00:02:50.720> on

iOS Linux and obviously Chrome OS this

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.300 
iOS Linux and obviously Chrome OS this
is<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.290> really<00:02:54.560> interesting<00:02:54.769> thing<00:02:55.010> because

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
is a really interesting thing because

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.670 
is a really interesting thing because
apple's<00:02:55.879> apps<00:02:56.090> are<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.629> regulated<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.409> so

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
apple's apps are so regulated and so

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.399 
apple's apps are so regulated and so
hyper<00:02:57.980> controlled<00:02:58.519> by<00:02:58.760> apple<00:02:59.659> and<00:02:59.810> Cupertino

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
that having such a big and you know

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.629 
that having such a big and you know
well-respected<00:03:03.109> company<00:03:04.069> like<00:03:04.250> Google

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
well-respected company like Google

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.550 
well-respected company like Google
serving<00:03:05.120> up<00:03:05.239> web<00:03:05.450> applications<00:03:06.139> in<00:03:06.379> this

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
serving up web applications in this

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.710 
serving up web applications in this
format<00:03:07.010> would<00:03:07.639> offer<00:03:07.819> probably<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.389> lot<00:03:08.599> of

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
format would offer probably a lot of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.270
