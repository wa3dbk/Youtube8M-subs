this again is while today's video is it
has<00:00:13.710> nothing<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.150> opener<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.929> so

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
has nothing to do with the opener and so

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.800 
has nothing to do with the opener and so
I<00:00:16.680> figured<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.369> gonna<00:00:17.460> throw<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> repeat

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I figured I was gonna throw a repeat

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.679 
I figured I was gonna throw a repeat
opener<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.490> that<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.699> wouldn't<00:00:20.970> use<00:00:21.390> one<00:00:21.660> of

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
opener in that way I wouldn't use one of

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.710 
opener in that way I wouldn't use one of
my<00:00:21.840> other<00:00:21.960> videos<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> show

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720

my other videos that I do have to show
of<00:00:24.720> course<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.080> could<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.320> knocked<00:00:25.769> off<00:00:26.010> two

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
of course I could have knocked off two

of course I could have knocked off two
birds<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:26.789> stone<00:00:26.820> or<00:00:27.330> kill<00:00:27.480> two<00:00:27.660> birds

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
here with a little bit different spring

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.750 
here with a little bit different spring
setup<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:48.110> well<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.890> rest<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.190> my<00:00:50.250> shaft<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
setup going well the rest of my shaft is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
openers like when I get to them the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
openers like when I get to them the
touch-and-go<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
touch-and-go that I'm not going to be

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
touch-and-go that I'm not going to be
able<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> fit<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.560> torsion

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
able to fit in here with this torsion

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.780 
able to fit in here with this torsion
bar<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.869> i<00:01:10.340> well<00:01:11.340> i<00:01:11.369> redid

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
bar the way it was and so i well i redid

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.270 
bar the way it was and so i well i redid
my<00:01:11.850> springs<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> i<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:14.010> extra

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
my springs and i put a little extra

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.070 
my springs and i put a little extra
bearing<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> other<00:01:15.479> side<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> spring

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
bearing on the other side of the spring

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.039 
bearing on the other side of the spring
and<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:17.250> pushed<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> springs<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.659> far<00:01:18.869> as

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and I pushed the springs over as far as

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.190 
and I pushed the springs over as far as
they<00:01:19.200> could<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.939> now<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.020> two

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
they could go and so now we have the two

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
they could go and so now we have the two
separate<00:01:22.619> Springs<00:01:23.150> one<00:01:24.150> her<00:01:24.479> drum<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.220> well

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
separate Springs one her drum and well

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.830 
separate Springs one her drum and well
there's<00:01:26.520> no<00:01:26.670> torsion<00:01:27.150> bar<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> center

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
there's no torsion bar in the center

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.380 
there's no torsion bar in the center
here<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.950> gives<00:01:29.189> me<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> room<00:01:30.299> in

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
well there we are again with spring set

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.750 
well there we are again with spring set
spring<00:04:48.449> setup<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:49.410> know<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.650> only<00:04:49.800> thing<00:04:49.889> now

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
spring setup you know the only thing now

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.400 
spring setup you know the only thing now
there's<00:04:51.090> no<00:04:51.389> way<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> could<00:04:51.750> put<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.870> GX<00:04:52.199> trap

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
there's no way I could put a GX trap

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.909 
there's no way I could put a GX trap
down<00:04:52.620> here<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.520> door<00:04:53.699> would<00:04:54.000> not<00:04:54.150> run<00:04:54.330> with<00:04:54.510> it

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
down here the door would not run with it

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.020 
down here the door would not run with it
you<00:04:55.919> know<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.280> if<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.460> run<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.699> down<00:04:56.790> and

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
you know and if you run it down and

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.850 
you know and if you run it down and
something<00:04:57.180> on<00:04:57.300> one<00:04:57.479> side<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:57.930> probably<00:04:58.680> will

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
something on one side it probably will

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.250 
something on one side it probably will
 the<00:05:00.240> nice<00:05:00.389> thing<00:05:00.660> though<00:05:00.810> is<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.080> always

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
 the nice thing though is I always

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.930 
 the nice thing though is I always
had<00:05:01.410> this<00:05:01.590> cable<00:05:01.949> over<00:05:02.070> here<00:05:02.310> would<00:05:02.490> go<00:05:02.639> slack

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
had this cable over here would go slack

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.030 
had this cable over here would go slack
a<00:05:02.970> little<00:05:03.180> bit<00:05:03.419> up<00:05:03.750> in<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:03.990> head<00:05:04.139> now<00:05:04.889> it

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
a little bit up in the head now it

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.820 
a little bit up in the head now it
doesn't<00:05:05.370> do<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.460> anymore<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.830> everything's

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
doesn't do that anymore so everything's

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.409 
doesn't do that anymore so everything's
perfect<00:05:08.220> there<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.639> I<00:05:08.760> just<00:05:08.940> got<00:05:09.090> these<00:05:09.210> two

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
perfect there and I just got these two

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.870 
perfect there and I just got these two
nice<00:05:09.660> little<00:05:09.949> shafts<00:05:10.949> with<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.669> little

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
nice little shafts with the little

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.580 
nice little shafts with the little
Springs<00:05:12.210> which<00:05:12.750> actually<00:05:13.139> these<00:05:13.260> Springs

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
Springs which actually these Springs

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.960 
Springs which actually these Springs
here<00:05:13.740> are<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.979> same<00:05:14.250> Springs<00:05:14.639> that<00:05:14.760> were<00:05:14.880> on

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
here are the same Springs that were on

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.939 
here are the same Springs that were on
the<00:05:15.030> door<00:05:15.180> before<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.720> did<00:05:16.500> not<00:05:16.650> change<00:05:16.830> the

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
the door before I did not change the

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.560 
the door before I did not change the
springs<00:05:17.280> or<00:05:17.400> anything<00:05:17.580> figured<00:05:18.090> you<00:05:18.180> know<00:05:18.300> two

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
springs or anything figured you know two

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.010 
springs or anything figured you know two
Springs<00:05:18.930> -<00:05:19.710> drums<00:05:20.010> two<00:05:20.370> cables<00:05:20.789> one<00:05:21.570> per<00:05:21.780> side

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
Springs - drums two cables one per side

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.950 
Springs - drums two cables one per side
and<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:23.130> worked<00:05:23.580> out<00:05:23.789> perfectly<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.479> think<00:05:24.870> I'll

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
and it worked out perfectly I think I'll

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.480 
and it worked out perfectly I think I'll
start<00:05:25.169> doing<00:05:25.440> this<00:05:25.530> with<00:05:25.680> every<00:05:25.889> door<00:05:26.070> install

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
start doing this with every door install

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.090 
start doing this with every door install
no<00:05:26.840> no<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:28.110> only<00:05:28.199> thing<00:05:28.320> is<00:05:28.560> this<00:05:28.710> won't<00:05:28.949> work

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
no no the only thing is this won't work

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.189 
no no the only thing is this won't work
on<00:05:29.340> a<00:05:29.400> 9<00:05:29.639> by<00:05:29.820> 7<00:05:29.880> or<00:05:30.330> an<00:05:30.419> 8<00:05:30.479> by<00:05:30.690> 7<00:05:30.750> you<00:05:31.169> know

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
on a 9 by 7 or an 8 by 7 you know

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.050 
on a 9 by 7 or an 8 by 7 you know
there's<00:05:31.440> only<00:05:31.590> one<00:05:31.770> spring<00:05:32.100> unless<00:05:32.880> you

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
there's only one spring unless you

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.900 
there's only one spring unless you
converted<00:05:33.570> it<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.870> have<00:05:34.020> two<00:05:34.370> so<00:05:35.370> there<00:05:35.820> we

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
converted it to have two so there we

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.510 
converted it to have two so there we
have<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.150> check<00:05:37.139> back<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.590> subscribe<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.460> the
