00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
this are navigation devices in our case

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.150 
this are navigation devices in our case
either<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> felt<00:00:39.510> looks<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> Phalke<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.860> bagged

either a felt looks or a Phalke I bagged

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
either a felt looks or a Phalke I bagged
and<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:42.300> both<00:00:42.540> devices<00:00:43.050> allow<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.350> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
Geo coordinate which we will now enter

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.859 
Geo coordinate which we will now enter
into<00:02:04.830> our<00:02:05.009> navigation<00:02:05.549> device<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.689> will

into our navigation device and this will
then<00:02:06.990> take<00:02:07.170> us<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.590> second<00:02:07.920> point<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
then take us to the second point of the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.100 
then take us to the second point of the
geocache<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.970> from<00:02:09.300> there<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.690> head<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:09.959> to

geocache and from there we head on to
the<00:02:10.140> third<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> fourth<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:13.340> if<00:02:14.340> a

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
the third and the fourth and so on if a

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.340 
the third and the fourth and so on if a
cache<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:14.910> always<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.330> simple<00:02:15.569> tendon<00:02:16.140> ism

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.350 
cache is not always a simple tendon ism
is<00:02:17.190> there<00:02:17.430> are<00:02:17.520> no<00:02:17.640> limits<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.030> people's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
is there are no limits to people's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.180 
is there are no limits to people's
imagination<00:02:18.959> with<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.160> are

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
imagination with this and so there are

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.860 
imagination with this and so there are
examples<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.880> caches<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.300> look<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.810> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
examples of caches that look like a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.559

you're out geocaching you also find
things<00:03:23.569> that<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.870> shouldn't<00:03:24.170> come<00:03:24.349> across<00:03:24.620> in

another very important role when

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.130 
another very important role when
geocaching<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.540> we<00:03:44.629> leave<00:03:44.750> everything

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
geocaching is that we leave everything

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.380 
geocaching is that we leave everything
exactly<00:03:45.379> as<00:03:45.920> we<00:03:46.069> found<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.519> because<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> next

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
exactly as we found it because the next

people to search for the geocache to of
course<00:03:49.190> also<00:03:49.640> want<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:49.879> spend<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.209> little<00:03:50.330> time

course also want to spend a little time
searching<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.440> that's<00:03:51.680> why<00:03:51.890> we're<00:03:52.099> shutting

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
searching and that's why we're shutting

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.130 
searching and that's why we're shutting
the<00:03:52.519> lid<00:03:52.640> again<00:03:52.730> here<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:53.900> doesn't

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
the lid again here so that it doesn't

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.479 
the lid again here so that it doesn't
look<00:03:54.200> like<00:03:54.440> anybody<00:03:54.829> has<00:03:54.980> been<00:03:55.190> here<00:03:55.400> before

this<00:03:56.060> is<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.239> very<00:03:56.420> important

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.920 

but<00:04:07.280> this<00:04:07.760> one<00:04:07.940> was<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.120> little<00:04:08.209> bit<00:04:08.420> tricky<00:04:08.599> but

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
but this one was a little bit tricky but

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.509 
but this one was a little bit tricky but
we<00:04:09.050> did<00:04:09.260> also<00:04:09.530> read<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.800> cached<00:04:10.010> description

we did also read the cached description
which<00:04:10.640> stated<00:04:10.970> that<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.209> needed<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.510> take<00:04:11.660> a

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
which stated that we needed to take a

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.180 
which stated that we needed to take a
bottle<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.080> water<00:04:12.290> with<00:04:12.500> us<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.769> now<00:04:12.920> we<00:04:12.980> know

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
bottle of water with us and now we know

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.040 
bottle of water with us and now we know
why<00:04:13.430> with<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.090> girls<00:04:14.300> were<00:04:14.450> really<00:04:14.660> clever<00:04:14.840> in

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
why with the girls were really clever in

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.810 
why with the girls were really clever in
working<00:04:15.410> out<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.590> solution<00:04:16.100> here<00:04:16.310> they

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
working out the solution here they

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.039 
working out the solution here they
watched<00:04:17.030> some<00:04:17.239> sort<00:04:17.480> of<00:04:17.570> when<00:04:17.690> water<00:04:17.900> flows

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
watched some sort of when water flows

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.509 
watched some sort of when water flows
out<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.500> bottom<00:04:18.560> they<00:04:18.950> needed<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.310> block

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
out of the bottom they needed to block

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.129 
out of the bottom they needed to block
up<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.760> holes<00:04:19.940> with<00:04:20.030> their<00:04:20.239> fingers<00:04:20.600> great

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
up the holes with their fingers great

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.050

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.940 

don't<00:04:39.099> think<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.719> shortest

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.700 

Oh<00:04:43.700> in<00:04:43.760> fact<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:44.450> we<00:04:44.720> found<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.200> final<00:04:45.500> cache

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
Oh in fact so we found the final cache

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.470 
Oh in fact so we found the final cache
and<00:04:45.950> there's<00:04:46.400> loads<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.850> different<00:04:46.910> things<00:04:47.330> in

and there's loads of different things in

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.390 
and there's loads of different things in

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
you must put something back in to

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.870 
you must put something back in to
replace<00:04:54.680> it<00:04:54.860> because<00:04:54.980> otherwise<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.670> box
