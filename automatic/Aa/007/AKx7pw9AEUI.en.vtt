about that on the podcast but I thought

about that on the podcast but I thought
that<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.920> juniors<00:00:59.789> best<00:01:00.149> interview

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that this was a juniors best interview

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.569 
that this was a juniors best interview
yet<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.079> haven't<00:01:01.379> heard<00:01:01.530> every<00:01:01.980> interview<00:01:02.370> he's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
yet I haven't heard every interview he's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.440 
yet I haven't heard every interview he's
done<00:01:02.850> I've<00:01:03.510> listened<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> few<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:05.450> but

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
done I've listened to a few of them but

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.570 
done I've listened to a few of them but
I<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> knocks<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.189> junior

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
I just think one of the knocks on junior

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
I just think one of the knocks on junior
and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> would<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> agree<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.950> know

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and I would have to agree was you know

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
and I would have to agree was you know
the<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.700> constant<00:01:12.150> interruptions<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.110> he

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the the constant interruptions when he

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870 
the the constant interruptions when he
would<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.470> interviewing<00:01:13.860> somebody<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> he

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
would be interviewing somebody and he

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.820 
would be interviewing somebody and he
would<00:01:15.030> interject<00:01:15.210> far<00:01:15.960> too<00:01:16.140> much<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.740> he

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
would interject far too much and then he

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.410 
would interject far too much and then he
would<00:01:16.950> wax<00:01:17.220> eloquently<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.939> go<00:01:18.060> off<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
would wax eloquently and go off on a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
would wax eloquently and go off on a
tangent<00:01:18.509> meanwhile<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.950> guest<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.400> kind<00:01:20.640> of

tangent meanwhile the guest is kind of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.980 
tangent meanwhile the guest is kind of
just<00:01:20.880> sitting<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> line<00:01:21.750> he

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
just sitting there on the line he

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
interview but it was also very

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.870 
interview but it was also very
frustrating<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.960> listen<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.460> it<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.640> was

driving me nuts with some of his
interviews<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:34.020> fun

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
interviews but this was a really fun

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
interviews but this was a really fun
discussion<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.130> none<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.490> there

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
discussion there was none of that there

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it was just a nice conversation between

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.390

became something of a parody of himself

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.890 
became something of a parody of himself
when<00:04:06.340> he<00:04:06.460> would<00:04:06.580> say<00:04:06.760> stuff<00:04:07.000> like<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.720> he

at the end there the last year or two at
WCW<00:04:12.130> he<00:04:12.700> just<00:04:12.910> didn't<00:04:13.120> care<00:04:13.270> I<00:04:13.510> mean<00:04:14.260> he<00:04:14.590> had

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
WCW he just didn't care I mean he had

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.740 
WCW he just didn't care I mean he had
mentally<00:04:15.190> checked<00:04:15.490> out<00:04:15.670> he<00:04:15.910> was<00:04:16.030> burnt<00:04:16.299> out<00:04:16.480> he

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
did not give a but I think he's

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.479 
did not give a but I think he's
underrated<00:04:20.230> as<00:04:20.350> an<00:04:20.500> announcer<00:04:20.980> and<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.190> think

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
underrated as an announcer and I think

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.590 
underrated as an announcer and I think
all<00:04:22.180> these<00:04:22.630> years<00:04:22.690> later<00:04:22.990> in<00:04:23.410> 2014<00:04:23.860> as<00:04:24.490> bad<00:04:25.419> as

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
all these years later in 2014 as bad as

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.970 
all these years later in 2014 as bad as
the<00:04:25.720> announcing<00:04:26.320> can<00:04:26.530> be

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
the announcing can be

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.370 
the announcing can be
it<00:04:27.850> makes<00:04:28.180> me<00:04:28.360> appreciate<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.930> guy<00:04:29.140> like<00:04:29.350> him

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
it makes me appreciate a guy like him

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.010 
it makes me appreciate a guy like him
even<00:04:29.830> more<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.340> long<00:04:31.030> for<00:04:31.420> the<00:04:31.450> days<00:04:31.660> when<00:04:31.690> we

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
even more and long for the days when we

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.140 
even more and long for the days when we
had<00:04:32.200> guys<00:04:32.590> like<00:04:32.860> Tony<00:04:33.040> Shivani<00:04:33.460> on<00:04:33.670> commentary

a<00:04:36.190> match<00:04:36.520> or<00:04:36.910> could<00:04:37.510> make<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.750> show<00:04:38.170> feel

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
a match or could make a show feel

a match or could make a show feel
special<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.880> feel<00:04:40.090> like<00:04:40.240> now<00:04:40.420> it's<00:04:40.690> not

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
special and I feel like now it's not

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.780 
special and I feel like now it's not
really<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.500> priority<00:04:41.770> with<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.370> announcers

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
really a priority with the announcers

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.610 
really a priority with the announcers
it's<00:04:43.030> more<00:04:43.420> they're<00:04:43.930> more<00:04:44.140> interested<00:04:44.560> in

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
it's more they're more interested in

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.800 
it's more they're more interested in
making<00:04:44.950> each<00:04:45.070> other<00:04:45.250> laugh<00:04:45.600> even<00:04:46.600> when<00:04:46.630> the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
making each other laugh even when the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.570 
making each other laugh even when the
audience<00:04:47.110> doesn't<00:04:47.740> find<00:04:48.220> what<00:04:48.430> they're

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
audience doesn't find what they're

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.910 
audience doesn't find what they're
talking<00:04:48.970> about<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.330> funny<00:04:49.660> at<00:04:49.870> all<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.320> and

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
which I guess they have to do but it's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.560 
which I guess they have to do but it's
just<00:04:56.320> not<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.620> same<00:04:56.800> anymore<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.910> makes<00:04:58.420> me

want to put cotton balls in my ears and
