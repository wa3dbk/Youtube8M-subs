00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.290

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.559
 around one of the most anticipated titles 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.290
 of this year 2013 we are talking 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.090
 of grand theft auto 5 and is that many of 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.279
 you are the ones who already have that 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.050
 saved money prepared for 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.260
 acquire this title that reaches us the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.940
 next day September 17 this 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.949
 same year well, that's already the last 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.070
 what has been said and is that rockstar has 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.840
 unveiled new details of this 7 to 5 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.820
 this time what the company has 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.159
 wanted to announce is that the title goes to 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.949
 require an installation in both 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.350
 xbox 360 as in playstation 3 a 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.839
 mandatory installation also in the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.260
 case of the microsoft console the xbox 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.449
 360 the gta 5 will reach us in two 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.729
 discs the first one is going to be used for 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.409
 the installation and the second disk to 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.449
 play so you will not have to be 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.000
 changing from one disk to another during 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.489
 heading that we are facing a 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.010
 installation in both systems is going to 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.560
 occupy nothing more and nothing less than 8 gigs 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.810
 of course on playstation3 only 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.050
 everything will come on a single disc and it's 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.330
 what 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.400
 the bluray you already know that it gives for a lot and 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.500
 you will say but what is the controversy 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.930
 in this news that happens because of having to 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.420
 installing the game will really be better 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.400
 for our console, well, yes, but 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.530
 you have to remember that there are people who 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.810
 example in playstation3 have the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.700
 memory of your hard drive quite 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.650
 let's not forget that one of the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.930
 playstation3 that are marketed in 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.690
 these moments in stores has so 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.220
 only 12 gigabytes of hard drive memory and if 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.010
 to this we add the different 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.420
 playstation 3 updates 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.640
 imagine what we can have 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.160
 we can have problems even for 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.590
 install this gta 5 what is clear is 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.210
 that we are looking forward to playing this new 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.250
 adventure for the first time in the saga 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.290
 grand theft auto 'can control 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.510
 three different characters in the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.940
 main story characters like 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.620
 michael franklin and trevor besides this 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.690
 title you already know that you will have the 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.910
 largest city ever created by 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.720
 rockstar in a grand theft title 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.179
 car 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.210
 for that reason it will surely be necessary 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.430
 install those 8 gigabytes of memory 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.660
 content although there is no doubt 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.790
 is that rockstar 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.920
 will surprise you and a lot because it's a 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.900
 title that is going to fire big 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.520
 this generation of consoles a title 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.820
 that by the way lately has been said 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.420
 that will not appear even in playstation 4 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.130
 and in xbox one or in pc it seems that not 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.140
 get off the donkey in the rockstar 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.850
 and they want to sell all the copies that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.600
 can in the current consoles 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.490
 generation 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.380
 rockstar through a session of 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.750
 questions and answers on your website 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.150
 has revealed new details of this 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.880
 fifth part of grand theft auto between 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.560
 those details that presentation of a 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.540
 video gameplay of grand theft 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.810
 auto 5 a video in which we will be able to 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.180
 see how the game is in gameplay too 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.740
 have wanted to emphasize that they will not say 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.770
 nothing about versions for 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.480
 playstation 4 xbox one and cc at least for 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.490
 the moment we'll see what's behind 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.130
 all this but ojito because grand theft 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.720
 car 5 could give us more of a surprise 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.720
 during the next hours 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.340
 do not
