bit in addition to the gun arm and I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.080

think Leela came with this arm and this
arm<00:01:27.149> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:28.410> now<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.069> can<00:01:29.429> remove<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.030> arm

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.180 
arm I think now you can remove this arm
here<00:01:30.590> pop<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.800> off<00:01:32.599> pop<00:01:33.599> that<00:01:33.869> back<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
here pop that off pop that back in and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.190 
here pop that off pop that back in and
you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.459> have<00:01:35.640> regular<00:01:35.940> arms<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.989> can

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you can have regular arms and you can

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.760 
you can have regular arms and you can
take<00:01:37.410> this<00:01:37.590> head<00:01:37.890> bit<00:01:38.340> take<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.270> off<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.780> put

take this head bit take that off and put

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.100 
take this head bit take that off and put
that<00:01:41.099> on<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:42.410> so<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.679> have<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:45.110> spike

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
that on there so you can have a spike

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
that on there so you can have a spike
it's<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.130> kinda<00:01:47.640> creepy<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.179> suppose<00:01:49.130> overall

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's just kinda creepy I suppose overall

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.889 
it's just kinda creepy I suppose overall
though<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> prefer<00:01:50.729> keeping<00:01:51.300> this<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.660> there

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
though I prefer keeping this on there

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
though I prefer keeping this on there
don't<00:01:52.380> know<00:01:52.619> why<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.190> I<00:01:53.280> also<00:01:53.399> prefer<00:01:53.819> to<00:01:53.910> keep

pompous<00:02:23.239> waste<00:02:23.480> bit<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:25.700> his<00:02:26.030> legs<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.420> legs

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
pompous waste bit in his legs the legs

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.089 
pompous waste bit in his legs the legs
are<00:02:26.750> actually<00:02:27.049> a<00:02:27.109> little<00:02:27.319> bit<00:02:27.500> loose<00:02:27.890> you

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
are actually a little bit loose you

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.990 
are actually a little bit loose you
could<00:02:28.219> probably<00:02:28.370> put<00:02:28.609> a<00:02:28.640> little<00:02:28.790> bit<00:02:28.939> of

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
could probably put a little bit of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.399 
could probably put a little bit of
superglue<00:02:29.299> around<00:02:29.629> there<00:02:29.780> playing<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.319> there

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
superglue around there playing in there

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:31.750 
superglue around there playing in there
probably<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.829> hold<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.129> there<00:02:31.280> nice<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.549> tight

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
probably to hold in there nice and tight

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.149 
probably to hold in there nice and tight
now<00:02:32.090> articulation<00:02:33.019> wise<00:02:33.140> obviously<00:02:33.739> his<00:02:33.950> head

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
now articulation wise obviously his head

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.220 
now articulation wise obviously his head
will<00:02:34.459> rotate<00:02:34.670> his<00:02:35.150> arms<00:02:36.040> rotate<00:02:37.810> all<00:02:38.810> over<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
will rotate his arms rotate all over the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.490 
will rotate his arms rotate all over the
place<00:02:39.470> he's<00:02:39.709> got<00:02:39.890> some<00:02:40.189> waist<00:02:40.459> articulation

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
place he's got some waist articulation

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.069 
place he's got some waist articulation
in<00:02:42.500> his<00:02:42.769> feet<00:02:42.980> can<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.700> can<00:02:43.970> have<00:02:44.120> them<00:02:44.269> stand

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
in his feet can you can have them stand

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.379 
in his feet can you can have them stand
like<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.439> suppose<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:46.459> overall<00:02:46.819> very<00:02:47.150> nice

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
like that I suppose in overall very nice

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.240 
like that I suppose in overall very nice
figure<00:02:47.629> it's<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.079> like<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.769> said<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.099> a

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
figure it's it's like like I said it's a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.410 
figure it's it's like like I said it's a
build<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.609> bought<00:02:49.790> figure<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.299> it's

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
build a bought figure so it's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.940 
build a bought figure so it's
essentially<00:02:50.750> free<00:02:51.170> when<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:51.709> all<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
essentially free when you get all the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.670 
essentially free when you get all the
pieces<00:02:52.310> with<00:02:53.030> all<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.269> characters<00:02:53.659> so<00:02:54.139> a<00:02:54.170> very

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
pieces with all the characters so a very

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.449 
pieces with all the characters so a very
nice<00:02:54.950> figure

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
nice figure

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.240 
nice figure
highly<00:02:56.120> recommended<00:02:56.689> very<00:02:57.470> nice<00:02:57.739> detail<00:02:58.220> on

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
highly recommended very nice detail on

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.629 
highly recommended very nice detail on
this<00:02:58.579> guy<00:02:58.819> it's<00:02:59.480> just<00:03:00.159> it's<00:03:01.159> so<00:03:01.310> cool-looking

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.979 
this guy it's just it's so cool-looking
I<00:03:03.220> really<00:03:04.220> think<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.549> a<00:03:04.669> very<00:03:05.000> sharp<00:03:05.510> looking

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
I really think it's a very sharp looking

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.740 
I really think it's a very sharp looking
robot<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.189> in<00:03:07.849> terms<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.269> a<00:03:08.329> size<00:03:08.540> comparison

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
robot so in terms of a size comparison

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.050 
robot so in terms of a size comparison
here<00:03:09.349> he<00:03:09.439> is<00:03:09.560> next<00:03:09.799> to<00:03:10.010> everybody's<00:03:10.519> favourite

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.599 
here he is next to everybody's favourite
other<00:03:11.209> robot<00:03:11.599> better<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.530> wonder<00:03:13.189> if<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.370> can

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
other robot better I wonder if you can

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.000 
other robot better I wonder if you can
you<00:03:14.480> probably<00:03:14.599> can't<00:03:15.019> do<00:03:15.260> this<00:03:15.439> but<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:15.859> is

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
you probably can't do this but this is

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:26.469 
you probably can't do this but this is
gonna<00:03:16.159> look<00:03:16.340> kind<00:03:16.579> of<00:03:16.669> funny<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.030> his

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
gonna look kind of funny and if his

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.030 
gonna look kind of funny and if his
won't<00:03:26.750> fit<00:03:27.019> on<00:03:27.109> here<00:03:27.290> because<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:27.650> too<00:03:27.829> big

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
won't fit on here because it's too big

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.559 
won't fit on here because it's too big
but<00:03:29.829> put<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:30.859> there<00:03:31.280> it's<00:03:32.120> kind<00:03:32.329> of<00:03:32.389> cool

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
but put that there it's kind of cool

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.559 
but put that there it's kind of cool
like<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:34.060> there<00:03:35.060> we<00:03:35.090> go

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
like that there we go

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.909 
like that there we go
replace<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:37.060> pop<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.239> right<00:03:38.269> back<00:03:38.659> so<00:03:39.049> you

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
replace that pop that right back so you

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.830 
replace that pop that right back so you
guys<00:03:40.069> have<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.489> Santa<00:03:40.849> bot<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.329> hope<00:03:41.690> you
