00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello friends with you now he and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.020
 This is the twenty-second issue of the rubric. 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.029
 master on all tanks heading in which i 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 trying to get a sign of you nasty master 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.170
 on the technique whose name you are 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.330
 specify in the comments today with us 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.060
 a little suffering release because 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.010
 summer ended September came and under 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.470
 I chose this autumn mood 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.630
 appropriate tank and so meet 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.260
 the very best premium tank of the fifth 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.270
 level british matilda black prince 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.239
 in total I spent on this type 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.860
 average tank as much as 15 fights and probably 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.840
 last time so useless i 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.410
 felt on another british 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.690
 masterpiece 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.730
 why i think matilda is useless yes 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.250
 all because of its excellent dynamics 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
 for an average tank to have as many as 22 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.960
 kilometer per hour maximum speed 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.329
 forward but it 's cool guys true but 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.969
 what is the worst thing these 22 kilometers in 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.489
 hour Matilda sometimes gaining and then already 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.380
 t95 has no chance 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.210
 okay let's forget about the dynamics and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.400
 talk about booking maybe 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.159
 she will please us at least a little on the forehead 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.680
 hull and turret ts 75 millimeters in 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 Basically, level 4 tanks can sometimes 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.119
 not punch if you're a bit on the Tanchiki 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 will return the diamond in terms of booking 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.640
 the sides of the hull then there are big screens 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.500
 thickness 13 25 millimeters and behind it 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.040
 the main part of the board has armored 40 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.380
 millimeters 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.810
 the top of the board is as much as 70 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.360
 millimeters has armor and you know here 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.729
 This is a small strip if I got out 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.790
 out of the corner neatly you eat overboard 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.430
 you can beat the shells from here 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.380
 no tanks 4 sometimes even the fifth level 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.509
 and in your offenders you can 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.490
 spitting out of a cool hole punch which 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.470
 shoots once every 2 seconds of breaking through 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.079
 head off him 110 millimeters well basically 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.899
 good for fifth level of the tank to break through 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.000
 This caliber 180 very well and 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.340
 here is the time of mixing with him two whole three 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.649
 tenths of a second that is it comes down 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.630
 longer than accurate recharge 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.009
 amazing spread on 100 meters 041 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.840
 probably the only thing that me 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.910
 pleased in this tank if at least something 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.580
 may I still please this review 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.410
 which is 350 meters very 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.590
 good figure for medium tank 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.780
 level five but the problem is that 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.660
 speakers then we don't have and dedicate we don't 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.030
 ca n't just don't get there from where 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.700
 You can devote this whole guys 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.560
 the problem here you know when I played on t95 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.260
 she is also slow and generally there 13 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.840
 kilometers per hour you crawl creep well 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.640
 do you have a feeling that if 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.349
 you are not half as crawling to you 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.150
 you have a powerful cool gun out 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.720
 which you can shoot you have 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.610
 armor 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.620
 because of which you will not be killed immediately and you 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.660
 you can pot in general 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.580
 damage you can but end up 2 too 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.380
 In principle, some such situation is 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.000
 you have no armor in your armor 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.459
 maximum speed is also very 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.250
 small but do you have a cool 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.500
 guns and 1400 strength points i.e. 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.780
 while you will crawl or when to you 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.940
 come again you can shoot 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.829
 from while you live you 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.620
 cause a good amount of damage 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.299
 In general, the wizard something like you can take but 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.640
 while I was playing on Matilda black prince 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.280
 the feeling of such was not only one 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.989
 feeling of complete uselessness if u 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.329
 There were some other strong words 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.650
 hand then Matilda but they simply do not 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.239
 except for the review which 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.680
 realize the impossibility of the absence 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.069
 speakers not 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.079
 strength points not bad armor 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.430
 guns i said she's ok but i 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.680
 I mean that it is normal for 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.700
 medium tank level five medium 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.130
 tank which can 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.650
 drive around the enemy change direction 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.359
 whirl heavy tank or which 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.400
 enjoys a speed of 20 kilometers per hour 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.170
 In general, guys, I have finally 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.120
 not bombed by this wonderful 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.889
 average and even premium so 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.540
 let me tell you a few words about 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.489
 what happened in the battle in which i 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.160
 finally got a mark of class 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.290
 master and then put the unfortunate 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.019
 Matilda to the farthest corner of the hangar and 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.090
 forgot about her and so this time choice 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.549
 sent me to suffer on an NSC card 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.380
 counter-battle mode and it's not just nsk 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.810
 head-to-head and the most ideal conditions 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.910
 in order to take the master on Matilda 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.990
 black prince as you could see two 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.390
 thirds of the team consisted of tanks 6 round 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.550
 me and at the very beginning I did not even know where 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.130
 I have to go because I'll go to the green 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.890
 kill I'll go to the city kill but a little later 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.990
 and so I ride a little bit of iron 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.120
 I thought where to go well and decided 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.640
 move a little towards the city 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.680
 together with their allies succeeded 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.530
 a little shoot obder Soviet 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.150
 t-34 85 and then i just turned around 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.520
 one hundred eighty degrees drove 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.350
 literally 50 meters and along with our 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.390
 gallant kvass prepared to meet 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.210
 enemy tanks that killed everyone on 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.250
 Zelenka and already crawled to us in the end with 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.810
 the help of the allies of sabot shells 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.180
 with grief in half succeeded first 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.130
 destroy sous-100 and then apt-1 its i 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.020
 by the way constantly kept on the tracks and not 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.500
 so that he does not leave and that 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.170
 get exactly the bonus in the experience for the downing 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.240
 caterpillars and after that we destroyed 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.970
 Hellketh now send it onguard 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.370
 t-34 so what can I say in the end 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.730
 by matilda black prince you know tanchik 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.410
 warms very well and if you 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.840
