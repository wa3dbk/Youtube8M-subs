00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.179 
loss or and/or weight maintenance over
time<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.140> would<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.920> big

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
time so that would really be the big

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.940 
time so that would really be the big
question<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> road<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.380> consume

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
question down the road is if I consume

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.280 
question down the road is if I consume
these<00:01:59.250> capsaicinoids<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> regular<00:02:00.570> basis

these capsaicinoids on a regular basis

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.399 
these capsaicinoids on a regular basis
will<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.280> help<00:02:02.520> me<00:02:02.850> maintain<00:02:03.450> or<00:02:04.140> lose

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
will that help me maintain or lose

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.889 
will that help me maintain or lose
weight<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.189> or<00:02:05.520> body<00:02:05.759> fat<00:02:06.149> over<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.659> course

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
day when it's ad lib intake eat as much

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.509 
day when it's ad lib intake eat as much
as<00:02:57.300> you'd<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:57.920> individuals<00:02:58.920> tend<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.340> eat

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
as you'd like individuals tend to eat

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.970 
as you'd like individuals tend to eat
less<00:03:00.140> when<00:03:01.140> they've<00:03:01.319> been<00:03:01.500> using<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
less when they've been using the

less when they've been using the
capsaicinoids<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.780> placebo<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> think

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
capsaicinoids the placebo so I think

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.860 
capsaicinoids the placebo so I think
that's<00:03:05.010> interesting<00:03:05.730> than<00:03:06.269> appetite

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
that's interesting than appetite

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.100 
that's interesting than appetite
suppressant<00:03:07.620> effects<00:03:08.239> with<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.540> dietary

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
suppressant effects with a dietary

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.229 
suppressant effects with a dietary
supplement<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.160> would<00:03:11.489> have<00:03:11.519> as<00:03:12.060> much

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
supplement so you would have as much

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.850 
supplement so you would have as much
food<00:03:12.540> as<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.750> want<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.140> eat<00:03:13.290> at<00:03:13.410> your<00:03:13.500> disposal

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
food as you want to eat at your disposal

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.220 
food as you want to eat at your disposal
but<00:03:14.160> when<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.430> take<00:03:14.640> these<00:03:14.880> capsules<00:03:15.569> you

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
but when you take these capsules you

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.310 
but when you take these capsules you
will<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.530> automatically<00:03:17.519> eat<00:03:17.790> less<00:03:18.320> that's

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
will just automatically eat less that's

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.289 
will just automatically eat less that's
beneficial<00:03:20.070> that's<00:03:20.459> been<00:03:20.640> shown<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.910> some

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
results that I've seen have been when

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.370 
results that I've seen have been when
they<00:03:29.010> added<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.760> capsaicin<00:03:30.239> oyed<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:31.140> the

and the food intake was drastically

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.180 
and the food intake was drastically
reduced<00:03:42.690> wow<00:03:43.200> that's<00:03:43.500> that's<00:03:43.829> really

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
reduced wow that's that's really

again<00:03:46.350> these<00:03:46.560> are<00:03:46.620> acute<00:03:47.160> studies<00:03:47.609> if<00:03:48.239> a

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
again these are acute studies if a

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.930 
again these are acute studies if a

will they have any sort of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.819 
will they have any sort of
desensitization<00:03:54.140> over<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.260> course<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.650> time

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.410 
desensitization over the course of time
in<00:03:56.040> other<00:03:56.190> words<00:03:56.459> what<00:03:56.910> they<00:03:57.000> need<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.180> take

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
in other words what they need to take

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.330 
in other words what they need to take
more<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.320> get<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.620> same<00:03:58.769> effect<00:03:58.950> as

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
more of it to get the same effect as

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.670 
more of it to get the same effect as
they<00:03:59.489> did<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.000> first<00:04:00.030> day<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:01.109> those<00:04:01.290> studies

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
they did the first day and those studies

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.229 
they did the first day and those studies
to<00:04:01.829> my<00:04:01.950> knowledge<00:04:02.160> really<00:04:02.549> haven't<00:04:02.880> been<00:04:02.940> done

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
to my knowledge really haven't been done

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.849 
to my knowledge really haven't been done
so<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.570> think<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.840> would<00:04:04.109> be<00:04:04.260> interesting<00:04:04.829> to

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
so I think that would be interesting to

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.270 
so I think that would be interesting to
investigate<00:04:05.370> but<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.480> does<00:04:06.720> generate

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
investigate but it does generate

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.500 
investigate but it does generate
thermogenesis<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:08.609> it<00:04:08.730> heats<00:04:08.910> your<00:04:09.090> body<00:04:09.269> up

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
thermogenesis so it heats your body up

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.509 
thermogenesis so it heats your body up
your<00:04:09.720> metabolism<00:04:09.890> conspired<00:04:10.890> up<00:04:11.130> right<00:04:11.340> right

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
your metabolism conspired up right right

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.610 
your metabolism conspired up right right
I<00:04:11.730> think<00:04:12.030> even<00:04:12.329> if<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.660> average<00:04:12.959> person<00:04:13.470> was

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
I think even if the average person was

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.009 
I think even if the average person was
at<00:04:13.769> home<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.220> had<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> thermometer<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.420> they

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
at home and had a thermometer and they

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.199 
at home and had a thermometer and they
went<00:04:16.260> ahead<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:16.709> doused<00:04:17.039> something<00:04:17.549> with<00:04:17.850> red

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
went ahead and doused something with red

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.300 
went ahead and doused something with red
hot<00:04:18.479> or<00:04:18.780> something<00:04:19.019> on<00:04:19.410> those<00:04:19.620> lines<00:04:19.769> and

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
hot or something on those lines and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.190 
hot or something on those lines and
consumed<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:21.000> they'd<00:04:21.359> probably<00:04:21.390> find<00:04:22.049> that

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
consumed it they'd probably find that

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.460 
consumed it they'd probably find that
their<00:04:22.380> basal<00:04:22.620> temperature<00:04:23.159> would<00:04:23.580> increase

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
their basal temperature would increase

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.379 
their basal temperature would increase
just<00:04:25.470> with<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.800> consumption

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389

have used dosages that are relatively

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.070 
have used dosages that are relatively
high<00:04:34.069> so<00:04:34.789> we<00:04:34.819> need<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.389> know<00:04:35.569> whether<00:04:35.779> or<00:04:35.930> not<00:04:36.020> a
