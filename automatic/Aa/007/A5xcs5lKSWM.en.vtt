00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the people are doing and serve for you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.350
 is showing this tutorial is a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.309
 serious problem with this car here 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.750
 in this fitch role 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 I do not know if it happens in all cars 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.839
 of this model here 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.220
 This is the template x 2007 2008 that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.920
 happened to this car here with the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
 I bought the government to use the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.269
 there may be a problem in the air 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.210
 conditioned here and I really liked it 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.019
 we change valves with expander the new 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.700
 expanding the air by cleaning the entire system 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.770
 spent playing because gas more or less 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.590
 three times or four times 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.860
 if I remember well that the whole problem 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.680
 car was in this process ok 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.230
 your temperature sensor and if I stay 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480
 in front of the carrier ball inside the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 this is a little box that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.610
 send the command of peace among the people 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.379
 of that car that commands this gentleman here 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.989
 works if you take a test of the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.570
 Only you from this movie 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.910
 just this little box inside the mec 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 causes instead of staying ok it will give 10 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.850
 k 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.470
 in fact since the wave with the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.360
 low temperature 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 the der can reach more or less 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.549
 15 degrees 15 degrees positive a little 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080
 more or less 15 10 degrees 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.080
 it will happen that it will fall to 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.080
 at least 20 of this car that is not 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.450
 This one here, I already bought it here. 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 This car was 47 years old, I was 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.490
 I was down hill in case falling falling 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.680
 or climbing to ip dance is very rock 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.930
 there is only that little point here that gives the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.729
 problem is this is the 6 what 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.829
 send the command with this little box that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.369

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.049
 then the air conditioner comes back 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.119

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.090
 generate enough and you will see that a 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.390
 temperature sensor that is 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.680
