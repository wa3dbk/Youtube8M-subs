00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.930 
hello this is larry from bj business
today<00:00:03.899> we're<00:00:04.230> looking<00:00:04.560> at<00:00:04.859> showing<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.759> how

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
today we're looking at showing you how

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.509 
today we're looking at showing you how
we<00:00:06.000> build<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.830> cockstand<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.189> particular

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
we build a cockstand this particular

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.039 
we build a cockstand this particular
stand<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:10.040> mid<00:00:11.040> clock<00:00:11.400> stand<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.599> we're

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
stand is a mid clock stand and we're

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.790 
stand is a mid clock stand and we're
going<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.259> make<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.620> from<00:00:13.799> 18<00:00:14.370> inch<00:00:14.759> acrylic<00:00:15.800> it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
going to make it from 18 inch acrylic it

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.260 
going to make it from 18 inch acrylic it
would<00:00:17.010> look<00:00:17.160> something<00:00:17.400> like<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
would look something like this in the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.260 
would look something like this in the
beginning<00:00:18.590> nice<00:00:19.590> flat<00:00:20.010> basically<00:00:20.850> nothing

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
beginning nice flat basically nothing

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.920 
beginning nice flat basically nothing
but<00:00:21.449> we're<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> cut<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.500> thing<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
but we're going to cut this thing with a

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.509 
but we're going to cut this thing with a
precise<00:00:24.930> laser<00:00:25.910> cnc<00:00:26.910> machine<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.279> it<00:00:29.279> will

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
precise laser cnc machine and it will

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.099 
precise laser cnc machine and it will
give<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> shape<00:00:30.300> form<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.929> you're

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
give you the shape form that you're

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.380 
give you the shape form that you're
looking<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.650> give<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.820> let's<00:00:33.239> take

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
looking for give with that let's take

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.030 
looking for give with that let's take
you<00:00:33.510> over<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.930> let<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> look<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.890> how

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you over and let you have a look at how

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.100 
you over and let you have a look at how
it<00:00:35.280> does<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.840> this<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.879> laser<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.270> blank<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it does it this is the laser a blank is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.430 
it does it this is the laser a blank is
in<00:00:40.350> place<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.600> talking<00:00:43.020> about<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
in place and we are talking about a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.619 
in place and we are talking about a
laser<00:00:43.800> high-intensity<00:00:44.670> light<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.390> lot<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
laser high-intensity light a lot of

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.910 
laser high-intensity light a lot of
people<00:00:47.000> wonder<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.480> okay<00:00:49.289> let's<00:00:49.710> see

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
people wonder about that okay let's see

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.229 
people wonder about that okay let's see
start<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.230> it's<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> go<00:00:52.649> beer<00:00:52.860> stuff<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:04.420 

and<00:00:57.239> we're<00:00:57.390> off<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> races

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.400 

there's<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.300> actual<00:01:05.720> shape<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.200> clock

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
there's the actual shape of the clock

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.930 
there's the actual shape of the clock
itself<00:01:08.500> now<00:01:09.500> it's<00:01:09.710> cutting<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.190> outside<00:01:10.700> up

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
itself now it's cutting the outside up

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.500 
itself now it's cutting the outside up
understand

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.950 

this<00:01:14.140> will<00:01:14.410> allow<00:01:14.710> us<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.950> get<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.780> shape<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
this will allow us to get the shape the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
this will allow us to get the shape the
clock<00:01:17.200> he<00:01:17.560> also<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.160 

the<00:01:21.520> bend<00:01:21.760> in<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.150> stand<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.690> order<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.080> hold

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
the bend in the stand in order to hold

00:01:23.170 --> 00:02:07.460 
the bend in the stand in order to hold
the<00:01:23.350> clock<00:01:23.530> once<00:01:23.950> mounted

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:22.940 

okay<00:02:08.450> look<00:02:19.220> one<00:02:20.220> o'clock<00:02:20.640> Stan<00:02:21.680> precision<00:02:22.680> cut

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
okay look one o'clock Stan precision cut

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.900 
okay look one o'clock Stan precision cut
out<00:02:23.760> looking<00:02:24.750> good<00:02:25.280> you'll<00:02:26.280> peel<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.730> paper

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
out looking good you'll peel the paper

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.390 
out looking good you'll peel the paper
off<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.570> will<00:02:27.990> heat<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.560> bend<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
off of it will heat it and bend it and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.690 
off of it will heat it and bend it and
put<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> out<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.630> production<00:02:31.460> thank<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.580> for

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
put it out in production thank you for

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.050 
put it out in production thank you for
watching<00:02:32.850> we'll<00:02:33.510> get<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.870> later<00:02:36.050> thank
