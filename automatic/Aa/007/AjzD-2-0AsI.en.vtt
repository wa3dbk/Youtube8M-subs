00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.170
 as always 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.059
 in this race that much will guide me and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.260
 this race has already played, not because if 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.359
 it seems quite like one I already played but 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.800
 if you notice, it is different and it seems that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.930
 A little harder, it cost me a lot 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.369
 because with the basic ramps have 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.410
 tried to break into ramp and shot because 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.460
 It touches me and I fall because I also 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.260
 touch to see 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.820
 it did not touch me but the rest is still a 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.199
 little troll and you leave me because the rest 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.360
 it reappears here and I do not understand 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.680
 gentlemen please are you so kind 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.380
 reappear me on top of a platform 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.340
 solid fuck me all boy gentlemen for 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.290
 please let me touch the pelendengues 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.590
 now yes no 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.000
 there is habit twitter 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.240
 this car has some kind of problem 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.220
 or accelerated for the cntc and the car 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.560
 turns but overturns palante or six super 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:57.720
 I miss to see why I did not ask 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.630
 how I fell this is going to fall on me 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.340
 face bwin your peace big water this is for 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.050
 your house you're doing well well that when 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.600
 ask how I did not fall because I do not have 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.750
 no idea we turn around as he says 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.430
 the song I do not know what song but it's not 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.670
 for quiet people to catch 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.670
 run 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.420
 we skip green kids and kids numbers 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.890
 follow each other until almost remote 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.509
 for control and almost the acoustic is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.320
 It's worth that jump and super difficult is 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.909
 that jump is super super super difficult 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.369
 but not as difficult as 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.530
 bush like what I just did sighted 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.409
 crazy 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.700
 you have to take the jump in such a way that 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.700
 Yes Yes 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:48.500
 my mother, my mother please call me 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:51.259
 thanks to see see guys let's go let's go 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.850
 let's skip what we would do if 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.130
 we have the point and now we have to go down 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.000
 down here and since there are four points of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.950
 control to choose where is the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.869
 next point more is down here in 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.799
 the gutter is ok ok you have to wash them 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.929
 guys you have to wash it so this 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.130
 it is epic you have to nail those that well 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.130
 it sounds but good of equal 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.410
 now we hit a soak because 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.670
 I feel like I think we left here and 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.170
 let's finance this like this video 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.150
 and the three points of four and the goal 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.150
