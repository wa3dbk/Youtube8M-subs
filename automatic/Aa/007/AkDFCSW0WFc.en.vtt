acrylic plastic useful sometimes
difficult<00:00:07.919> but<00:00:08.700> we're<00:00:08.820> gonna<00:00:08.940> talk<00:00:09.450> about

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
difficult but we're gonna talk about

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360 
difficult but we're gonna talk about
cutting<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.080> I'm<00:00:10.320> Robert<00:00:10.679> Markey<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.190> we're

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
cutting it I'm Robert Markey and we're

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.129 
cutting it I'm Robert Markey and we're
going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.519> talk<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.759> how<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> cut<00:00:12.599> acrylic

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
going to talk about how to cut acrylic

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.580 
going to talk about how to cut acrylic
plastic<00:00:15.770> basically<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> idea<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.990> when

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
plastic basically the idea is you when

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.040 
plastic basically the idea is you when
you<00:00:19.680> cut<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.730> need<00:00:20.910> something<00:00:21.359> pretty

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
you cut this you need something pretty

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.109 
you cut this you need something pretty
fine<00:00:23.990> we<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.109> use<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> handsaw<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.820> want<00:00:27.029> to

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
fine we can use a handsaw and we want to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.470 
fine we can use a handsaw and we want to
use<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.689> fine<00:00:28.650> toothed<00:00:29.630> handsaw<00:00:31.430> with<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.030 

basically<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.140> cutting<00:00:37.739> wood

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
basically it's kind of like cutting wood

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:52.549 
basically it's kind of like cutting wood
only<00:00:48.649> it's<00:00:49.649> cutting<00:00:49.980> plastic<00:00:51.199> okay

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
only it's cutting plastic okay

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.479 
only it's cutting plastic okay
to<00:00:52.800> find<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.399> tooth<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.190> finer<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to find the tooth you have the finer the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.810 
to find the tooth you have the finer the
better<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.090> nicer<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> cut<00:00:57.890> okay<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.609> want

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
better the nicer the cut okay if we want

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.880 
better the nicer the cut okay if we want
to<00:00:59.910> use<00:01:00.210> our<00:01:01.789> scroll<00:01:02.789> saw<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:04.080> use<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.470> very

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
to use our scroll saw we use the very

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:36.490 
to use our scroll saw we use the very
fine<00:01:05.280> blade<00:01:05.489> down

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.380 

and<00:01:39.619> there<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
and there we have it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.060 
and there we have it
using<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.509> tends<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.140> melt<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.650> little<00:01:43.830> bit

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
using this tends to melt it a little bit

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.130 
using this tends to melt it a little bit
this<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:46.369> if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
this is as you can see if you want to

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.580 
this is as you can see if you want to
cut<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.470> skill<00:01:50.250> saw<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> table<00:01:51.300> saw

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
cut it with a skill saw or a table saw

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.270 
cut it with a skill saw or a table saw
again<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:53.759> want<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.940> use<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.360> fine<00:01:55.280> toothed

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
again you want to use the fine toothed

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.280 
again you want to use the fine toothed
blade<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:02.149> when<00:02:03.149> you're<00:02:03.299> done<00:02:03.570> cutting<00:02:03.990> it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
blade and when you're done cutting it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.260 
blade and when you're done cutting it
you<00:02:04.590> usually<00:02:05.009> gonna<00:02:05.310> sand<00:02:05.759> usually<00:02:06.149> get<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you usually gonna sand usually get a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.590 
you usually gonna sand usually get a
burr<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.619> bottom<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.310> from<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.880> saw

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
burr on the bottom of it from the saw

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.630 
burr on the bottom of it from the saw
blade<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.200> through<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.519> can

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
blade going through and that you can

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.979 
blade going through and that you can
have<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.970> scrape<00:02:12.269> off<00:02:14.300> I'm<00:02:15.300> Robert<00:02:15.660> Markey<00:02:15.780> and

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
have to scrape off I'm Robert Markey and

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.819 
have to scrape off I'm Robert Markey and
we've<00:02:16.200> been<00:02:16.500> cutting<00:02:16.830> acrylic<00:02:17.130> plastic
