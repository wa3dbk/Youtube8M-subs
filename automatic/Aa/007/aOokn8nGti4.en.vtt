 Now I can't get the audience, so I'm going to go back to the washroom with the last glass 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:34.630
 Please replace this broken file with a new tab 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.750
 The handle is stuck like this in spring 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 Come in two stages in total handle the method of operation 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:46.769
 Lift this handle first 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:53.159
 As I mentioned earlier, I will tell you from here I will break this to the side of a hard, hard woman or 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:58.949
 Kedomo I might tough it Tteyuu is set to take off here with this base is 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:00.460

 5 set can be removed 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.860
 And 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.860
 New tall 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.990
 There are many piles here, so bring this barrel here 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:21.430
 In the empty plate 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 Would be new to the top so should I should say at this lower 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.440
 Please repeat 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.220
 In Remove this label 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.840
 It's just for convenience 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.100
 now 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.100
 I also do this in the rules 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.600
 If this skips a new eating label 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:47.510
 You can until 9:00 say this here, please be sure clean 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:49.430
 It's the part where the beer is in direct contact, so I will work in the opposite direction as soon as possible. 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.850
 Where I am addicted 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:58.740
 Look for a place to go up like this 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.770

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.290

 Then, when too Rachanto the handle 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:15.700
 This handle will be connected to this barrel 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:21.220
 The handle is attached to the handle for this purpose and the barrel of the gas is here 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:25.989
 Though I totally do not need Searle about this image quality gas pipe of the gas this 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:32.050
 You will go up to the beer school by putting gas pressure on the sauce 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.160
 When tightening with this gushing, this lever is in a state where it is facing straight and stopped 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.330
 After confirmation 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.569

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:48.099
 I always put a bucket like this when I just replaced it 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:54.329
 When I changed to a new meal, the air of a trip that had been cut before 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.329
 Since it becomes a state that has entered the tube first and disconnect the gas 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:06.569
 So you may put away a little to the audience and the bucket would a little away in the millet village 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.569
 I always have a bucket on top and I have a glass. 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:18.319
 Next to + 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:20.220

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.370
