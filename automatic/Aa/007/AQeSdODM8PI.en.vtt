00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
 hello fucking I introduce myself 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.280
 I am the great mario 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.320
 I made this account because in my original account I do not want to put the videos that 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.299
 I'll put in this one that will deal with videogames 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.579
 as you can see above me says the title of the video so it's 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.359
 we'll talk about the best games coming next year so wii that the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.269
 truth is that they will be the cock 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.789
 good let's start 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.769
 let's start with the conduit 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.599
 It is an exclusive first person shooting game for Wii 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.029
 it is known that it is about an invasion of shit aliens who want 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.260
 conquer the earth 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.910
 the game will not only use all the power of ui 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 it will also be compatible with many of the wii accessories like the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.770
 very spiritual a microphone that is put on top of the sensor and 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.770
 captures the sound of the whole room or the wii motionplus 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.690
 It is not yet well known what this but good will do 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.700
 It should be noted that the company that makes this game is first time and nothing 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.860
 famous but they managed to invent a graphic engine to be able to use all the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.730
 graphic power of ui this game promises many things since it 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.550
 ad 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.980
 the truth is that the game will be as big as my big hairy fleshy and 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.230
 judge cock both in graphics and in gameplay since it is based on 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.220
 metro and kinship games and medal of honor heroes 2 which 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.680
 were excellent will have countless options like the option 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.010
 to customize the sensitivity of the look something never seen before and by 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.950
 course the online multiplayer of up to 16 bastards 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.980
 the president of the company declared that it is a total shame 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.930
 that the other companies do not use all the power of ui properly 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.660
 For more information on the Wii charts, watch the video 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.030
 sergeant that gold 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.720
 honestly this wii is piqué they saw it invented from the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.510
 beginning 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.210
 but anyway 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.080
 It's good news and I hope they correct several errors that the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.930
 medal of honor like you do not know if you're giving the bastard when you 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.450
 they shoot and it causes you many problems 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.750
 the second is for all the consoles is nothing more and nothing less than a game 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.630
 new 0 0 7 of this one I have no information but please it's a game 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.920
 of 0 0 7 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.010
 it has to be good 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.859
 It had been a long time since they came out 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.069
 and finally another exclusive wii 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.149
 what is castlevania I played minds 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.669
 a game of cassette vanity of fights 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:16.959
 uu did not hear wrong 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.560
 a cassette vanity of fights that also looks very good because they will use 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.169
 legendary characters of castlevania 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.169
 so far only sa and mon belmont have been announced 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.819
 to death and a new clone that has just been invented called aeón 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.669
 I shit on your fucking mothers why they invent characters 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.499
 better keep putting characters from the saga 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.400
 just pray for characters like lion cross soma to appear 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.529
 hector amount 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.419
