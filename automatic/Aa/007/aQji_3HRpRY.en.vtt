the<00:00:00.329> only<00:00:00.539> thing<00:00:00.719> I<00:00:00.870> brought<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.560> the

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
the only thing I brought to the

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.300 
the only thing I brought to the
character<00:00:02.399> that<00:00:02.429> wasn't<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.449> script<00:00:03.570> was

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.310 
character that wasn't in the script was

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.920 
character that wasn't in the script was
just<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.430> appearance<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.270> character<00:00:06.720> I

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
just the appearance of the character I

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.629 
just the appearance of the character I
thought<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.919> myself<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.639> would<00:00:08.820> be<00:00:09.030> fun<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:10.639> to
