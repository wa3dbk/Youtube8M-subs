issue remember this is players edition

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.420 
issue remember this is players edition
so<00:00:45.820> this<00:00:45.969> is<00:00:46.090> one<00:00:46.270> up<00:00:46.390> from<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.629> 1000<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:48.280> it's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
so this is one up from the 1000 but it's

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.670 
so this is one up from the 1000 but it's
not<00:00:48.610> necessarily<00:00:49.329> a<00:00:49.480> perfect<00:00:50.230> looking<00:00:50.469> piece

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
not necessarily a perfect looking piece

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.100 
not necessarily a perfect looking piece
of<00:00:50.829> willow<00:00:51.010> what<00:00:51.610> this<00:00:51.879> willow<00:00:52.120> is<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.600> their

of willow what this willow is is their

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.680 
of willow what this willow is is their
best<00:00:53.800> performing<00:00:54.520> ruler<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.030> it's<00:00:55.539> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
best performing ruler and it's the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.600 
best performing ruler and it's the
willow<00:00:55.899> that<00:00:56.170> they<00:00:56.320> would<00:00:56.559> then<00:00:56.739> give<00:00:57.039> on<00:00:57.309> to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
willow that they would then give on to

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.740 
willow that they would then give on to
the<00:00:58.360> AV<00:00:58.899> de<00:00:59.020> Villiers<00:00:59.609> Ricky<00:01:00.609> Ponting's<00:01:01.090> stuff

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
the AV de Villiers Ricky Ponting's stuff

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.240 
the AV de Villiers Ricky Ponting's stuff
like<00:01:01.960> that<00:01:01.989> so<00:01:02.410> just<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.829> give<00:01:02.859> you<00:01:03.039> a<00:01:03.070> quick

like that so just to give you a quick

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.210 
like that so just to give you a quick
look<00:01:03.520> there's<00:01:04.000> nothing<00:01:04.300> to<00:01:04.449> huge<00:01:04.780> about<00:01:05.020> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
look there's nothing to huge about it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.200 
look there's nothing to huge about it
I'd<00:01:06.220> say<00:01:06.280> these<00:01:06.670> edge<00:01:06.880> sizes<00:01:07.360> are<00:01:07.479> about<00:01:08.550> 30<00:01:09.550> 35

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
I'd say these edge sizes are about 30 35

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.559 
I'd say these edge sizes are about 30 35
to<00:01:10.660> 37<00:01:11.110> million<00:01:11.410> inner<00:01:11.590> edges<00:01:12.360> over<00:01:13.360> all<00:01:13.450> the

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
to 37 million inner edges over all the

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.859 
to 37 million inner edges over all the
finishes<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.319> phenomenal<00:01:15.130> very<00:01:15.369> good<00:01:15.550> finish

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
finishes is phenomenal very good finish

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.919 
finishes is phenomenal very good finish
and<00:01:16.869> just<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.410> slight<00:01:17.830> curve<00:01:18.190> on<00:01:18.459> the<00:01:18.580> bat<00:01:18.929> the

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
and just the slight curve on the bat the

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.440 
and just the slight curve on the bat the
one<00:01:20.080> issue<00:01:20.229> I<00:01:20.410> wouldn't<00:01:20.709> have<00:01:20.800> with<00:01:20.979> us<00:01:21.130> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
one issue I wouldn't have with us is

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.100 
one issue I wouldn't have with us is
that<00:01:22.450> its<00:01:22.660> exact<00:01:23.200> same<00:01:23.530> shape<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:25.209> 1000

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
that its exact same shape of the 1000

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
that its exact same shape of the 1000
now<00:01:26.770> we<00:01:26.830> know<00:01:27.190> that<00:01:27.220> very<00:01:27.849> seldom<00:01:28.330> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
now we know that very seldom the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.080 
now we know that very seldom the
professionals<00:01:30.130> actually<00:01:30.490> use<00:01:30.729> off-the-shelf

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
professionals actually use off-the-shelf

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.109 
professionals actually use off-the-shelf
bats<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.410> would<00:01:32.740> think<00:01:33.039> for<00:01:33.520> example<00:01:33.640> like

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
bats so I would think for example like

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.910 
bats so I would think for example like
God<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.509> more<00:01:34.690> have<00:01:34.810> done<00:01:34.990> they've<00:01:35.649> got<00:01:35.890> a

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
God and more have done they've got a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.339 
God and more have done they've got a
player<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.490> player<00:01:36.819> edition<00:01:37.149> bat<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.750> is<00:01:37.899> the

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
player to player edition bat that is the

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.949 
player to player edition bat that is the
exact<00:01:38.739> same<00:01:38.979> shape<00:01:39.039> of<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:40.060> player<00:01:40.420> who<00:01:40.660> uses

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
exact same shape of the player who uses

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.190 
exact same shape of the player who uses
it<00:01:41.110> whereas<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.160> gun<00:01:42.849> and<00:01:42.970> more<00:01:43.200> original

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
it whereas the gun and more original

it whereas the gun and more original
icon<00:01:44.770> le<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:47.140> example<00:01:47.229> or<00:01:47.709> let's<00:01:47.890> use<00:01:48.099> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
icon le is for example or let's use the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.790 
icon le is for example or let's use the
epic<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:48.729> an<00:01:49.090> example<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.989> gonna<00:01:50.200> more<00:01:50.440> epic

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
is quite a bit better but I would say

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.480 
is quite a bit better but I would say
that<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.470> certainly<00:02:41.830> an<00:02:41.950> upgrade<00:02:42.370> from

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.200 
that this is certainly an upgrade from
the<00:02:42.640> 1000m<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:45.040> maybe<00:02:45.310> even<00:02:45.760> though<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.000> am

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
the 1000m but maybe even though I am

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.550 
the 1000m but maybe even though I am
knocking<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.600> same<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:46.990> customer<00:02:47.170> I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
knocking the same for this customer I

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.220 
knocking the same for this customer I
maybe<00:02:48.130> do<00:02:48.430> need<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.780> spin<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> little<00:02:49.870> bit<00:02:50.110> more

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
maybe do need to spin a little bit more
