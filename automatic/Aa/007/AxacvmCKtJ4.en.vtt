warrior<00:00:07.950> control<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:09.480> first<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.170> thought<00:00:10.469> that

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
warrior control at first I thought that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.610 
warrior control at first I thought that
the<00:00:11.630> warrior<00:00:12.630> control<00:00:12.960> would<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> really

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the warrior control would be a really

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.620 
the warrior control would be a really
hard<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> tough<00:00:14.460> matchup<00:00:15.000> because<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.480> loud

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
hard and tough matchup because the loud

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.359 
hard and tough matchup because the loud
and<00:00:15.660> play<00:00:15.929> harrison<00:00:16.440> jones<00:00:16.650> they<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.190> gain<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
and play harrison jones they can gain a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.890 
and play harrison jones they can gain a
lot<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.670> armor<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.570> range<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.810> your

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
lot of armor get out of range of your

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.250 
lot of armor get out of range of your
combos<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.789> in<00:00:20.789> theory<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.750> still<00:00:21.960> sounds

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
combos but in theory it still sounds

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.540 
combos but in theory it still sounds
like<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.470> should<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.769> bad<00:00:22.980> matchup<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.460> I've

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
like it should be a bad matchup but I've

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.890 
like it should be a bad matchup but I've
actually<00:00:23.789> found<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> positive

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
actually found that I have a positive

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.339 
actually found that I have a positive
win<00:00:25.439> rate<00:00:25.680> against<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:27.119> control<00:00:27.930> warrior<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
win rate against a control warrior and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.950 
win rate against a control warrior and
I've<00:00:28.439> played<00:00:28.650> probably<00:00:29.119> about<00:00:30.119> 10<00:00:30.539> games<00:00:30.779> or

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
I've played probably about 10 games or

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
I've played probably about 10 games or
so<00:00:31.080> against<00:00:31.439> i<00:00:31.470> might<00:00:31.619> say<00:00:31.800> i<00:00:31.830> won<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.610> don't

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
so against i might say i won I don't

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.470 
so against i might say i won I don't
know<00:00:33.030> around<00:00:33.750> seven<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.149> might

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
know around seven and I think it might

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.530 
know around seven and I think it might
hinder<00:00:37.260> mainly<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> fact<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:39.329> are

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
hinder mainly on the fact that they are

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.660 
hinder mainly on the fact that they are
playing<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.440> are<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.399> warrior

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
playing as if you are also a warrior

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.510 
playing as if you are also a warrior
control<00:00:42.180> deck<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.219> kill<00:00:44.430> them

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
control deck and then you just kill them

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.799 
control deck and then you just kill them
out<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> nowhere<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.539> plays

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
out of nowhere because they make plays

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.380 
out of nowhere because they make plays
that<00:00:46.079> maybe<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.820> normally<00:00:48.180> wouldn't

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that maybe they they normally wouldn't

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
that maybe they they normally wouldn't
have<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.739> knew<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:49.950> kind<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> deck<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
have if they knew what kind of deck you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610 
have if they knew what kind of deck you
actually<00:00:50.879> were<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.899> he<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> armor<00:00:52.410> Smith

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
actually were so he is the armor Smith

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
actually were so he is the armor Smith
which<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.070> annoying<00:00:53.340> because<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> one

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
which is really annoying because the one

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.299 
which is really annoying because the one
thing<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> prevent<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.980> him

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
thing that we do want to prevent is him

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.750 
thing that we do want to prevent is him
stacking<00:00:56.850> armor<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.100> cry<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.489> act<00:00:59.640> like

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
stacking armor and I cry not to act like

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
stacking armor and I cry not to act like
obviously<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.809> he<00:01:00.899> has<00:01:00.989> fiery<00:01:01.230> war<00:01:01.590> axe<00:01:01.620> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
obviously if he has fiery war axe it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
obviously if he has fiery war axe it
sucks<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:02.850> he<00:01:02.940> doesn't<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.270> fiery<00:01:03.510> war

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
sucks but if he doesn't have fiery war

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.679 
sucks but if he doesn't have fiery war
axe<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> few<00:01:06.270> cards<00:01:06.570> off

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
axe then I get to get a few cards off

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.000 
axe then I get to get a few cards off
his<00:01:06.840> acolyte<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
his acolyte and I just want to get the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
his acolyte and I just want to get the
ball<00:01:08.130> rolling<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.729> honestly<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.530> he<00:01:10.530> does

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
ball rolling here honestly and he does

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.530 
ball rolling here honestly and he does
fre<00:01:11.040> work<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.150> sucks<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.479> me<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:14.540> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
fre work so that sucks for me but it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.179 
fre work so that sucks for me but it
prevents<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:15.960> from<00:01:15.990> armoring<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.680> turn<00:01:16.890> so

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
prevents them from armoring up a turn so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.560 
prevents them from armoring up a turn so
I<00:01:17.220> guess<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.790> guess<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.390> thing

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
I guess that's I guess that's one thing

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.040 
I guess that's I guess that's one thing
to<00:01:18.720> look<00:01:18.840> forward<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.960 

picked<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.770> another<00:01:23.010> armorsmith<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.760> don't

picked up another armorsmith I don't

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.040 
picked up another armorsmith I don't
know<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.120> I<00:01:24.180> quite<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.510> to<00:01:24.570> play<00:01:24.690> armorsmith

know if I quite want to play armorsmith

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.340 
know if I quite want to play armorsmith
because<00:01:25.850> he<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.180> kill<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> the

but<00:03:15.840> maybe<00:03:16.380> not<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.790> luckily<00:03:18.660> instead<00:03:19.050> of

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
but maybe not so it luckily instead of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.960 
but maybe not so it luckily instead of
Harrison<00:03:19.440> he<00:03:19.500> has<00:03:19.620> faceless<00:03:20.100> which<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.670> don't

Harrison he has faceless which I don't

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.190 
Harrison he has faceless which I don't
know<00:03:21.030> how<00:03:21.150> lucky<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.480> actually<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:21.989> because

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
know how lucky that actually is because

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.080 
know how lucky that actually is because
now<00:03:22.350> there's<00:03:22.560> two<00:03:22.830> cans<00:03:23.100> I'm<00:03:23.310> definitely<00:03:23.760> not

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
now there's two cans I'm definitely not

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.790 
now there's two cans I'm definitely not
dealing<00:03:24.450> with<00:03:24.570> both<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.750> these<00:03:25.019> essentially

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
dealing with both of these essentially

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.840 
dealing with both of these essentially
making<00:03:26.100> brawl<00:03:26.630> completely<00:03:27.630> useless<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.980> can't

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
making brawl completely useless I can't

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.670 
making brawl completely useless I can't
and<00:03:30.150> like<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.600> could<00:03:30.840> start<00:03:31.080> attacking<00:03:31.380> them

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
and like I could start attacking them

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.840 
and like I could start attacking them
with<00:03:31.710> my<00:03:31.920> weapon

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
with my weapon

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.260 
with my weapon
at<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.780> point<00:03:34.020> my<00:03:34.170> plan<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:34.680> ignoring

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
at this point my plan is just ignoring

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.570 
at this point my plan is just ignoring
hit<00:03:36.270> him<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.510> face<00:03:36.830> pick<00:03:37.830> up<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.040> charge<00:03:38.340> and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
hit him in the face pick up a charge and

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.760 
hit him in the face pick up a charge and
just<00:03:38.730> go<00:03:38.850> for<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> kill<00:03:39.350> sludge<00:03:40.350> belcher

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
just go for the kill sludge belcher

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.180 
just go for the kill sludge belcher
would<00:03:40.920> be<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.340> big<00:03:41.880> problem<00:03:42.060> here<00:03:42.720> as<00:03:42.870> well<00:03:43.190> as

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
would be a big problem here as well as

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.350 
would be a big problem here as well as
sludge<00:03:44.400> belcher<00:03:44.730> he<00:03:44.820> can't<00:03:45.060> ignore<00:03:47.150> which<00:03:48.150> may

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
sludge belcher he can't ignore which may

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.150 
sludge belcher he can't ignore which may
be<00:03:48.390> may<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:48.720> playing<00:03:49.080> one<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.530> iron<00:03:49.830> beguile

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
be may be playing one like iron beguile

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.590 
be may be playing one like iron beguile
wouldn't<00:03:50.520> be<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.700> worst<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.210> deck<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:51.540> I

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
wouldn't be the worst in this deck but I

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.949 
wouldn't be the worst in this deck but I
haven't<00:03:51.870> found<00:03:51.990> that<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.230> really<00:03:52.260> need<00:03:52.680> it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.030 

so<00:04:01.959> let's<00:04:02.260> just<00:04:02.410> wait<00:04:02.560> here<00:04:02.739> if<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:02.860> play

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
so let's just wait here if you play

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.740 
so let's just wait here if you play
something<00:04:03.250> like<00:04:03.370> ragnaros<00:04:04.030> right<00:04:04.270> now<00:04:04.450> that

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
something like ragnaros right now that

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.580 
something like ragnaros right now that
would<00:04:04.870> be<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:06.670> could<00:04:06.790> be<00:04:06.849> pretty<00:04:07.000> annoying

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
would be that could be pretty annoying

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.430 
would be that could be pretty annoying
so<00:04:08.700> he<00:04:09.700> basically<00:04:09.880> has<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.420> nightmare<00:04:11.110> board

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
so he basically has the nightmare board

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.050 
so he basically has the nightmare board
of<00:04:11.910> karen<00:04:12.910> kam<00:04:13.739> sludge<00:04:14.739> belcher<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.370> at<00:04:16.000> this

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
of karen kam sludge belcher and at this

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.060 
of karen kam sludge belcher and at this
point<00:04:16.269> i<00:04:16.450> almost<00:04:16.750> feel<00:04:16.870> like<00:04:16.930> conceding<00:04:17.440> but<00:04:18.040> I

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
point i almost feel like conceding but I

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.370 
point i almost feel like conceding but I
figure<00:04:18.519> maybe<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.180> can<00:04:19.329> get<00:04:19.389> a<00:04:19.450> lucky<00:04:19.780> bra<00:04:20.019> like

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
figure maybe I can get a lucky bra like

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.820 
figure maybe I can get a lucky bra like
an<00:04:20.500> execute<00:04:21.010> something<00:04:21.340> pick<00:04:21.850> up<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.150> charge

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
an execute something pick up the charge

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.110 
an execute something pick up the charge
so<00:04:23.830> here<00:04:24.040> I'm<00:04:24.130> gonna<00:04:24.280> say<00:04:24.400> yep<00:04:24.610> let's<00:04:24.880> see<00:04:25.000> what

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
so here I'm gonna say yep let's see what

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.909 
so here I'm gonna say yep let's see what
happens<00:04:25.360> with<00:04:25.419> brawl<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.080> i<00:04:26.139> don't<00:04:26.380> know<00:04:26.470> i

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
happens with brawl and i don't know i

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.230 
happens with brawl and i don't know i
think<00:04:27.010> i<00:04:27.250> might<00:04:27.340> in<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:27.639> plate<00:04:27.880> i<00:04:27.910> didn't

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
think i might in this plate i didn't

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.280 
think i might in this plate i didn't
really<00:04:28.330> think<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.630> through<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:29.080> maybe

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
really think it through but maybe

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.620 
really think it through but maybe
executing<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.280> cairn<00:04:30.580> before<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.120> brawl<00:04:31.330> was

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
executing the cairn before the brawl was

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.490 
executing the cairn before the brawl was
was<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.110> best<00:04:32.260> way<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.500> go<00:04:32.620> about<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:34.500> because

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
was the best way to go about it because

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.080 
was the best way to go about it because
then<00:04:35.650> i<00:04:35.710> end<00:04:35.889> up<00:04:35.979> like<00:04:36.190> executing<00:04:36.790> both<00:04:36.940> of

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
then i end up like executing both of

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.360 
then i end up like executing both of
them<00:04:37.210> anyways<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:38.229> I<00:04:38.260> think<00:04:38.680> yeah<00:04:38.889> i<00:04:38.919> think<00:04:39.100> i

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
them anyways so I think yeah i think i

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.650 
them anyways so I think yeah i think i
miss<00:04:39.610> played<00:04:39.850> i<00:04:39.880> just<00:04:40.180> played<00:04:40.389> it<00:04:40.540> a<00:04:40.570> little

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
miss played i just played it a little

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.600 
miss played i just played it a little
bit<00:04:40.840> too<00:04:40.990> quick<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.620> like<00:04:42.160> i<00:04:42.250> said<00:04:42.310> at<00:04:42.550> this

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
bit too quick and like i said at this

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.890 
bit too quick and like i said at this
point<00:04:42.729> I'm<00:04:42.970> kind<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.180> thing<00:04:43.389> I'm<00:04:43.540> kind<00:04:43.780> of

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
point I'm kind of thing I'm kind of

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.170 
point I'm kind of thing I'm kind of
giving<00:04:44.260> up<00:04:44.410> I'm<00:04:44.620> like<00:04:44.830> there's<00:04:45.790> no<00:04:45.910> I'm<00:04:46.030> going

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
giving up I'm like there's no I'm going

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.090 
giving up I'm like there's no I'm going
to<00:04:46.240> win<00:04:46.389> this<00:04:46.510> match<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:47.110> who<00:04:47.380> knows<00:04:47.590> maybe<00:04:47.950> I

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
to win this match but who knows maybe I

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.850 
to win this match but who knows maybe I
pick<00:04:48.310> up<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.520> charge<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.229> and<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.290> can<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.680> could

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
pick up the charge and and I can I could

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.280 
pick up the charge and and I can I could
squeeze<00:04:51.010> in<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.280> damage<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:52.150> think<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.110> think

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
squeeze in the damage so I think I think

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.920 
squeeze in the damage so I think I think
that<00:04:53.380> was<00:04:53.470> a<00:04:53.530> Miss<00:04:53.680> play<00:04:53.889> but<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:55.720> brawl

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
that was a Miss play but the brawl

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.590 
that was a Miss play but the brawl
either<00:04:56.229> way<00:04:56.590> in<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.370> end<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.669> brawl<00:04:57.880> works

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
either way in the end the brawl works

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.080 
either way in the end the brawl works
out<00:04:58.919> okay<00:04:59.919> i<00:04:59.950> guess<00:05:00.310> i<00:05:00.460> got<00:05:00.610> rid<00:05:00.729> of<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:00.880> sludge

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
out okay i guess i got rid of the sludge

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.580 
out okay i guess i got rid of the sludge
Belcher<00:05:02.310> i<00:05:03.930> have<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.960> legitimate<00:05:05.320> way<00:05:05.560> to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
Belcher i have a legitimate way to

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.740 
Belcher i have a legitimate way to
actually<00:05:05.979> kill<00:05:06.250> him<00:05:06.430> he<00:05:07.030> plays<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.240> sarah<00:05:07.600> which

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
actually kill him he plays a sarah which

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.659 
actually kill him he plays a sarah which
I'm<00:05:07.870> actually<00:05:08.169> very<00:05:08.410> happy<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.130> see<00:05:09.160> believe

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
I'm actually very happy to see believe

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.190 
I'm actually very happy to see believe
it<00:05:09.789> or<00:05:09.880> not<00:05:09.970> because<00:05:10.150> that's<00:05:10.419> one<00:05:10.780> more<00:05:10.960> turn

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
it or not because that's one more turn

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.090 
it or not because that's one more turn
that<00:05:11.500> he<00:05:12.130> prevents<00:05:13.050> armoring<00:05:14.050> up<00:05:14.140> and<00:05:14.380> this

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
that he prevents armoring up and this

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.680 
that he prevents armoring up and this
again<00:05:15.820> this<00:05:15.940> is<00:05:16.090> kind<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.240> what<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.390> was<00:05:16.479> talking

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
again this is kind of what I was talking

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.960 
again this is kind of what I was talking
about<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.320> think<00:05:17.919> that<00:05:18.070> if<00:05:18.130> he<00:05:18.310> knew<00:05:18.550> my<00:05:18.700> deck

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
about I think that if he knew my deck

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.850 
about I think that if he knew my deck
maybe<00:05:19.360> maybe<00:05:19.960> he<00:05:20.169> wouldn't<00:05:20.380> even<00:05:20.500> want<00:05:20.770> to

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
maybe maybe he wouldn't even want to

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.350 
maybe maybe he wouldn't even want to
play<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.070> Sarah<00:05:21.460> right<00:05:21.760> now<00:05:21.970> because<00:05:24.360> he

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
play you Sarah right now because he

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.820 
play you Sarah right now because he
maybe<00:05:25.630> he<00:05:25.810> would<00:05:25.900> want<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.139> shield<00:05:26.380> block<00:05:26.650> or

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
maybe he would want to shield block or

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.170 
maybe he would want to shield block or
maybe<00:05:26.979> he<00:05:27.130> would<00:05:27.250> want<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.400> armor<00:05:27.700> up<00:05:27.789> instead

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
maybe he would want to armor up instead

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.690 
maybe he would want to armor up instead
like<00:05:28.389> I<00:05:28.510> don't<00:05:28.570> know<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.340> slammed<00:05:30.639> the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
like I don't know so I slammed the

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.920 
like I don't know so I slammed the
USERRA<00:05:31.090> which<00:05:31.600> was<00:05:32.139> probably<00:05:32.350> wrong<00:05:32.800> because

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
USERRA which was probably wrong because

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.480 
USERRA which was probably wrong because
I'm<00:05:34.930> I've<00:05:35.289> already<00:05:35.440> used<00:05:35.590> both<00:05:35.889> my<00:05:36.039> execute

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
I'm I've already used both my execute

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.240 
I'm I've already used both my execute
and<00:05:36.729> if<00:05:36.880> I<00:05:36.970> shield<00:05:37.300> if<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:38.110> slammed<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.680> Karen

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
and if I shield if I slammed the Karen

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.250 
and if I shield if I slammed the Karen
then<00:05:39.910> that<00:05:40.210> means<00:05:40.330> I<00:05:40.510> could<00:05:40.690> use<00:05:40.900> a<00:05:40.930> shield

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
then that means I could use a shield

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.080 
then that means I could use a shield
slam<00:05:41.470> on<00:05:41.650> it<00:05:41.800> but<00:05:41.979> instead<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.490> actually<00:05:42.729> opted

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
slam on it but instead I actually opted

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.600 
slam on it but instead I actually opted
to<00:05:43.240> shield<00:05:43.510> slam<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:44.590> foods<00:05:45.130> because<00:05:45.460> I'd

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
to shield slam the foods because I'd

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.000 
to shield slam the foods because I'd
rather<00:05:45.850> not<00:05:46.720> have<00:05:47.020> to<00:05:47.050> use<00:05:47.229> my<00:05:47.380> weapon<00:05:47.590> to<00:05:47.830> kill

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
rather not have to use my weapon to kill

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.170 
rather not have to use my weapon to kill
it<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:49.950> here<00:05:50.950> again<00:05:51.100> another<00:05:51.460> sludge<00:05:51.789> belcher

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
it and here again another sludge belcher

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.969 
it and here again another sludge belcher
would<00:05:52.389> pretty<00:05:52.630> much<00:05:52.720> be<00:05:52.840> game<00:05:53.289> at<00:05:53.680> this<00:05:53.889> point

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
would pretty much be game at this point

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.850 
would pretty much be game at this point
but<00:05:54.490> if<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.850> pick<00:05:55.030> up<00:05:55.150> a<00:05:55.240> charge<00:05:55.570> that's<00:05:56.440> six

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.379 
but if I pick up a charge that's six
seven<00:05:57.190> eight<00:05:57.250> nine<00:05:57.340> ten<00:05:57.490> if<00:05:57.940> I<00:05:58.000> pick<00:05:58.180> up<00:05:58.300> a
