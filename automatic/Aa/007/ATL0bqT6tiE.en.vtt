00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
still like to see him under pressure

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.860 
still like to see him under pressure
still<00:00:51.780> being<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:53.039> rock<00:00:53.730> solid<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.329> he<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
still being as rock solid as he is and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.600 
still being as rock solid as he is and
not<00:00:55.680> sure<00:00:55.860> about<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.160> pressured<00:00:56.489> environment

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
not sure about the pressured environment

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.029 
not sure about the pressured environment
yet<00:00:57.440> because<00:00:59.000> he<00:01:00.000> hasn't<00:01:00.300> had<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.920> up

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
yet because he hasn't had the is not up

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799

against<00:01:02.460> Fernando<00:01:02.850> Alonso<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> teammate

against Fernando Alonso as a teammate

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.310 
against Fernando Alonso as a teammate
and<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.769> would<00:01:05.580> tend<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.909> show<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.659> things<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and that would tend to show up things so

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
and that would tend to show up things so
I<00:01:07.380> think<00:01:07.470> still<00:01:08.310> another<00:01:09.119> year<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
I think still another year or so of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
I think still another year or so of
development<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> go<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:11.369> there's<00:01:11.580> still

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
development to go there there's still

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.450 
development to go there there's still
some<00:01:12.390> question<00:01:12.960> marks<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.189> very

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
some question marks I think but very

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.969 
some question marks I think but very
very<00:01:14.670> fast<00:01:14.820> driver<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.590> through<00:01:16.890> in

had<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.330> miss<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> race<00:02:12.810> probably<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.920> means

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
had to miss a race probably it means

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.410 
had to miss a race probably it means
you'll<00:02:14.190> Bianchi<00:02:14.550> they<00:02:14.700> would<00:02:14.849> put<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.209> car

everything<00:02:15.900> maybe<00:02:16.290> Pedro<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.250> think<00:02:17.910> they

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
everything maybe Pedro but I think they

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.750 
everything maybe Pedro but I think they
might<00:02:18.180> give<00:02:18.360> give<00:02:18.720> me<00:02:18.750> hanky<00:02:19.110> around<00:02:19.220> they<00:02:20.220> yes

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
might give give me hanky around they yes

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.460 
might give give me hanky around they yes

immediately<00:05:09.460> yeah<00:05:09.849> but<00:05:10.030> Eddie<00:05:10.180> Cheever<00:05:10.539> being

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
immediately yeah but Eddie Cheever being

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.390 
immediately yeah but Eddie Cheever being
a<00:05:10.960> bit<00:05:11.080> like<00:05:11.229> that<00:05:11.349> when<00:05:11.500> he<00:05:11.590> was<00:05:11.740> 18<00:05:12.039> years<00:05:12.099> old

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
a bit like that when he was 18 years old

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.909 
a bit like that when he was 18 years old
and<00:05:12.659> but<00:05:13.659> I'm<00:05:13.810> not<00:05:13.930> sure<00:05:13.960> actually<00:05:14.380> went<00:05:14.740> any

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
and but I'm not sure actually went any

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.969 
and but I'm not sure actually went any
faster<00:05:15.750> after<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.870> make<00:05:17.110> under<00:05:17.409> faster<00:05:17.740> cars

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
faster after that make under faster cars

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.909 
faster after that make under faster cars
and<00:05:18.849> some<00:05:19.449> cars<00:05:19.750> call<00:05:19.930> Formula<00:05:20.289> One's<00:05:20.440> but

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
and some cars call Formula One's but

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.760 
and some cars call Formula One's but
whether<00:05:21.099> he<00:05:21.250> was<00:05:21.430> any<00:05:21.610> faster<00:05:22.120> QV<00:05:23.020> app<00:05:23.139> has<00:05:23.620> to

whether he was any faster QV app has to

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.529 
whether he was any faster QV app has to

get to be as let's face it it's a tough

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.760 
get to be as let's face it it's a tough
thing<00:05:36.630> growing<00:05:37.630> with<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.050> team<00:05:38.259> that's<00:05:38.440> also

these guys came in because that never
happened<00:06:28.569> but<00:06:28.690> it<00:06:28.779> took<00:06:28.930> nine<00:06:29.229> months<00:06:29.259> not<00:06:29.919> to

happened but it took nine months not to

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.950 
happened but it took nine months not to
happen<00:06:30.520> and<00:06:31.029> by<00:06:31.120> then<00:06:31.270> it<00:06:31.360> was<00:06:31.419> too<00:06:31.479> late<00:06:31.630> and

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
happen and by then it was too late and

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.060 
happen and by then it was too late and
they<00:06:32.050> were<00:06:32.110> informal<00:06:32.529> one<00:06:32.710> and<00:06:32.830> they<00:06:32.889> had<00:06:32.979> to

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
they were informal one and they had to

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.200 
they were informal one and they had to
sort<00:06:33.219> of<00:06:33.310> fudge<00:06:33.520> it<00:06:33.669> through<00:06:33.820> and<00:06:33.969> make<00:06:34.089> it

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
sort of fudge it through and make it

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.910 
sort of fudge it through and make it
happen<00:06:34.479> so<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:35.050> organic<00:06:35.529> growth

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
happen so the organic growth

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.470 
happen so the organic growth
of<00:06:35.980> the<00:06:36.100> team<00:06:36.310> from<00:06:36.520> day<00:06:36.730> one<00:06:36.940> was<00:06:37.210> always

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
wrong it was never Frank Williams let's

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.670 
wrong it was never Frank Williams let's
run<00:06:39.940> one<00:06:40.150> car<00:06:40.450> in<00:06:40.480> eight<00:06:40.810> races<00:06:41.290> and<00:06:41.530> that's

run one car in eight races and that's

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.170 
run one car in eight races and that's
progress<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:42.190> two<00:06:42.340> cars<00:06:42.640> and<00:06:42.820> let's<00:06:42.970> do<00:06:43.090> the
