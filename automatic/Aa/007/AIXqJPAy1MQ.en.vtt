00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
so we're down in the basement these

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.050

built-ins<00:00:02.040> that<00:00:02.250> we're<00:00:02.399> looking<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:02.850> were

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
built-ins that we're looking at were

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.440 
built-ins that we're looking at were
previously<00:00:04.160> the<00:00:05.160> television<00:00:05.940> area<00:00:06.180> for<00:00:06.420> the

too small for any large TV I might have

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
too small for any large TV I might have
but<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:11.849> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> good<00:00:12.420> size<00:00:12.690> for<00:00:13.019> a

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
but it's going to be a good size for a

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.240 
but it's going to be a good size for a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
time capsule over there there's also

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.200 
time capsule over there there's also
more<00:00:26.130> speaker<00:00:26.519> wire<00:00:26.670> because<00:00:27.029> it's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
more speaker wire because it's

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.870 
more speaker wire because it's

want to show you is the utility space
where<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.469> craziness<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> pink

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
where the craziness is up here this pink

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920 
where the craziness is up here this pink
wire<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> cable<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.570> enters

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
wire right here is the cable that enters

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.779 
wire right here is the cable that enters
the<00:01:01.140> house<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.770> least<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.129> bottom<00:01:02.430> two<00:01:02.579> floors

not<00:01:42.000> connected<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.170> anything<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:44.850> going

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
not connected to anything so I'm going

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.749 
not connected to anything so I'm going
to<00:01:45.030> clean<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.310> thinking

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
to clean that up and what I was thinking

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.950 
to clean that up and what I was thinking
for<00:01:48.119> moving<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.579> cable<00:01:51.149> box<00:01:51.299> too<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
for moving you know the cable box too is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.749 
for moving you know the cable box too is
this<00:01:52.439> piece<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.829> wall<00:01:52.979> right<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.579> would

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
this piece of wall right here this would

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.310 
this piece of wall right here this would
be<00:01:53.880> perfect<00:01:54.119> whether<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.750> verizon<00:01:55.229> or

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
be perfect whether it's verizon or

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.980 
be perfect whether it's verizon or
somebody<00:01:55.649> else<00:01:55.909> if<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.210> verizon<00:01:57.659> we've<00:01:57.780> got

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
somebody else if it is verizon we've got

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.709 
somebody else if it is verizon we've got
power<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.740> corner<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.570> right<00:02:00.570> up

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
power down in that corner and right up
