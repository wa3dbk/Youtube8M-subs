nodes<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:57.059> found<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> best<00:00:58.050> XP

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
nodes and I found this to be the best XP

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.709 
nodes and I found this to be the best XP
on<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> lot<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> people<00:00:59.460> disagree<00:00:59.910> saying<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
on a lot of people disagree saying that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.680 
on a lot of people disagree saying that
staying<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.920> island<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.550> deciding<00:01:03.149> for

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
staying at one island and deciding for

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.590 
staying at one island and deciding for
constant<00:01:04.199> XP<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:05.100> better<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> long

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
constant XP is better but in the long

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.020 
constant XP is better but in the long
run<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.960> actually<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.619> EndNote<00:01:08.130> funding<00:01:08.490> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
run it's actually not EndNote funding is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.929 
run it's actually not EndNote funding is
a<00:01:09.150> lot<00:01:09.360> better<00:01:09.830> those<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> lot<00:01:11.369> more<00:01:11.520> XP

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
a lot better those we have a lot more XP

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.450 
a lot better those we have a lot more XP
than<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.869> regular<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.560> s<00:01:13.770> race<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.250> whatever

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
than the regular like s race or whatever

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.940 
than the regular like s race or whatever
so<00:01:15.420> yeah<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.990> found<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.710> lot

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
so yeah I just found this to be a lot

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.260 
so yeah I just found this to be a lot
better<00:01:16.979> method<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.000> faster<00:01:18.750> XP

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
better method and faster XP

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.310 
better method and faster XP
before<00:01:21.270> doing<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.110> want

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
before doing this you're going to want

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.510 
before doing this you're going to want
to<00:01:22.440> stock<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.800> on<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:24.150> s<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.280> pretty<00:01:26.280> much<00:01:26.310> how

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
to stock up on the s and pretty much how

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.180 
to stock up on the s and pretty much how
you<00:01:26.550> get<00:01:26.760> s<00:01:27.260> essence<00:01:28.260> or<00:01:28.410> whatever<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
you get s essence or whatever is you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.300 
you get s essence or whatever is you
have<00:01:29.370> to<00:01:29.550> siphon<00:01:30.380> estrace<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> while<00:01:31.860> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
have to siphon estrace for a while so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.969 
have to siphon estrace for a while so
what<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.120> usually<00:01:33.420> did<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.870> just<00:01:34.050> some<00:01:34.260> siphon

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
what I usually did was just some siphon

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.500 
what I usually did was just some siphon
the<00:01:35.010> x-ray<00:01:35.430> still<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.729> got<00:01:35.760> like<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.300> know<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
the x-ray still I got like you know a

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.530 
the x-ray still I got like you know a
good<00:01:36.810> amount<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.170> s<00:01:37.460> essence<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.580> whatever<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
good amount of s essence or whatever and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
good amount of s essence or whatever and
then<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> would<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.740> around<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:41.280> note

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
then I would just go around on note

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.050 
then I would just go around on note
hunting<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.440> they<00:01:43.440> are<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> few<00:01:44.010> French<00:01:44.850> test

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
hunting and they are a few French test

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
hunting and they are a few French test
you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.330> join<00:01:45.510> stay<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.680> through<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.310> no

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
you can join stay on through like no

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.030 
you can join stay on through like no
calls<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:49.050> pretty<00:01:49.500> much<00:01:49.590> called<00:01:49.920> out

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
calls so they pretty much called out

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280 
calls so they pretty much called out
