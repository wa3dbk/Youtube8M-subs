00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
found that a safety pin works the best

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.780

just<00:01:56.369> slip<00:01:56.579> your<00:01:56.610> safety<00:01:57.299> pin<00:01:57.540> through<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
just slip your safety pin through the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.160 
just slip your safety pin through the
last<00:01:58.920> loop<00:02:01.219> from<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.250> chain<00:02:02.840> close<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.049> up

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and then tighten it down and that'll

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.309 
and then tighten it down and that'll
just<00:02:07.110> keep<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> chain<00:02:07.950> from<00:02:08.250> unraveling

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.809
