page<00:02:39.460> I<00:02:39.850> have<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.780> random<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.470> thingy<00:02:41.740> which

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
page I have this random a thingy which

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.910 
page I have this random a thingy which
is<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:43.570> thing<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:44.050> Sigma<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.560> guess<00:02:44.770> it's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
is the this thing is Sigma I guess it's

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.470 
is the this thing is Sigma I guess it's
probably<00:02:45.100> programmed<00:02:45.820> by<00:02:45.970> Sigma<00:02:46.390> it's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
probably programmed by Sigma it's

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.820 
probably programmed by Sigma it's
basically<00:02:46.840> how<00:02:46.960> it<00:02:47.200> tracks<00:02:47.440> down<00:02:47.620> how<00:02:47.770> many

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
basically how it tracks down how many

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.410 
basically how it tracks down how many
times<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.400> walk<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.760> what<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.030> do<00:02:49.210> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
times you walk and what you do the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.770 
times you walk and what you do the
exercises<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:51.190> next<00:02:51.460> thing<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.390> stuff

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
exercises the next thing is this stuff

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.390 
exercises the next thing is this stuff
um<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.410> don't<00:02:53.590> know<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.250> guess

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
um I don't know what this is I guess

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.160 
um I don't know what this is I guess
this<00:02:54.520> has<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.760> do<00:02:54.850> with<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.090> s-pen<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:55.960> thing

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
this has to do with the s-pen this thing
