00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:10.179
 you know the regression team guajaca 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:12.700
 Ricardo because at the airport 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.049
 talk to us, obviously you can not 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.360
 say that he fears satisfied with the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.260
 result but there is possibility of 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.940
 come back is this disadvantage ricardo and 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.330
 it's possible 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.870
 the team works the game that you 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.990
 we wait 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.240
 if we are what we regularly went 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.700
 during the tournament 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:41.510
 the difference that we have against is 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.400
 an accessible difference if we work and 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.460
 we can take an unpleasant 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.460
 surprise 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.219
 riccardo I do not greet you gilberto alcalá 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.559
 today we are seeing transmitting the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.089
 party I think let in the first 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 time was one in the second time the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.039
 Oaxacan team could have done a lot 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.629
 more you liked the operation 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.969
 in general terms the 90 minutes 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 because we saw you in several takes annoying 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.630
 screaming giving strong indications to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.729
 your data players and I said it a 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 transmission that for me alebrijes could 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.810
 to have done more is to get better results 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.810
 that what is apparently age 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.370
 and we have the party 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.560
 it's a team that but here comes the 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.440
 attitude that we seek 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.050
 counter this part several missions 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 of being exposed is also 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.660
 different that will play us in breadth 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.320
 but also we are not yet 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.120
 having projections of long balls 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.210
 seize also transmit could 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.990
 generate pressures of danger we missed 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.080
 depth 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.080
 [Music] 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.320
 [Applause] 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.910
 oaxaca the party of the class of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:11.310
 different way through the city and I hope 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:14.070
 than to advance to the final 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.530
 I remember that depth of which 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.440
 you talk about what the team did not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.090
 it costs this to have invested and I said it 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.400
 me in the game that was my point of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.770
 sight poke this castle king 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.620
 they passed as left lane and 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.930
 this guy medina does not not lose there 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.100
 maybe you get better mark 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.100
 but you do not lose depth 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:50.570
 [Music] 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.570
 but the player 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.170
 paul output waiting next 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.390
 of the caliber you'll have to be a little 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.390
 different without neglecting 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.139
 [Music] 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.420
 perfect ricardo something more 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.609
 Juan Carlos Zúñiga at the end of accounts 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.230
 beyond that they advance or not to the final 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.359
 this season it seems to me that the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.099
 balance is good they do not manage to reach the 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.629
 final instances of the cup tournament 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.819
 in a very good role being leaders 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.870
 general in this his first tone in the 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.020
 promotion can count good afternoon 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.420
 [Music] 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.660
 With all due respect to your comment and 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.380
 I'm tired of always talking to 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.300
 the team out of nowhere with the screws 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.270
 portachuelo its true that it was very 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:57.180
 well and I want to give a joint blow 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:04:01.350
 between diction have the capacity to 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.300
 win I want to transcend but suddenly 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.490
 tooth because a lot of people have to 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.510
 be but the size of what we can 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.849
 get 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.829
 perfect ricardo a hug good trip to 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.349
 oaxaca luck el salvador 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.239
 a hug ricardo stripes the technician of 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.570
 oaxaca is also aware he 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.570
 knows 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.820
 the one of semifinals yes but it is obvious that 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.270
 to teams or they are reminded of who is 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.270
 champion
