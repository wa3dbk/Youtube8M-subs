00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.740
 break a computer ditch specialist 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.980
 specifically for users of our site 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.700
 we have developed will perceive coffing 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.730
 today's lesson we will look at 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.240
 fault determination 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.240
 power supply 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.240
 it often happens that the computer is not 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.520
 turns on gets to jump 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.869
 ficus decision brand evangelists key and 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.869
 today we will see why 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.879
 scrolling the body we connect the wires 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.409
 unscrew the body elbow 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:30.890
 We reach a crab baguette nothing 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 specially unscrewed the power supply from 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.750
 hull longtime fix any more 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.350
 the device is now our power supply 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.800
 are off 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.800
 connect power 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.080
 we connect some device to 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.080
 to raise 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.430
 next we need to produce food bushes 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.239
 empty produced by closing the green and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.239
 black bravo 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.319
 we close hit we press 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.690
 we have a power supply gives some 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.720
 voltage fan spun 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.170
 it remains to measure how much stress he is 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.170
 getting ready 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.750
 measure the voltage before us 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.260
 need black connect black 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.870
 the wire 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:01.360
 any one is grounding and we check every 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:04.650
 leg power unit table were even you 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.650
 see on the screen 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.900
 ringing each contact power supplies 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.790
 check with a tablet me what 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.250
 voltage if everything obviously means 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.710
 the motherboard is powered 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.870
 then we need to check this food 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.430
 gets the processor and and accordingly 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.730
 all other devices of yours 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.730
 computers 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.600
 check the molex connector about which 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.340
 feed the cd-rom drive 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.250
 hard drive also put the ground black 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.250
 leg 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.250
 check 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.150
 5 volts and 12 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.560
 voltage of them 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.159
 check the extra power 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.159
 processor 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.760
 also connecting ground 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.760
 check chapter contact 1 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.340
 we have a power supply in a completely 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:31.780
 incapable can go to 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:33.550
 next I hope you have this video 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.669
 useful thank you for your attention to 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.669
 dating
