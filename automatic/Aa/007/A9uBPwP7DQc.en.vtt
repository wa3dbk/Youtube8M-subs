00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
oceans being away from home and and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.760 
oceans being away from home and and
that's<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.600> kind<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.869> perspective<00:01:44.409> you<00:01:44.439> can't

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
that's the kind of perspective you can't

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.230 
that's the kind of perspective you can't
help<00:01:45.040> but<00:01:45.280> have<00:01:45.340> when<00:01:45.909> you're<00:01:46.060> up<00:01:46.180> here

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.090 
help but have when you're up here
looking<00:01:46.900> down<00:01:47.110> at<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.409> earth<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:47.890> think

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
looking down at the earth and you think

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.429 
looking down at the earth and you think
about<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.460> early<00:01:48.820> explorers<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.689> here<00:01:50.320> we

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
about the early explorers and here we

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.500 
about the early explorers and here we
are<00:01:50.470> more<00:01:50.890> more<00:01:51.340> recent<00:01:51.729> explorers<00:01:52.180> but<00:01:52.360> we

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
are more more recent explorers but we

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.120 
are more more recent explorers but we
all<00:01:52.630> have<00:01:52.840> some<00:01:53.049> things<00:01:53.290> in<00:01:53.470> common<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:54.010> in

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
all have some things in common and in

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.399 
all have some things in common and in
their<00:01:54.970> jobs<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.510> have<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.780> do<00:01:55.900> far<00:01:56.170> from

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
their jobs that we have to do far from

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.730 
their jobs that we have to do far from
