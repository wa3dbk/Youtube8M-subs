00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hi how about everyone now we are going to 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.460
 try to fix good to treat this 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.630
 I already checked to fix the 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.910
 motorola motokey xt 1032 what's up 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.320
 a lot since then obviously now 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.800
 everyone wants to update themselves 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.260
 lollipop and when once you 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.560
 we update because we simply do not 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.230
 like to make failures or applications do not 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.170
 they stay well etcetera and many people are 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.410
 wants to go back to make it google play or 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.710
 to the original stock of Motorola 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.170
 already with this because the phones are 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 they are warm and I bring them the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.840
 solution towards that let's go to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.960
 your preferred browser and I'm going to leave you 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.690
 the link of the download as the rom of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.329
 culp edition 4.4 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.760
 once you have downloaded this 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.339
 zip file will decompress it and they 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.560
 this folder will be left in this folder 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.320
 what he has then is the 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.900
 what is the name of the rum and has some logos 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.150
 if you like to upgrade to lollipop 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.800
 even what happened to me or that is what 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.140
 I leave it because what happened to me the most 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.510
 that nothing was to update and I did not 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.430
 came in is not done that in the pure start 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.610
 the logos these are to unlock that 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.610
 start 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.659
 good what the blue folder is 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.270
 added was the m fast boot and the retract to 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.579
 that those two files are the ones that you 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.369
 they added to this folder that they are the ones 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.250
 they're going to make our cell phone run 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.700
 well a first let's connect the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.200
 cellular with the computer for this 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.960
 obviously have the files 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.450
 of the motorola forgiveness drivers are the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.080
 I will leave in the description of the video 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.700
 and we will run the retail to s 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.140
 once in mode please give in 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.870
 run 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.000
 and ready, well, I do not get anything 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.090
 Well, because my cell phone already fix it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.770
 and I do not ever want to restore clear 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.569
 and once I finish this it takes 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.280
 around about 5 minutes 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.410
 they are going to enter 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.140
 Well your phone is going to enter with 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.830
 google play edition 4.4 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.770
 where google edition 4.4 is already the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.470
 android lollipop if you like to update it 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.970
 as I say here they have the logos to me 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.670
 personally do not need it 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.400
 So, I could not tell you 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.590
 yes 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.329
 the wolves do not know that but 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.329
 well this does not stay 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.110
 from where it takes us out of 7 weeks I think 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.870
 I took it out and then here they are 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.659
 If the cell phone stays 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.940
 in the pure start what they have to 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.730
 do is turn it off again meter so 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.299
 facebook and dale to execute this 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.700
 file that is install and this takes 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.760
 around a second the truth a 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.549
 done that because that would be all for 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.290
 it served please leave comments and
