00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.720
 more water easily evs back on the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.250
 fair 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.170
 Today we have the old stock 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.320
 go 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:24.199
 and we have I heard 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.210
 you have new product that we have today 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.279
 Imagine soon so we have many 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.199
 new products but for seawater have 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.970
 i have a product here i believe one 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.320
 many things are exciting 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.120
 seawater aquarians have since 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.100
 a second a third a fourth 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.289
 aquarium if that is not always all 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.750
 are huge but it will be 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.160
 commonly used in lime reactor so far 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.890
 it was so that we characterize each one 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.750
 need a separate co2 plant and we 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.719
 thought about it as you did 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.640
 with a pressure reducer equal to two co2 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.070
 can operate plants and therefore 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.530
 we have this pro flora 001 duo 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.350
 made on where one bottle of 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.600
 but then closes accordingly two co2 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.909
 so two lime reactors 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.680
 can operate 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.720
 Fine thing about this enemy valves 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.240
 more precisely, no special settings 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.490
 Connection to the lime reactors via the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.890
 Final valve can then be correspondingly 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.760
 be dosed CO2 is added 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.010
 that means additional adapter purpose exactly 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.940
 everything is great and the connection 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.260
 after all, there are some with more 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.750
 reusable bottles but inter patriots like that 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.760
 on it and who has a bottle like co2 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.650
 The only had to unscrew the bus 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.480
 and then the whole thing fits on 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.480
 The local super well thought 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.020
 in passing 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.760
 at the stand of I have seen you have 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.650
 as a badge for brand 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.960
 audience yes, we are very happy 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.800
 We are from the specialist dealers 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.690
 been awarded for the best 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.820
 product 2014 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.620
 and has become the plankton pur 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.150
 and I find that very, very great because it 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.400
 is really a unique product 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.900
 There is nothing in the direction and 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.760
 just in the sea water area are there 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.110
 many successes have been recorded because 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.210
 We're a bunch of plankton eater 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 in the direction of anti us and so thought 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.950
 they do not really like dry food 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.240
 and eat granules but pure plankton 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.670
 really really like 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.580
 or are you lucky we have 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.410
 another video made 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.780
 We already had that on the plan 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.890
 stand because some users ask 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.870
 request were 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.820
 we've already shot only 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.600
 set high but it will be soon 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.140
 be online 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.000
 So look forward to the next video 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.400
 reiko thank you very much for your time 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.990
 christian thank you and another 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.990
 nice day until next time
