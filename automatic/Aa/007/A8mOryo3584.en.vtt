you today about a product from inkaid
that<00:00:24.099> I've<00:00:24.220> been<00:00:24.340> working<00:00:24.580> with<00:00:24.789> for<00:00:24.939> a<00:00:25.180> while

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
that I've been working with for a while

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.659 
that I've been working with for a while
and<00:00:25.750> really<00:00:26.410> getting<00:00:26.619> some<00:00:26.860> great<00:00:27.070> results<00:00:27.550> on

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
and really getting some great results on

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.120 
and really getting some great results on
some<00:00:27.849> interesting<00:00:28.060> surfaces<00:00:28.960> this<00:00:29.680> is<00:00:29.890> called

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
some interesting surfaces this is called

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.850 
some interesting surfaces this is called
transferees<00:00:30.820> it's<00:00:31.180> a<00:00:31.360> concentrate<00:00:32.230> gloss<00:00:32.470> and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
transferees it's a concentrate gloss and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.549 
transferees it's a concentrate gloss and
it<00:00:33.340> is<00:00:33.489> an<00:00:33.640> image<00:00:34.000> transfer<00:00:34.570> medium<00:00:34.930> so<00:00:35.379> that

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
it is an image transfer medium so that

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.590 
it is an image transfer medium so that
means<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:35.980> you<00:00:36.129> put<00:00:36.430> this<00:00:36.640> on<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.000> surface

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
means that you put this on a surface

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.750 
means that you put this on a surface
once<00:00:38.019> you<00:00:38.230> mix<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.680> and<00:00:38.800> dilute<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.129> you<00:00:39.489> put<00:00:39.730> it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
once you mix it and dilute it you put it

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.430 
once you mix it and dilute it you put it
on<00:00:39.879> a<00:00:39.940> surface<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:40.540> then<00:00:40.690> you<00:00:40.780> transfer<00:00:41.410> your

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
on a surface and then you transfer your

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.799 
on a surface and then you transfer your
image<00:00:41.980> to<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.430> surface<00:00:42.850> an<00:00:43.360> image<00:00:43.660> is

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
image to the surface an image is

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.110 
image to the surface an image is
transferred<00:00:44.350> with<00:00:44.730> transparency<00:00:45.730> this<00:00:45.910> is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
transferred with transparency this is

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.020 
transferred with transparency this is
quite<00:00:46.720> a<00:00:46.750> large<00:00:46.989> one<00:00:47.170> because<00:00:47.440> I<00:00:47.530> did<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.710> on<00:00:47.890> my

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
quite a large one because I did it on my

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.410 
quite a large one because I did it on my
seventh<00:00:49.030> Epson<00:00:49.390> 78<00:00:49.839> 96<00:00:50.500> 24<00:00:51.040> inches<00:00:51.309> wide<00:00:51.549> but

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
seventh Epson 78 96 24 inches wide but

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.840 
seventh Epson 78 96 24 inches wide but
it<00:00:52.540> brings<00:00:52.839> a<00:00:53.199> lot<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.680> surfaces<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.610> may

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
it brings a lot of surfaces that you may

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.729 
it brings a lot of surfaces that you may
not<00:00:55.059> be<00:00:55.269> able<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.540> print<00:00:55.839> and<00:00:56.080> especially<00:00:56.470> if

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
not be able to print and especially if

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.740 
not be able to print and especially if
you<00:00:56.860> have<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.040> printer<00:00:57.400> that<00:00:57.549> does<00:00:58.119> not<00:00:58.390> take

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
you have a printer that does not take

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.229 
you have a printer that does not take
thicker<00:00:59.140> surfaces<00:00:59.830> and<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.670> pigment<00:01:01.089> ink

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
thicker surfaces and it's a pigment ink

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.630 
thicker surfaces and it's a pigment ink
usually<00:01:02.049> a<00:01:02.080> pigment<00:01:02.470> ink<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.769> think<00:01:03.100> works<00:01:03.309> best

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
usually a pigment ink I think works best

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.310 
usually a pigment ink I think works best
but<00:01:03.909> dye<00:01:04.119> inks<00:01:04.479> will<00:01:04.720> work<00:01:04.989> so<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:07.600> just<00:01:08.049> gives

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
but dye inks will work so it just gives

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.140 
but dye inks will work so it just gives
you<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.799> opportunity<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.670> make<00:01:09.850> other

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
you the opportunity to make other

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.969 
you the opportunity to make other
surfaces<00:01:10.900> you<00:01:11.110> might<00:01:11.320> not<00:01:11.470> have<00:01:11.590> been<00:01:11.650> able<00:01:11.860> to

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
surfaces you might not have been able to

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.039 
surfaces you might not have been able to
print<00:01:12.250> before<00:01:12.430> this<00:01:13.150> one<00:01:13.420> right<00:01:13.570> here<00:01:13.840> is<00:01:14.020> a

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
print before this one right here is a

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.980 
print before this one right here is a
cheesecloth<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:16.240> looks<00:01:16.420> nice<00:01:16.659> on<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
cheesecloth really looks nice on the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.080 
cheesecloth really looks nice on the
cheesecloth<00:01:17.470> at<00:01:18.250> first<00:01:18.549> I<00:01:18.729> thought<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.000> was

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
cheesecloth at first I thought it was

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.789 
cheesecloth at first I thought it was
going<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.299> be<00:01:19.420> hard<00:01:19.659> on<00:01:19.750> textural<00:01:20.260> surfaces

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
going to be hard on textural surfaces

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.330 
going to be hard on textural surfaces
but<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.130> soaks<00:01:21.640> right<00:01:21.789> in<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.799> is<00:01:24.039> a<00:01:24.070> piece<00:01:24.310> of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
but it soaks right in this is a piece of

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.060 
but it soaks right in this is a piece of
rimae<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:24.909> it's<00:01:25.329> pretty<00:01:25.570> smooth<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.829> did<00:01:27.039> a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
rimae so it's pretty smooth and I did a

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.929 
rimae so it's pretty smooth and I did a
double<00:01:28.259> image<00:01:29.259> on<00:01:29.500> here<00:01:29.890> where<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.130> cut<00:01:30.609> it<00:01:30.759> and

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
double image on here where I cut it and

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.989 
double image on here where I cut it and
put<00:01:31.840> another<00:01:31.869> piece<00:01:32.409> into<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.009> then<00:01:33.609> it's<00:01:33.789> all

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
put another piece into it then it's all

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:35.999 
put another piece into it then it's all
burned<00:01:34.240> across<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.840> side<00:01:35.109> because<00:01:35.590> it's<00:01:35.799> a

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
burned across the side because it's a

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.550 
burned across the side because it's a
synthetic<00:01:36.609> and<00:01:36.969> Swiper<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.509> edge<00:01:37.689> these

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
synthetic and Swiper in the edge these

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.419 
synthetic and Swiper in the edge these
are<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.950> couple<00:01:39.399> of<00:01:39.549> pieces<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.450> metal<00:01:41.020> mesh<00:01:41.429> so

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
are a couple of pieces of metal mesh so

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.239 
are a couple of pieces of metal mesh so
this<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.030> copper<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.539> this<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.320> brass<00:01:44.799> and

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
this is copper and this is brass and

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.459 
this is copper and this is brass and
it's<00:01:45.729> beautiful<00:01:46.359> on<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.630> mesh<00:01:46.869> little<00:01:47.259> things

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
it's beautiful on the mesh little things

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.959 
it's beautiful on the mesh little things
you<00:01:47.590> have<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.859> know<00:01:48.009> about<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.429> but<00:01:48.609> I'm<00:01:48.789> gonna

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
you have to know about it but I'm gonna

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.809 
you have to know about it but I'm gonna
teach<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.420> stuff<00:01:50.039> this<00:01:51.039> is<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.520> piece<00:01:51.789> of

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
teach you that stuff this is a piece of

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.779 
teach you that stuff this is a piece of
crinkle<00:01:52.479> cotton<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:54.069> should<00:01:54.280> might<00:01:54.520> be<00:01:54.670> able

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
crinkle cotton you should might be able

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.899 
crinkle cotton you should might be able
to<00:01:54.880> see<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.240> it's<00:01:55.390> crinkly<00:01:55.990> back<00:01:56.200> here

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to see that it's crinkly back here

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.779 
to see that it's crinkly back here
there's<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.999> good<00:01:58.439> special<00:01:59.439> way<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.560> do<00:01:59.740> it<00:02:00.189> so

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
there's a good special way I do it so

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.779 
there's a good special way I do it so
that<00:02:00.969> it<00:02:01.090> gets<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.450> good<00:02:01.630> result<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.789> really

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
that it gets the good result of really

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.300 
that it gets the good result of really
going<00:02:03.999> into<00:02:04.389> the<00:02:04.539> fabric<00:02:04.990> which<00:02:05.649> is<00:02:05.829> you<00:02:06.189> know

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
going into the fabric which is you know

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.389 
going into the fabric which is you know
it's<00:02:06.490> it's<00:02:06.819> cotton<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:09.009> actually<00:02:09.369> a

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
it's it's cotton this is actually a

I<00:02:20.730> doubt<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.970> edges<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.319> doesn't

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
I doubt the edges so that it doesn't

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.670 
I doubt the edges so that it doesn't
give<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.090> jagged<00:02:25.090> edge<00:02:25.240> print<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.440> don't

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
give a jagged edge print I really don't

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.730 
give a jagged edge print I really don't
like<00:02:26.920> my<00:02:27.130> edges<00:02:27.580> flat<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.870> love<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.380> rub<00:02:29.590> out
