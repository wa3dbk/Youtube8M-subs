00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.370
 g2 from hp at this year's mobile 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.769
 world congress in barcelona has to be hp 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 the newest elite pad imagines that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 This is especially important for business customers 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.070
 this is one of the first windows 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.980
 Tablets with a 64 bit architecture 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.380
 the media echo was especially special 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.769
 Great what the end for the user 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.660
 means we show you the elite now 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.270
 pad is 17 8 inches high 26 1 inches wide and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 nine millimeters deep at one weight 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.739
 from 680 grams 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.210
 The display is 10.1 inches tall and triggers 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 powered with 1290 x 1200 pixels 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.739
 the tablet is powered by an intel atom 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.430
 quad core processor with each up to 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.260
 23 9 ghz computing power in connection 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.410
 with four gigabytes of RAM 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.739
 the internal memory is optional 64 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.320
 or 128 gb the maximum 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.840
 memory extension via micro SD is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.670
 64 gigabytes 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.070
 the housing of the new elite pad exists 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.080
 Almost completely made of aluminum what the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.659
 device gives a high value 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.100
 The weight of 680 grams is for one 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.759
 tablet this size already quite 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 orderly 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.259
 on average it is a good 100 grams 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.119
 more than competitive products reason 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.340
 especially the big one 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.360
 Battery with a capacity of 30 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.549
 be watt hours 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.369
 despite the weight, the device is but 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.259
 nice to catch flat and handy dust 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.270
 the gaps and gaps are not 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.829
 to discover 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.869
 the quality of the workmanship is 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.820
 therefore completely satisfactory only 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.679
 There is a minus point for the weight 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.539
 we give a good the display is 10 1 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.590
 inch becomes big by corning gorilla 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.319
 glass protected and dissolves with 1920 x 1200 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.189
 pixeln on that results in a pixeldichte 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.840
 of 224 ppi what with a tray of this 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.880
 size corresponds to the average 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.380
 the sharpness is therefore not perfect though 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.840
 everything OK 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.849
 particularly positive are the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.190
 high viewing angle stability and the 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.970
 strong colors 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.790
 in summary, this is 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.010
 to make a good display how to easily 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.260
 can recognize runs on the label that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.959
 windows operating system at the version 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.810
 these are windows 8.1 pro in 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.670
 the 64 bit variant problems in the 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.880
 Usage we did not notice in the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.290
 on the contrary everything runs fluently also hp 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.700
 did not take it off and 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.489
 some software preinstalled 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.129
 this includes, for example, hp mobile 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.230
 connect a prepaid solution for mobile 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.970
 broadband internet can be used by 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.100
 encrypted everywhere on the world wide 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.049
 web can be accessed without hotspot or 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.600
 contractual commitment but by means of 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.400
 Numerous volume fares whether you all the 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.319
 preinstalled program needs or 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.600
 is not up to everyone 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.239
 If something is missing in the windows 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 store to look out for are 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.319
 this one is still the security eps 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.489
 By HP they include a drive 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.380
 encryption as well 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.239
 password manager especially for 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.620
 business customers should be interesting 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.140
 thumb 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.390
 we come to the hardware for the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.420
 computing power is an intel bay trail 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.390
 four core processor ready up to 23 9 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.760
 gigahertz clocks and supports 64 bit 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.819
 the memory is full 4 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.739
 gigabyte what also on the new 64 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.750
 bit architecture is due 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.790
 this is the elite pad able 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.069
 all apps and many windows store 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.909
 Play easily and quickly 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.010
 perform 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.349
 only the service per 3 delivers her 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.200
 currently better values ​​for this 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.329
 race machine 's thumb up 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.859
 we stick to the hardware and look 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.650
 especially the rest under the housing 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.720
 What attracts attention is the Lte 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.140
 function by which you also surf mobile 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.709
 can 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.680
 module for gps wlan bluetooth 4.0 and 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.269
 nfc are at this price range 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.129
 of course also on board 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.829
 small highlight is also the 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.680
 integrated tpm chip which means so much 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.900
 like trusted platform module with this 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.790
 Additive receives your own tablet

 Identification with which especially in networks 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.680
 a clear identification of the 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.510
 equipment is also possible that is ideal 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.230
 for business people in larger

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.970
 megapixels and lightning 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.410
 the quality is not for a tablet 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.740
 bad compared to 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.220
 even noticeably better 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.169
 there is the thumb up for that 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.840
 Battery is as mentioned above with a 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.729
 capacity of 30 watt hours right big 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.440
 what turned out especially in the 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.630
 average operating time significantly 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.210
 makes normal use, the enough 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.099
 battery a good nine hours a very 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.789
 good value 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:05:00.009

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.069
 high quality housing 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.280
 Deduction is only for the 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.690
 weight and mediocre resolution 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.759
 unmistakable is also given the
