 from the saints engine oil leaks before and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.630
 then remove the protection under the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.750
 engine to detect leaks of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.750
 oil 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.280
 the oil loss of this engine is 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.280
 considerable 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.480
 place paper towels 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.700
 under the engine to measure the entity 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:09.560
 of the leak before using the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:12.190
 anti engine oil leakage product after 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.190
 an hour 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.649
 after three hours 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.860
 the oil leak on the left and of the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.860
 oil Cup 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.770
 the oil leak on the right and more 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.700
 the loss of the oil is important

 vacuum pump 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.280
 here is the product to stop the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.560
 oil leaks that will be used if 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.540
 assumes that the product stops leaks 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.250
 of oil increasing the volume of 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.380
 engine gaskets 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.270
 the product is effective on all types 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.240
 of gaskets except those for 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.250
 paper seals the minority nor up 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.410
 that crack is recommendable 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.020
 add the bottle after a change 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.910
 of oil and a filter but it is not mandatory 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.980
 if you wait long enough before 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.930
 next oil change to allow the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.880
 product time to react 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.100
 the result of this test cannot 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.230
 be generalized to all cases of 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.860
 loss because there are numerous factors 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.140
 which can influence the result 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.290
 material of the age compression seal 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.910
 general condition pour the bottle 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:13.699
 in the oil engine

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:06.790
 after three hours the oil leaks from the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.980
 oil sump have been stopped 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.349
 oil leaks from the August pump were 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.670
 too important have been diminished 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:17.799
 but not completely removed on this one 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.609
 vehicle the product was effective for 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.609
 small losses
