00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930 
then you got to upgrade the Reeve record
and<00:00:49.500> make<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> into<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.950> colossus<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.579> legs<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and make it into a colossus with legs I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
and make it into a colossus with legs I
would<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.120> kind<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> cool<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:52.379> some<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.240 
guys might know I'm not the biggest fan
of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.629> Reaver<00:00:54.930> i<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> Colossus<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
of the Reaver i think the Colossus was a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189 
of the Reaver i think the Colossus was a
better<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.969> Reaver<00:00:57.180> was<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
better or the Reaver was I'm not the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.420 
better or the Reaver was I'm not the
biggest<00:00:58.379> fan<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> Colossus<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
biggest fan of the Colossus I think the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.240 
biggest fan of the Colossus I think the
river<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.059> more<00:01:00.449> fun<00:01:00.690> unit<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.260> we'll<00:01:02.129> see

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
river was a more fun unit but we'll see

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
river was a more fun unit but we'll see
what<00:01:02.370> happens<00:01:02.460> man<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.120> starcraft<00:01:03.870> 2<00:01:04.140> it's

really could not have asked for a better

Roach and fester style we've sought

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.580 
Roach and fester style we've sought
we've<00:02:16.220> seen<00:02:16.400> already<00:02:16.930> even<00:02:17.930> muta<00:02:18.170> lists<00:02:18.470> are

we've seen already even muta lists are

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.380 
we've seen already even muta lists are
really<00:02:18.830> good<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.160> map<00:02:19.340> as<00:02:19.490> well<00:02:19.520> open

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
really good on this map as well open

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.000 
really good on this map as well open
space<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.780> work<00:02:20.900> with<00:02:20.960> they<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.740> get<00:02:21.860> behind

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
space to work with they can get behind

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.190 
space to work with they can get behind
the<00:02:22.220> basis<00:02:22.550> pretty<00:02:22.730> easily<00:02:23.170> speaking<00:02:24.170> of

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the basis pretty easily speaking of

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.810 
the basis pretty easily speaking of
which<00:02:24.290> will<00:02:24.530> its<00:02:24.710> oval<00:02:24.800> or<00:02:25.040> make<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.490> out<00:02:25.760> of

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
which will its oval or make it out of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.860 
which will its oval or make it out of
the<00:02:26.330> way<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:27.140> think<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:29.540> looks<00:02:29.630> like<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the way I think so and it looks like the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.030 
the way I think so and it looks like the
old<00:02:30.020> Lord<00:02:30.170> will<00:02:30.290> be<00:02:30.350> able<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.560> park<00:02:30.740> behind<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
old Lord will be able to park behind the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.260 
old Lord will be able to park behind the
day<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.340> was<00:02:31.460> actually<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.730> calculated<00:02:32.240> risk

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
day so I was actually a calculated risk

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.480 
day so I was actually a calculated risk
from<00:02:32.690> killer<00:02:33.040> knowing<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.130> know<00:02:34.250> there<00:02:34.400> might

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
from killer knowing you know there might

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.740 
from killer knowing you know there might
be<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.640> marine<00:02:34.880> out<00:02:35.000> there<00:02:35.210> but<00:02:35.360> hey<00:02:35.480> i<00:02:35.510> can

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
be a marine out there but hey i can

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.850 
be a marine out there but hey i can
probably<00:02:35.930> get<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.170> behind<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.530> base<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
probably get it behind the base and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.020 
probably get it behind the base and
there's<00:02:36.950> nothing<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> Terran<00:02:37.640> can<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:37.910> about

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
there's nothing the Terran can do about

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.420 
there's nothing the Terran can do about
that<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:39.050> on<00:02:39.380> top<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.010> can<00:02:40.100> even<00:02:40.310> get

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that so on top of that you can even get

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.640 
that so on top of that you can even get
the<00:02:40.520> Overlord<00:02:40.910> it's<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.270> here<00:02:41.320> up<00:02:42.320> on

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
the Overlord it's like up here up on

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.020 
the Overlord it's like up here up on
this<00:02:42.830> little<00:02:43.130> ledge<00:02:43.280> right<00:02:43.490> here<00:02:43.730> like<00:02:43.880> on

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
this little ledge right here like on

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.740 
this little ledge right here like on
Todd<00:02:44.240> rim<00:02:44.420> altar<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.140> nice<00:02:45.260> spot<00:02:45.590> for

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
Todd rim altar so it's a nice spot for

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.030 
Todd rim altar so it's a nice spot for
for<00:02:47.750> Zurich<00:02:48.050> it's<00:02:48.170> really<00:02:48.410> great<00:02:48.590> map<00:02:48.830> for

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
for Zurich it's really great map for

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.980 
for Zurich it's really great map for
them<00:02:49.190> change<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.820> hear<00:02:49.940> going<00:02:50.240> with<00:02:50.450> command

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
them change to hear going with command

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.980 
them change to hear going with command
center<00:02:51.290> first<00:02:51.590> again<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.280> looks<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:52.700> or<00:02:52.959> no<00:02:53.959> I

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
center first again it looks like or no I

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.449 
center first again it looks like or no I
think<00:02:54.170> he<00:02:54.350> actually<00:02:54.380> went<00:02:54.709> barracks<00:02:55.100> versus

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
think he actually went barracks versus

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.680 
think he actually went barracks versus
time<00:02:55.610> around<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.030> then<00:02:56.120> he<00:02:56.180> lifted<00:02:56.360> off<00:02:56.570> the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
time around and then he lifted off the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.480 
time around and then he lifted off the
Berenstain<00:02:57.050> brought<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.470> front<00:02:57.680> door<00:02:57.890> so

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
Berenstain brought to the front door so

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.250 
Berenstain brought to the front door so
that's<00:02:58.910> why<00:02:59.000> he<00:02:59.090> got<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.390> early<00:02:59.690> marine<00:03:00.020> out

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
that's why he got the early marine out

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.650 
that's why he got the early marine out
and<00:03:00.590> we'll<00:03:01.490> see<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:01.820> killer<00:03:02.090> goes<00:03:02.330> for<00:03:02.510> this

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
and we'll see what killer goes for this

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.480 
and we'll see what killer goes for this
time<00:03:02.840> around<00:03:02.959> most<00:03:03.680> likely<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.220> go<00:03:04.310> for

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
time around most likely going to go for

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.949 
time around most likely going to go for
the<00:03:04.550> quick<00:03:04.670> third<00:03:04.910> again<00:03:05.360> unless<00:03:05.690> he<00:03:05.840> decides

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
the quick third again unless he decides

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.130 
the quick third again unless he decides

let's see what the ad on that is it is a
reactor<00:04:26.410> core<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.340> we<00:04:27.460> are<00:04:27.580> going<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.820> probably

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120

have<00:04:28.540> delayed<00:04:29.080> reactor<00:04:29.530> hellions<00:04:29.949> here<00:04:30.250> and
