00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.439
 hello how about youtube friends I'm already 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:11.670
 abigail and today we will learn how to weave this 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:15.330
 beautiful coordinated dvd that consists of 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.980
 very simple votings to perform 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.350
 we will also make our beanie look 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.200
 here I have you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.660
 the tissue several texts 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.240
 in various colors this good booty is 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.870
 coordinated 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:40.340
 and it's already three months from three to four 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:45.950
 months I am very bad for the measures of 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:50.240
 the babies good the beanie I have it 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.660
 always a little bigger than 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.570
 it would be the size three months babies 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:02.060
 they grow very fast too fast 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.300
 they are already almost new everything that 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.310
 we buy it in the little buttons if you do not 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.670
 I recommend that you make them bigger 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 because if not, they would not have 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.479
 would be very large then then the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.600
 little buttons and lots and the task of three 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.689
 months and the slightly bigger beanie 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 so that they can continue to occupy 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.590
 our babies well let's move on 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.399
 with the list of materials actually 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.500
 they are very simple to perform they carry 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.720
 very little stamen 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.720
 of 100 grams that I bought 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.009
 doing the boots and the hat 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.500
 is this 100 grams then 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.009
 We are talking about what they are 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.329
 approximately 70 80 grams what 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:03.960
 we occupy for this cute coordinated 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:09.509
 then we'll buy a wool 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.120
 thick 4 millimeters thick 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.739
 or if you prefer you can find 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.159
 the more you are more skinny but remember 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.090
 that varies greatly the size of our 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:26.430
 clothes and the crochet that we occupy 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.450
 then we are going to need 100 grams of 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.920
 stamen of a thick wool of 4 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:40.590
 millimeters thick we are going to occupy some 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:45.390
 2 crochet scissors in aluminum 1 of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:49.300
 number 5 and 1 of number 4 with the number 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.690
 4 we are going to weave the shoes 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.740
 and with the number 5 we are going to knit the cap 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:00.040
 so that we do not get so tight 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:03.640
 our work we will occupy 4 buttons 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.390
 of your choice the size is 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.260
 approximately 2 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.110
 to two centimeters in diameter 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.810
 do not buy them very small because 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.870
 as this part of here they read it 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.769
 tongue that they have here good as it is 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.079
 wide 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.349
 so if you put a button 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:31.930
 small because it will not look so if 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:35.470
 I recommend you buy a button of 2 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.780
 centimeters in diameter let's occupy 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.319
 mark points remember that if you do not have 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.359
 can occupy pieces of yarn and 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.359
 I think that would be all
