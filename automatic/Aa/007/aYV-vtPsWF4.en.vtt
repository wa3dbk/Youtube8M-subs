00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.000 
clumped a little bit to the side but
that's<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.410> because<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.709> way<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:49.830> was

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
close up to the camera so it's harder

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.300 
close up to the camera so it's harder
but<00:02:56.130> they<00:02:56.550> look<00:02:56.760> very<00:02:56.940> nice<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.930> i<00:02:58.620> highly
