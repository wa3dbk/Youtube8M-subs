00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.400 
happened today I think like James said
James<00:01:44.190> Amos<00:01:44.370> body<00:01:44.670> high<00:01:44.910> on<00:01:45.090> crack<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.420> he

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
James Amos body high on crack and he

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.680 
James Amos body high on crack and he
probably<00:01:46.680> came<00:01:46.950> down<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.580> high<00:01:47.910> and<00:01:48.270> realize

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.100 
probably came down or high and realize
that<00:01:48.720> he's<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> basket<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:51.110> do

that he's gonna get the basket and do

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.900
