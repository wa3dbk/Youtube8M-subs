to<00:00:22.980> quickscope<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:24.029> first<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.420> got<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.570> define

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
to quickscope but first I got to define

first step you need to know is how to
aim<00:01:14.220> obviously<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.690> most

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
aim obviously it's one of the most

the key to aiming will push hoping is

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.410 
the key to aiming will push hoping is

here this didn't look like much of a

here this didn't look like much of a

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
drag school but as you can see when it's

drag school but as you can see when it's
slowed<00:03:51.920> down<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:53.210> can<00:03:53.330> see<00:03:53.540> as<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.840> scope<00:03:54.170> in

I'm not quite on target but I dragged my
scope<00:03:56.780> overcook<00:03:57.200> them<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.560> take<00:03:57.770> out<00:03:57.920> the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
scope overcook them and take out the

target

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.650 

these<00:04:17.110> are<00:04:17.230> just<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.500> few<00:04:17.640> quick<00:04:18.640> clips<00:04:18.940> of<00:04:19.150> drag

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
these are just a few quick clips of drag

these are just a few quick clips of drag
shows

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.430 

now<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.300> put<00:04:27.599> the<00:04:27.690> jump<00:04:27.900> shot<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.169> this<00:04:28.259> tutorial

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
now I put the jump shot in this tutorial

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.830 
now I put the jump shot in this tutorial
because<00:04:29.069> I<00:04:29.310> think<00:04:29.699> it's<00:04:29.819> a<00:04:29.910> very<00:04:30.090> useful<00:04:30.389> shot

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
because I think it's a very useful shot

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.390 
because I think it's a very useful shot
because<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.259> can<00:04:31.410> stay<00:04:31.590> behind<00:04:31.770> cover<00:04:32.099> and

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
because you can stay behind cover and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.469 
because you can stay behind cover and
still<00:04:32.880> take<00:04:33.120> out<00:04:33.330> people<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.880> jump<00:04:36.120> shot<00:04:36.150> also

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
still take out people the jump shot also

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.430 
still take out people the jump shot also
goes<00:04:36.690> with<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.960> drag<00:04:37.289> scope<00:04:37.590> because<00:04:38.370> in

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
goes with the drag scope because in

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.650 
goes with the drag scope because in
midair<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.979> jump<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.550> sort<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.120> drag<00:04:42.449> your

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
midair you jump and sort of drag your

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.650 
midair you jump and sort of drag your
crossers<00:04:43.199> while<00:04:44.069> you<00:04:44.220> jump<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.729> hit<00:04:45.509> your

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
crossers while you jump and hit your

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.080 
crossers while you jump and hit your
targets<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:48.800> great<00:04:49.800> way<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.400> practice<00:04:50.729> your

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
targets a great way to practice your

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.350 
targets a great way to practice your
drag<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.599> your<00:04:51.750> jump<00:04:52.199> shot<00:04:52.259> is<00:04:52.639> to<00:04:53.639> hold<00:04:54.180> your

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
drag for your jump shot is to hold your

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.870 
drag for your jump shot is to hold your
breath<00:04:54.710> before<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:56.160> jump<00:04:56.460> when<00:04:56.759> you're

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
breath before you jump when you're

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.059 
breath before you jump when you're
scoped<00:04:57.240> in<00:04:57.360> so<00:04:58.139> scope<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.590> hold<00:04:58.860> your<00:04:59.009> breath

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
scoped in so scope and hold your breath

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.180 
scoped in so scope and hold your breath
jump<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.180> hopefully<00:05:00.870> you're<00:05:01.680> able<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:02.009> move

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
jump and hopefully you're able to move

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.689 
jump and hopefully you're able to move
your<00:05:02.819> across<00:05:03.180> routes<00:05:03.389> to<00:05:03.509> your<00:05:03.569> target<00:05:03.810> and

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
your across routes to your target and

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.659 
your across routes to your target and
eliminate<00:05:05.699> them<00:05:07.099> step<00:05:08.099> 3<00:05:08.310> is<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.430> movement

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
eliminate them step 3 is a movement

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.469 
eliminate them step 3 is a movement
movement<00:05:09.060> is<00:05:09.360> very<00:05:09.990> helpful<00:05:10.409> just<00:05:11.009> because

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
movement is very helpful just because

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.730 
movement is very helpful just because
it's<00:05:12.479> just<00:05:12.599> harder<00:05:13.020> for<00:05:13.169> people<00:05:13.289> to<00:05:13.470> hit<00:05:13.710> you

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
it's just harder for people to hit you

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.430 
it's just harder for people to hit you
and<00:05:14.120> when<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.210> miss<00:05:15.389> shots<00:05:15.630> on<00:05:15.870> when<00:05:16.289> you're

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
and when you miss shots on when you're

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.749 
will help you greatly here I'm I see a
guy<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.210> lay<00:05:21.449> down<00:05:21.599> miss<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.560> shot<00:05:22.830> lay<00:05:23.729> down

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
guy so I lay down miss a shot lay down

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:28.420 
guy so I lay down miss a shot lay down
again<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.360> I'm<00:05:25.259> able<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.560> take<00:05:25.830> him<00:05:25.949> out

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.189 

another<00:05:29.430> great<00:05:29.729> move<00:05:30.060> to<00:05:30.090> use<00:05:30.449> his<00:05:30.659> drop<00:05:30.930> shots

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
another great move to use his drop shots

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.779 
another great move to use his drop shots
which<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:31.590> especially<00:05:32.130> effective<00:05:32.340> when<00:05:32.580> you

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
which is especially effective when you

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.399 
which is especially effective when you
come<00:05:32.969> into<00:05:33.120> like<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.389> face<00:05:33.659> to<00:05:33.840> face<00:05:34.020> wall<00:05:34.289> in

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
come into like a face to face wall in

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.920 
come into like a face to face wall in
one<00:05:34.560> situation<00:05:34.880> because<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.479> drop<00:05:36.750> shot

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
one situation because the drop shot

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.050 
one situation because the drop shot
actually<00:05:37.250> changes<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.340> effect<00:05:38.729> of<00:05:38.880> the

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
actually changes the effect of the

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.770 
actually changes the effect of the
auto-aim<00:05:39.419> in<00:05:39.810> modern<00:05:40.380> warfare<00:05:40.440> 2<00:05:41.630> so<00:05:42.630> you're

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
auto-aim in modern warfare 2 so you're

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.529 
auto-aim in modern warfare 2 so you're
able<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:43.169> avoid<00:05:43.620> their<00:05:43.860> auto<00:05:44.039> aim<00:05:44.360> ability<00:05:45.360> and

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
able to avoid their auto aim ability and

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.800 
able to avoid their auto aim ability and
drop<00:05:46.409> and<00:05:46.650> take<00:05:46.800> them<00:05:46.949> up<00:05:47.099> here<00:05:48.090> I<00:05:48.120> drop<00:05:48.539> shot<00:05:48.780> a

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
drop and take them up here I drop shot a

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.010 
drop and take them up here I drop shot a
guy<00:05:49.020> even<00:05:49.979> though<00:05:50.219> these<00:05:50.400> on<00:05:50.849> as<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.240> partner

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
guy even though these on as a partner

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.630 
guy even though these on as a partner
missile

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.630 

step<00:05:58.640> four<00:05:58.880> is<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.270> most<00:05:59.510> important<00:05:59.990> and<00:06:00.170> by

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
step four is the most important and by

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.740 
step four is the most important and by
by<00:06:01.640> far<00:06:01.970> the<00:06:02.750> one<00:06:02.870> you<00:06:02.990> need<00:06:03.260> to<00:06:03.290> do<00:06:04.420> out<00:06:05.420> of<00:06:05.570> all

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
of them because if you don't practice
