00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.820
 the pleasure of being here with a legend 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.550
 living of the Mexican food embargo 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.260

 young people of the theater as it can be 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.640
 very happy very comfortable and above all very 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.780
 proud because I feel that in Mexico 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.610
 there is a seed of new young people who 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.980

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.410

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.200
 that those people who are coming now 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.790
 thriving to achieve a place in the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.800
 artistic environment master for not 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.600
 talk about breaking the country rope I think 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.640
 which is something very common but that can 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.070
 as that interaction now with these 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.770
 new young people and count technologies 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.540

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.910
 of this young audience 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.280

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.590
 really in this new technology that 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.300

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.370
 they will be facilitated a little more 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.640
