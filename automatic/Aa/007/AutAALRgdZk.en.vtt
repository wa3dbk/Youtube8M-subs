which<00:02:19.440> has<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> bolt<00:02:19.980> removed<00:02:20.569> since<00:02:21.569> they<00:02:21.720> just

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
which has a bolt removed since they just

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.910 
which has a bolt removed since they just
pull<00:02:22.170> right<00:02:22.200> up<00:02:22.409> on<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.489> foil<00:02:24.560> okay<00:02:25.560> there<00:02:25.830> it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
pull right up on the foil okay there it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.750 
pull right up on the foil okay there it
is<00:02:25.980> out<00:02:27.500> okay<00:02:28.500> while<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.099> coil<00:02:29.610> out

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
is out okay while you have that coil out

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.600 
is out okay while you have that coil out
you<00:02:30.629> can<00:02:30.780> see<00:02:30.930> down<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.290> there<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.709> actually

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you can see down in there is actually

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.240 
you can see down in there is actually
the<00:02:32.940> spark<00:02:33.330> plug<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.739> you're<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the spark plug so if you're going to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.650 
the spark plug so if you're going to
change<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.489> spark<00:02:35.760> plugs<00:02:36.000> obviously<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.540> is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
change the spark plugs obviously this is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.400 
change the spark plugs obviously this is
the<00:02:36.780> time<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:38.930> okay<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.989> remove<00:02:40.170> your

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
the time to do it okay to remove your

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.770 
the time to do it okay to remove your
spark<00:02:40.650> plug<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.220> want<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.610> proper<00:02:42.060> spark<00:02:42.450> plug

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
spark plug you want a proper spark plug

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.319 
spark plug you want a proper spark plug
socket<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.819> one's<00:02:45.030> actually<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
socket like this this one's actually a

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.850 
socket like this this one's actually a
little<00:02:45.510> bit<00:02:45.629> worn<00:02:45.900> out<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.379> doesn't<00:02:46.500> rip

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
little bit worn out so it doesn't rip

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.759 
little bit worn out so it doesn't rip
the<00:02:47.160> plug<00:02:47.370> as<00:02:47.610> well<00:02:47.790> as<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.060> should<00:02:48.769> obviously

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
the plug as well as it should obviously

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.520 
the plug as well as it should obviously
just<00:02:50.310> kind<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:52.190> suck<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.340> down<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:55.260> make

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
just kind of to suck it down in you make

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.940 
just kind of to suck it down in you make
the<00:02:55.680> contact<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.459> plug<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.799> also

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the contact with the plug and you also

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.400 
the contact with the plug and you also
obviously<00:02:59.519> need<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.970> extension<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:01.079> I<00:03:01.200> have

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
obviously need a extension like I have

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.309 
obviously need a extension like I have
here<00:03:02.180> even<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.239> little<00:03:03.359> longer<00:03:03.690> one<00:03:03.930> would<00:03:04.170> be

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
here even a little longer one would be

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.309 
here even a little longer one would be
good<00:03:05.269> okay<00:03:06.269> we're<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.690> hit<00:03:07.019> fast

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
good okay we're going to hit fast

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.009 
good okay we're going to hit fast
forward<00:03:07.470> again<00:03:07.739> here<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.310> remove<00:03:08.670> that

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
forward again here as I remove that

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.479 
forward again here as I remove that
spark<00:03:10.019> plug<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.650> get<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:10.890> loose<00:03:11.129> with<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
spark plug you can get it loose with the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.920 
spark plug you can get it loose with the
wrench<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.819> then<00:03:11.970> pretty<00:03:12.390> much<00:03:12.510> just<00:03:12.660> turn<00:03:12.810> it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
wrench and then pretty much just turn it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.809 
wrench and then pretty much just turn it
with<00:03:13.019> your<00:03:13.140> hands<00:03:14.810> okay<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.200> said<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
with your hands okay so like I said the

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.520 
with your hands okay so like I said the
grommet<00:03:17.819> in<00:03:17.910> my<00:03:18.150> sock<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.049> not<00:03:19.200> very<00:03:19.349> good

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
grommet in my sock it's not very good

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.979 
grommet in my sock it's not very good
some<00:03:19.769> single<00:03:20.160> piece<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.459> paper<00:03:20.609> towel<00:03:20.870> kind<00:03:21.870> of

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
some single piece of paper towel kind of

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.250 
some single piece of paper towel kind of
stuff<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.349> in<00:03:22.440> there<00:03:22.530> with<00:03:22.680> my<00:03:22.829> pinky<00:03:25.400> use<00:03:26.400> that

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
stuff it in there with my pinky use that

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.229 
stuff it in there with my pinky use that
once<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.410> sticks<00:03:28.650> down<00:03:28.919> onto<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.370> spark<00:03:30.180> plug

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
once it sticks down onto this spark plug

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:40.280 
once it sticks down onto this spark plug
should<00:03:31.430> get<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.459> good<00:03:32.819> grip<00:03:33.090> on

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.370 

okay

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
okay

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.640 
okay
spark<00:03:43.380> plugs<00:03:43.590> right<00:03:43.770> up<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.040> out<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:46.440> want<00:03:46.620> to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
spark plugs right up and out you want to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.070 
spark plugs right up and out you want to
make<00:03:46.800> sure<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.430> check<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.510> spark<00:03:48.810> plug

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
make sure that you check the spark plug

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.960 
make sure that you check the spark plug
gap<00:03:49.380> which<00:03:49.710> is<00:03:49.740> basically<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.460> distance

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
gap which is basically the distance

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.830 
gap which is basically the distance
between<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.510> diode<00:03:52.520> and<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:55.460> tip<00:03:56.460> and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
between the diode and the this tip and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.670 
between the diode and the this tip and
this<00:03:57.840> vehicle<00:03:58.380> calls<00:03:58.770> for<00:03:59.070> 0.050<00:04:00.500> which<00:04:01.500> if

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
this vehicle calls for 0.050 which if

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.900 
this vehicle calls for 0.050 which if
you<00:04:01.770> have<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.920> tool<00:04:02.250> like<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.430> which<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.790> a

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
you have a tool like this which is a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.980 
you have a tool like this which is a
spark<00:04:03.240> plug<00:04:03.270> gapping<00:04:03.630> tool<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.540> run<00:04:06.870> it

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
spark plug gapping tool you just run it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.870 
spark plug gapping tool you just run it
through<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:08.160> should<00:04:08.340> go<00:04:08.520> through<00:04:08.550> there

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
through and it should go through there

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.350 
through and it should go through there
with<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.000> little<00:04:09.480> bit<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.720> resistance<00:04:11.030> okay<00:04:12.030> and

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
with a little bit of resistance okay and

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.930 
with a little bit of resistance okay and
then<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.080> use<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.920> either<00:04:14.310> kind<00:04:14.790> of

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
then you use this to either kind of

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.599 
then you use this to either kind of
release<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.200> or<00:04:16.380> bend<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.890> closer<00:04:17.130> if<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.459> need

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
release it or bend it closer if you need

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.800 
release it or bend it closer if you need
to<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.040> can<00:04:20.160> find<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.669> gap<00:04:21.030> usually<00:04:21.570> on

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
to and you can find the gap usually on

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.320 
to and you can find the gap usually on
this<00:04:22.230> decal<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:23.070> can<00:04:23.880> see<00:04:24.030> right<00:04:24.120> there<00:04:24.300> a

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
this decal you can see right there a

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.810 
this decal you can see right there a
spark<00:04:24.600> plug<00:04:24.810> gap<00:04:24.840> 20050<00:04:25.710> inch<00:04:26.010> or<00:04:26.400> one<00:04:26.580> point

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
spark plug gap 20050 inch or one point

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.480 
spark plug gap 20050 inch or one point
two<00:04:27.090> seven<00:04:27.120> millimeter<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:28.800> information

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
two seven millimeter this information

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.530 
two seven millimeter this information
usually<00:04:29.640> is<00:04:29.850> also<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:31.040> your<00:04:32.040> owner's<00:04:32.910> manual

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
usually is also in your owner's manual

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.290 
usually is also in your owner's manual
okay<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.470> did<00:04:34.620> just<00:04:34.770> put<00:04:34.919> these<00:04:35.910> plugs<00:04:36.210> a

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
okay and I did just put these plugs a

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.580 
okay and I did just put these plugs a

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
down through the center and it should

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:14.050 
down through the center and it should
thread<00:05:00.270> in<00:05:00.450> easily
