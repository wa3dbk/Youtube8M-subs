00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.450
 hello and we already have a harvest here 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:14.250
 see how cucumbers are grown in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.670
 one stem without extra green 3 what 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.140
 sheet normal sheet evidence of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 that vitamins do not have everything ok 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.949
 cucumber grows all the way further here 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.099
 look here she is 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.770
 ragged hi even all harvest 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.350
 not all stepchildren starred before being cut off from below 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:43.320
 the crop was taken and here they are cucumbers 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 look at 2 in the palace began to grow out 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.690
 sinuses 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 Agura river from understood that he can be given 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.840
 the harvest 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:02.640
 here and here it is generally required here 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:05.970
 even 3 and they all grow up and mature so 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.270
 and here's another down for quality here 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.420
 the very bottom come awake another notch 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.509
 on here I left it why because 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 So I will start these news 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.189
 these bottom here will be free and possible 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:29.000
 bottom this one this one 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:33.740
 then on existing at this plate 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.740
 by maternal here are all the leaves of varava 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.150
 and here we go let's show now 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.340
 the second option so here also see here 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.560
 cucumbers below 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.150
 grown all you can shoot here further 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.930
 above went see cucumbers 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.619
 all stepchildren are all broken out 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.050
 look here he appeared here it is necessary 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.880
 immediately break off a better break until they 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.150
 little you see 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.330
 which is not so painful for cucumber and 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.850
 the frame is small and if 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.070
 wait until it grows big it will 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.080
 firstly self- leakage secondly unsafe 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:21.410
 some microbes can get there and 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:28.060
 here is a whip look so well let's say 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:31.340
 so for our Russian manufacturer 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.170
 we want everything a lot here I am for you 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.820
 specifically made here such a whip with 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.459
 parcels that is here's a basement of two 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.450
 sheet and if you left three for you 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.510
 It will be even worse than climbing Les 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:52.480
 Here are a lot of cucumber but not a fact 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.820
 that they will all live to normal 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.730
 trade dress there are some may 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.110
 may even fall off with this 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.780
 growing cucumbers need more 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:11.090
 more often tear that is how they started 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.070
 He came to the presentation of his need 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.299
 break off immediately so they can grow 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.670
 other cucumbers 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:21.680
 otherwise the ovaries will begin 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:25.060
 dump it around like this and this 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.060
 You can still show here the passages 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.200
 here is also a small forest because 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.560
 stepson remains with two leaves video 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.900
 2 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.360
 here even three sheets for some reason turned out 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.900
 But in general, and leave two sheets of them 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.440
 more 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.150
 but it is not a good thing here here 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.569
 better not 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.829
 most like it more about 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:54.269
 to be seen here see here they are 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:58.900
 they are free to them they are all 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.849
 see the sun grow green cucumbers from 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.849
 and better the same as in the open field 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.209
 in the sun that is no different 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.420
 just the most picky so distributed 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:14.290
 smell awesome cucumber smell please 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:21.370
 heed the taste and what a knife to notice 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:27.880
 Dim here today, only here it is June 21 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:31.840
 For two weeks eat almost 9 June there 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.690
 very well May 9 planted well, as laid 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.539
 45 days after sprouting cucumbers 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.310
 we should expect the first harvest from us further 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.669
 a little bit earlier well probably because 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:49.919
 that in the greenhouse, show me another one from the river 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.919

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.490
 decide how to grow here or here 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:09.150
 where is the time 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:10.860
 or something like that I wish you 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.910
