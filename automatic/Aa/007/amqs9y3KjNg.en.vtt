otherwise<00:00:46.379> you'll<00:00:46.559> probably<00:00:46.710> end<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.100> losing

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
otherwise you'll probably end up losing

this<00:00:51.989> game<00:00:52.199> still<00:00:52.440> gonna<00:00:52.559> end<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.770> being<00:00:52.949> about

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
this game still gonna end up being about

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.410 
this game still gonna end up being about
eight<00:00:53.309> minutes<00:00:53.489> long<00:00:53.730> which<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:53.940> normally

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
eight minutes long which is normally

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.850 
eight minutes long which is normally
about<00:00:54.570> how<00:00:54.719> long<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> row<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> challenges

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
about how long in a row of challenges

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.959 
about how long in a row of challenges
and<00:00:55.949> that's<00:00:56.129> why<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> decided<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.610> speed<00:00:56.820> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and that's why I decided to speed this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:57.439 
and that's why I decided to speed this
one<00:00:57.120> up

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
one up

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.740 
one up
don't<00:00:57.960> nobody<00:00:58.230> wants<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> watch<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.750> 14

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
don't nobody wants to watch this for 14

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.060 
don't nobody wants to watch this for 14
minutes<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.109> how<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.350> throat<00:01:01.710> challenged

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
minutes on how to be throat challenged

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.830 
minutes on how to be throat challenged
because<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.340> already<00:01:02.520> should<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.600> able<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
because we already should be able to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
because we already should be able to
kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.559> reasonably<00:01:05.280> far<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
kind of get reasonably far and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.210 
kind of get reasonably far and
understand<00:01:06.060> how<00:01:06.210> far<00:01:06.390> we're<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
understand how far we're going so I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.140 
understand how far we're going so I
guess<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> biggest<00:01:08.640> problem<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> you're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
guess the biggest problem that you're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.929 
guess the biggest problem that you're
gonna<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:10.049> bit<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.070> demon

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
gonna have here is a bit of the demon

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:12.770 
gonna have here is a bit of the demon
amps<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.510> they're<00:01:12.659> actually

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
amps over here they're actually

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
amps over here they're actually
surprisingly<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.740> against<00:01:14.100> your<00:01:14.400> Tesla

you think about it like that 14 minutes
divided<00:01:47.430> by<00:01:47.520> 6<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.990> 2<00:01:49.350> minute<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.070> like

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
divided by 6 you have 2 minute and like

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.910 
divided by 6 you have 2 minute and like
20<00:01:50.700> seconds<00:01:51.799> freakin<00:01:52.799> rounds<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:54.180> crazy<00:01:54.450> man

that<00:03:15.230> could<00:03:15.350> work<00:03:15.440> out<00:03:15.590> too<00:03:15.799> but<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.100> feel

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
that could work out too but I do feel

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.640 
that could work out too but I do feel
like<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:17.000> extra<00:03:17.690> magic<00:03:18.019> just<00:03:18.230> kind<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.440> gets

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
like the extra magic just kind of gets

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.050 
like the extra magic just kind of gets
you<00:03:18.709> down<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.280> what<00:03:19.400> towers<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.760> want<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:19.970> get

you down for what towers you want to get
to<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.209> late-game<00:03:20.650> sometimes<00:03:21.650> will<00:03:21.769> actually

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
to the late-game sometimes will actually

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.259 
to the late-game sometimes will actually
just<00:03:22.130> build<00:03:22.340> every<00:03:22.640> single<00:03:22.880> Tower<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.239> I
