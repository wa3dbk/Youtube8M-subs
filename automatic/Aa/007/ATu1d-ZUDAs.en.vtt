otherwise<00:01:52.430> if<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:52.880> look<00:01:53.000> carefully<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.630> will

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
otherwise if you look carefully it will

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.270 
otherwise if you look carefully it will
start<00:01:54.049> to<00:01:54.140> burn<00:01:54.290> on<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.500> outside<00:01:54.560> if<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.039> see

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
start to burn on the outside if you see

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.859 
start to burn on the outside if you see
it<00:01:55.340> getting<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.670> bit<00:01:55.820> too<00:01:56.030> dark<00:01:56.210> on<00:01:56.390> one<00:01:56.600> side

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
it getting a bit too dark on one side

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.289 
it getting a bit too dark on one side
you<00:01:57.530> can<00:01:57.590> just<00:01:57.860> move<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.159> pan<00:01:58.399> off<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.700> heat<00:01:59.119> a

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
you can just move the pan off the heat a

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.609 
you can just move the pan off the heat a
little<00:01:59.390> bit<00:01:59.659> and<00:01:59.869> give<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.200> another<00:02:00.320> little

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
little bit and give it another little

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.930 
little bit and give it another little
brushing<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.700> water<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:04.490> should<00:02:04.759> take

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
brushing of water so this should take

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.730 
brushing of water so this should take
about<00:02:05.000> five<00:02:05.720> minutes<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.259> if<00:02:06.320> you're<00:02:06.470> looking

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
about five minutes and if you're looking

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.949 
about five minutes and if you're looking
for<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.039> in<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> pan<00:02:07.549> now<00:02:07.819> see<00:02:08.690> it's<00:02:08.810> nearly

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
for the in the pan now see it's nearly

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.040 
for the in the pan now see it's nearly
there<00:02:09.229> also<00:02:09.590> resist<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.519> urge<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.870> get<00:02:11.989> a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
there also resist the urge to get a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.050 
there also resist the urge to get a
spoon<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.530> start<00:02:12.680> stirring<00:02:12.980> because<00:02:13.790> it's

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
spoon and start stirring because it's

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.850 
spoon and start stirring because it's
quite<00:02:14.269> likely<00:02:14.510> if<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.780> do<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.620> will

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
quite likely if you do that that it will

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.470 
quite likely if you do that that it will
crystallize<00:02:18.670> okay<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:19.730> that's<00:02:20.030> now<00:02:20.269> nice

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
crystallize okay so that's now nice

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.530

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
surface we're going to do is that to cut

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.360 
surface we're going to do is that to cut
this<00:03:43.690> in<00:03:44.710> two<00:03:45.710> pieces<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:47.650> then<00:03:48.650> just<00:03:48.680> roll<00:03:49.160> it

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
this in two pieces and then just roll it

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.440 
this in two pieces and then just roll it
out<00:03:49.490> a<00:03:49.820> rough<00:03:50.810> kind<00:03:50.990> of<00:03:51.140> rectangular<00:03:51.650> shape

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
out a rough kind of rectangular shape

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.440 
out a rough kind of rectangular shape
you<00:03:53.450> want<00:03:53.660> each<00:03:53.870> piece<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.710> be<00:03:54.920> under<00:03:55.850> half<00:03:56.300> a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
you want each piece to be under half a

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.330 
you want each piece to be under half a
centimeter<00:03:56.990> so<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.890> kind<00:03:58.250> of

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
centimeter so that that kind of

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.870 
centimeter so that that kind of
thickness<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:59.540> next<00:03:59.990> step<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.800> to<00:04:01.220> take<00:04:01.460> the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
thickness the next step is to take the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.700 
thickness the next step is to take the
cinnamon<00:04:02.510> butter<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:04.160> just<00:04:04.340> put<00:04:04.490> half<00:04:04.760> on
