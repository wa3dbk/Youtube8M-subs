 inclined ar 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.649
 I would call it a yellow book 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.319
 for the free world plot 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:15.369
 a novel 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.720
 I connect noprofit 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.369

 euroma 2 pc times will not appear 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.009
 delicious I know for my early twentieth century 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.699
 and instead of being a story 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.589
 with the inscription 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.660
 only Pavia 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.220
 it's a story 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.510
 inp li 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.640
 the fourth part a part the form 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.100
 but 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.710
 a part 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.040
 how to say reflex a 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.150
 also international 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.410
 we 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.670
 good company from Pavia as we are very much in Sardinian 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.490
 we find it hard to believe then 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.970
 may have been in some way 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.089
 involved 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.550
 in something 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.730
 I go beyond the borders not only Maldives 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.600
 complilazione 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.960
 and I have now made this story 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.440
 in which 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.850
 a pavia assure you if you buy a crime 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 because it is not an end in itself name looks 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.750
 is strictly one 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.060
 a story 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.680
 small town 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.190
 but it concerns 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.830
 a rivalry 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.830
 between italy and france 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.510
 for the rest rita phases 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.560
 they are pode eseico michele ass 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.760
 but why you 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.940

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.440
 of cuneo holding 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.760
 obviously to have I tell that then I really don't attack color 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.000
 I say I believe because ours is a graspable citroen 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.790
 for iron to be able to understand it 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.500
 I think of colombo know them I believe that he knew account of this story 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.379
 and then for the rest I love only a rapidly written novel 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.569
 and certainly not my sense I wrote in 12 days in the south 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.319
 with the urgency of 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.189
 call 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.189
 Gianni Iuculano wanted to publish it 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.949
 and all that remains for me is to say and hopefully the web is not good 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.109
 also I'm a merchant 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.019
 I hope well for Gianni who makes it 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.679
 now we hope good 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.529
 what interest to enjoy 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:48.729
 the task of a book of this kind is just that of fun 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.119
 do not create 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:55.399
 problems do not send messages in all those beautiful things 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.139
 don't need it 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.579
