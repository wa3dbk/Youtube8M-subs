not familiar with because i have never

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.130 
not familiar with because i have never
dyed<00:00:15.599> my<00:00:15.750> hair<00:00:15.780> once<00:00:16.170> I've<00:00:16.410> got<00:00:16.619> natural<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:18.140> had

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
dyed my hair once I've got natural I had

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.250 
dyed my hair once I've got natural I had
kept<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.590> its<00:00:19.859> own<00:00:20.070> color<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.660> only<00:00:21.990> thing

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
kept it its own color on the only thing

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.750 
kept it its own color on the only thing
the<00:00:22.500> closest<00:00:22.859> thing<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.100> kind<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.730> guess

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the closest thing I kind of I guess

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.439 
the closest thing I kind of I guess
technically<00:00:24.480> done<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.050> diet<00:00:25.260> would<00:00:25.949> be

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
technically done to diet would be

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.429 
technically done to diet would be
squeezing<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.779> bit<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> lemon<00:00:28.199> juice<00:00:28.230> in

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
squeezing a little bit of lemon juice in

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.200 
squeezing a little bit of lemon juice in
my<00:00:28.650> hair<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> Sun

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
my hair and then going out in the Sun

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.429 
my hair and then going out in the Sun
and<00:00:30.390> hoping<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> will<00:00:30.840> kind<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.080> lighten<00:00:31.230> up<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and hoping it will kind of lighten up a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.010 
and hoping it will kind of lighten up a
little<00:00:31.529> bit<00:00:31.679> he<00:00:31.980> did<00:00:32.340> lighten<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.719> only

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
little bit he did lighten up but I only

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.440 
little bit he did lighten up but I only
did<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.230> once<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> don't<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.489> about<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
did that once so I don't know about the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
did that once so I don't know about the
damage<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.200> she<00:00:37.440> could<00:00:37.590> possibly<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.070> on

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
damage that she could possibly do on

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.420 
damage that she could possibly do on
natural<00:00:38.610> hair<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.210> regard<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> dying<00:00:40.430> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
assistance but um I can't I can't simply

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.310 
assistance but um I can't I can't simply
can't<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.470> disappointed<00:01:11.130> no<00:01:11.670> kidding<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
can't so disappointed no kidding but I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.280 
can't so disappointed no kidding but I
would<00:01:14.070> assume<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.299> would<00:01:15.869> over<00:01:16.259> time

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
would assume that it would over time

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.130 
would assume that it would over time
damage<00:01:16.830> your<00:01:16.979> hair<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.310> bit<00:01:17.430> because

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
damage your hair a little bit because

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.219 
damage your hair a little bit because
dying<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.700> sort<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.180> drying<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
dying is just it's sort of drying to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.450 
dying is just it's sort of drying to
your<00:01:22.350> hair<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:24.020> you're<00:01:25.020> asking<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.560> since

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
your hair and you're asking it since

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
your hair and you're asking it since
you'll<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.640> dying<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.180> route<00:01:27.420> basically<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you'll be dying the route basically to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
you'll be dying the route basically to
do<00:01:28.740> touch-ups<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:30.000> grows<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
do touch-ups as it grows out and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
do touch-ups as it grows out and
everything<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:32.009> assume<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.520> could

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
everything so I would assume it it could

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
everything so I would assume it it could
be<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.180> damaging<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.920> if

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
be a little damaging but I think that if

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.289 
be a little damaging but I think that if
you<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.869> deep<00:01:36.869> conditioning<00:01:37.530> treatments<00:01:38.299> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you do deep conditioning treatments and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.609 
you do deep conditioning treatments and
you<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> stick<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.170> using<00:01:41.100> henna<00:01:42.229> as<00:01:43.229> opposed

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
you do stick to using henna as opposed

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.940 
you do stick to using henna as opposed
to<00:01:43.740> regular<00:01:44.070> dying<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.770> chemicals<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to regular dying you know chemicals and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.010 
to regular dying you know chemicals and
things<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:48.270> will<00:01:48.420> probably<00:01:48.840> be

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
things like that you will probably be

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.899 
things like that you will probably be
better<00:01:49.200> off<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.649> would<00:01:49.799> assume<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.700> what<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
better off I would assume that's what I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
better off I would assume that's what I
think<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.649> more

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
think if you know a little bit more

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
think if you know a little bit more
about<00:01:52.979> henna<00:01:53.220> dying<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.630> natural<00:01:54.960> hair

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
about henna dying and natural hair

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.870 
about henna dying and natural hair
please<00:01:55.439> put<00:01:56.009> your<00:01:56.100> comments<00:01:56.460> down<00:01:56.549> here<00:01:56.729> so

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
she can see your answers because you

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.580 
she can see your answers because you
probably<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> bit<00:01:59.159> better<00:01:59.250> than<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.460> do<00:02:00.590> but

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
probably know a bit better than I do but

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
probably know a bit better than I do but
I<00:02:01.649> would<00:02:01.890> assume<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.729> would<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.939> okay<00:02:03.299> if

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
I would assume that you would be okay if

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.359 
I would assume that you would be okay if
you<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.990> kept<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> deep<00:02:04.799> conditioning

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
you just kept up the deep conditioning

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:05.630 
you just kept up the deep conditioning
tree

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
tree

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.670 
tree
and<00:02:05.970> used<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.600> more<00:02:06.840> natural<00:02:07.290> approach<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and used a more natural approach to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400 
and used a more natural approach to
dyeing<00:02:08.009> your<00:02:08.160> hair<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.700> henna<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.959> hope

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

Woollett<00:02:18.240> bantu<00:02:18.569> knot<00:02:18.780> out<00:02:18.810> give<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> same

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
Woollett bantu knot out give the same

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.800 
Woollett bantu knot out give the same
results<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.520> curly<00:02:20.880> fro<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:23.720> don't<00:02:24.720> know<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
results as a curly fro I don't know I

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.140 
results as a curly fro I don't know I
think<00:02:24.990> bantu<00:02:25.950> knot<00:02:26.100> out<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.640> would<00:02:26.910> be

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
think bantu knot out it would be

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.480 
think bantu knot out it would be
slightly<00:02:28.020> different<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.680> curl<00:02:29.010> would<00:02:29.280> be

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
slightly different the curl would be

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.330 
slightly different the curl would be
kind<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.530> random<00:02:31.530> because<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.250> just

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
kind of like random because it's just

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.960 
kind of like random because it's just
kind<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.000> mean<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.570> don't<00:02:33.959> know<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.970> haven't

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
kind of I mean I don't know I haven't

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.210 
kind of I mean I don't know I haven't
done<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> bantu<00:02:36.630> knot<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.050> long<00:02:37.380> time<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> am

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
done a bantu knot in a long time so I am

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.610 
done a bantu knot in a long time so I am
not<00:02:38.459> positive<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.660> would<00:02:40.080> assume<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.500> it's

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
not positive but I would assume it it's

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.290 
not positive but I would assume it it's
somewhat<00:02:41.040> similar<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.700> think<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.090> still

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
somewhat similar but I think it still

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.449 
somewhat similar but I think it still
has<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> little<00:02:42.630> bit<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.140> different<00:02:43.590> look<00:02:44.400> to

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
has a little bit of a different look to

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.250 
has a little bit of a different look to
it<00:02:44.730> anyone<00:02:45.060> who's<00:02:45.330> tried<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.750> ban<00:02:45.870> sit<00:02:46.050> out

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
it anyone who's tried to ban sit out

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.650 
it anyone who's tried to ban sit out
same<00:02:47.100> goes<00:02:47.310> here<00:02:47.340> let<00:02:48.239> me<00:02:48.360> know<00:02:48.390> your<00:02:48.630> thoughts

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
same goes here let me know your thoughts

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.030 
same goes here let me know your thoughts
because<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.170> haven't<00:02:49.380> done<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> while<00:02:49.830> and

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
because I haven't done in a while and

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.460 
because I haven't done in a while and
I've<00:02:50.160> been<00:02:50.280> meaning<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.350> if

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
I've been meaning to but I think that if

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.259 
I've been meaning to but I think that if
my<00:02:52.650> hair<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:52.860> wet<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.580> do<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.940> it's<00:02:54.150> going

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
my hair is wet and I do that it's going

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.910 
my hair is wet and I do that it's going
to<00:02:54.360> take<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> long<00:02:54.810> time<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> dry<00:02:55.380> cuz<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.769> like

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
to take a long time to dry cuz it's like

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.080 
to take a long time to dry cuz it's like
not<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.480> know<00:02:57.630> it's<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:59.160> it's

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
not it's like you know it's it just it's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.270 
not it's like you know it's it just it's
not<00:03:00.239> out<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.780> when<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.350> hear<00:03:01.590> kind<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.010> curled

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
not out and when I hear kind of curled

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.160 
not out and when I hear kind of curled
up<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.640> balled<00:03:02.880> up<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.209> takes<00:03:03.360> long<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.750> dry<00:03:03.930> so

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
up and balled up it takes long to dry so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.810 
up and balled up it takes long to dry so
that's<00:03:04.380> why<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> would<00:03:04.680> try<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:04.890> yet<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.459> like

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
that's why I would try it yet but I like

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.970 
that's why I would try it yet but I like
to<00:03:05.850> try<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.120> sooner<00:03:06.450> or<00:03:06.540> later<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.050> if<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.890> ever

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
to try it sooner or later so if I ever

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.500 
to try it sooner or later so if I ever
do<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.400> course<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.850> will<00:03:08.940> share<00:03:09.239> with<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.420> guys

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
do of course I will share with you guys

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.580 
do of course I will share with you guys
and<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.900> will<00:03:09.959> let<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.260> know<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.500> results<00:03:10.860> um<00:03:11.510> is

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
and I will let you know my results um is

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.479 
and I will let you know my results um is
my<00:03:13.590> curly<00:03:14.370> fro<00:03:14.640> or<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.840> wrote<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:16.890> myself<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.459> I

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
my curly fro or I wrote for myself so I

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.860 
my curly fro or I wrote for myself so I
would<00:03:17.700> understand<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.180> but<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.480> guess

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
would understand it but I guess

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.479 
would understand it but I guess
technically<00:03:19.230> would<00:03:19.380> be<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.620> your<00:03:19.890> curly<00:03:20.190> fro

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
technically would be is your curly fro

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.610 
technically would be is your curly fro
curlier<00:03:21.360> because<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.959> using<00:03:22.290> smaller

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
curlier because of using smaller

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.250 
curlier because of using smaller
sections<00:03:23.250> um<00:03:23.959> no<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:24.989> think<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:27.260> think

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
sections um no I think it's just I think

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.800 
sections um no I think it's just I think
it's<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:28.769> my<00:03:29.220> my<00:03:29.760> hair<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.360> think<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:30.690> just

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
it's just my my hair I think it's just

it's just my my hair I think it's just
my<00:03:30.900> curls<00:03:31.230> because<00:03:31.320> i<00:03:31.470> don't<00:03:31.650> use<00:03:31.769> small

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390

Carrie<00:04:11.159> no<00:04:11.519> I'm<00:04:11.640> just<00:04:11.700> kidding<00:04:11.879> but<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.450> think

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
Carrie no I'm just kidding but I think

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.410 
Carrie no I'm just kidding but I think
it's<00:04:13.050> just<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.650> product<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.159> i'm<00:04:14.400> using<00:04:14.640> and

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
it's just the product that i'm using and

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.050 
it's just the product that i'm using and
despite<00:04:16.139> my<00:04:16.739> hair<00:04:17.130> texture<00:04:17.519> i<00:04:17.549> think<00:04:17.880> that's

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
despite my hair texture i think that's

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.550 
despite my hair texture i think that's
what<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.910> method<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.389> use

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
what it is is the method that I use

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.090 
what it is is the method that I use
faster<00:04:22.560> than<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.949> bantu<00:04:23.490> knot<00:04:24.000> out<00:04:24.440> method<00:04:25.440> um<00:04:25.710> I

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
faster than a bantu knot out method um I

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.200 
faster than a bantu knot out method um I
think<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:26.760> cuz<00:04:27.060> bantu<00:04:27.419> knots<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:28.020> mean<00:04:28.820> well<00:04:29.820> it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
think so cuz bantu knots I mean well it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.480 
think so cuz bantu knots I mean well it
depends<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.930> don't<00:04:31.800> know<00:04:31.979> if<00:04:32.160> you're<00:04:32.280> using

rubber bands to secure the bantu knots
and<00:04:35.460> i<00:04:36.440> don't<00:04:37.440> know<00:04:37.560> i<00:04:38.300> would<00:04:39.300> assume<00:04:39.919> that<00:04:40.919> you

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
and i don't know i would assume that you

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.620 
and i don't know i would assume that you
would<00:04:41.280> have<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.610> do<00:04:42.260> more<00:04:43.260> band<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.860> nuts<00:04:44.100> then

would have to do more band to nuts then

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.180 
would have to do more band to nuts then
then<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.840> twist<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.680> roll<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.039> tuck

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
then the twist that you roll it tuck

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.920 
then the twist that you roll it tuck
into<00:04:47.370> themselves<00:04:47.669> so<00:04:48.000> i<00:04:48.030> would<00:04:48.270> i'm<00:04:48.720> gonna

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
into themselves so i would i'm gonna

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.779 
into themselves so i would i'm gonna
just<00:04:49.080> go<00:04:49.199> ahead<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.380> say<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.770> curly<00:04:50.610> fro

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
just go ahead and say the curly fro

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.060 
just go ahead and say the curly fro
technique<00:04:51.210> without<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.500> rollers<00:04:52.830> without

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
technique without the rollers without

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.040 
technique without the rollers without
the<00:04:53.190> foam<00:04:53.370> rollers<00:04:53.639> is<00:04:53.760> pretty<00:04:54.150> fast<00:04:54.570> i<00:04:54.870> would

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
the foam rollers is pretty fast i would

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.360 
the foam rollers is pretty fast i would
think<00:04:55.169> if<00:04:55.289> i<00:04:55.350> can<00:04:55.500> do<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.620> in<00:04:55.800> 10<00:04:55.949> minutes<00:04:56.130> i

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
think if i can do it in 10 minutes i

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.439 
think if i can do it in 10 minutes i
don't<00:04:56.639> think<00:04:56.699> i<00:04:56.880> would<00:04:56.940> be<00:04:57.090> able<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.240> do<00:04:57.360> the

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
don't think i would be able to do the

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.570 
don't think i would be able to do the
bantu<00:04:57.780> knot<00:04:58.500> one<00:04:58.740> intended<00:04:59.100> i<00:04:59.220> think<00:04:59.400> it<00:04:59.460> would

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
bantu knot one intended i think it would

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.770 
bantu knot one intended i think it would
take<00:04:59.699> me<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.850> bit<00:04:59.940> longer<00:05:00.060> because<00:05:00.360> i<00:05:00.539> would<00:05:00.660> be

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
take me a bit longer because i would be

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.840 
take me a bit longer because i would be
so<00:05:01.050> i<00:05:01.350> want<00:05:01.949> to<00:05:01.979> make<00:05:02.039> sure<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.699> hair

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
so i want to make sure that the hair

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.909 
so i want to make sure that the hair
smooth<00:05:03.270> out<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.750> then<00:05:03.900> wrapped<00:05:04.169> around<00:05:04.350> you

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
smooth out and then wrapped around you

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.790 
smooth out and then wrapped around you
know<00:05:05.039> is<00:05:05.250> as<00:05:06.240> tight<00:05:06.510> as<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.720> can<00:05:06.780> be<00:05:06.990> but<00:05:07.229> not<00:05:07.500> so

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
know is as tight as it can be but not so

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.529 
know is as tight as it can be but not so
tight<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:08.039> it's<00:05:08.280> pulling<00:05:08.520> on<00:05:08.639> my<00:05:08.760> scalp<00:05:09.000> so<00:05:09.300> i

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
tight that it's pulling on my scalp so i

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:10.969 
tight that it's pulling on my scalp so i
think<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.050> would<00:05:10.169> take<00:05:10.289> me<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.440> bit<00:05:10.560> longer<00:05:10.680> to

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
think it would take me a bit longer to

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.020 
think it would take me a bit longer to
do<00:05:11.070> that<00:05:12.919> how<00:05:13.919> would<00:05:14.100> your<00:05:14.220> hair<00:05:14.370> go<00:05:14.580> into<00:05:14.880> an

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
do that how would your hair go into an

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.909 
do that how would your hair go into an
afro<00:05:15.360> without<00:05:15.660> falling<00:05:16.110> forward<00:05:16.380> in<00:05:16.770> the

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
afro without falling forward in the

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.750 
afro without falling forward in the
middle<00:05:18.500> well<00:05:19.500> i<00:05:19.530> don't<00:05:19.889> think<00:05:20.190> my<00:05:20.490> hair<00:05:20.729> would

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
middle well i don't think my hair would

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.070 
middle well i don't think my hair would
do<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.240> i<00:05:21.300> think<00:05:21.450> my<00:05:21.690> hair<00:05:21.870> would<00:05:21.900> either

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
do that i think my hair would either

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.860 
do that i think my hair would either
fall<00:05:22.380> forward<00:05:22.770> or<00:05:22.889> fall<00:05:23.070> back<00:05:23.570> unless<00:05:24.570> it's

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
fall forward or fall back unless it's

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.589 
fall forward or fall back unless it's
just<00:05:25.289> like<00:05:25.740> washed<00:05:26.070> if<00:05:26.400> it's<00:05:26.610> just<00:05:26.880> just

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
just like washed if it's just just

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.080 
just like washed if it's just just
washed<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.200> that's<00:05:28.410> it<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:29.729> just<00:05:29.880> kind<00:05:30.060> of

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
washed and that's it and I just kind of

washed and that's it and I just kind of
pick<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.360> out<00:05:30.450> then<00:05:30.990> my<00:05:31.110> hair<00:05:31.320> stands<00:05:31.560> up<00:05:31.710> a

hair<00:05:36.720> add<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.250> little<00:05:38.250> bit<00:05:38.430> of<00:05:38.490> maybe<00:05:39.150> a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
hair add a little bit of maybe a

kind of pulled back if your hair is
longer<00:05:45.150> like<00:05:45.360> mine<00:05:45.590> because<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.620> know<00:05:46.680> my<00:05:46.919> hair

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130

longer like mine because I know my hair
dries<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.729> kind<00:05:48.539> of<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:50.220> dries<00:05:50.460> up<00:05:50.669> like<00:05:50.880> if<00:05:51.000> you

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
dries it kind of it dries up like if you

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.750 
dries it kind of it dries up like if you
saw<00:05:51.240> my<00:05:51.479> my<00:05:51.870> hair<00:05:52.050> drawing<00:05:52.289> video<00:05:52.650> my<00:05:53.580> hair

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
saw my my hair drawing video my hair

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.430 
saw my my hair drawing video my hair
starts<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.090> dry<00:05:54.389> and<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:54.870> starts<00:05:55.169> to<00:05:55.229> kind<00:05:55.349> of

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
starts to dry and it starts to kind of

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.320 
starts to dry and it starts to kind of
come<00:05:55.590> up<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> little<00:05:55.830> bit<00:05:56.070> so<00:05:56.580> I<00:05:56.610> private<00:05:57.240> do

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
come up a little bit so I private do

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.839 
come up a little bit so I private do
that<00:05:57.560> otherwise<00:05:58.560> I<00:05:59.099> would<00:05:59.160> probably<00:05:59.669> just

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
that otherwise I would probably just

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.070 
that otherwise I would probably just
take<00:06:00.120> this<00:06:00.389> and<00:06:00.660> then<00:06:01.500> my<00:06:01.770> pin<00:06:02.610> it<00:06:02.870> so<00:06:03.870> that<00:06:04.050> the

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
take this and then my pin it so that the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.500 
take this and then my pin it so that the
rest<00:06:04.500> was<00:06:04.800> kind<00:06:05.130> of<00:06:05.280> you<00:06:05.460> know<00:06:05.490> up<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:06.330> doing

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
rest was kind of you know up and doing

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.210 
rest was kind of you know up and doing
it<00:06:06.630> don't<00:06:06.750> think<00:06:07.020> because<00:06:07.289> now<00:06:07.620> my<00:06:07.860> hair<00:06:08.039> does

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220
