00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
this we pull you can see that we have

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.280 
this we pull you can see that we have
some<00:00:01.890> excess<00:00:02.340> mortar<00:00:02.760> in<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.540> top<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.990> bottom

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
some excess mortar in the top and bottom

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.840 
some excess mortar in the top and bottom
so<00:00:04.890> I'm<00:00:05.009> going<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.220> take<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.520> through<00:00:05.730> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
so I'm going to take you through the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.660 
so I'm going to take you through the
steps<00:00:05.879> on<00:00:06.810> how<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.200> clear<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.919> out<00:00:08.130> so<00:00:08.610> you

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
steps on how you clear that out so you

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.370 
steps on how you clear that out so you
can<00:00:08.940> fit<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.480> full<00:00:09.719> device<00:00:12.019> when<00:00:13.019> setting

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
can fit in the full device when setting

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.950 
can fit in the full device when setting
your<00:00:13.410> drill<00:00:13.969> to<00:00:14.969> clean<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.570> weep<00:00:15.719> hole

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
your drill to clean out the weep hole

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.590 
your drill to clean out the weep hole
it's<00:00:16.170> very<00:00:16.350> important<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> few<00:00:17.190> things

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
it's very important to do a few things

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.720 
it's very important to do a few things
one<00:00:18.600> find<00:00:18.990> yourself<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.439> end<00:00:19.619> brick<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.550> this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
one find yourself an end brick like this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.820 
one find yourself an end brick like this
one<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.689> see<00:00:21.869> how<00:00:22.020> deep<00:00:22.320> your

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
one here so you can see how deep your

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.980 
one here so you can see how deep your
brick<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.330> because<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> wall<00:00:24.720> behind

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
brick is because in the wall behind

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.779 
brick is because in the wall behind
these<00:00:25.380> other<00:00:25.590> bricks<00:00:26.630> are<00:00:27.710> important<00:00:28.789> parts

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
these other bricks are important parts

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.400 
these other bricks are important parts
of<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> wall<00:00:30.150> structure<00:00:30.689> including

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
of the wall structure including

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.000 
of the wall structure including
insulation<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.360> vapor<00:00:33.360> barrier<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.200> paper

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
insulation and vapor barrier and paper

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.360 
insulation and vapor barrier and paper
and<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.149> don't<00:00:36.329> want<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> mess<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.620> so

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and you don't want to mess with that so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
and you don't want to mess with that so
it's<00:00:39.300> important<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> when<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.110> set<00:00:40.320> your

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it's important that when you set your

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.760 
it's important that when you set your
drill<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.250> does<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.670> extend<00:00:42.440> deeper<00:00:43.440> than<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
drill it does not extend deeper than the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.979 
drill it does not extend deeper than the
brick<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> gauge<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.899> we

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
brick so we use this as a gauge so we

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.200 
brick so we use this as a gauge so we
can<00:00:46.140> stop<00:00:46.489> quite<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.700> short<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
can stop quite a bit short of that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
can stop quite a bit short of that
because<00:00:48.570> rid<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.870> mice<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.410> does<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.800> actually

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
because rid of mice it does not actually

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.880 
because rid of mice it does not actually
penetrate<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> full<00:00:51.680> depth<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> brick<00:00:54.890> so

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
penetrate the full depth of the brick so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.450 
penetrate the full depth of the brick so
when<00:00:56.190> setting<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.760> drill<00:00:57.059> make<00:00:57.600> sure<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
when setting your drill make sure that

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.800 
when setting your drill make sure that
you're<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.609> plugged<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:04.850> there<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you're not plugged in there so this is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.840 
you're not plugged in there so this is
as<00:01:06.960> far<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.710> gonna<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.950> able<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.369> drill<00:01:08.640> in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
as far as I'm gonna be able to drill in

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
as far as I'm gonna be able to drill in
and<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.830> reach<00:01:11.159> beyond

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and as you can see I do not reach beyond

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.570 
and as you can see I do not reach beyond
the<00:01:12.570> back<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> brick<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> can't<00:01:14.340> do<00:01:14.460> any

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the back of the brick so I can't do any

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.980 
the back of the brick so I can't do any
damage<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.330> gonna<00:01:15.420> tighten<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.930> up

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
damage so I'm just gonna tighten that up

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:33.850 
damage so I'm just gonna tighten that up
and<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.560> I'm<00:01:16.650> gonna<00:01:16.740> plug<00:01:17.070> in

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.860 

there's<00:01:34.860> excess<00:01:35.220> dust<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.910> bits<00:01:36.240> inside<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
there's excess dust and bits inside you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.330 
there's excess dust and bits inside you
can<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.350> use<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.620> drill<00:01:37.860> bit<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.070> help

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
can actually use the drill bit to help

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.400 
can actually use the drill bit to help
you<00:01:38.430> draw<00:01:38.670> them<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.260> not

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
you draw them out and if that's not

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.220 
you draw them out and if that's not
enough<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.460> grab<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.510> household<00:01:45.960> hand

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
enough you can grab the household hand

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.200 
enough you can grab the household hand
back<00:01:49.160> or<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.460> grab<00:01:50.610> something<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
back or you can grab something the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.250 
back or you can grab something the
equivalent<00:01:51.660> that's<00:01:51.720> got<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.110> more

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
equivalent that's got a little more

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.540 
equivalent that's got a little more
power<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.790> clean<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.150> hole
