it their own forge well actually started
as<00:00:53.460> five<00:00:53.730> separate<00:00:54.329> maps<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.620> said

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
as five separate maps and I said

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
as five separate maps and I said
wouldn't<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.519> be<00:00:56.609> cool<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.350> could

interesting pieces of geometry we wanted

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
interesting pieces of geometry we wanted
to<00:01:44.490> give<00:01:44.670> people<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.090> variety<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.630> locations

that they could forge in a different way

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.410 
that they could forge in a different way
so<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.509> Gulch<00:01:48.780> an<00:01:49.049> island<00:01:49.409> an<00:01:49.619> interior<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.700> very

let's use a lot of interesting parts in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.170 
let's use a lot of interesting parts in
it<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.920> people<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.310> manipulate<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.969> or

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
it so that people can manipulate it or

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.510 
it so that people can manipulate it or
we<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.479> change<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.960> why<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.159> bring<00:02:05.280> back

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
we can change it why don't we bring back

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.279 
we can change it why don't we bring back
Blood<00:02:06.030> Gulch<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.479> carve<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> all<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.140> into

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.010 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into
pieces<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> people<00:02:08.820> can<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.840> start

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
pieces so that people can and start

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.110 
pieces so that people can and start
manipulating<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.160> interesting<00:02:11.640> ways<00:02:11.850> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
manipulating it and interesting ways and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.410 
manipulating it and interesting ways and
then<00:02:12.870> sanctuary<00:02:13.680> was<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> other<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
then sanctuary was the other one the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.780 
then sanctuary was the other one the
cage

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
cage

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.449 
cage
paradiso<00:02:18.050> that's<00:02:19.050> just<00:02:19.319> Chad<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.920> playing

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
paradiso that's just Chad and I playing

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.340 
paradiso that's just Chad and I playing
with<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.670> map<00:02:20.910> editor<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.540> actually<00:02:21.930> building

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
with a map editor and actually building

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.190 
with a map editor and actually building
cool<00:02:23.069> maps<00:02:23.430> within<00:02:24.090> forge<00:02:24.390> world<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.840> mean<00:02:25.080> we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
cool maps within forge world I mean we

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.050 
cool maps within forge world I mean we
were<00:02:25.260> doing<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.620> exactly<00:02:25.800> how<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.819> fans

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
were doing that exactly how the fans

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.440 
were doing that exactly how the fans
would<00:02:27.209> do<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:29.880> definitely<00:02:30.000> looked<00:02:30.330> at

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
would do that we definitely looked at

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.480 
would do that we definitely looked at
what<00:02:30.600> we<00:02:30.690> did<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.900> Halo<00:02:31.080> 3<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.590> said<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:32.370> can

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
what we did in Halo 3 and said what can

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.309 
what we did in Halo 3 and said what can
we<00:02:32.550> learn<00:02:32.670> from<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.840> one<00:02:34.080> thing<00:02:34.260> to

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
we learn from this it's one thing to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.620 
we learn from this it's one thing to
build<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.280> stunning<00:02:36.060> amount<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.480> Matt

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
build just a stunning amount of Matt

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.470 
build just a stunning amount of Matt
variants<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:38.069> nobody<00:02:38.670> was<00:02:38.970> expecting

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
variants but like nobody was expecting

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.059 
variants but like nobody was expecting
for<00:02:39.720> George<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.110> don't<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.800> was

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
for George I don't think like that was

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.780 
for George I don't think like that was
just<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.370> completely<00:02:41.730> whoa<00:02:42.440> what<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.790> Rube

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
just a completely whoa what the Rube

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.340 
just a completely whoa what the Rube
Goldberg<00:02:45.030> machines<00:02:45.630> yeah<00:02:45.900> those<00:02:46.170> are

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
Goldberg machines yeah those are

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.350 
Goldberg machines yeah those are
everywhere<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:49.370> Halo<00:02:50.370> 3<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.820> was<00:02:51.000> cool<00:02:51.330> that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
everywhere in Halo 3 it was cool that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880 
everywhere in Halo 3 it was cool that
you<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:51.780> move<00:02:51.930> things<00:02:52.140> around<00:02:52.350> but<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.800> was

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you can move things around but it was

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.330 
you can move things around but it was
still<00:02:53.100> kind<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.400> clunky<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.350> we're<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.500> we

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
still kind of clunky and we're like we

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.729 
still kind of clunky and we're like we
have<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.700> make<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.030> better<00:02:57.500> what<00:02:58.500> are<00:02:58.620> some

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
have to make this better what are some

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.900 
have to make this better what are some
of<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> tricks<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.340> communities<00:02:59.760> using

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
of the tricks at the communities using

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.960 
of the tricks at the communities using
and<00:03:00.239> how<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:01.830> make<00:03:02.069> those<00:03:02.280> not<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.670> tricks

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
and how can we make those not be tricks

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.199 
and how can we make those not be tricks
and<00:03:03.269> just<00:03:03.420> make<00:03:03.569> those<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.870> tools<00:03:04.519> we<00:03:05.519> we<00:03:05.970> took

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
and just make those be tools we we took

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.720 
and just make those be tools we we took
that<00:03:06.510> stuff<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.230> made<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> real

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
that stuff and made it like a real

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.059 
that stuff and made it like a real
feature<00:03:09.000> there's<00:03:09.510> normal<00:03:09.930> phased<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.680> fixed

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
feature there's normal phased and fixed

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.520 
feature there's normal phased and fixed
so<00:03:11.610> normal<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:12.480> halo<00:03:12.750> 3<00:03:12.959> style<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.470> know

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
so normal is like halo 3 style you know

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.170 
so normal is like halo 3 style you know
it<00:03:13.650> bumps<00:03:13.920> into<00:03:13.980> stuff<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.519> let<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.700> go<00:03:14.819> it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
it bumps into stuff and you let it go it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.940 
it bumps into stuff and you let it go it
falls<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.690> ground<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.230> moves<00:03:16.560> around<00:03:16.739> and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
falls the ground and moves around and

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.090 
falls the ground and moves around and
stuff<00:03:17.090> fixed<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:19.140> same<00:03:19.350> thing<00:03:19.590> except

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
stuff fixed is the same thing except

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.470 
stuff fixed is the same thing except
when<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.340> let<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.579> go<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.970> stays<00:03:21.239> exactly

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
when you let it go it stays exactly

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.470 
when you let it go it stays exactly
where<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.019> was<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:23.010> then<00:03:23.310> phase<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
where it was and then phase is the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.960 
where it was and then phase is the
coolest<00:03:24.799> because<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:26.190> means<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.519> while

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
coolest because it means that while

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.130 
coolest because it means that while
you're<00:03:27.090> editing<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.420> object<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:27.930> not

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
you're editing the object it's not

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.180 
you're editing the object it's not
actually<00:03:28.560> your<00:03:28.620> acting<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:28.980> environment

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
actually your acting at the environment

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.850 
actually your acting at the environment
you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.120> put<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.600> through<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.049> wall<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.709> can

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
you can put it through a wall you can

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.910 
you can put it through a wall you can
put<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.850> know<00:03:32.940> through<00:03:33.209> other<00:03:33.390> objects

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
put it you know through other objects

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.069 
put it you know through other objects
which<00:03:34.920> changed<00:03:35.730> everything<00:03:36.239> for<00:03:36.269> forage<00:03:36.840> like

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
which changed everything for forage like

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.069 
which changed everything for forage like
immediately<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:38.549> much<00:03:38.850> easier<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.480> build<00:03:39.930> a

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
immediately it's much easier to build a

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.530 
immediately it's much easier to build a
force<00:03:40.290> space<00:03:40.500> there's<00:03:41.190> snaps<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.090> rotates

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
force space there's snaps and rotates

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.349 
force space there's snaps and rotates
and<00:03:42.840> degrees<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.100> units<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.180> can

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
and degrees and and units that you can

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.860 
and degrees and and units that you can
move<00:03:45.480> things<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:46.019> be<00:03:46.109> very<00:03:46.320> precise<00:03:47.870> the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
move things you can be very precise the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.720 
move things you can be very precise the
camera<00:03:49.109> controls<00:03:49.470> it's<00:03:50.220> actually<00:03:50.579> really

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
camera controls it's actually really

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.340 
camera controls it's actually really
good<00:03:50.970> for<00:03:51.150> object<00:03:51.540> placement<00:03:51.720> because<00:03:52.019> like

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
good for object placement because like
