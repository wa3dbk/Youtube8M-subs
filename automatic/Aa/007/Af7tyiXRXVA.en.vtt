00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.360
 and for the self-esteem that the jury and if you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.730
 Do not stop here. Welcome to the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.920
 channel 11 games and video games are taken 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.810
 seriously and today let's get acquainted with the story 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.260
 and also find out why the console 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.750
 atari 5200 did not work all this soon 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
 after super-atari commercial 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.359
 on top of your competitor that I gave 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.079
 for you 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:55.379
 so let's talk and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:01:03.270
 solve ancient is in the pan too 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:05.580
 ready the river route is the end of the decade 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.100
 70 was marked by the glorious reign of the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.920
 atari 2600 and by the rise of the market 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.200
 of video games or atari 2600 inclusive 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.090
 broke taboos in a market where 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.600
 maximum duration of consumption was two 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.670
 years 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.860
 the agent was practically 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.229
 five years reigning in the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.049
 consoles and of course how the target makes success 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.909
 competition appears to bring new and 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.979
 even better equipment to 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.530
 main competitor of the afternoon at the time 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.360
 it was the mattel with television on console 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.030
 which was already threatening the reign of 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.590
 gaming giant with graphics 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.360
 visibly better and consequently 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.329
 more advanced hardware soon after 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.619
 launch of i tele travel in mid 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.270
 1980 afternoon then ran behind 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.100
 injury and started the production of a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 new console that had forecast 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.619
 for the year 1982 and was intended to 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.630
 codename 3,600 but there the bird 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.549
 told the afternoon that such a collection 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.049
 was producing a paralyzed console 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.090
 collecting the virgin the console will have 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.159
 graphics very faithful to those of the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.219
 still had retro look compatibility 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.020
 only with the games of atari 2600 the iata 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.970
 freaked out once right and decided to take a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.580
 upgrade the radio it is making 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.590
 leaves in this new videogame very close 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.480
 new computer soon he does not know 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.330
 only the entertainment system and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.629
 yes a super system and from there was born the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.370
 atari 5200 super sixth that the atari 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.069
 she had plans to make a video game 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.720
 to compete with television but I think 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.220
 that was very clear to you later 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.620
 I showed at the beginning of this 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.390
 video that the rate was very direct attacking 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 colleague or colleague correct the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.650
 5200 atari had a lot of hardware 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.480
 best beautiful graphics and beyond 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.310
 a remarkable difference in size and weight 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.140
 for comparison purposes the videogame is 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.510
 almost twice as big as xbox 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.010
 original that is already a holy box o 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.079
 control of the wii console with some 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.799
 differences in that classic control of 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.930
 atari 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.640
 I now have alpha-numeric keyboard that 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.500
 complicated the players can 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.049
 then we'll talk about it and the button 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.910
 start and reset with this the new afternoon flight 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.890
 because the start button also worked 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.840
 with the most legendary mental button up 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.269
 the pause button, or whether you 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.590
 was fighting with the boss and the game 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.959
 and see that urge to go to the bathroom 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.390
 All you had to do was hold the athlete. 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.459
 Tupiniquim is only of pause the atari 5200 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.650
 also had two versions one way with 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.510
 support for four controls what it was 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.609
 one more novelty for the time and another 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.680
 with two console controls when you 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.120
 released did not have a fixed price 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.859
 depending on the promotion and also in the store 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.600
 that was selling or you could 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.060
 find yourself at $ 1,200 for $ 200 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.829
 or 270 to ask for two more 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.500
 news that I almost forgot to quote 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.359
 are from the console only came out a cable that is 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.489
 straight through a power box that was a 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.290
 prototype of the consoles sources today 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.480
 in day but the consoles nowadays 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.489
 has two rear outputs one that goes 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.190
 for tv and another for the source 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.440
 in the atari 5200 it was just a cable that came out of the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.299
 console is for the power box that box 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.130
 both in charge of sending energy 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.200
 when you have the video and audio signal 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.769
 for tv and other news that console 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.120
 had looked only in 1982 to support the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.430
 online gambling 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.349
 of course it is an expensive ipê system and also 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.299
 premature for the season the way was to wait 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.799
 that we evolve system is there in the 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.959
 I did not give much time talking right now 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.819
 two games is at this point that the console 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.639
 begins to create his own grave 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.099
 the atari 5200 was released was announced 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.109
 with him 12 games but it was about 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.940
 just atari game henry max 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.760
 2600 and was thus with the majority 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.800
 overwhelming of the games were remix or 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.190
 Portes of the arcade games all this 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.470
 to compete directly 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.570
 even with the colleague the vision the rate 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.750
 was so obsessed with leadership that 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.520
 it was still 2600 and overthrowing the console 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.320
 to forget about the quality of 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.600
 games another point that was in itself is 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.280
 negatively is the control I have already cited 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.140
 previously for being innovative for 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.540
 cut with pause motor number on 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.610
 control but ultimately to cut costs 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.770
 console atari ended up making the 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.210
 super fragile control and bad with 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 analog and only fulfills this function of 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.990
 to vote for a place and also horrible 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.060
 Engine durability was nightmare 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.280
 the players and in the afternoon did not 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.650
 model the question was guide with the games 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.110
 remake of games from archives 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.880
 will be released to people who no longer 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.310
 I was so accustomed and having video games 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.890
 at home saw no reason to switch from 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.930
 console for having better graphics games 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.380
 new ones, especially the afternoon 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.030
 had quality even at 82 a.m. 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.700
 launched the game and it was an adaptation 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.620
 of the movie sold and for the love of 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.300
 God, this game was a shot in the foot. 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.070
 including the rate buried thousands of 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.240
 cartridges of the game that was found 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.140
 recently by a group of 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.600
 researchers 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.520
 the conclusion was that at the end of 83 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.650
 video games start to lose a lot of their 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.940
 space in the market people did not want 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.370
 swap your video game 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.530
 the games were of horrible quality and there 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.600
 the market did not support went into crisis and 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.560
 we come to what is known as the crash 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.000
 of video games 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.470
 the video game market has been changed 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.150
 by the PC market they already had 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.160
 machines with better durability 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.530
 hardware and this was not only the end of 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.690
 late as 200 and 100 in the second generation 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.930
 whole with the colleague the video and television 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.850
 atari 2600 and five thousand two hundred and 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.860
 on and that was the one I saw on the console 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.410
 that even with the title the horrible ones had 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.360
 in total 69 games released and one million 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.310
 number of units sold is well 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.020
 small with stops 30 million 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.340
 units of the original osório unit was 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.350
 considered the first failure 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.660
 commercial of atari and the united states 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.940
 could not overcome the crisis of the games 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.700
 that only ended up with a company of the 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.440
 orientated and innovated by launching a 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.750
 entertainment for the family and still 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.550
 that of a game of the most 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.620
 famous in history but that's another 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.480
 video and these 10 people because it did not 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.310
 right here you may think you own 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.530
 only this history has in the searches 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.280
 not yet guys the console was released and 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.970
 32 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.200
 he turned out 83/84 ended up generation then 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.030
 so there is not much history 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.770
 his account of this here only information 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.840

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.570
 some hardware information from the 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.980
 console here for anyone who wants to know
