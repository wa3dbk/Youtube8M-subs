00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 so they had welcome my name is 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.759
 French and today I show you again 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.599
 to deal with something from there again 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.040
 nexteer rhymes dlc-package people with the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.719
 Another use is if you like 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.690
 namely the single step is from 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.340
 victor and connor and the no angels of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.840
 series and adrien ney the but 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.699
 probably more through the new ones 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.990
 patch have arrived but there are these 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.430
 simultaneously with the government too 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 it would come from time to time say shit 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.779
 I 'll tell you all about it 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.669
 Let's just do a quarter 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.280
 weymouth and then we do a lot and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.570
 make an animal come along but it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.969
 It does not matter anyway 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.450
 So let's start with that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.379
 Good semi see where it is semi semi 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170
 semi-sen 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.500
 there we have in the company like rem 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.510
 green apple so there we see this and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.850
 then we go to the characters 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.449
 Victor and then corner 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 let them come out of here now if 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.059
 that worked I'm not quite 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 for sure 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.790
 and as I said everything fits in with start 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.320
 the new angeles of semih series and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.360
 edwin level did not come to that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.920
 but have replaced the old ones 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.540
 otherwise I would have liked to you otherwise the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.780
 video shown so do not flap now 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.030
 more 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.229
 then I would not have to because they are not 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.450
 Downgrade is all about 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.700
 I did not think so let's go with 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.860
 I have me wondering why his 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.850
 essentials shit was that was really 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 very stiff times semi sainÃ¤wwel motion 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.600
 capturing for the abu dhabi 25 operated 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.939
 as they confirmed in interviews 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.939
 said interview 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.320
 So no is not a new detail 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.020
 Of course, Erich, of course, that out 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.579
 but can show the community technology 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.200
 It's about the most beautiful updated 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.549
 has been 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.719
 probably with the patch together 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.869
 with many more gameplay 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.380
 I will sometimes improve 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.380
 try out 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.830
 already big fan of him, I'm 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.830
 nix champion did not last long 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.060
 already seen here on the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.740
 other side and dennis it to end 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.860
 i believe or i can be wrong 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.790
 So Devil's Angels change was not 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:47.220
 so optimally solved 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:50.460
 At the beginning is the same principle in the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.130
 Grand Arena is pretty weird but is 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.930
 also updated weird and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.310
 jumped so exaggerated faith 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.450
 I even voted the timing that 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.070
 was totally wrong 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.300
 in the first version that's what I mean 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.170
 you have to be the championships as well 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:16.550
 like normal one can lead out of yes 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.550
 credit rating angels yes the break 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.250
 very nicely said he and semi sen 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.659
 hamburg capturing operated for zf 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.790
 Acting can make him wonder why 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:33.049
 Exactly the patch is so fucking wait 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.760
 funny weird and then we wait 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.560
 the individual chips of grains and 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.340
 victor if at all 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.560
 distinguish in front of the text or whether the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:48.140
 Texte has been taken over without stopping 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.370
 the other relevant okay so 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.049
 Camera trip in any case a bit 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:04:04.370
 different has to be different so that he is in the 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:04:08.620
 center is I saw differently I know it 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.970
 I do not want to compare it 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.290
 but I mean comes with the same 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:18.919
 location 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.690
 purely from the ring placement position though 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.580
 otherwise they have some interaction 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.599
 they do not know each other exactly 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.599
 I do not think so 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.750
 but still interesting to see 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.750
 how the individual would get along 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:40.480
 The furniture is also beautiful without 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:42.900
 only sha is missing 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.900
 with K 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.740
 but sometimes took it or not 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.160
 we know 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.160
 clicks 

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:11.240
 that's good slow is essential 

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:13.699
 not the original occupation sweet like so 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.219
 as they are now in and the way we do them 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.939
 see now 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:23.629
 originally it was so funny 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:27.559
 somehow chamberlain or so the present 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.789
 board at tmn the right change 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.520
 can have a look to google and the 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.869
 comments we write that was exactly 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.080
 and no comments write which 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:39.439
 engines find their best tends to be 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.360
 very serious for him is very much for him 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.979
 because then we are already with 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.300
 that angeles that 's it too 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.409
 Already with the respective video unfortunately 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.569
 The video has a bit liked 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.039
 As I said, write your opinion in the 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.180
 comments thumbs up and I forget 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.249
 switch off the network 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.419
 you can find more videos about the dlc package 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.089
 Describe below in the video masked 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.449
 says wissmann this time has reinhardt 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:01.449
 jazz
