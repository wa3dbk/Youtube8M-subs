00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
it isn't fully changed but so for the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.700 
it isn't fully changed but so for the
first<00:03:14.450> three<00:03:14.690> lines<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.200> walls<00:03:15.380> start

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
first three lines the walls start

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.440 
first three lines the walls start
breathing<00:03:16.190> my<00:03:16.280> mind<00:03:16.520> start<00:03:16.790> weaving<00:03:17.000> maybe

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
breathing my mind start weaving maybe

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.250 
breathing my mind start weaving maybe
especially<00:03:17.750> leave<00:03:18.020> me<00:03:18.200> alone<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.700> if<00:03:19.870> CC<00:03:20.870> so

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
especially leave me alone is if CC so

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.090 
especially leave me alone is if CC so
you<00:03:21.320> play<00:03:21.710> if<00:03:22.460> twice<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.600> then<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.900> play<00:03:24.110> C

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
you play if twice and then you play C

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.750 
you play if twice and then you play C
and<00:03:25.520> then<00:03:26.300> extra<00:03:26.780> C<00:03:26.960> well<00:03:27.740> I<00:03:27.770> guess<00:03:28.130> once<00:03:28.430> but

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
and then extra C well I guess once but

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.350 
and then extra C well I guess once but
if<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.030> forget<00:03:29.600> twice<00:03:29.990> but<00:03:30.950> um<00:03:31.100> yeah<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.180> then

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
if you forget twice but um yeah and then

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.780 
if you forget twice but um yeah and then
when<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.660> get<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.560> weight<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.040> lifted<00:03:34.070> it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
when you get to a weight is lifted it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.050 
when you get to a weight is lifted it
you<00:03:35.630> just<00:03:35.840> play<00:03:36.080> if<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.860> see<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.820> strong

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
you just play if and see the strong

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.180 
you just play if and see the strong
pattern<00:03:38.330> once<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.900> then<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.410> says<00:03:39.740> D<00:03:39.950> minor

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
pattern once and then it says D minor

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.040 
pattern once and then it says D minor
twice<00:03:40.550> so<00:03:41.300> you<00:03:41.360> just<00:03:41.570> play<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.780> strong

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
twice so you just play the strong

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.840 
twice so you just play the strong
pattern<00:03:42.440> for<00:03:42.710> each<00:03:42.890> of<00:03:43.070> those<00:03:43.130> de<00:03:43.340> minors<00:03:43.700> but

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
pattern for each of those de minors but

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.830 
pattern for each of those de minors but
it's<00:03:44.000> pretty<00:03:44.150> much<00:03:44.270> just<00:03:44.330> playing

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840

I said but I would slow it down a bit so

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.780 
I said but I would slow it down a bit so
then<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:03.200> can<00:04:03.380> hear<00:04:03.740> H<00:04:03.920> strong<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.340> lot<00:04:04.550> better

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
then you can hear H strong a lot better

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.480 
then you can hear H strong a lot better
and<00:04:05.060> at<00:04:05.150> C<00:04:05.450> if<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:06.200> minor<00:04:06.470> G<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.070> we're<00:04:07.220> not<00:04:07.340> say

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
and at C if a minor G so we're not say

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.420 
and at C if a minor G so we're not say
that<00:04:07.700> our<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:09.230> strong<00:04:09.440> pattern<00:04:09.770> before<00:04:10.130> is

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
that our so the strong pattern before is

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:20.650 
that our so the strong pattern before is
about<00:04:10.460> this<00:04:10.940> pace

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.830 

and<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.710> want<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.520> slow<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.300> down<00:04:24.540> to

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
and so I want you to slow that down to

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:34.700 
and so I want you to slow that down to
about<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.169> face

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.650 

so<00:04:35.710> then<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.550> course<00:04:36.820> is<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.030> bit<00:04:37.210> slower<00:04:37.480> than

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
so then the course is a bit slower than

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.360 
so then the course is a bit slower than
everything<00:04:37.900> else<00:04:38.110> okay<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:38.680> for<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.100> bridge

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
everything else okay so for the bridge

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.040 
everything else okay so for the bridge
the<00:04:39.640> showing<00:04:39.910> pattern<00:04:40.270> is<00:04:40.450> of<00:04:40.690> course<00:04:40.930> the

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
the showing pattern is of course the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.660 
the showing pattern is of course the
same<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.930> cool<00:04:44.140> thing<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:44.830> your

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
same and the the cool thing is your

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.200 
same and the the cool thing is your
cords<00:04:46.180> here<00:04:46.480> is<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:47.320> minor<00:04:47.620> G<00:04:48.010> D<00:04:48.310> minor<00:04:48.580> if<00:04:48.880> a

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
cords here is a minor G D minor if a

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.930 
cords here is a minor G D minor if a
minor<00:04:50.020> G<00:04:50.290> D<00:04:50.500> run<00:04:50.650> if<00:04:50.890> and<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.220> just<00:04:51.460> goes<00:04:51.730> in

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
minor G D run if and it just goes in

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.690 
minor G D run if and it just goes in
that<00:04:52.060> pattern<00:04:52.330> of<00:04:52.900> course<00:04:53.230> and<00:04:53.580> yeah<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
that pattern of course and yeah the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.700 
that pattern of course and yeah the
shrimp<00:04:54.940> ends<00:04:55.120> exactly<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.660> same<00:04:55.840> okay<00:04:56.230> so<00:04:56.290> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
shrimp ends exactly the same okay so the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.100 
shrimp ends exactly the same okay so the
only<00:04:56.860> time<00:04:57.190> any<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.690> things<00:04:58.930> I've<00:04:59.080> just

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
only time any of the things I've just

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.650 
only time any of the things I've just
