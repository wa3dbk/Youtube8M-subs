00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.310
 Good morning, good morning and evening 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.310
 Crazy bugs 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.740
 Thank you 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.720
 do not 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.740
 good how many are 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.950
 I'm going to explain the coni 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 and the plane 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:54.410
 let's start for the most basic 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.530
 the oil is all this well 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:09.040
 the back foot not sure the back foot 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:09.040
 here although it is with the forward 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.590
 go and pose it common 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.590
 that simple is the easiest of all 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.640
 so now we go to the oxxo bean 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.440
 boxing beat boxing is about doing 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.860
 a 180 with the table therefore the foot 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.240
 back of olic 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.280
 and forward also today 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.040
 but if not you can do so 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.310
 is to do this and with this the company 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.310
 it's like that the days with students 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.500
 very well 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680
 ah 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.920
 in the freezer profession it is the same but 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.660
 back 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.750
 it's a little more complicated this is time 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.160
 in the foot of today but so more crooked in 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.380
 diagonal up there to do so and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.360
 this way around here a little going out to 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.360
 accompany him like this 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.060

 in the clip in the clip and harder than 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.490
 all these but it is very easy 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.450
 in olic feet here 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.880
 the forward more or less I put it by 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.610
 here because it is no longer done well but for 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.470
 do not know who put it thus a 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.990
 little diagonally 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.260
 while you are practicing the flip 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.730
 you can put more and more up I like 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.430
 here 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.050
 for when they click or gerlo in the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.480
 air 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.080
 what are the ones that look good today is 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.380

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.240

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.830

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.840
