 [Music] 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.219
 game of speaking sir the don feeling in 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.130
 this tutorial we will teach how to connect 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.259
 a console games so here we have a 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.670
 person or a small console like 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.130
 we call 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.480
 this console is contained with phantom and 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.020
 has everything you need to do 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.020
 a good mix 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.000
 we have the console are a good job 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.400
 The first thing we need is an entity 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.820
 of the blog as I call it first 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.489
 we will connect the microphone that goes in this 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.170
 for example with the second will involve 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.180
 the two of these in their cute 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 controller 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.190
 of migration 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.550
 then they are what we need is the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.170
 sound that goes from the card to the pc that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.880
 is connected 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.050
 [Music] 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.440
 in these 2 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.159
 [Music] 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.700
 is where they connect then we will use the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.320
 of the microphone that goes from the test in the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.690
 console 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.450
 to the card that goes in which says sir 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.440
 or departure times for bread only 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.170
 can learn how to turn off 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.750
 then we come with the cables that go from 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.460
 the console to the sound monitors that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.840
 we will use any of these four 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.320
 channels you can know that we will use 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.320
 these two 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.680
 [Applause] 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.870
 then there is the cable that is the one of the iphone 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.740
 as what they call it is used this 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.020

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.320

 any of the three 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.250
 and then to see that they are 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.790
 working well on the console we come and 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.790
 we light it 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.210
