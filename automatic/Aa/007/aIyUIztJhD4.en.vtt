upwards and all the other strings you

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
pulled downwards

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.850

if<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:51.209> want<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.510> vibrate<00:03:51.930> if<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.620> want<00:03:52.800> to

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
bend you always push upwards um actually

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.540 
bend you always push upwards um actually
I'm<00:03:57.180> wrong<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:57.989> not<00:03:58.140> always<00:03:58.470> because<00:03:59.130> if<00:03:59.430> you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
I'm wrong it's not always because if you

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.600 
I'm wrong it's not always because if you
want<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.820> bend<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.120> string<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:01.320> mean<00:04:02.280> one<00:04:02.580> of

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
the bass strings then it's easier to

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.100 
the bass strings then it's easier to
pull<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.650> down

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110

correctly<00:04:48.770> using<00:04:49.759> this<00:04:50.090> motion<00:04:50.979> then<00:04:51.979> you

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
correctly using this motion then you

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:02.469 
correctly using this motion then you
only<00:04:53.090> hear<00:04:53.509> this<00:04:53.750> note<00:05:00.550> C<00:05:01.550> because<00:05:02.330> it's

only hear this note C because it's

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.260

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
vibration of the original note okay

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.200 
vibration of the original note okay
now<00:05:16.759> there's<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.270> classical<00:05:17.960> way<00:05:18.169> of

now there's the classical way of

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:26.140 
now there's the classical way of
vibrating<00:05:20.210> notes<00:05:23.620> which<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:25.340> sideways

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150

one<00:05:26.509> it's<00:05:26.990> sideways<00:05:28.030> sideways<00:05:29.030> and<00:05:29.599> then<00:05:30.169> it

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
one it's sideways sideways and then it

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:40.150 
one it's sideways sideways and then it
sounds<00:05:30.590> like<00:05:30.650> this<00:05:38.080> again<00:05:39.080> you<00:05:39.199> can<00:05:39.349> do<00:05:39.470> this

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
mean they can go a long way you can bend

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:58.029

them<00:05:51.880> but<00:05:53.949> they're<00:05:54.949> more<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:56.800> forgot<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.889> word

they're<00:05:59.030> more<00:05:59.180> flexible<00:05:59.360> that's<00:06:00.080> it<00:06:00.349> flexible

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
they're more flexible that's it flexible

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789
