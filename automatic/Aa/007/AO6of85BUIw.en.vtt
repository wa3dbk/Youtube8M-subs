00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.380
 I tell you how it is done 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.510
 in this video tutorial we are going to 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.330
 teach how to make eggs in the shape of 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.310
 heart 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.370
 a beautiful decoration for you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.830
 dishes 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.150
 to get our eggs shaped 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.780
 from the heart we are going to need the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 next material a saucepan to cook the 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.760
 egg an egg 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.210
 a Chinese toothpick if you might have 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.210
 square shape 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.340
 a brick in this case I will use one 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.340
 fried tomato 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:53.560
 two rubber bands very important that 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.560
 be two and a pair of scissors 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.189
 the first step is to cook our 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.070
 egg the time of cooking an egg 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.650
 it's 10 minutes 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.940
 meanwhile we open the green and 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.920
 We cut a piece should have 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.370
 approximately 10 centimeters by 6 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.370
 centimeters 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.400
 once we have our piece of brick 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.400
 we fold it along forming a vee 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.310
 when the egg is cooked and still 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.030
 hot we put the egg on the ub 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.640
 of cardboard 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.980
 and we put the toothpick just above the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.220
 egg 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.680
 it must be well centered we hold it 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.100
 with your fingers and put the two rubber bands 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.750
 elastic one at each end so that 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.440
 press ok I'm going to put the rubber 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.900
 double 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.530
 and we will make the stick and the cardboard leaving 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.530
 the free egg 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.659
 i 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.659
 in this way 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.790
 we center our stick well and leave 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.420
 cool the egg for about 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.420
 10 minutes 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.580
 Once the egg is cold we remove the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.580
 gums 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.440
 when removing the toothpick and cardboard 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.910
 we will check that our egg has 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.910
 stayed with a heart shape 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.750
 all we have to do is break it 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.050
 in slices for it we put it mouth 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.900
 down 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.799
 so that it sits well on top of the table 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.799
 and we cut 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.580
 As you can see we have achieved a way of 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.580
 almost perfect heart 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.640
 i 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.829
 you can use these eggs in the form of 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.579
 heart to decorate salads or 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.579
 any other dish 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.630
 and that's how it's done if you liked it 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.280
