okay<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.630> I've<00:00:15.990> moved<00:00:16.139> out<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.590> 300<00:00:17.340> yards

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
okay so I've moved out to 300 yards

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.380 
okay so I've moved out to 300 yards
hopefully<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> wind<00:00:20.460> isn't<00:00:20.700> making<00:00:20.820> too<00:00:21.270> much

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
hopefully the wind isn't making too much

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.140 
hopefully the wind isn't making too much
of<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> problem<00:00:21.810> with<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.110> camera<00:00:22.970> now<00:00:23.970> what

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
of a problem with the camera now what

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.780 
of a problem with the camera now what
I'm<00:00:24.240> gonna<00:00:24.360> do<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.840> fire<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:25.860> ladder<00:00:26.160> test<00:00:26.490> and

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
I'm gonna do is fire my ladder test and

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.120 
I'm gonna do is fire my ladder test and
I'm<00:00:27.330> using<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.869> quite<00:00:28.290> popular<00:00:28.680> method<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
I'm using the quite popular method of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.380 
I'm using the quite popular method of
using<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.180> sharpie<00:00:30.930> or<00:00:31.140> coloured<00:00:31.950> Sharpie

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
using a sharpie or coloured Sharpie

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.350 
using a sharpie or coloured Sharpie
permanent<00:00:33.390> marker<00:00:34.430> all<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> tips<00:00:35.879> rather

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
permanent marker all the tips rather

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.700 
permanent marker all the tips rather
than<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> bearing<00:00:36.840> surface<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.470> bullet

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
than the bearing surface of the bullet

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.619 
than the bearing surface of the bullet
so<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.580> as<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:38.940> pass<00:00:39.150> through<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.449> paper

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so that as they pass through the paper

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.439 
so that as they pass through the paper
target<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.680> colored<00:00:41.460> sharpie<00:00:41.820> comes<00:00:42.000> off<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
target the colored sharpie comes off and

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.540 
target the colored sharpie comes off and
you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:43.500> find<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.830> which<00:00:43.980> shop<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.370> which

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you can find out which shop was which

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.870 
you can find out which shop was which
and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.720> can<00:00:45.960> use<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> pen<00:00:47.220> and<00:00:47.520> mark<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
and then you can use a pen and mark it

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.650 
and then you can use a pen and mark it
off<00:00:48.290> so<00:00:49.579> I'm<00:00:50.579> gonna<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.880> the<00:00:51.030> ladder<00:00:51.180> test<00:00:51.480> now

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
off so I'm gonna do the ladder test now

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.020 
off so I'm gonna do the ladder test now
I'm<00:00:51.930> gonna<00:00:52.110> fire<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.500> shot<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.820> I'm<00:00:53.940> gonna

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
I'm gonna fire a shot then I'm gonna

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
I'm gonna fire a shot then I'm gonna
wait<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.420> minutes<00:00:54.540> fire<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> next<00:00:55.200> shot<00:00:55.530> wait

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
wait two minutes fire the next shot wait

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.010 
wait two minutes fire the next shot wait
two<00:00:56.489> minutes<00:00:56.579> again<00:00:56.970> and<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> third<00:00:57.480> shot<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
two minutes again and a third shot and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.380 
two minutes again and a third shot and
each<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.380> a<00:00:58.530> different<00:00:58.590> color<00:00:59.100> red<00:00:59.670> black

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
each one is a different color red black

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.620 
each one is a different color red black
and<00:01:00.600> green<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:02.100> I'm<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.820> mark

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
and green then I'm going to go down mark

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.609 
and green then I'm going to go down mark
them<00:01:03.809> off<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:04.979> got<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> next<00:01:06.000> streak

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
them off and then got to the next streak

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.070 
them off and then got to the next streak
charges<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.820> fire<00:01:09.450> those<00:01:09.660> off<00:01:09.899> and<00:01:10.020> then

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
charges and then fire those off and then

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
charges and then fire those off and then
keep<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.350> till<00:01:10.680> I've<00:01:10.800> done<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.130> 15<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
keep going till I've done all 15 and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
keep going till I've done all 15 and
then<00:01:12.660> we'll<00:01:12.840> we'll<00:01:13.350> talk<00:01:13.560> about<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.920> results

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
then we'll we'll talk about the results

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.270 
then we'll we'll talk about the results
right<00:01:14.880> now<00:01:14.910> the<00:01:15.119> winds<00:01:15.479> playing<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.280> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
right now the winds playing up and it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300 
right now the winds playing up and it's
it's<00:01:17.610> quite<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.909> while<00:01:18.180> before<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it's quite a while before the you get a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
it's quite a while before the you get a
low<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> wind<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.479> take<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> shot

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
low in the wind so you can take a shot

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.109 
low in the wind so you can take a shot
so<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.890> would<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.040> quite<00:01:23.190> boring<00:01:23.430> waiting<00:01:23.820> for

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
so it would be quite boring waiting for

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.399 
so it would be quite boring waiting for
me<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.330> take<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.630> shot<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.260> me

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
me to take the shot that would just me

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.140 
me to take the shot that would just me
be<00:01:25.950> me<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> position<00:01:26.760> for<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> few<00:01:27.990> minutes<00:01:28.290> so

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
be me in position for a few minutes so

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.840 
be me in position for a few minutes so
all<00:01:30.150> go<00:01:30.330> straight<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> results<00:01:31.140> next<00:01:31.850> so

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
all go straight to the results next so

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.140 
all go straight to the results next so
here's<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.270> results<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> ladder<00:01:34.200> test<00:01:35.150> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
here's my results of the ladder test and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.880 
here's my results of the ladder test and
as<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.200> looks<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.590> bit<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
as you can see it looks a little bit of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.149 
as you can see it looks a little bit of
a<00:01:37.920> mess<00:01:38.869> once<00:01:39.869> I've<00:01:40.020> gone<00:01:40.200> from<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.890> hundred

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
a mess once I've gone from a hundred

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.620 
a mess once I've gone from a hundred
yards<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.520> I've<00:01:41.580> done<00:01:41.760> my<00:01:41.909> sighting<00:01:42.420> I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
yards and I've done my sighting I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
yards and I've done my sighting I
estimated<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.500> drop<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> three<00:01:44.400> hundred

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
estimated the drop for the three hundred

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.280 
estimated the drop for the three hundred
yards<00:01:45.200> for<00:01:46.200> 33.3<00:01:46.979> greens<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.930> drop

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
yards for 33.3 greens and I got the drop

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.969 
yards for 33.3 greens and I got the drop
pretty<00:01:49.680> much<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.850> target<00:01:51.320> as<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.650> see<00:01:52.799> on

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
pretty much on target as you can see on

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
pretty much on target as you can see on
the<00:01:53.130> far<00:01:53.430> left<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.090> was<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.299> first

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the far left here this was the first

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.620 
the far left here this was the first
shot<00:01:54.860> 33.3<00:01:55.860> grains<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.479> bit

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
shot 33.3 grains it was a little bit

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.990 
shot 33.3 grains it was a little bit
left<00:01:57.900> so<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.259> had<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.470> do<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.860> dial<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.759> I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
left so what I had to do is dial right I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
left so what I had to do is dial right I
didn't<00:02:00.299> touch<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.780> elevation<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
didn't touch the elevation just the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
didn't touch the elevation just the
windage<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.720> could<00:02:03.869> bring

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
windage and just so that I could bring

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.039 
windage and just so that I could bring
these<00:02:04.229> shots<00:02:04.500> back<00:02:04.770> onto<00:02:05.070> target<00:02:05.840> now<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.020> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
these shots back onto target now what I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
these shots back onto target now what I
should<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.350> done<00:02:07.560> first<00:02:07.860> mistake<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.579> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
should have done first mistake is I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
should have done first mistake is I
should<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.239> had<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.320> started<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
should have had it so that I started a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
should have had it so that I started a
little<00:02:11.130> bit<00:02:11.280> low<00:02:11.549> on<00:02:11.700> here<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.299> as<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
little bit low on here so as the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900 
little bit low on here so as the
velocity<00:02:13.470> increases<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.040> shots<00:02:14.310> come<00:02:14.519> up<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
velocity increases the shots come up to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.430 
velocity increases the shots come up to
the<00:02:15.120> central<00:02:15.480> target<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.230> above<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.780> came

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the central target and above but I came

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.060 
the central target and above but I came
across<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.739> problem<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:21.200> 36<00:02:22.200> grains<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.919> was

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
across a problem up to 36 grains I was

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.479 
across a problem up to 36 grains I was
still<00:02:23.310> on<00:02:23.430> target<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.419> knew<00:02:25.010> by<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.070> amount

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
still on target and I knew by the amount

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.119 
still on target and I knew by the amount
of

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
of

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.110 
of
elevation<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.400> getting<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.879> was<00:02:30.030> gonna

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
elevation I was getting that was gonna

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.089 
elevation I was getting that was gonna
be<00:02:30.329> after<00:02:30.599> over<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.319> top<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.680> target

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
be after over the top of the target

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.369 
be after over the top of the target
pretty<00:02:32.400> shortly<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.150> had<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.599> do<00:02:33.750> is

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
pretty shortly so what I had to do is

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.490 
pretty shortly so what I had to do is
make<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> decision<00:02:35.219> and<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:37.200> something<00:02:37.469> I

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
make a decision and do something I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.970 
make a decision and do something I
didn't<00:02:37.739> want<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.099> which<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:39.349> change<00:02:40.349> my

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
didn't want to do which was to change my

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.589 
didn't want to do which was to change my
point<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.430> aim<00:02:41.670> from<00:02:41.969> the<00:02:42.060> center<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
point of aim from the center of the

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.770 
point of aim from the center of the
target<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.560> lower<00:02:43.829> left<00:02:44.219> here<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.480> then

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
target to the lower left here so I then

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.809 
target to the lower left here so I then
had<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.019> measure<00:02:46.829> all<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.189> shots<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.730> then

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
had to measure all the shots and then

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.479 
had to measure all the shots and then
tally<00:02:48.060> them<00:02:48.269> up<00:02:51.769> which<00:02:52.769> was<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> little<00:02:53.280> bit<00:02:53.430> of

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
tally them up which was a little bit of

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.550 
tally them up which was a little bit of
a<00:02:53.579> problem<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.180> not<00:02:54.719> to<00:02:54.870> worry<00:02:55.909> so<00:02:57.560> anything

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
a problem then not to worry so anything

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.619 
a problem then not to worry so anything
that's<00:02:58.739> highlighted<00:02:59.129> here<00:02:59.700> was<00:03:00.150> actually

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
that's highlighted here was actually

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.509 
that's highlighted here was actually
aimed<00:03:00.840> bottom<00:03:01.409> left<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.389> had<00:03:03.389> I<00:03:03.720> taken<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.590> 36

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
aimed bottom left so had I taken the 36

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.210 
aimed bottom left so had I taken the 36
grain<00:03:05.909> shot<00:03:06.359> by<00:03:06.569> aiming<00:03:07.049> on<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.560> lower<00:03:07.859> left

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
grain shot by aiming on the lower left

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.089 
grain shot by aiming on the lower left
target<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:09.389> would<00:03:09.629> have<00:03:09.750> landed<00:03:10.040> right<00:03:11.040> here

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
target it would have landed right here

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.330 
target it would have landed right here
exactly<00:03:11.879> here<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.329> 36<00:03:12.930> 36<00:03:13.709> point<00:03:14.010> three<00:03:14.310> and

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
exactly here so 36 36 point three and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.879 
exactly here so 36 36 point three and
thirty<00:03:14.760> six<00:03:14.909> point<00:03:15.180> six<00:03:15.450> grains<00:03:15.750> as<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.739> can

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
thirty six point six grains as you can

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.619 
thirty six point six grains as you can
see<00:03:17.129> is<00:03:17.189> quite<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.639> nice<00:03:17.849> little<00:03:17.879> cluster

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
see is quite a nice little cluster

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.839 
see is quite a nice little cluster
relevant<00:03:19.139> of<00:03:19.319> windage<00:03:20.159> the<00:03:20.310> elevation<00:03:20.760> is

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
relevant of windage the elevation is

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.080 
relevant of windage the elevation is
quite<00:03:21.359> small<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:22.439> was<00:03:22.620> my<00:03:22.859> high<00:03:23.250> note<00:03:23.579> which

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
quite small that was my high note which

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.629 
quite small that was my high note which
was<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.989> note<00:03:25.230> highest<00:03:25.769> near<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:26.340> near

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
was the the note highest near the near

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.589 
was the the note highest near the near
the<00:03:26.669> max<00:03:26.939> charge<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.510> did<00:03:28.139> have<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.319> low<00:03:28.530> note<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
the max charge I did have a low note and

inches of innovation on there but what's

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.289 
inches of innovation on there but what's
interesting<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:41.220> note<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.579> before<00:03:41.909> I<00:03:41.940> even<00:03:42.090> got

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
interesting to note is before I even got

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.050 
interesting to note is before I even got
to<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.540> target<00:03:42.769> out<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.069> 15<00:03:44.459> shots<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
to the target out of the 15 shots the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.240 
to the target out of the 15 shots the
only<00:03:45.269> one<00:03:45.389> that<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.569> called<00:03:45.840> as<00:03:46.049> as<00:03:46.650> lucky<00:03:47.099> off

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
only one that I called as as lucky off

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.309 
only one that I called as as lucky off
was<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.729> thirty<00:03:48.030> six<00:03:48.269> point<00:03:48.419> three<00:03:48.540> grains<00:03:49.049> I

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
was this thirty six point three grains I

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.509 
was this thirty six point three grains I
actually<00:03:50.250> here<00:03:50.609> aimed<00:03:52.010> at<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.099> center<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.400> the

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
actually here aimed at the center of the

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.339 
actually here aimed at the center of the
tire<00:03:53.729> I'm<00:03:53.909> down<00:03:54.510> here<00:03:54.540> sorry<00:03:55.019> on<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.199> lower

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
tire I'm down here sorry on the lower

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.249 
tire I'm down here sorry on the lower
left<00:03:55.739> but<00:03:56.729> as<00:03:56.909> a<00:03:56.939> shot<00:03:57.299> broke<00:03:57.540> off<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.900> noticed

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:58.259 
left but as a shot broke off I noticed

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:59.990 
left but as a shot broke off I noticed
the<00:03:58.379> crosshairs<00:03:58.889> were<00:03:59.069> a<00:03:59.099> little<00:03:59.340> low<00:03:59.639> and<00:03:59.879> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the crosshairs were a little low and a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.929 
the crosshairs were a little low and a
little<00:04:00.299> left<00:04:00.599> so<00:04:01.439> if<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.709> do<00:04:01.769> compensate<00:04:02.549> for

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
little left so if I do compensate for

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.509 
little left so if I do compensate for
that<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.199> came<00:04:04.439> a<00:04:04.590> little<00:04:05.040> cheating<00:04:05.340> maybe

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
that and I came a little cheating maybe

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.789 
that and I came a little cheating maybe
even<00:04:05.759> if<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.090> compensate<00:04:06.419> for<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.680> will

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
even if I compensate for that it will

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.589 
even if I compensate for that it will
mean<00:04:08.009> I<00:04:08.040> would<00:04:08.280> bring<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.699> shot<00:04:08.879> up<00:04:09.090> until<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
mean I would bring the shot up until the

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.240 
mean I would bring the shot up until the
right<00:04:09.780> slightly<00:04:10.079> which<00:04:10.409> will<00:04:10.620> bring<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:10.919> even

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
right slightly which will bring it even

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.819 
right slightly which will bring it even
closer<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.819> these<00:04:12.000> two<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.079> seems<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.799> be

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
closer to these two so that seems to be

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.909 
closer to these two so that seems to be
the<00:04:14.340> low<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.359> shows<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.750> most<00:04:15.900> promise<00:04:15.989> so

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
the low that shows the most promise so

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.930 
the low that shows the most promise so
I'm<00:04:17.250> probably<00:04:17.400> going<00:04:17.639> to<00:04:17.729> load<00:04:17.909> up<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:20.459> center

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
I'm probably going to load up the center

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.260 
I'm probably going to load up the center
of<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.780> charge<00:04:22.079> range<00:04:22.409> from<00:04:22.560> 36<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.310> 36<00:04:24.060> point

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
of that charge range from 36 to 36 point

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.850 
of that charge range from 36 to 36 point
six<00:04:24.539> grains<00:04:24.840> which<00:04:25.080> would<00:04:25.229> be<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.470> one<00:04:25.650> three

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
six grains which would be this one three

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.550 
six grains which would be this one three
six<00:04:26.009> point<00:04:26.280> three<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.960> then<00:04:27.960> I'm<00:04:28.349> going<00:04:28.500> to

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
six point three and then I'm going to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.779 
six point three and then I'm going to
play<00:04:28.710> with<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.919> seating<00:04:29.130> depth<00:04:29.460> all<00:04:29.639> these

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
play with the seating depth all these

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.140 
play with the seating depth all these
shots<00:04:30.380> where<00:04:31.380> were<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.590> 87<00:04:32.099> grain<00:04:32.250> v-max<00:04:32.580> as<00:04:32.970> I

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
shots where were the 87 grain v-max as I

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.230 
shots where were the 87 grain v-max as I
probably<00:04:33.330> mentioned<00:04:33.750> before<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:35.070> it's<00:04:35.250> 40

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
probably mentioned before and it's 40

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.670 
probably mentioned before and it's 40
thousands<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.960> an<00:04:37.050> inch<00:04:37.200> off<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.500> lands

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
thousands of an inch off the lands

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.100 
thousands of an inch off the lands
so<00:04:39.040> I'm<00:04:39.190> probably<00:04:39.340> gonna<00:04:39.580> go<00:04:39.790> load<00:04:40.600> up<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.870> few

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
so I'm probably gonna go load up a few

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.689 
so I'm probably gonna go load up a few
more<00:04:41.259> or<00:04:41.410> four<00:04:41.590> teeth<00:04:41.710> now<00:04:41.889> just<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.280> test<00:04:42.490> them

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
more or four teeth now just to test them

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.810 
more or four teeth now just to test them
to<00:04:42.850> see<00:04:43.000> how<00:04:43.120> accurate<00:04:43.479> they<00:04:43.600> are<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:45.310> then

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
to see how accurate they are and then

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.230 
to see how accurate they are and then
load<00:04:46.150> them<00:04:46.330> perhaps<00:04:46.780> 500<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.889> then<00:04:48.160> just<00:04:48.520> just

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
load them perhaps 500 and then just just

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.060 
load them perhaps 500 and then just just
kissing<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.720> lands<00:04:50.050> just<00:04:50.289> to<00:04:50.380> see<00:04:50.560> if<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:50.830> can

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
kissing the lands just to see if I can

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.770 
kissing the lands just to see if I can
improve<00:04:51.370> on<00:04:51.580> accuracy<00:04:52.150> or<00:04:52.300> if<00:04:52.419> I<00:04:52.539> can<00:04:52.660> get

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
improve on accuracy or if I can get

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.210 
improve on accuracy or if I can get
anything<00:04:52.930> better<00:04:53.500> by<00:04:53.770> playing<00:04:54.009> with<00:04:54.130> the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
anything better by playing with the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.939 
anything better by playing with the
seating<00:04:54.430> depth<00:04:54.759> or<00:04:55.660> perhaps<00:04:55.930> 40<00:04:56.320> hours<00:04:56.680> is

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
seating depth or perhaps 40 hours is

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.600 
seating depth or perhaps 40 hours is
perfectly<00:04:57.910> fine<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.360> that's<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.680> the<00:05:00.190> results

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
perfectly fine so that's the the results

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.939 
perfectly fine so that's the the results
is<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.850> little<00:05:01.150> bit<00:05:01.270> of<00:05:01.330> a<00:05:01.389> mess<00:05:01.600> I<00:05:01.870> had<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.229> do<00:05:02.919> a

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
is a little bit of a mess I had to do a

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.340 
is a little bit of a mess I had to do a
few<00:05:03.130> calculations<00:05:03.820> there<00:05:04.060> too<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:05.080> get<00:05:05.259> all

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
few calculations there too to get all

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.140 
few calculations there too to get all
the<00:05:05.440> data<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.889> needed<00:05:06.190> but<00:05:06.789> what<00:05:06.940> I'll<00:05:07.030> do

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
the data that I needed but what I'll do

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.999 
the data that I needed but what I'll do
next<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.600> I'll<00:05:07.750> I'll<00:05:07.960> apply<00:05:08.199> it<00:05:08.259> all<00:05:08.440> now<00:05:08.650> on<00:05:08.949> a

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
next is I'll I'll apply it all now on a

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.400 
next is I'll I'll apply it all now on a
split<00:05:09.340> spreadsheet<00:05:09.940> and<00:05:10.120> show<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.139> the<00:05:11.229> graph

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
split spreadsheet and show you the graph

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:21.220 
split spreadsheet and show you the graph
I<00:05:11.620> made

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.290
