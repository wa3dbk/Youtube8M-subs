00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 men who have been producers and who 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.700
 they devote even hard labor that is 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.399
 produce watermelon in our field 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.340
 paola gonzÃ¡lez the year 2012 in the month of

 base to sweetness the color of watermelons 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.210
 here in the appearance of bain is a lot 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.699
 true first of all proud of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.399
 have represented the woman and already 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 ended the machismo that only the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.960
 men can be producers the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.129
 women we can also and nothing then a 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.950
 good job 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.490
 I have an uncle who leave behind me 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.380
 that the one behind that what we have 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.119
 to do all that and I put him now 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.979
 the what's called the other point of no 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.450
 agricultural technician are cons 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.189
 has agricultural technical study because you 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.490
 like the work of the field hundred equals 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.649
 heavy work the climate the inclemency 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 of time and the difficulties that I 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.630
 entails because this love for the earth 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 paola good the truth is that he was born and the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.929
 the most wonderful field there is and nothing 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.630
 can work it well I do not know how one 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.539
 live here nature does not change 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.099
 change the field for santiago not the other 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.899
 the theme the watermelon as a fruit that 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.310
 it's not so easy could you reap the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.229
 corn for example could harvest 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.789
 tomato but watermelon of a fruit that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.439
 requires a specific job with 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.720
 mainly what we see here the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.429
 acequia as to what should be received 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.200
 this amount of water is because to assume 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.020
 this challenge of producing watermelons to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 campaign is that is takes the lead 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.489
 is that the truth is that spain is 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.090
 recognized and now part that we take a 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.800
 logo 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.230
 which are a certification that 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:21.000
 really the watermelon here already then 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.440
 18 if everywhere that something else is not 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.700
 can say that produce watermelons more than 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.040
 an economic issue rather than a theme of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.350
 be able to make a personal challenge regarding 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.390
 to grow a fruit that finally a 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.580
 Fruit that is not anybody is not 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.750
 anyone has a lot of work is very 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.450
 complicated to transplant it after the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.580
 process that the plants do not fall 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.190
 it's complicated it's very complicated it's very 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.320
 Long and hard work we will walk 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.000
 already with the camera while you tell us 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.959
 about the people who work 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.209
 with you because even they 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.800
 they develop a very important work and 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.570
 who are cultivating the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.230
 watermelon as the camera shows us 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.880
 cristian tower to the middle of the field 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.480
 what are the characteristics for 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.270
 proceed to cut a watermelon already 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.130
 take it out let's say cut it out of the bush if 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.390
 The truth is that there is a person who 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.120
 the what 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.440
 is specialized let's say it so for 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.250
 cut it because you do not have to get there and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.370
 cut it 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.790
 let's say a lot of that watermelon is already 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.080
 cortÃ©mosla good for nothing no no 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.060
 who has his technique 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.150
 it's a human technique more than more than 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.140
 more than clear non-human scientific the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.260
 what is the name of the person's knowledge 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.150
 years working on this 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.830
 they come with it with the watermelon 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.410
 loaded from the truck but here 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.820
 we have some samples you Paola us 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.709
 you can count and what we talk little about 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.580
 knee with the radio every day that I do 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.950
 since we have pure watermelon 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.690
 spectacular we have a very large 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.330
 that should have about 18 kilos 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.670
 approximately not about 18 kilos is more 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.200
 great but that you talk to me 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.430
 forget that many times it does not matter that 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.920
 the watermelon is very big but 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.680
 also between median so that too 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.510
 so with short conserve sweetness if you're 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.170
 very important now the size does not 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.250
 matter with success the important thing is that 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.280
 be sweet or be the quality that is good 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.870
 it is no longer clear field and refreshing and you 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.380
 take away the heat 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.540
 thirst is the important thing we have several 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.130
 all very nice samples that we see 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.810
 what is the technique of the days you 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.090
 we ask about the technique that one 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.150
 know how watermelon is good if the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.610
 good technique really one when looking at the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.740
 cutter who knows he taught me to me I think 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:41.610
 which is only part of the view 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.820
 because the stripes and stripes must 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.820
 be 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:49.979
 between the line that is wider is 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:54.080
 whiter stretch marks those are the ones 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:57.000
 they are already better at their clear point 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.070
 regarding the visual theme 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.720
 and part already know a watermelon that is 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.690
 really good here in the background is 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.280
 is 6 this list is not ready and the 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.950
 time to break down the drum beat 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.930
 that it was also another technique that one 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.250
 same sometimes it turns out not to be of a myth 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.250
 to be the one with the pocket 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.069
 if the important thing is what he taught me 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.500
 the gentleman who cuts the signal is just 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:23.050
 part by sight is this good thing 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.940
 there they are harvesting and in the background 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.099
 picking the watermelon by passing it is this 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.110
 straw bed that we have just and that 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.970
 allows in the background that there is a rest 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.960
 since it's extracted from the field 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.460
 towards later and for sale but it will count 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.379
 also paula one of those two the 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.379
 cut to none 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.880
 despite being only harvesting 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.650
 so he also told me that the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.789
 to have been elected queen of the year 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.229
 past the watermelon festival and how 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.060
 first woman a lot of time from 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.680
 history has brought you certain benefits 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.840
 how was it that last year many people 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.270
 he contacted you through has seen 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.740
 seen not also on national channels 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.169
 so that watermelon part directly and 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.710
 the truth is that it is very good to be a farm 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:10.349
 lucky because the next day he calls 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.410
 we want watermelon he even called me a 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.120
 person from the before I had seen the 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.910
 television that had been that had 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.039
 won and that she was without work that 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.810
 I wanted you to direct iodine so that 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:26.180
 she sold watermelon 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.349
 that is a woman's support to another woman 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.630
 respect challenge that is as big as 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.009
 the work in the field finally the 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.509
 people can come to buy in the form of 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.150
 and highlights the plot located in the 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:38.729
 Father way stolen the way for 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.259
 tasted is pasadito 300 not the 500 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.970
 meters after the crossing of 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.190
 alley the appearance there is your 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.110
 plot outside potatoes are sold but 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.039
 finally it's like the data is not without 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.599
 plot 20 the appearance of page 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:54.719
 this is how it is this weekend 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:56.610
 out the paint expo in 2013 at the stadium 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:59.009
 Municipal Government of Paola Gonzalez Gonzalez 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.770
 again he wants to look for the possibility 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:04.349
 of being crowned the queen of this of this 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.589
 award that is the best watermelon of 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.589
 paine
